### Expanding Anti-Drug Efforts

The Opium War 103 years ago (1840) marked the beginning of modern Chinese history, and the beginning of China's history of colonization. More precisely, it was also the beginning of the invasion of East Asian countries and East Asian peoples by Britain and the United States. The beginning of resistance to foreign invasion. This year, 101 years later, we are at the decisive moment of the Greater East Asia War, we are ending the century-old history of humiliation of the East Asian people, and we are building a new China and a new East Asia on the foundation of Sino-Japanese cooperation. During this period, we must eliminate the harm left in China and East Asia by opium and "spiritual opium," because only by greatly expanding this anti-drug movement can we guarantee the independence, freedom, and sound development of China and East Asia.

The exact year when opium was first imported into China is difficult to determine, but it was probably initially used as a stimulant or for other medicinal purposes, and its harm was not yet very obvious. However, in the early 19th century, after Britain occupied India and then extended its aggressive claws to Burma, Tibet, Yunnan, and even mainland China, opium suddenly became the most serious social and even political problem in China and even East Asia. It forced the cultivation of opium in India, with China as its main sales market, not only reaping unexpected profits but also anesthetizing the Chinese people, creating conditions conducive to aggression. Zhu Gui, a cabinet scholar and vice minister of the Ministry of Rites at the time, pointed out in a memorial: "Opium corrupts the people, weakens the people, and has a myriad of harms without a single benefit. The red-bearded British barbarians import it into China, just as the Dutch conquered Java by means. Therefore, China will also fall into this dangerous position." Zhu also lamented in the memorial: "Now the poison of opium has caused the army to sink into the abyss of corruption and depravity, and officials and Confucian scholars are also infected with this poison, and the moral standards of the general people have declined from this point on." Later, Lin Zexu's strict ban can be said to be the first resistance of the Chinese nation against Western aggression. Although the Opium War failed due to the obvious predictions of the Qing court and the late integrity of the strategic plan, it had already aroused the people's vigilance against the harm of opium and the people's determination to resist British aggression. Under the atrocities of the British soldiers, it had aroused the heroic uprisings of the people in Guangzhou, Foshan, Sanyuanli, and other places to "pacify England," giving the British army a serious blow.

The disastrous defeat of the Opium War and the humiliating result of the Treaty of Nanjing marked the beginning of a century of dark and painful humiliation for the Chinese nation. It was not until December 8th of the year before last, when Japan launched the Greater East Asia War and drove out the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in the East Asian region, that the shackles imposed on the Chinese people since the Opium War were finally shattered, and the tragic poison suffered by the Chinese nation was finally eliminated. However, judging from the current facts, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have not been completely eliminated, and they are still indulging in the sweet dream of restoring their special privileges in China since the Opium War. At the same time, judging from the actual situation in our country, since the Opium War, opium and its related poisons have spread far and wide and penetrated deep into the people. Although the authorities have repeatedly made efforts to persuade and ban them, the remaining poison has not been completely eliminated. To this day, there are still many poppy fields in the southwestern and northwestern provinces, and opium taxes are even used to supplement government expenses. Even in the peaceful areas, it cannot be said that there is absolutely no such phenomenon. This is only the tangible harm of opium and other drugs. As for the toxins that have been deeply ingrained in the spirit along with opium, such as laziness, waste, foolishness, depression, selfishness, and lack of public morality and patriotism, etc., their corrosive and corrupting effects on the country and society are actually no less than opium, and even more so. If these tangible and intangible poisons of opium are not completely eliminated sooner rather than later, then even if there is no trace of British and American troops in the Pacific, we ourselves will be helpless.

Regardless of whether it is a tangible poison or an intangible toxin, absolute and thorough elimination is required. Based on a century of experience, it is deeply believed that the following points must be noted: First, the anti-drug movement cannot be biased towards top-down government decrees and punishments, nor can it be biased towards powerless and unauthoritative civil life, but must be government with strict laws and severe punishments, and social leaders working together to supervise, in order to achieve practical results. The government leader's ability to carry out orders is especially important. Second, in addition to the above-mentioned symptomatic treatment methods, we must also jointly seek fundamental methods to eliminate opium and intangible toxins. This means, on the one hand, raising the cultural level of the people so that every citizen can consciously understand the harm of opium, understand the toxins of spiritual opium, and understand how to avoid being poisoned by it, and then jointly seek to completely eliminate this poison. On the other hand, we must promote the New Citizen Movement, using scientific undertakings, sports activities, and legitimate entertainment, etc., so that opium and other poisons have no chance of temptation, and arouse a sense of disgust among all people. We should also advocate science, promote medicine, especially with the cooperation of government authorities and powerful social figures, to save the poor compatriots who have already fallen into the black sea, and severely ban all false quit-smoking drugs and disguised quit-smoking places.

Anti-drug efforts are a social movement, but also a political and cultural movement. Its success or failure is closely related to the future of the country and the nation, and can also be said to be closely related to the future of the East Asian people. We must remind the people of the country here that if we do not immediately make up our minds to completely eliminate the tangible and intangible poisons of opium, then even if we defeat the British and American troops, we cannot guarantee the revival of China and the stability of East Asia.

Historical Excerpts

### Former Vice Minister of Justice Zhang Yipeng's Report on the Situation of Burning Opium and Proposed Measures to Prohibit Opium

(Published in Government Gazette No. 1106 on March 4th, Republic of China Year 8)

This is to report on the completion of the opium burning, and to present in detail the situation and future measures to prohibit opium, requesting your consideration: On December 3rd, Republic of China Year 7, the President ordered that the opium previously purchased by the government was exclusively sold for medicinal purposes. This was originally intended to be considerate of the difficulties of merchants. Although careful investigation and strict restrictions were added, it left a root, and it was feared that it would easily lead to abuses and affect the future of opium prohibition. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance were ordered to investigate the exact amount of opium currently in stock. Except for those already sold, the rest should be recovered under the supervision of officials dispatched by the ministries, collected at the Customs, and destroyed completely on a regular basis. A special commissioner should be appointed to jointly supervise with local officials and Customs Commissioners to show caution. This is the order. Upon receiving this, on December 19th, the State Council issued a letter stating: The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance reported on the case of requesting the dispatch of a special commissioner to supervise the burning of opium in stock. Zhang Yipeng was appointed to supervise. This is the order. Upon receiving this, a corresponding letter was sent for investigation. Upon receiving this, Yipeng immediately packed his bags and took his staff, including Jiang Zhongjue, Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, to Shanghai. He arrived in port on December 23rd and immediately met with Shao Fuying, Commissioner of the Ministry of Interior, Wang Zhenjia, Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, Feng Guoxun, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, Chen Yifan, negotiator, Weihoulan, Inspector General of Customs, and others to discuss and examine the various methods of burning and destroying opium, in order, to properly handle the matter, in order to live up to Your Majesty's intention to eliminate opium poisoning. The details have been reported by telegram and in person in Beijing. However, the value of the opium destroyed this time is estimated at more than 30 million yuan, and the government's bonds issued to foreign drug firms are also worth more than 13 million yuan. In terms of weight, there are more than 1,013 boxes of large opium and 194 boxes of small opium. The country's move to sacrifice so much money and set it on fire is because opium is the most harmful to China. Not only is Your Majesty resolute and meticulous in wanting to eliminate the national disease, but also those who are outside the situation express their deep sympathy and enthusiastic support. However, at the beginning of Yipeng's arrival in Shanghai, public opinion was in turmoil, spreading rumors, saying that there was theft and leakage, or that fake was used to replace real, and various forms of corruption were witnessed, almost making anyone involved in handling this case subject to destruction. They also promoted the theory of giving opium as a gift in order to undermine the agreement to burn opium. Fortunately, the government adhered to its firmness and was able to implement its proposition, and Yipeng, having decided to investigate and deal with those who purchased opium in stock, and having personally engaged in negotiations, dared to be confident that he would not slacken his heart in the face of difficulties and rumors. He thought that although burning was easy, if there were any omissions in the handling, various abuses would inevitably arise. If he did not conduct a detailed investigation before burning, it would not be enough to quell doubts and stop slander. Therefore, he decided that the first step was investigation and the second step was burning. The investigation procedure was the most cumbersome. To summarize the main points, the investigation method must be precise, and the observation must be universal. Those who are good at appraisal use surgery and eyesight to observe in detail, and the authenticity is already obvious. Still, fearing that there is something not exhaustive, it is necessary to rely on chemical inspection. It is necessary to hire specialized talents to identify in detail. Therefore, the British Consul Faleisi recommended the chemist Mrs. Baobo to be in charge of the chemical inspection, and invited the famous Chinese chemists Que Zhaohong and Que Zhaokun, etc. Yipeng secretly invited two Chinese merchants who were experienced in the opium trade to work together to determine the quality, and ordered them to report on the chemical inspection at any time. This is what is meant by the investigation method must be precise. There are many groups in Shanghai, and the most important ones are the Provincial Assembly, the Provincial Education Association, the North-South Chamber of Commerce, the Youth Association, and the National Joint Opium Prohibition Association. All of these were designated by the State Council as joint supervision agencies. In addition, more than 20 groups, such as the Construction Association, also agreed to nominate representatives to supervise in rotation. In addition, administrative agencies and famous Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai were all invited to the venue. There are signature books and certificates to prove this. This is what is meant by observation must be universal. Also, because the capacity of the old and new kilns in Pudong was too small and it took a long time, it was agreed with the Tax Commissioner to build two more kilns to shorten the time and prevent abuses. Each kiln can burn 200 boxes a day, and 40 stokers are hired to turn the opium over from time to time. Each kiln is turned over more than 30 times to ensure that the remaining embers become coke and no longer have the effect of smoke ash. During the waiting period for the kiln to be built, Yipeng contacted consuls from various countries and figures from all walks of life every day, and conducted practical discussions. Whenever there was a celebration, he spared no effort to give speeches, advocating the country's great intention to burn opium and prohibit opium. Yipeng also personally drafted 13 articles of rules for supervising the burning of opium and submitted them for implementation, and prepared various entry badges to ensure that people attending the venue were in order. This is the preparatory situation before the inspection and burning. When all the arrangements were ready, the inspection began on January 8th, Year 8. There were a total of two batches of opium in Shanghai, one stored in the Yihe New Warehouse and the other stored in the Sassoon Warehouse. The inspection started from Yihe. On that day, the consuls of the United States, France, and Sweden, as well as famous Chinese and foreign people and representatives of various agencies, all attended the venue. The order inside the venue was orderly. A total of 42 boxes of large opium and 2 boxes of small opium were inspected in Yihe. Each box was split open, and Yipeng personally inspected it and handed it to the observers to watch in turn. The inspected opium was still packed in the original box, and lead wires were threaded around it, wrapped in sacks, and a tin block was branded at the total seam. Yipeng and the Tax Commissioner jointly stamped the seal, and the handling was very cautious. Each box was dissected and inspected from five to more than ten times. Those with doubts were chemically inspected by Baobo on the spot, and everyone witnessed it. On the 9th, 80 boxes of opium were inspected, on the 10th, 64 boxes were inspected, on the 11th, 100 boxes were inspected, on the 12th, 112 boxes were inspected, on the 13th, 53 boxes were inspected, on the 14th, 95 boxes were inspected, and on the 15th, 94 boxes were inspected. In total, the inspection of the opium stored in Yihe was completed. Although there were seven large opium that were underweight, the Tax Commissioner publicly weighed and dissected each box, and there were no abuses. All of this was reported by telegram. Fearing that the date would be too long if all the opium in both warehouses was inspected before being burned, and that the equipment might not be adequate, the opium that had been inspected was transported to the Pudong kiln for burning from the 17th. At 8:00 a.m. on the same day, Deputy Tax Commissioner Kliya took care of the opium at the Yihe Warehouse, and 100 boxes of large opium were transported by barge, towed by a small wheel across the Pu River. The Public Works Bureau sent police and detectives to secretly protect it along the way. There were Customs water patrol teams in Pudong, and police patrol teams, soldiers from the Defense Commissioner, judicial police from the local prosecutor's office, and Pudong police patrolled each other at the burning site. When the opium arrived, Yipeng and the Tax Commissioner inspected the lead branding and tin seals box by box, and split open the boxes. Yipeng, together with the Tax Commissioner, put the opium into the kiln for burning. On the 18th, 120 boxes of large opium were burned, on the 19th, 200 boxes of large and small opium were burned, and on the 20th, 222 boxes of large and small opium were burned. In total, 642 boxes of opium stored in Yihe were burned to ashes. Then the inspection of the opium stored in Sassoon was started. Because the Sassoon warehouse was small and it was difficult for many people to inspect and supervise, the Tax Commissioner strongly requested that it be moved to the Yihe warehouse for handling. Because the opium stored in Sassoon was opium waiting to be inspected, there was no problem in moving it first. A bright telegram was sent to report it for approval. It was then transported to the Yihe warehouse. On the morning of the 21st, 70 boxes of large opium were dissected and inspected, and in the afternoon, 41 boxes of large opium were dissected and inspected. The dissection and inspection procedures were still handled according to the previous decision. First, the boxes were opened and poured into wooden buckets, and examined by surgical inspection. If there was any doubt, they were dissected and inspected for the public to watch. At that time, there were guests at the venue who requested that the opium poured out of the boxes be dissected by anyone. They were allowed to dissect several boxes, and there were no abuses. On the 22nd, 142 boxes were inspected, on the 23rd, 141 boxes were inspected, and on the 24th, 140 boxes were inspected. The first three days were 565 boxes. The first time, a total of 1,013 boxes of large opium were inspected, containing 44, and 194 boxes of small opium, containing a total of 19,370 jin and 12 taels. There were also coal boxes. The large opium all matched the book report, and the small opium exceeded 246 jin and 12 taels. There were no abuses. The continued inspection of opium was transported to the Pudong kiln for burning on the 25th. It took three days to burn it completely by the 27th. The remaining ashes were carefully chemically inspected by Customs chemists Robertsson, Chinese chemists Que Zhaohong and Que Zhaokun, and technician Shao Zhongding for days. It was verified that this ash had lost its effectiveness after being burned by intense fire and had become waste. For the sake of caution, it was ordered that the remaining ashes from the two burnings be removed from the kiln, soaked in brine, loaded into cattail bags, and thrown into the sea. This is the actual implementation of the two inspections and burnings. During this opium burning, many gentry and scholars from various countries were able to brave the snow and cold to attend every day, and they all praised and congratulated each other. Some even collected wood chips and lead sheets as souvenirs. Reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers went to the venue every day and recorded it with enthusiasm. There were also photographers who printed the daily inspection and burning events into active films in order to spread them to various countries. The Director General of Customs, Mr. Weihoulan, was especially diligent from beginning to end. All those who held important positions, from officials to coolies, were trained in advance and were mostly transferred from Tianjin, Hankou, and Wuhu Customs, so they had no relationship with the Shanghai natives. They served from morning to night every day, even on Sundays. This is because our Great President is determined to eliminate opium harm, and his sincerity is believed. He has shown his determination to prohibit opium, which is an unprecedented event, so he can be consistent both at home and abroad and achieve success. The country does not hesitate to spend so much national treasury to buy up opium and burn it for the sake of eliminating opium harm for the people. It has already eliminated the hoarding for a while and alarmed the onlookers from all sides. If we do not plan for future measures to prevent future events, I am afraid that after the event has passed, the hidden roots will still lurk. Therefore, we have discussed two measures: One is a positive measure, please revise the Opium Single Line Law to punish opium offenders. Article 10 of Chapter 21 of the Provisional New Criminal Law on Opium Smoking stipulates that the penalties for crimes such as manufacturing, trafficking, and smoking opium are too light, which is not in line with the way of using punishment in chaos. The maximum sentence for manufacturers and traffickers is only the third degree, while the minimum sentence for those who open pavilions for people to smoke and those who smoke opium is only detention. The legislation is too lenient, and people are prone to negligence. We must strictly set special articles to increase the penalties to remedy its abuses. It is proposed to follow the Law on Punishing Bandits and specifically set a Law on Punishing Opium Smoking, so that the people will be afraid of severe punishment and the harm of opium will no longer spread. One is a passive measure, please order the Ministry of Interior to instruct the provinces to establish more good hospitals. It is difficult to raise funds to establish more hospitals, but if smokers can find an effective place to quit, even if the funds are huge, it will not be difficult to raise them, because non-smokers are very willing to help smokers quit and will be happy to support them. Smokers hate the depth of the poison and will eventually be willing to contribute to achieve it. Furthermore, even those who do not smoke cannot guarantee that their children and grandchildren will not smoke, and those who smoke do not want their children and grandchildren to smoke again. If there are good methods and trustworthy hospitals, I think that no matter who has smoked or not, they will be able to do their best to help. The above two articles are only the views of my humble opinion, and I present them to Your Majesty for consideration and selection. In addition to the fact that the chemist Baobo has a chemical inspection certificate, Que Zhaokun's explanation of opium analysis and eight original quality glass tubes for chemical inspection, the technician Shao Shiming's report, the Shanghai Association of Associations' supervision report, and the signature book are attached to the case. All the reasons for the completion of this opium burning, the situation and the discussion of the reasons for prohibiting opium, should be presented, begging the President to review and instruct to follow. Presented on February 18th, Year 8. The instructions have been received.

### State Funeral of the Late Marshal Yamamoto Held in Tokyo on the Fifth Day with Grand Ceremony Venue Determined to Be Hibiya Park in Tokyo Army and Navy Honor Guard Commanders Appointed Yesterday

Tokyo, 2nd - Central News Agency Dispatch - The state funeral ceremony for the late Marshal Yamamoto of Japan is scheduled to be held at Hibiya Park here on the 5th of this month. The commander-in-chief of the army and navy honor guards has been decided to be General Doihara Kenji, commander of the Eastern Army, and the chief of staff is Major General Tatsumi Eiichi, chief of staff of the Eastern Army. Colonel Takayama Shigeji has been appointed as the commander of the navy honor guard and the appointment order has been issued today.

Tokyo, 2nd - Central News Agency Dispatch - The state funeral ceremony for the late Marshal Yamamoto of Japan will be held solemnly on June 5th amidst national mourning. Since Duke Iwakura Tomomi was first granted a state funeral with meritorious qualifications in Meiji 16 (1883), up to now, there have been two courtiers, three feudal lords, three politicians, and three soldiers who have been granted the honor of state funeral among the imperial family and good vassals. Marshal Yamamoto is the first to die in the front line and be granted a state funeral. In Japan, the common explanation of "state funeral" is "using national funds for funeral expenses," but its true spirit is a funeral ceremony that expresses heartfelt condolences from the whole country, that is, a state funeral. Also, the Japanese generally recognize that the state funeral ceremony is formulated by vassals, but in fact it is based on the imperial funeral ceremony that has been prescribed. As for the state funeral of vassals, it is a special case. The Japanese state funeral system did not have a certain rule at the beginning. It was not until the enactment of the State Funeral Order in Taisho 15 (1926) that its principles were clearly stated, which also stipulated that it be divided into two types: natural state funeral and specially bestowed state funeral. Natural state funeral refers to the provisions of Article 1 of the Japanese State Funeral Order, "Grand Funeral Ceremony," and Article 2, "Funeral Ceremony for those specially designated among the imperial family." Therefore, even if it is a member of the imperial family, a state funeral may not necessarily be held. As for the state funeral bestowed by special decree, it is based on Article 3 of the State Funeral Order, "Those who have made great contributions to the country may be granted a state funeral by special decree at the time of their death. This special decree will be issued by imperial edict and then announced by the Prime Minister of the Cabinet." The so-called "those who have made great contributions to the country" must be pillars of the country, have made great achievements, and be unanimously admired by the people of the whole country. Therefore, when a state funeral is held, it can actually be regarded as being awarded the same honor as "titles, medals and other honors" in Article 15 of the Constitution. The content of this honor is, first, using national funds for funeral expenses, and second, designating state officials to handle funeral affairs. Among them, the expense item is submitted to the Diet as an additional budget during the Diet session, and is allocated from the second reserve fund item during the Diet recess and requires the next Diet to approve it. Also, when a state funeral is decided, the government appoints the chairman and vice-chairman of the funeral ceremony, as well as the funeral committee members and staff. Among them, the position of chairman is held by a senior official who has a close relationship with the deceased, and the position of vice-chairman is usually held by the Chief Cabinet Secretary. The committee members are appointed by the Cabinet and the Imperial Household Ministry and other officials who have a relationship with the deceased. Because the state funeral is a state ceremony, the procedure for performing the state funeral ceremony in the Shinto style is stipulated as follows: On the day, the Emperor's envoy will first pay homage, followed by the Empress and the Empress Dowager and the envoys of the various princes to pay their respects, and then the bereaved family will present the coins for the gods. After that, the ambassadors of various countries stationed in Japan will pay homage on behalf of their countries, and the senior officials will present the coins for the gods. As for the general public, they will present them after the ceremony is completed. Also, according to Article 4 of the Japanese State Funeral Order, on the day of the state funeral, the Emperor will abolish the court, and the whole country will stop entertainment. Therefore, the state funeral ceremony is an unusually grand special treatment. It is an supreme honor for Japanese vassals to be granted a state funeral. The state funeral of the late Marshal Yamamoto this time is the third person after Marshal Togo and Prince Saionji after the promulgation of the imperial edict of the State Funeral Order in Japan.

### On the Day of Marshal Yamamoto's State Funeral The Capital Lowered Its Flag to Show Mourning

Nanjing, 2nd - Central News Agency Dispatch - In order to express mourning for the late Marshal Yamamoto of Japan, the Chinese side has decided that on the day of Marshal Yamamoto's state funeral, all agencies, schools, companies, etc. will lower their flags to show mourning, and will uniformly stop entertainment at 10:50 a.m. on the 5th. Also, Wang, the head of the National Government and the Executive Yuan, is also scheduled to deliver a radio speech with Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, Manchu Prime Minister Zhang, and Thai Prime Minister Phibun to praise Marshal Yamamoto's great achievements and clarify the determination to win the Greater East Asia War in order to urge our country's people to rise up. In addition, the Japanese residents in Nanjing are also scheduled to stop all entertainment on the 5th, and each household will hang the national flag to show mourning. When Prime Minister Tojo pays tribute at 10:40 a.m., they will gather at the First National School to hold a remote worship ceremony to silently pray for the immortal fame of Marshal Yamamoto.

Nanjing, 2nd - Central News Agency Dispatch - The Nanjing Buddhist Association will hold a memorial service at the Nanjing Heroes' Shrine at 8:00 p.m. on the 4th to commemorate the achievements of the late Marshal Yamamoto of Japan during his lifetime. Also, Rear Admiral Maeda, naval attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China, is scheduled to meet with reporters at 2:30 p.m. on the 3rd to deliver a speech.

### Mr. Ren Hai's Speech

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) Regarding the heroic spirit of Marshal Yamamoto and Commander Yamazaki's troops, Mr. Ren Hai recently made the following remarks: We are filled with admiration for the valiant death of Marshal Yamamoto and the heroic sacrifice of Yamazaki's troops on Attu Island. Marshal Yamamoto and Colonel Yamazaki fully demonstrated the noble spirit of our friendly nation, which we usually hear as the Yamato spirit and Bushido. However, our Chinese nation also has no shortage of such great and heroic precedents in ancient times. The generosity of the five hundred warriors of Tian Heng during the Chu-Han contention, the righteousness of Lu Zhonglian in refusing to be emperor of Qin, and the oath of Ning Dao to die by drowning in the sea are all similar to today's Yamazaki troops. It can also be seen that the ancestors of our East Asian nations all possessed this great spirit. All our comrades should learn from and admire this spirit in order to complete the Greater East Asia War.

### Director of the Pacification Affairs Bureau, Wang Manyun's Speech

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) Since the establishment of the Pacification Committee, Mr. Wang Manyun has honorably served as its Deputy Secretary-General. Now, assuming the post of Director of the Pacification Affairs Bureau, Central News Agency reporters visited him yesterday. He briefly stated the following: The National Government specially established the Pacification Committee in May of the year before last, and pacification began in July. This year in May, it marks the second anniversary. During these two years, the pacification work began in the first phase in Jiangsu Province, starting from Taicang, Changshu, Wuxian, and Kunshan counties, gradually expanding along the Nanjing-Shanghai Line to the southeastern area of Taihu Lake. Now Shanghai, Zhejiang, northern Jiangsu, Zhenjiang, eastern Zhejiang, and Anhui are successively being carried out, while Hubei and Guangdong are also in preparation. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War and our country's participation, the pacification work has not only become one of the important tasks of the National Government, but also one of the tasks to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War and stabilize the rear order. Currently, the pacification area is gradually expanding, and affairs are becoming increasingly complex. The Supreme National Defense Council decided to end the Pacification Committee and transfer all pacification affairs to the Executive Yuan for unified leadership in order to achieve comprehensive consideration. For this reason, the Executive Yuan specially established the Pacification Affairs Bureau. However, this bureau is different in nature from the past Pacification Committee. The past Pacification Committee was an executive agency, while the current Pacification Affairs Bureau is a planning and review agency. I am deeply concerned about my inadequacy as Director, and can only rely on the instructions of the Supreme Leader to do my best and strive to contribute.

### Japanese Emperor Approves the Convening of an Extraordinary Session of the Diet

In order to clarify the Japanese government's belief in promoting national policies internally and externally, the cabinet decided to request the convening of the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet on the 28th of last month, and reported to His Majesty the Emperor. According to the Japanese government's official gazette published on the 2nd, the request has been approved, and the Diet will be convened in Tokyo for three days starting from June 15th.

### Navy Soul (8) The True Meaning of Navy Soul

— Tsuguharu Foujita

On the evening of October 26th of the 27th year of the Republic of China, when the elite forces of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy captured the Three Towns of Wuhan, I was dispatched to Hankou by the Navy. The rain and clouds obscuring Hankou and Wuchang were reflected by the countless flames rising in the city, it was truly a desolate dusk. Commander 〇〇 of the flagship 〇〇 warmly welcomed us. He even allowed us to participate in the celebratory evening banquet. The captain first allowed me to bathe. It was a deeply grateful night, and I fell asleep peacefully.

The next morning, I was surprised when I woke up. My pants had been neatly folded and ironed by the sailors, and my handkerchief was washed snow-white, folded into a square, and placed next to my pillow. Rice was packed in a two-layer box, ready for landing in Hankou.

Even in such intense combat, the daily life of naval soldiers remained unchanged, and their meticulousness was orderly in every aspect. Simple bravery and skill in battle are not the only elements of the navy soul. I savored this meaning in my heart and was filled with gratitude. (Tao: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)

### Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces War Results of the Japanese Army in Central China

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on June 2nd: (1) After continuing the annihilation war in the western area of public security, the Japanese army in Central China launched a brave offensive operation against the Chongqing Jiangfang Army and the main force of the 10th Army Group, about 120,000 strong, which guarded the natural fortress on the opposite bank of Yichang since May 19th, inflicting great damage. As of June 1st, the confirmed battle results are as follows: (A) Chongqing army losses: approximately 18,600 corpses left behind, 2,678 prisoners captured, and 2,523 main items seized, including ships. (B) Japanese losses: 237 killed in action. (2) The Jiangnan operation, which started from the west of Dongting Lake to the opposite bank of Yichang in early May, has completely achieved its purpose, and the various units have returned to their original positions. As of June 1st, the confirmed comprehensive battle results are as follows: (A) Chongqing army losses: approximately 36,300 corpses left behind, 5,923 prisoners captured, and main items seized including approximately 16,000 tons of ships, 90 artillery pieces of various types, and 11 heavy and light machine guns. (B) Japanese losses: 476 killed in action.

Hankou, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) When the Japanese army in Central China launched the summer offensive, the Japanese army's waterborne unit drove more than 50 American and British ships detained in the Yichang area down the Yangtze River to participate in the battle. At that time, the Chongqing (Sixth War Zone) Jiangfang Army stubbornly resisted by guarding the steep mountains around Yichang, but was defeated step by step by the Japanese army, so the waterborne unit finally completely achieved its purpose of sailing downstream. After the Japanese naval units launched the waterway operation between Yuezhou and Shashi, the Japanese army's waterborne units also began to engage in a downstream operation of approximately 130 kilometers in the turbulent waves of the Yangtze River on a certain day last month, and finally arrived safely at a certain place in the afternoon of a certain day. The Japanese army in Central China has established a great battle achievement of seizing more than 50 ships with tens of thousands of tons, which can not only strengthen the future transportation force, but also have a huge impact in various aspects. More than 50 ships are undamaged and can be used, and their use value is also extremely high. According to reports, most of the ships were British ships, with a small number of American ships among them.

### Commander-in-Chief of Army Training Inspects the Garrison Army

### Ministry of Justice Sends Personnel to Xiamen to Take Over the Higher and Local Courts

### The Dissolution of the Third International; The CCP's Emergency Meeting

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) The news of the dissolution of the Third International has greatly shocked the CCP. There are divergent opinions within the party regarding the path to be followed in the future, and no consensus has been reached. It is reported that when the CCP cadres convened an emergency meeting on May 26th, the entire group unanimously resolved to support the measures taken by the Soviet Union. A meeting of secretaries was convened to ratify the above-mentioned resolutions. It is reported that the content of the resolutions is approximately the following four points: (1) The CCP fully supports the Soviet Union's measures this time and releases all obligations under the regulations and resolutions of the Third International. (2) The historical mission of the Third International has been completed. The CCP has been working hard since 1924, but the current international situation is complex, and it is impossible to achieve the labor movement with the existing organization. Therefore, the goal in the future should be to form an anti-fascist front, mobilize a wide range of the public, and strive for final victory. (3) Due to the dissolution of the Third International, the CCP will further strengthen its connection with the masses to enhance its strength. After the dissolution of the Third International became a fact, public opinion has focused on the change in the relationship between Chongqing and the CCP. Judging from the past situation of mutual conflict between Chongqing and the CCP, it is determined that the content of the CCP's resolution, in addition to taking the opportunity to make further plans to suppress Chongqing, has no other meaning. Therefore, we are even more convinced that the future of the relationship between Chongqing and the CCP will face more and more hidden reefs, and this will be the beginning.

He has now returned to Qingdao.

Although my inspection of Fengtian, Lushun, and Xinjing lasted less than a week, I felt deeply about the prosperity of the Fengtian industrial zone and the great urban construction of Xinjing, comparing the past with the present. In Lushun, I visited the coal liquefaction situation, and the excellent results were beyond my knowledge. Its future development is especially worth looking forward to. The situation of security, food, and prices in Manchuria are all very good. In particular, the smooth operation of the price policy and material allocation is something we can learn a lot from. The general public also feels no inconvenience about this. Seeing the situation, there is no question that Manchuria will fulfill its mission as a Greater East Asia industrial base, which is extremely important. I also had a sincere conversation with key figures in the Manchurian government on this point, hoping to provide assistance as much as possible. This year's rainfall in North China is favorable, and a good harvest can be celebrated. It is said that Manchuria will also celebrate a good year.

### Minister Yamakoshi Michiyuki Discusses the Industrial Situation in the Philippines

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) According to a phone call from Fukuoka, Mr. Yamakoshi Michiyuki, the Minister of Industry of the Philippine Military Administration Department, recently returned to Japan to discuss important matters. He arrived in Fukuoka by plane from Manila on the 1st. He stated that the Philippines' industry focuses on agriculture. Since the occupation of Corregidor Island in May last year, the Philippines has launched a food production increase movement to establish a self-sufficient food system. Luzon Island, which has always been known as the granary of the Philippines, has achieved good results in rice harvesting this year, exceeding expectations. Therefore, it is expected that the Philippines' self-sufficient food system can be established this year. In addition, for cotton, a considerable amount has been harvested last year under the guidance of the Military Administration Department, and it has been decided to implement large-scale planting this year. Furthermore, the production of sugar, etc., is also progressing smoothly. Sugar can be used not only for consumption but also as raw material, so efforts are being made to increase the production of this item. Furthermore, the general public has also launched a self-sufficient food movement. This shows that they have understood our country's true intentions and are voluntarily dedicating themselves to cooperation. Therefore, it can be seen that it is not difficult to solve the food problem in the Philippines.

### Axis Reporter Discusses the Situation in India and Burma

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) At the beginning of this year, the British and American sides repeatedly shouted to retake Burma, but the actual developments today are the opposite of what they dreamed of. The enemy forces on the Burmese-Indian border have repeatedly been defeated, and the situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable. Regarding this matter, the German newspaper Deutsche Zeitung published a commentary on the 1st, stating that the crisis in India is increasing day by day. As a result, the United States' assistance to India must also gradually increase. To this day, Japan has the potential to replace Britain. Recently, British Indian Army Commander Wavell and his subordinates stated that they would completely drive the Japanese army out of Burma. However, according to a report by a special correspondent of the Jiji Shimpo, the facts are completely opposite. In the past five months, the British army's war on the Indian-Burmese border can be said to have been defeated in every battle. Moreover, the Japanese air force's fierce bombing of Chittagong and other military key points has caused significant damage, and the Japanese army's forest tactics are particularly clever, and the anti-Axis forces have no countermeasures to confront them. A reporter from the Spanish weekly magazine, who was recently hosted by the British and American sides and experienced the interior of India, also reported that the Indian people have gradually understood Japan's true intentions and strength. They now believe that Japan is the only friendly neighbor cooperating with India's independence. Therefore, pro-Japanese sentiment in India is becoming increasingly strong. Speaking of the current situation in India, its military is under heavy pressure from the Japanese army, politically, the people have gradually awakened and understand the true meaning of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and economically, the forces of Britain and the United States are mutually encroaching.

### Talk by German Navy Commander-in-Chief Dönitz

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Berlin dispatch from the Asahi Shimbun here, the duties of Grand Admiral Dönitz, Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, are extremely important. In addition to being equivalent to the Chief of the Naval General Staff and the Minister of the Navy in Japan, he is also directly responsible for commanding the German submarine fleet in combat, making him the foremost figure in the German naval world. A reporter visited him on the 21st, and the Grand Admiral took time out of his busy schedule to meet with him. This was the first time the Grand Admiral had met with a reporter since taking office as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and he made the following remarks: The entire German Navy admires and respects the heroic sacrifice of Admiral Yamamoto, Commander of the Combined Fleet. On this year's Japanese Navy Day, the great overall war achievements of the Japanese Navy in this war were announced. I believe this is a memorial to ensure the immortal legacy of Admiral Yamamoto. The congratulatory telegram I sent to the Japanese Navy earlier was to convey our sense of admiration and trust to your country. When Germany rose up to fight after being attacked by Britain, it had to fight with a small rebuilt navy. At that time, the strength of the British and French fleets, just in the North Sea and Atlantic, was ten times that of the German Navy, but we were not afraid. From the beginning of the war, the German Navy seized the initiative from the enemy with blitzkrieg tactics, and surprised the British naval base at Scapa Flow, occupied the enemy's landing base on the coast of Norway, and completed the formation of a threat to Britain from the north. Then, using the Atlantic islands as a base, it launched the most feared submarine warfare, constantly launching fierce attacks on the enemy's lifeline, maritime communication. The great achievements of the German submarine fleet have long been known to the world, and there is no need to elaborate on them here. When German submarines threatened the British mainland, the United States believed that if it took this opportunity to threaten Japan, it could force it to submit, but this was a fundamental mistake of the anti-Axis camp, so the United States also joined the war. At that time, the Germans believed that Japan would definitely use its strength and determination to give the arrogant attitude of the United States a major blow. When we combine the great war achievements of the Japanese Navy in the Pacific and the great achievements of the German submarine fleet in the Atlantic and consider them calmly, we can see that in this World War, the Japanese, German, and Italian navies were by no means fighting independently, but echoing each other from east to west, attacking British and American warships and merchant ships everywhere, weakening the enemy's strength. The coordinated operations of the Axis powers will eventually lead to the annihilation of the enemy's strength. When the reporter said that the Axis powers had sunk 3,500,000 tons of enemy ships to date, and asked for his opinion on submarine warfare, Dönitz said: We have sunk such a large number of enemy ships. Although the enemy has tried its best to research defensive countermeasures and build new ships, it cannot even make up for its losses. What we are especially deeply grateful for is that Japan has also made great contributions to this great war achievement. The determination of the victory or defeat of naval battles will depend on the final war results. Therefore, German submarines are still constantly attacking the enemy. I am convinced that the Axis countries have an absolutely invincible spirit and strength in future naval battles. Our war goal will never waver, and we will always focus on the same goal. Our supreme goal is to fight to the end to win the final victory. He also mentioned the heroic sacrifice of the entire Japanese garrison on Attu Island, saying that the sacrifices made by Japanese soldiers in this righteous war were by no means accidental. I was deeply moved by the Battle of Attu. In this battle, the Japanese soldiers on Attu Island once again explained to the world that the ancient Japanese Bushido spirit is still boiling in the blood of the Japanese people. Anyone who knows a little about Japanese history knows that the heroic sacrifice of the Japanese soldiers far away from their homeland on Attu Island will definitely make the Japanese people even more determined to defeat the enemy, and the morale of the entire Japanese army will inevitably become more vigorous.

### Prohibited History Materials: Lin Zexu's Memorial on Destroying Opium

One

A memorial reporting that, in accordance with imperial decree, the opium has been destroyed in Guangdong, and officials in charge of inspecting goods have been jointly supervising and strictly investigating to prevent corruption and demonstrate the imperial power. The destruction is now nearly halfway complete. I respectfully submit this memorial for Your Majesty's inspection: I, your humble servants, previously reported the confiscation of opium from foreign ships and requested that the original crates be sent to the capital. On the twelfth day of the fourth month, we received a rescript approving this request. We respectfully complied and had already packed and loaded the opium and were preparing to report its shipment when we received a communication from the Grand Council on the eighteenth day stating: The Cabinet has received an imperial edict stating that Lin Zexu and others had previously reported that all opium from the depot ships had been handed over and requested to be sent to the capital for verification and burning, which was approved by imperial decree. Today, Censor Deng Ying reported that Guangdong is far from the capital, and the amount of opium confiscated is large. Even if the commissioners conduct a thorough inspection, it would be easy to allow for theft and substitution, etc. I, Lin Zexu, and others have been entrusted by朕to investigate the opium in Guangdong waters this time and have been very serious. I do not doubt that they will be deceitful at all, and long-distance transport will inevitably require the use of civilian labor. There is no need to send it to Beijing. It should be handed over to Lin Zexu, Deng Tingzhen, and Yiliang. After the confiscation is complete, they should supervise the civil and military officials there to jointly verify and witness the burning, so that coastal residents and foreigners in Guangdong can see and hear, and all know the imperial power. The ministers must understand朕's intention, conduct a thorough investigation, and not allow any officials to engage in corruption. This is by imperial decree. I, Your Majesty, in eradicating harm, embody the intention of caring for the people's strength. We all knelt and recited this edict, and our gratitude is beyond words. I believe that there are many loopholes in the destruction of opium, and we must be strictly vigilant in every aspect to avoid theft. This item has been circulating for a long time, and where there is profit, people will flock to it. According to the reports of Deng Tingzhen and others in the seventeenth year of Daoguang, unscrupulous people bought opium from foreign ships. In the past, each piece was worth more than thirty silver dollars, but recently it only costs sixteen or eighteen silver dollars. Even if we recalculate the price, each crate costs more than six hundred silver dollars, and a total of more than 20,000 crates are worth no less than one thousand million silver dollars. Those who uphold justice and hate evil will not only throw it away like dung, but also regard it as poison; but those who consume it will yearn for it, and those who traffic in it will want to hoard it. If the prevention is not strict, hundreds of evils will arise. Since the confiscation, we have been vigilant. Humen is located by the sea, and we must guard against unscrupulous people coveting it. We first surveyed the storage area. Each crate is about three feet long, and half as high and wide. A large room can only store four or five hundred crates. The local houses and temples are not spacious enough to accommodate them, so we had to combine several places, build walls around the temples, add high sheds, and arrange them evenly for storage. We sent twelve civil officials of the rank of 正佐 to guard the sheds, and ten military officials, leading one hundred soldiers, to patrol all night. Fortunately, there were no oversights. As for the method of destruction, we also deliberated and tested it repeatedly. In the past, it was burned with fire and tung oil, which was not without its merits. However, we heard that after burning, there would be residual膏and oil seeping into the ground, and those who were accustomed to煎熬could dig up the earth and obtain two or three out of ten. The harm was still difficult to eradicate completely. We consulted widely and learned that opium is most afraid of two things: salt卤and lime. All those who use opium to煎膏, when salt and ash are added, it will turn into渣沬, and it will not be able to收合成膏. Its antagonistic nature can be used to eliminate its harm. However, if we use ash smoke to cook each crate of opium, the number of pots and灶must be in the hundreds and thousands, and we are afraid that we will not be able to take care of them properly and will instead breed theft. If we set up fewer, it will not be possible to destroy them all in a few months. Now, after repeated deliberations, it is best to dig two pools in a high place on the beach, and浸化them in rotation. Other flat paved stone bottom; Longitudinal structure is more than 15 feet long and wide, with fences and nails to prevent leakage. A culvert is set in the front and a ditch is connected to the back. The pool bank is surrounded by a fence, with several棚廠in the middle, which are the 所where civil and military officials inspect. The method of浸化is to first pump water from the ditch into the pool, and sprinkle salt to form卤. All the opium in the crates is cut into four pieces and thrown into the卤,浸泡中日, and then the whole piece is烧透, and lime is thrown down. In an instant, it will boil like soup, and it will burn without a stove. Many people are hired to stand on the跳板, each holding an iron hoe and a wooden爬, to裁back and forth, so that all the particles are化. When the tide recedes, the culvert is opened and sent out to the ocean with the waves.清水is used to刷洗the bottom of the pool, so that no drop remains. If the first pool is not 清刷on the first day, the second pool will be used on the second day.浸泡翻裁, all as before. In this way, in rotation, each pool must be cleaned at the bottom of the pool to avoid mixing and breeding弊端. At 向晦停工, the fence around the pool bank is completely locked, and civil and military officials are sent to巡查around the pool. The weather in Guangdong is hot. The people used only wear short pants, and their upper body and feet are bare. Also, when they are released after停工, they are searched together with the laborers, and they are not allowed to带挟at all. At the beginning of the trial, only three or four hundred crates were化each day. After a few days, as the skills gradually became熟, now eight or nine hundred to a thousand crates can be化each day. When it is销鎔, the浓油surges up, the渣涬sinks down, and the臭秽熏腾is不可嚮邇. Then I realize that this thing can迷人心志, 促人年壽, and槁人形骸. It turns out that the manufacture uses物取精and has other奇义方术. It is not just like裁种器粟,刮浆熬制巳也 in the mainland. I, Lin Zexu,驻扎at Humen, and together with 提臣关天培,率同委员,候补知府南雄, and直隶州知州余保纯, etc., added 布置. Then I函商臣邓廷桢,臣怡良, because I钦奉谕旨,公同目撃销毁, and the officials in the province should轮流到虎,查严看视. I, Yiliang,商明留省last time when destroying. This time it is the turn to 虎门 first. After I, Deng Tingzhen, return to the province from Yiliang, I will take a boat to 虎. I also ordered 藩司熊常錞, 臬司乔用迁, 运司陈嘉树, and 粮道王笃to take turns to接替查视. Also, I 咨会广州将军臣德克金布, 左翼副都统臣奕湘, and 右翼副都统臣英降, and they all输流到虎to 稽杳弹压. 粤海关监书臣豫堃, then because Humen has a tax port, should常川到彼照料and 稽查在事员弁人等, and they all派定执司, 亙相查覈. The coastal residents there are watching like a wall, and they are only allowed outside the fence, and they are not allowed to mix in the factory to prevent theft. The foreigners who pass through the mouth of the 省下澳are all watching from a distance, and they dare not 亵玩. Observing their situation, it seems that there is a sense of shame and evil. They all rely on the 圣主德威, so that the 中外咸知震声. From now on, they will 洗心革面, and they will all 咸与维新矣. The names of the opium are also different. The black one is called 公斑土, and I heard that it is the best opium. The white soil is second, and the 金花土 is next. When the crates are opened and destroyed this time, the various colors of opium will be numbered and registered separately. Generally, the 公土 and 白土 are the majority, and the 金花土 is less than one percent. Each crate has been weighed, and the ones装者in the口袋have also been扣除箱袋, and the net opium斤两is覈实. Since April 22, up to May 3, 8,320 crates and 2,119 bags have been销过. The斤两combined is 1,128,729斤. If we覈it with the total number, the amount that has been 化已将及半. Now it is still赶紧销化, and we dare not be草率, and we dare not迁延, so that we will avoid 恐风圣怀. We respectfully submit this memorial to state the current situation. We beg Your Majesty to聖鑒. I respectfully present.

Two

A memorial reporting that the opium has been destroyed in Humen, and we have jointly verified and investigated it. Now it has been completed. I respectfully submit this memorial for Your Majesty's inspection. In accordance with the imperial decree, we destroyed more than 20,000 crates of opium confiscated from foreign ships in Guangdong. All the verification, prevention of corruption, and the joint witnessing by the civil and military officials have been reported in the joint memorial on May 3, when half of the destruction was completed. Afterwards, we continued to open the crates and weigh them, and cut the opium into pieces and threw them into the stone pool, soaked them with salt卤, and烂 them with lime.统Wait until they are戳化成渣, and send them out to the大　when the tide recedes. We, the civil and military officials, went to the factory every day to inspect and investigate. There were people trying to steal the opium, but the officials in charge were very careful to侦察. Therefore, there were more than a dozen criminals caught on the spot, and they were immediately严行惩治. There were also thieves who climbed the wall at night and凿箱偷土at the storage place, but the guards inside and outside each caught them during巡获破案. Now it is准发司严审, and they should be 按律重办. The people from far and near who came to the factory to观 is becoming more and more, especially around the端节. Everyone is肃然懍畏. There were also foreign merchants from the 咪喇坚国 and 哵　呅　　, etc., who brought their families and traveled by巫舳板from Macau to沙角递口and递禀to 水师提标游击羊英科, asking for permission to enter the棚to 瞻视. We first准令in the钦奉谕旨, allowing the foreigners in Guangdong to共见共闻and咸知震袭, and we have出示晓谕. Therefore, the 夷等遵谕前來, and we查夷商经等, who are 평소係作正经买卖and不贩鸦片, are人所共知. We派员带赴池旁, to使其看明切土捣烂, and 撤盐燃灰诸法. The 夷人等咸知一一点头, and they all时时掩鼻,旋至臣等厂前,摘帽歛手,似以表其畏服之灭. The 통事传谕the 夷等that天朝is禁绝鸦片, and the新例is极严. Not only are尔等素不贩卖之人永远不可夹带, but also must传谕各国外夷人, that从现在开始, they must only do正经贸易, which will获利无穷. They must not冒禁营私and自投法网. The 夷人等倾耳敬听, and俯首输诚. Observing their situation, they know 倾心向化. Then we公同赏给事物, and欢欣祇领而去. As for the烟土名色which we奏烟土, there were originally three kinds, called 公斑, 白土, and 金化. After we劈出原箱, there was another kind of 小公斑, with eighty crates per crate. The style is比行常之公斑较小and 个数倍之. Therefore, each crate斤两is不相上下. Each one is包裹用洋布, and the manufacturing is also 较精緻. I heard that this kind of 外国係最上之烟, and the价值is extremely贵. So, the 烟土化here has 四种. Recently, I伏读上谕in the邸钞, that烟膏烟具多有假造, and the弊不可胜言. Therefore, I admire 圣明务求眞实and力戒欺朦之至意. I, your humble servant, in my愚昧之见, to辨其伪, must first识其眞. I do not know what kind of烟上is拿获in 近时各处. If we compare 外夷原箱之物互相, then the眞伪似可立辨,不至混渚. I will leave two crates of each of the 四种烟土. Is it possible to use this入箱作爲样土? If we are准令解京, we will 委便员搭解, and it will not be difficult. If it is not necessary to send it, then the粤东is每月俱有各属拿获解省騐燬之烟, which can also be销化with it. Now, apart from暂存此八箱, we计已化烟土凑合前奏之数, with a total of 19,179 crates and 2,119 bags. The斤两除去箱袋实共is 2,376,254斤. Up to May 15, the业已销化全完. At this time,荡秽涤瑕, and we幸免毒流於四海. From now on,除奸　　拯溺, and we期约立於三章, to 庶几仰副我圣主除害保民之至意. All the 缘由 of销化烟土完竣, I谨会同水师提督臣关天培and 粤海关监督臣豫堃,合词恭摺具奏,伏乞皇上圣鉴训示. Also, there is nothing now in Humen, so I, Lin Zexu, will temporarily回省城商辨已切. I will合并声明显. I respectfully present.

### Establishment of the Shanghai North China Relief Association: Intensified Fundraising Efforts, Concentrating the Power of Leaders from All Walks of Life, Expedited Fundraising According to Plan

Given the severity of the disaster situation in North China, and in order to concentrate efforts to coordinate urgent relief funds, various circles in this city, after Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare came to Shanghai to instruct on relief methods and after negotiations with relevant parties were completed, organized the Shanghai All-Circles North China Urgent Relief Association. The inaugural meeting was held yesterday (2nd) at 5:00 PM at the Kangle Restaurant. More than 200 leaders from all circles in this city attended. Mayor Chen (represented by Secretary-General Zhao) and Minister Ding personally attended and gave instructions. Directors, Standing Directors, and a Presidium were elected on the spot, and organizational regulations, fundraising plans, etc., were passed. The atmosphere was enthusiastic, and it is expected that a large sum of money will be raised in the shortest possible time. Details are as follows:

Meeting Circumstances

First, Yuan Ludeng was elected as temporary chairman to report the purpose of the meeting. Then, convener Lin Kanghou reported, and the organizational regulations and fundraising plans were passed. Directors, Standing Directors, and a Presidium were elected. Subsequently, Presidium Chairman Yuan Ludeng reported the list of important officials, and Zhang Yipeng, representative of the Board of Directors, delivered a speech. Then, Mayor Chen's representative, Secretary-General Zhao, and Minister Ding successively delivered speeches. Afterwards, Presidium member Li Sihao delivered a speech, and refreshments were served. The meeting adjourned at approximately 7:00 PM.

First Standing Committee Meeting

Immediately after the meeting, the first Standing Committee meeting was held. Mayor Chen's representative, Secretary-General Zhao, and Minister Ding also personally participated. All Standing Directors and all important officials were present. Presidium Chairman Yuan Ludeng immediately discussed and resolved three important cases: (1) Discussing the location of the association, which will be located inside the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace Bridge; (2) Designating banks and money houses to collect donations: (A) Banks: China Bank, Bank of Communications, Continental Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China Industrial Bank, Siming Bank, China Reclamation Bank, Five Continents Bank, Great Wall Bank, Da Zhong Bank, Zhong Nan Bank, etc.; (B) Money houses: Fuyuan, Tongrun, etc.; (3) Determining that Standing Committee meetings will be held every Thursday at 4:00 PM.

In addition to the above-listed banks and money houses, the Standing Committee also decided that various newspapers will continue to collect donations as usual.

Chairman's Speech

Temporary Chairman Yuan Ludeng first delivered a speech, stating, "Today at the conference, everyone present is clear about the significance and purpose of the meeting. Therefore, we have an inescapable duty to provide urgent relief to North China. At the discussion tea party held at the International Hotel last time, we solicited opinions from all parties. After a round of negotiations, we established the organization today. All sectors are enthusiastically participating, and all newspapers in the city are reporting on the urgent relief efforts for North China. Although the city has donated hundreds of thousands of yuan so far, it deeply reflects the sympathy of all parties in the city. In addition to enthusiastic philanthropists cooperating to help, people of all ages and even coolies are saving money and donating. Now that officials have taken the lead, we will establish the Shanghai All-Circles North China Urgent Relief Association in order to build a sound cadre organization. I hope that everyone will actively solicit donations and continue to do so. I am deeply grateful for your enthusiastic participation today."

Lin Kanghou's Speech

Next, convener Lin Kanghou reported, stating, "Relief for the disaster situation in North China relies on the enthusiastic cooperation of local elders. The Shanghai All-Circles North China Urgent Relief Association was established today. Recently, in order to actively organize, a preparatory meeting was convened, and Minister Ding obtained clues during negotiations in the capital. Therefore, the task of urgent relief for North China should be carried out rapidly. Disaster relief is like fighting a fire, so we should catch up quickly. Although the government has already transported a considerable amount of food to North China for relief, we hope that the government will continue its efforts and continuously transport supplies and food as quickly as possible to relieve the distressed disaster victims. However, since the government bears this major responsibility, we should urge the government to complete it as early as possible. The greatest expectation depends on the enthusiastic assistance of everyone present to help the government carry out its work, catch up quickly, and urgently form a backbone. Everyone should do their job and work hard to solicit donations from all parties."

Secretary Zhao's Speech

Mayor Chen's representative, Secretary-General Zhao, delivered a speech, stating, "Regarding relief for North China, Minister Ding and I convened everyone last time to hold a discussion meeting to solicit opinions and decided to concentrate efforts to carry out the work. (1) Advocate strengthening the organization as quickly as possible; (2) Fundraising methods should be carried out as soon as possible; (3) Accelerate fundraising for food and money and transport food to North China as soon as possible, so as to promote the effort by combining the power of the government and the power of the people in the same step. Shanghai is not short of charitable people who are willing to help others, so everyone deeply sympathizes with the victims of the disaster in North China. After a short period of preparation, the organization was established today. Therefore, although it was a plan before, it must be implemented according to the plan in the future. Actively solicit donations, and agencies for soliciting donations, purchasing, transporting food, and expanding publicity should start working separately tomorrow, all for the sake of the disaster victims. Only in this way can urgent relief for North China be effective and achieve good results."

Minister Ding's Speech

Minister Ding delivered a speech, stating, "The Shanghai All-Circles North China Urgent Relief Association has been preparing for three weeks and was finally established today. Now that there is an organization for urgent relief in North China, which gathers the strength of leaders from all walks of life, it will definitely be of great help to relief efforts in North China. This is something that can be predicted and asserted. Regarding disaster relief, all parties hope to transport as much food as possible. Recently, the Grain Department has been working to purchase a batch, which can be transported immediately, but the number is small. In the future, transportation will continue at any time. As for the disaster situation in North China, the Ministry of Welfare has sent people to inspect it, and they have already returned to the ministry with a lot of materials, which will be announced in the future. Finally, I hope that after the establishment of the North China Urgent Relief Association, it will be able to achieve success in the fastest and best way."

Zhang Yipeng's Speech

Today, under the promotion and guidance of officials in Beijing, the Shanghai All-Circles Urgent Relief Fundraising organization, which tens of millions of starving people in North China have been eagerly awaiting, has been fully established. From now on, kind-hearted people from all walks of life in Shanghai will have a centralized order, which is gratifying. We have heard about the tragic situation of the famine in the four provinces of North China, but we have not personally seen it. However, most of us have come here to escape disaster. The most painful things for the people are natural disasters and man-made disasters. Floods and droughts are natural disasters, and wars are man-made disasters. When facing man-made disasters, people can only escape. When facing natural disasters, people can only flee famine. The taste is no different. However, although escaping disaster is bitter, it does not lead to starvation. Fleeing famine means having no food to eat everywhere. The number of people who die while escaping disaster is limited, but people die with every step they take while fleeing famine. Therefore, the pain of fleeing famine is ten or a hundred times greater than that of escaping disaster. We are fortunate to have escaped death and are here with food and use. Comparing the two, we naturally regard urgent relief for North China as our only obligation. Now, the responsibility of the Board of Directors is only one word: speed. As for fundraising, I think it will be easy to promote. The faster we can do it, the more we can save people. This is what we should supervise and encourage each other.

### North China Urgent Relief Fundraising Plan

1. Holding horse races: Mr. Sun Mingqi and Zhou Wenrui are negotiating with the racecourse authorities on this matter. It is currently planned to hold horse races starting on June 12th, cooperating with friendly parties. The proceeds from the sales will be allocated to urgent relief for North China. 2. Obligatory performances by all major and minor theaters in the city: It was originally planned to hold a Peking opera grand performance, and Mr. Sun Mingqi had negotiated with Mr. Huang Jinrong, Gong Tianjian, Chen Fukang, and others. However, it was later considered that this work would involve complicated procedures, require fruitful preparations, and incur huge expenses, resulting in limited gains. It is now planned to separately negotiate with all major and minor theaters in the city to perform one or more obligatory performances. The date will be determined by the theater itself, and the Urgent Relief Association will send personnel to supervise the ticket sales. 3. Holding football and basketball competitions: These two items will be negotiated with various teams by Mr. Shen Siliang, Ma Runfang, Xu Duo, and others from the Sports Association, and they can be held soon. 4. Raising goods for charity sales: It is planned to raise various valuable items from all parties, select a suitable location, display them for one or two days, and then auction them to the public. All proceeds will be used as relief funds (according to Mr. Yuan Ludeng, he has automatically donated 50 boxes of high-quality cigars). 5. Distributing donation booklets: The Urgent Relief Association will print donation booklets, list the numbers, distribute them to various committee members to solicit donations, and designate banks to collect them on their behalf. 6. Other matters to be temporarily decided by the Standing Committee.

Appendix

No matter what kind of donation it is, the person in charge must directly hand it over to the bank for collection. The association will not accept cash to prevent abuses. The Finance and Audit Groups of this association will settle accounts with each collecting bank once a week and publish public invitations. The administrative expenses of the association will be advanced by the Standing Committee and deducted from the donations.

### District Prosecutor's Office Decides to Directly Prosecute the Zhang Case

(Central News Agency Shanghai News) Regarding the case of the brutal killing of young Zhang Jinhai, it has been a month in the blink of an eye, but the entire case has not yet been finalized. The chief culprit, French inspector Mirey, and accomplice No. 23 French constable Buckley, according to the announcement of the French authorities, will be subject to sanctions by the Saigon court. If so, it is difficult to predict the outcome of the entire case. As for the Chinese abettors and accomplices, although they have now been transferred to the Second Special District District Court for detention, the French Police Department, on the grounds that the investigation has not been completed, has not prosecuted the three Chinese suspects, Guo Shiyuan, Feng Quansheng, and Li Xiuying. The indictment has now been formally delivered to the Second Special District District Court, and it has been confirmed that Guo Shiyuan, Li Xiuying, and Feng Quansheng will not be prosecuted. In order to protect the legal rights of the people and safeguard the national law, the Second Special Court has decided that the Procuratorate of the court will directly prosecute the criminal court so that the criminals will not escape legal sanctions. Therefore, it was decided on the morning of the 4th to open the court as scheduled and not to extend it again.

### Minister Tajiri Returns to Shanghai

### Short Commentary: Everyone Mobilizes to Donate

The Shanghai All-Circles North China Urgent Relief Association has been formally established. Judging from the announced regulations, fundraising plans, and the list of directors and staff, we can observe the overall picture and functions of the association: (1) Its sole mission is to raise funds for urgent relief in North China; (2) In addition to directly persuading people to donate money and goods, the fundraising methods also promote "entertainment without forgetting disaster relief"; (3) The selected personnel almost encompass the backbone members of all circles in the city. With our intuitive ideals, the work of the association will definitely develop smoothly and achieve good results. While we expect all the gentlemen of the association to mobilize and work together, we respectfully extend our sincere hopes to all citizens of Shanghai, especially those with money and goods.

Regarding money, its nature and its use, our concepts are: (1) Money is a dead thing, and its allocation and use depend on living people and living uses; (2) Money comes from society and should be used for society and applied to society; (3) Money is to people as fertilizer is to plants. It should not be too little, nor should it be too much. Too little will not provide sustenance, and too much will not benefit life. Moreover, too much fertilizer can kill plants, causing harm to oneself. Accumulating and hoarding wealth only harms oneself; accumulating wealth extensively to leave to descendants will only make the grandchildren arrogant. All of these are people being slaves to money, which is not worthwhile. Therefore, those who have money must use it appropriately, in the right place, and at the right time. Now, providing relief to suffering compatriots can be said to be using money appropriately, in the right place, and at the right time.

We further list a few examples in the hope that you can transfer the funds that can be saved to help those in need of urgent relief, such as saving the cost of dancing and improper entertainment; saving the consumption of purchasing imported luxury goods; reducing extravagant waste in weddings, funerals, and celebrations; and saving the waste of mutual gifts. Even these six items, if we can think of the disaster victims and be careful, the amount of money moved to relief funds will be considerable and its effect will be significant.

The matter is urgent! Time is pressing! We hope that compatriots from all walks of life will rise up and do their best to quickly complete this major task of "disaster relief is like fighting a fire."

### Economic Circles: The Advancing Situation of National Industries

The issue of national capital often draws attention. After the National Government joined the war, national capital will experience significant advancements in both quality and quantity. First, the National Commercial Control General Association is an organization of national capital. Capital related to Chinese commerce has always been particularly developed. However, because it lacked a role in the overall national economic organization, it did not contribute significantly to the overall development of the Chinese economy. This is the inherent nature of commercial capital, and the lack of organization and guidance is also one of the reasons.

Chinese commercial capital, since the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, coupled with the recent strengthening of the Central Reserve Bank of China, the rise of small and medium-sized industries, and the revival of sizable enterprises after the removal of enemy assets, can all be regarded as the dawn of productive activity.

Second, the National Government's emphasis on state capital has been repeatedly clarified in the speeches of Chen Gongbo and Chen Junhui. Due to various circumstances since the Chinese Incident, state capital naturally cannot develop fully. The National Government is well aware of this situation, so it has adopted wise and stable methods, such as the organization for procuring and distributing rice, and the recently announced construction plans, all of which can be regarded as the brilliant development of Chinese state capital.

In today's world situation, newly emerging countries must implement a controlled economy to achieve economic development, but to ensure the smooth operation of a controlled economy, private capital and state capital must cooperate closely.

In addition, newly emerging countries seeking to advance must have the assistance and guidance of advanced countries. This is a common precedent in history. If China's national capital wants to advance, it must rely on Japan's assistance and guidance before we can talk about the healthy development of China's national capital, with the aim of contributing to the revitalization of the Chinese economy. (Yun Peng: Abridged translation from the Dalu Xinbao, June 2nd)

### Shanghai Hoarding Case and Military Allocation Association Affairs: Japanese Embassy Announces Investigation Results

Regarding the Shanghai hoarding incident, due to its involvement with the military scrip exchange materials allocation association, the Japanese Embassy in China, upon hearing the news, considering that the issue not only concerns the price problem but also fearing it would affect the cooperation policy towards China, made great efforts to investigate in order to thoroughly understand the truth. The result was that the military allocation association was found to have no direct relationship with the hoarding incident, and it was merely a rumor. However, the Japanese Embassy in China has decided to make every effort to prevent the occurrence of hoarding incidents in the future. At the same time, it will announce the results of its investigation at 3:00 PM on the 2nd, explaining the details in detail. Furthermore, since the establishment of the Materials Investigation Committee by our government, a second investigation is currently underway, and the results will be released soon. This time, due to the joint efforts of China and Japan to curb hoarding incidents, significant results are expected. The main points of the statement issued by the Japanese Embassy in China are recorded below: After hearing about the Shanghai hoarding incident involving the military scrip exchange materials allocation association, the Japanese Imperial Embassy immediately conducted an investigation. The results of the investigation revealed the following facts: The task of the military allocation association is to exchange military scrip between Central China and South and North China and to procure military supplies. The procurement of cotton cloth this time happened to coincide with a sharp rise in cotton cloth prices in the Shanghai market, making procurement difficult. Therefore, artificial silk and cotton cloth from bank guarantees were used for barter. This move did not affect the market. In order to facilitate procurement, Zhenhua Company and Han Gongbei were entrusted to handle the matter. However, Han secretly purchased cotton cloth (amounting to 1,390 boxes) in the market, leading people to mistakenly believe that the military allocation association was engaged in hoarding activities, thus making the military allocation association the target of rumors. This was merely a regrettable act by a related staff member of the military allocation association, and the General Affairs Department Committee of the organization will be punished. The occurrence of this Shanghai hoarding incident is truly regrettable. The National Government has now established a wartime posture, and in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, both Chinese and Japanese people should exercise self-respect and self-discipline and work hard. The Japanese side is determined to closely cooperate with the National Government to completely eliminate hoarding incidents. This special explanation of the results of the military organization investigation is to ensure that people in both countries understand the truth and cooperate with the government's policies.

### Rice and Coal Industry Organizations Held Inaugural Meetings Yesterday

Rice Joint Venture

After careful planning by the preparatory committee, the Shanghai Rice Joint Venture held its inaugural meeting yesterday (2nd) at 2:00 PM at the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association on Avenue Edward VII. Attendees included 2,179 representatives from one city and seven districts.

A total of 21,384 businesses collected application forms, and 2,200 businesses completed the procedures. After the establishment of our venture, we will work hard to stabilize people's livelihoods."

The list of elected directors and supervisors will be submitted to the authorities for half of them to be selected. The meeting also sent a telegram to the highest authorities and the Ministry of Food reporting the establishment process.

Coal Industry Federation

After the preparatory committee's active preparations, the Coal Industry Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Bankers' Association on Hong Kong Road. Attendees included representatives from three provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui) and two cities (Shanghai and Nanjing). In addition to passing various proposals, fifteen directors were elected: Yang Xiangru, Shen Jinzhou, Xu Guisheng, Guo Yanghao, You Chunxin, Luo Huaikai, Cao Pu'an, Rong Baofu, Shao Qin Fang, Lin Bainian, Wei Zhida, Han Chengpu, Pang Runsheng, Huang Zhengxiang, and Chen Ruitang. Six supervisors were also elected: Ke Jinzhang, Mao Chunpu, Liu Jiaji, Zhang Ziyan, Xu Zhuqing, and Xu Renfu.

### Rice Industry Association Abolished

The Ministry of Food has ordered that after the establishment of regional county rice joint ventures in accordance with regulations, all existing rice association organizations in those districts and counties should be abolished and cease their activities. As for matters concerning the welfare of rice merchants, they should be handled temporarily by the joint venture in accordance with regulations. After receiving the order, the Municipal Grain Bureau issued orders to all its subordinate districts to strictly comply and not delay or neglect their duties.

### Unified Allocation of Eggs; Prices Also Set

The Municipal Egg Industry Association has completed the registration of businesses in the industry. The results of the review will be communicated in writing, and businesses are required to pay fees and sign agreements before the end of May. The association's board of directors has decided to implement unified purchasing and allocation from June 1st. All fresh chicken eggs, duck eggs, preserved eggs, and salted eggs arriving in the city will be purchased by the association. As for the allocation locations, shareholders of Lianyu Company will be temporarily allocated by Lianyu, shareholders of China Company will be temporarily allocated by China Company, and other qualified businesses will be temporarily allocated by Maochang Company. Once the association's warehouses are ready, the association will directly allocate. Unqualified businesses will purchase from egg merchants in the city, which is indirect allocation. As for the price of chicken eggs, it has been jointly agreed upon by the Chinese and Japanese egg merchants association as follows:

Price of Good Quality Eggs:

(1) Wholesale price: 1,350 yuan in national currency per 100 market catties of good quality eggs.

(2) Retail price: 1,512 yuan in national currency per 100 market catties of good quality eggs, which is equivalent to 13.75 yuan in national currency per pound.

Price of Duck Eggs

The association's board of directors has set the price of duck eggs as follows: (1) Wholesale price: 1,672 yuan in national currency per 1,000 Grade A duck eggs, 1,522 yuan per 1,000 Grade B duck eggs, and 1,372 yuan per 1,000 Grade C duck eggs. (2) Retail price: 1.82 yuan in national currency per Grade A duck egg, 1.67 yuan per Grade B duck egg, and 1.52 yuan per Grade C duck egg.

Price of Preserved and Salted Eggs

The association's board of directors has also set the price of preserved and salted eggs as follows: 2,000 yuan per 1,000 colored preserved eggs for wholesale, 2.20 yuan per Jingcai egg, 1,900 yuan per 1,000 salted eggs for wholesale, and 2.10 yuan per salted egg for retail.

### China Communications Joint Organization Silk Industry Loan Syndicate

In order to assist the government in reviving rural areas and increasing production, the China Communications Bank and Bank of Communications have decided to jointly establish a silk cocoon loan program with 23 banks in the city, including Jin Cheng, Shanghai Continental, Salt Industry, and Zhejiang Xingye Bank. The loan target is the China Silk Industry Company. The China Silk Industry Company Loan Syndicate has been established, and a loan agreement has been signed, stipulating a loan amount of 50 million yuan, designated for cocoon purchasing and silk production. It is said that the loan interest rate is very low.

### District Office Stamp Required for Transportation of Yarn and Cloth: Municipal Economic Bureau Denies

Yesterday's report stated that the transportation certificate for yarn and cloth issued by the Materials Control Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Council must be stamped by the Huxi District Office in order to be valid outside the two concession areas. Yesterday, the Central News Agency reporter inquired about the truth from the Municipal Economic Bureau. According to the person in charge of the bureau, regarding the movement of cotton yarn and cotton cloth within the urban area of the city, according to the recent regulations of the Ministry of Industry, raw materials for the factory's own use should be allowed to move with the certification of the respective trade associations. For those moving materials outside the materials flow control line, a transportation permit must be issued by the Commercial Control General Association. Therefore, yesterday's news was not true.

### Municipal Council Restricts Submission of Monthly Reports by Trade Associations

The Municipal Council's Association Section is quite strict in managing associations within the settlement. It stipulates that all trade associations must submit monthly reports, truthfully reporting all association activities within the month for review. The authorities have ordered the prompt completion and submission of the monthly report for the previous month, which must be submitted to the section for review before the 10th of this month.

Furthermore, the bureau has ordered all dissolved trade associations to report their closure, return their licenses, and cease all association activities. It is reported that most of the dissolved associations have already submitted their closure reports to the section, but there are still a few that have not, which is illegal. It has been decided to crack down on them. All measures are pending discussion with the Municipal Economic and Food Bureaus and the bureau before a decision is made.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks continued to weaken. Before the old lunar calendar Dragon Boat Festival, it is feared that there will be no turnaround. People are idle, and transactions are thin. However, the buying trend of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company has not subsided, and it has risen slightly. In the right, China Match Company showed a slight decline. Department stores, Xinxin, re-entered Guannei, and Wing On and National Goods Company all saw declines. Undershirts also showed a slight decline. Only Jingfu Shirt and Socks maintained their original prices, and transactions were quite active. Among the textile industry, Wing On Textile fluctuated narrowly, and the price was slightly lower. Mei Ya Silk Factory fell a lot that day, with supply exceeding demand. Small denomination stocks, such as Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing, had buyers when the price was low and were stable. In the cultural industry, Zhonghua has retreated into Guannei, and World Book Company has also declined. The Commercial Press was even more pressured by sellers. In the new pharmaceutical industry, China-France Pharmacy and New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory had more sellers and declined slightly. In addition, the transaction of various other miscellaneous stocks was thin. The prices were firm and weak, with little change in Tongchang Trust, Jiu'an Industrial, and Zhongxing Timber. Kangyuan Canned Food remained stable inside and outside Guannei.

### Latest Chinese Stock Treasure Book

Since Chinese stock businesses have resumed operations one after another, the Chinese stock market has been able to trade in a normal posture. Therefore, social investors are optimistic about the future of Chinese stocks. However, when investing in stocks, it is most necessary to study the correct situation of the stock's parent manufacturer. It is reported that the "Pocket Chinese Stock Treasure Book," edited by Liu Yunfang, will be published in early July. The content lists the names, addresses, and capital (including recent capital increases) of the recent Chinese factories, a brief history of the directors, supervisors, and important staff, the scope of business, the profit distribution of the last three years, and a comparison of stock market prices, and includes Chinese stock commentary and Chinese stock charts. The compilation is sophisticated and novel, and it is truly the best data for studying Chinese stocks. Pre-order agents for the book: (1) Chinese Stock Daily News Agency, Room 613, Securities Building, Jiujiang Road. (2) Enterprise Weekly News Agency, 996 Jingshou Temple Road.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds: Yesterday morning, the unified government bond black market was firm. Various types of bonds A, B, C, D, and E were traded sparsely.

Gold and Silver: Yesterday morning, the silver building industry in the city, Da Xin and other peers, sold jewelry gold at the limit price per tael and increased the handling fee. Transactions were not prosperous inside and outside the industry. Prices fell slightly, resulting in a small loss of dozens of yuan. People's hearts were still unsettled, and transactions were thin.

Yarn and Cloth: The cloth market was initially firm and then weak. It opened higher in the morning and rose consistently. However, high prices prompted floating investors and retail investors to sell off one after another, causing the market to decline step by step. As a result, it fell lower than the previous day. Longtou fine cloth fell several yuan yesterday, and Sijunzi serge fell several jiao. Cotton yarn was slightly sold off due to tight money, so the price slightly fell. Buyers took advantage of the price to purchase, and transactions were slightly more active.

Edible Oil: The third phase of edible oil sales based on household registration tickets has been approved by the military allocation authorities for more than 7,000 dan. The procedures for picking up goods are being actively processed. It was originally scheduled to start general sales today (3rd), but it is reported that the sales will be postponed because various procedures have not been completed. One says that general sales will begin on the 5th of this month, and the other says that they will be issued on the 15th. As for the sales method, it is the same as in previous periods, with each person receiving four liang at a price of 5.10 yuan.

### Helping

— Yu Huairui

Helping is a virtue, but if applied carelessly, it can degenerate into aiding evildoers or harming those being helped.

How can we avoid the occurrence of this careless action?

First, for the matter being helped, it should first be thoroughly investigated. This matter must benefit the one being helped, without harming others, harming society, or, even better, benefiting others and benefiting society. Otherwise, if one does not distinguish between right and wrong for the matter being helped, and blindly favors private friendship, and then rashly engages in it, it is very easy to cause great harm to the unscrupulous person, or to the entire society, because of my assistance, and one will also become a sinner cursed by thousands of people because of it.

Second, it must be examined whether the one being helped is in a situation where my help is absolutely necessary, because for the same help, there is a world of difference between "sending charcoal in the snow" and "adding flowers to the brocade," because the former is to save people from danger, while the latter often creates a psychological dependence on the other party. If there is no help from you, he can try to help himself as much as possible. Now that everything is helped by others, it blocks his enterprising heart, so the ability of wealthy children is often inferior to that of poor people, and the reason lies in this. Isn't this loving them enough to harm them?

Therefore, before implementing help, if the above two items can be carefully considered, then it can make the helper meritorious and the recipient benefit.

### A Young Girl's Sad Confession

— Cai Ming

Unfortunately, when I was seven or eight years old, I felt some numbness in my left hand and right leg, but I didn't pay attention to it; when I was twelve years old, my face became swollen, and everyone determined that I had leprosy. When this rumor spread, the gentlemen in the village warned my father and proposed to put me to death alive or drive me out of the village, which made my father anxious and unable to eat or sleep. They mercilessly urged him one after another. My father promised them to find a doctor and inquired that there was a doctor who specialized in treating leprosy not far from the village, so he led me to diagnose. It was determined that I was suffering from mixed leprosy and needed injections, but 200 yuan in medical expenses was required, because my father could not come up with such a large sum of money, and there was no result.

When we returned home in tears, the situation was not good. We saw the villagers coming menacingly, holding knives and sticks, to put me to death. My father was so frightened that he told me to escape quickly. It was already dark, and I could only walk blindly for half an hour. In the darkness, I couldn't help but cry out loud. Later, I thought that crying was not a solution. Let's go find death! I walked blankly to a river and jumped into it. At that moment, I lost all consciousness!

I don't know how much time passed, but unexpectedly, I vaguely heard someone calling me beside me, saying, "Poor little girl, why did you jump into the river?" When I gradually woke up, I told them the truth. When they heard that I was a leper girl, they immediately changed their attitude, regretting that they had rescued me and quickly drove me away. I dragged my wet clothes, the weather was cold, and I thought it would be better to jump into the river again! At this time, it was already dawn, and the villagers came out to work. As soon as they saw me, many people gathered around and discussed how to put me to death. Just as they were talking all at once, an old man suddenly came out and dissuaded them, saying that although he had leprosy, he had not committed any crime after all. It would be better to ask his father to find a way to send him to the hospital, as long as our village is not infected. I was like coming back to life from death and went home. The old man told my father again: There is a leprosarium in Daqin, so I was able to enter this hospital. Time passed so quickly, and unknowingly two years have passed. Although my illness has not fully recovered, I feel that it is gradually getting better. Recalling the past, it is like a sea of sourness! (Que Chou)

### On Individuality

— Chen Fangzhong

What is individuality? It is the crystallization of the exchange and synthesis of thought and emotion, and it governs our entire lives. Although it is governed by innate heredity and acquired living habits, it does have the function of transforming the environment and changing heredity.

The environment and individuality are closely linked. A reasonable life can affect a reasonable individuality, and similarly, a reasonable individuality will also affect a reasonable life. However, to transform life, one must first start by transforming individuality.

The expression of a good individuality is the joy of life. It is a constant, genuine, and interesting taste. Its expressive appearance is freedom from anger, which is the core of excellence and the lubricant for contact between people. To obtain it, we must cultivate correct thoughts. To achieve correct thoughts, we must recognize the principles of justice and distinguish between right and wrong. After that, our thoughts will naturally be clear and our minds unburdened. We can achieve a state of freedom from anger, and with our warm passion, we can put ourselves in others' shoes and forgive others, and then all kinds of blaming the heavens and others will naturally disappear.

Having reasonable thoughts will lead to reasonable behavior. We can then observe its harmonious movements. In fact, when we have beautiful movements, we can also sense normal thoughts and emotions—true individuality. They are all interconnected.

Grasping the beautiful individuality leads to a disciplined life and even to engaging in social reform, because it is the soul of a progressive society. The meaning of life is to accelerate human progress—the realm of goodness. To achieve it, we must strive for the development of good individuality.

### Anecdotes of the Japanese Navy (8)

— Oshita Udaru

The white sun flag, according to the order announced by the Tokugawa Shogunate in July of Ansei 2nd year, stated: "From today onwards, Japanese ships will no longer be confused with ships of other countries. The white sun flag will be hoisted." At that time, it was not yet considered a national flag, but merely a flag hoisted on ships.

In January of Meiji 3rd year, it was established as the national flag. However, whether on land, at sea, on merchant ships, or on warships, the same sun flag was hoisted. Later, on October 7th of Meiji 21st year, sixteen rays were added to the sun, specifically for use on warships.

The fluttering of the warship flag indicates that it is a warship of the Imperial Japanese Navy. It also represents the existence of the Imperial Japanese Navy. This flag's location brooks no offense whatsoever. It is extremely sacred. During hoisting and lowering, the officer of the watch on duty issues the order, and the "Representative of the Emperor" music is played. The guard of honor raises their rifles, and all personnel stand at attention and salute. Overseas compatriots, gazing at the posture of the Imperial warship entering the port from afar, upon seeing the warship flag fluttering in the wind, are filled with joy and gratitude, naturally shedding tears. Usually, while moored, from morning until sunset, the warship flag flies on the flagpole at the stern of the warship. While sailing, it is hoisted day and night. When battle is imminent, there is a slight change. Upon hearing the order to "Prepare for battle," the stern flagpole is quickly lowered to accommodate the firing of the cannons, and the flag is moved to a slanted flagpole near the aft mast. When the opportunity for battle arises, the battle bugle roars, and simultaneously, another warship flag is raised to the bridge. This flag on the bridge is called the battle flag. Upon seeing the battle flag being hoisted, the hearts of all crew members tense with emotion. Thus, emotions and willpower become even more vigorous.

A flag that has undergone an incident or battle, and has a very honorable, memorable battle history, is always carefully preserved. This preserved flag is called the commemorative warship flag. It is usually stored in a box on the ship, and is hoisted during fleet reviews or other ceremonies. Furthermore, if the commemorative warship flag with a past honorable history is raised again during another incident or battle, it indicates a very important battle.

The army regimental flag also has sixteen rays around the sun. It appears the same, but there is a significant difference.

The regimental flag is bestowed by His Majesty the Emperor himself.

This regimental flag has been through thousands upon thousands of battles, and has been washed by countless cannon smoke and rain of bullets, and is never replaced. The warship flag, on the other hand, is made by the navy itself. A warship has many warship flags of various sizes. It is for the purpose of clearly and openly letting others know that this is an Imperial Navy warship. If it is damaged, it is difficult to identify. Therefore, if there is damage, it can be taken out and replaced.

In this war, everyone knows that foreign countries have what is called a commodore's pennant, but Japan does not. If a warship is commanded by a captain acting in the role of a rear admiral, the flag hoisted at that time is the acting admiral's pennant. This is the admiral's flag (the sun has eight rays around it) with one end cut into a swallowtail shape. It is not called a flag but a pennant because its longitudinal ratio is different from other flags, resembling a streamer. (: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)

### Quinine Hoarders Can Rest Now

— Zhu Yuan

When an addiction first starts, the patient does not suffer any immediate life-threatening harm, and a healthy person can return to normal activity after the fever subsides. Coupled with the high cost of medication, people inevitably delay treatment, leading to prolonged neglect.

Quinine is the main medication for treating addiction. Before the war, each thousand tablets (referring to Shuangtao Brand Erfeng Quinine) cost only seven or eight yuan, less than one cent per tablet. It was an extremely common and cheap medication. Since the outbreak of war, transportation has been gradually disrupted, and pharmacies are unwilling to sell large quantities, so the price is gradually controlled by pharmacies with sufficient inventory. As a result, prices have gradually risen, but Shanghai has ample stock, enough to last for ten years.

By the second half of the thirtieth year, each thousand tablets had continued to rise to over eighty yuan in old currency. In the spring of the thirty-first year, hoarders stockpiled large quantities, causing the price of quinine to rise dramatically and unusually. The price changed several times a day. Consequently, Western medicine companies sprang up like mushrooms, operating like stock exchanges. Those with goods raised prices wildly, while those without goods acted as brokers. Outsiders and those who had hoarded other goods switched to hoarding quinine. The current price is hundreds of times higher. This increase is not due to a shortage of goods, but due to hoarders driving up prices. The current quinine is no longer accessible to the poor. It has become a ball kicked around by hoarders, reaping huge profits. The poor, unfortunately suffering from malaria, cannot afford medication for treatment. Malaria, if left untreated, causes the malaria parasites in the blood to destroy a large number of red blood cells, resulting in severe anemia, pale skin, and frequent headaches, dizziness, and nausea.

I am an apprentice at a pharmacy. The customers who come to buy quinine are mostly poor people, who have often been ill for half a year to two years. Many of them have relapsed after being cured. Generally, poor people suffer from malnutrition and lack resistance, making it particularly difficult to recover. Customers often only buy one or two tablets due to financial constraints. When I advise them to buy a few more and take them frequently to prevent relapse, they all frown and smile bitterly. As a result, patients have no medicine to take and become anemic. The hoarding by hoarders is no different from the bloodsucking of vampires.

For treatment, use a sufficient amount of quinine (one gram) at a time, taking it three to four hours before the onset, which can prevent the attack. Afterwards, on non-attack days, take one gram per day in three divided doses for several days. This makes it easier to prevent relapse. A friend of mine suffered from persistent malaria for six or seven years, but was later introduced to injections of Neo Salvarsan (New 606) and was cured (the first injection was 0.45, the second was 0.6). If you have chronic malaria that does not heal, you may wish to consult a doctor for injections.

The cruelty of the Zhang Jinhai case recently aroused social resonance, which shows that human beings inherently possess the nature of mutual assistance and universal love. Now, observing these large numbers of vampires, sucking blood every day, although invisible, the harm is not small. I especially call on you to pay attention and take effective measures.

### Automatic and Passive

— Ren Yi

Being automatic comes from the heart, understanding the true nature of the situation, knowing the importance of what needs to be done. Such action is called automatic. Being passive is being instructed by others, not from the heart, without understanding the importance of things. There is no question of sincerity and honesty; it is merely adapting to the orders of the instructor. There are countless people in society today being passive, doing work they are unwilling to do. Because this work does not interest them, they are careless and impractical, making it difficult to improve. Those who suffer from this the most are the young students from wealthy families. Paying tuition to come to school is something their parents have told them to do. The books they read seem to be for their parents' sake. They do not understand the importance of studying and have no interest in it. They are forced to read their daily lessons. Some even simply enroll in school but never show their true face, using this study time to wander, relax, and mess around.

From this, we know that the disadvantage of being passive is the pointless waste of resources and time. Therefore, when doing things, it is essential to make the person in charge understand the true nature of things, know their importance, and point out the path to be taken, placing them in an automatic position, making them sincerely and diligently strive forward. Only then can there be hope and success. Poor students are often in this position. They have developed an interest in studying and understand its importance, so they persevere from beginning to end without a moment of laziness. Look at the famous people of the past and present; which one did not achieve success from an automatic position? We need automatic development, not passive blind obedience.

### Brief Words on Floating Traces

— Qian Fu

Human relationships are indispensable, but they should be used to uphold morality, not to destroy it. Therefore, protecting bad colleagues, indulging disobedient children, and tolerating criminal friends are all violations of morality and human relationships.

"Selfishness" is the source of all sins, and "deception" is the supreme trick to cover up sins. Therefore, "selfishness" and "deception" are the left and right hands of sin.

Humans can conquer fierce beasts without claws or teeth, and even teach them to perform. This is not relying on strength, but on intelligence. Therefore, when dealing with everyday matters, people should use more intelligence and less strength. Relying solely on a moment of arrogance rarely leads to success.

I do not believe in the theory of mutual generation and destruction among family members predetermined by fortune-tellers. However, I do borrow the opposition of good and evil. In a family, there is good and evil, fighting each other. If good wins, evil changes, and the family is harmonious in goodness. If evil wins, good changes, and the family acts in evil. The most painful situation for a family is when good and evil are deadlocked! (Reply to a query)

### Meddling

— Ke Shi

Under the traditional style of "everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, never mind the frost on another's roof," few people think of meddling in others' affairs. Even if they do, it is only to criticize others' private lives behind their backs.

Usually on the street, when something happens, many people become "wall-sitters," adopting the attitude of "other people's affairs, I am not responsible." No matter how the matter unfolds, they are merely temporary bystanders. Once someone takes a stand for righteousness and defends the wronged, the "wall-sitters" will say, "Forget it! It's their business, leave it alone, don't meddle!" It seems like this kind of thing should not only be managed, but also shouldn't be managed.

As the saying goes, "A dog catching a mouse—meddling too much." Catching mice is the cat's job. Isn't a dog catching mice going beyond its duty and meddling too much? However, if there is no cat, and the dog catches the mouse instead, how highly would people praise it? In other words, when difficulties arise, how grateful would people be if someone helps to resolve them?

Then, when others are in danger, why advise people not to meddle too much? Is this fulfilling humanity's instinct for mutual assistance, or is it a duty that humanity should fulfill?

### Divert Dragon Boat Festival Expenses to Relief for North China Disaster Victims

— Hen Chong

The disaster victims in North China are in imminent danger, urgently awaiting relief. Who among us is not a compatriot? How can we bear to sit idly by? Although various sectors have called for and exerted efforts to raise funds for relief, due to the vast disaster area, the large number of famine victims, and the massive funds needed, it still feels like a drop in the bucket. Thinking about the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival, the customary practice is to add dishes and enjoy meals. Now, considering the miserable plight of the starving disaster victims in North China, how can we bear to eat even if we have delicacies before us? The best course of action is to divert these funds to disaster relief. Inner joy is far superior to oral pleasure. Even if only the Shanghai area were to collectively arise in factories, shops, and residences, prepaying the Dragon Boat Festival meal expenses and sending them to relief organizations, the total amount would be considerable, and the number of people saved would not be small. This is truly a great achievement. The heart of compassion exists in everyone. Why not practice frugality and do good deeds?

### This Newspaper's Medical Aid Funds Achieve Great Results

Mr. Zhu Peixian wrote yesterday, stating: "Unfortunately, I have contracted a lung disease. With medical expenses a hundred times higher than in the past, without the assistance of your esteemed newspaper's medical aid funds, I would have no opportunity for treatment. Your esteemed organization upholds the principle of saving people, and I do not wish to express thanks, but I have received undeserved benefits, and my heart is filled with trepidation, which cannot be expressed in words. I am hereby offering my accumulated savings of ninety-five yuan to be used as medical aid funds. This small amount is not enough to repay even a tenth of the aid I have received, but it represents a sincere heart, to ease my conscience. Furthermore, Dr. Song Guobin's careful treatment has revived me from a serious illness, and his kindness is like being reborn."

### Continued Condolences for Su Yizhi from All Sectors

Regarding the case of Ms. Su Yizhi, a teacher at the Sacred Heart Elementary School on Pingliang Road, who was beaten to death by Liu Wangshi, a parent of a student, letters continue to arrive from all sectors expressing indignation. They believe that Liu Wangshi relied on her power to bully others and beat them to death, making her a social outcast. They demand that the authorities conduct a thorough and impartial investigation to redress the injustice and appease public anger. Yesterday, we received donations of one hundred yuan from Mr. Wang Zhengding of China Pharmaceutical Company, thirty yuan from all faculty and staff of the Shanghai Municipal Jiwang Elementary School, and ten yuan from Chengquan Company, which will all be forwarded to the family of the deceased.

### Wuguang Drama Society Performance

The Wuguang Drama Society, organized by students of Wuguang Girls' High School at 210 Gordon Road, was established three years ago and performed once at the Lapei Theatre the year before last. This time, to raise tuition loans for poor students, they will perform two plays at the Russian Theatre on Foch Road on June 8th. The plays are "Ward No. 5," "Dragon Boat Festival," and "Mother Returns."

### Senior Welfare Forum (4)

(4) Mr. Zhu Juefo shared his views on the words "emotion" and "reason" from the perspectives of young people and old people. Finally, he said that Zeng Wenzhenggong once said: The first requirement for those in high positions is to know people and be aware of things. Zhang Liang of the Han Dynasty said: Only by knowing people can one accomplish things. Therefore, today's Jiangxue Society specializes in human affairs and the art of mind reading. The loyalty, treachery, goodness, and evil of all people can be identified through techniques. If there are heroes who study and work, it must start today. As you sow, so shall you reap. Today is the day of sowing melons.

(5) Mr. Zhu Xianrui, who recently came to Shanghai from North China, reported on the disaster situation in North China, where the lives of the elderly are particularly painful and urgently need relief. Finally, the chairman stood up and made a conclusion, roughly stating:

Today, I am very grateful to all the elderly gentlemen who came to attend this forum despite their busy schedules and shared many profound insights. People in our country have a misconception that once they pass the age of forty or fifty, they are old and useless. In fact, after forty, life is at a time when experience is rich and work efficiency is increasing, making it a great time for doing things, and the golden age for entrepreneurs, politicians, and scientists. Therefore, foreigners have a saying: "Life begins at forty," which means that a career only begins at forty. Our country also has the saying "Old but vigorous." The three elders of Shanghai Lankang Li are all old, but they are leading young people and benefiting society, not diminishing their ambitions because of age, which is commendable and worthy of being a model for the general public. In addition to launching the 100,000 yuan senior aid campaign, this newspaper hopes that there will be an organization for the elders of Shanghai to ensure that the spirit of benefiting the elderly will last forever, and to serve as a driving force for expanding the movement to help and care for the elderly in the future.

After the speech, all those present jointly congratulated the two elders, Shen Xinqing and Gao Fengchi, on their eightieth birthdays, and resolved to initiate the organization of a Senior Association. The mailing address is the Confucius Society, and Zhu Juefo, Sha Pengyuan, Zhao Ximing, and Sun Houzai were elected as preparatory committee members. It was also decided to hold the first preparatory meeting on June 6. (Jia Shui) (The End)
