### "Riding in the Same Boat, Working Together Closely"

General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, delivered a radio address to the people in the Japanese homeland from Nanjing on the evening of the second, expressing his determination to complete the war. He said, "I firmly believe that China and Japan, riding in the same boat and working closely together, will one day be able to revive Asia and become the center of Asia." However, he also stated, "It is quite difficult to quickly restore the relationship between China and Japan to its original state, as there are still many obstacles ahead. This is something that both China and Japan should be aware of, and it requires further joint efforts from both nations in the future." (See today's Japanese newspaper dispatches.) We share the same confidence as General Hata in the ultimate victory of Sino-Japanese cooperation, and we deeply sympathize with the "difficulty" in "quickly restoring the original state" of the relationship between China and Japan due to "many obstacles ahead." Therefore, we wholeheartedly resonate with General Hata's call for awareness from both China and Japan. Thus, at the beginning of this thirty-second year of the Republic of China, we wish to offer sincere advice to both the government and the public of China and Japan:

We firmly believe that the journey of the thirty-second year is a path to the victory of the Greater East Asia War, which is also the successful liberation of the East Asian peoples. The future is bright. However, this journey is by no means a broad avenue; it is winding and rugged. Moreover, on this path, there are venomous snakes, fierce beasts, violent winds, and heavy rains waiting for us. Only through continuous hard work can we achieve the common goals of victory and success. Therefore, on this day of the beginning of the year, we want to point out to everyone that the thirty-second year of the Republic of China requires every son and daughter of the East Asian nations to rise up, be emotional and tense, and shoulder the significant mission entrusted to us by the new era!

In order to shoulder the mission of the new era, and to strive for future victory and success, we must concentrate the strength of all East Asian nations, especially the people of the two great nations of China and Japan! The forces that determine the future destiny of the East Asian nations must advance through genuine and close cooperation. However, in order to more fully exert the force of solidarity and cooperation between these two great nations, it is necessary to, as General Hata said, "restore the original state of China and Japan," and the main thing is to eliminate the obstacles that have accumulated between these two great nations over the years. What are these obstacles? They are the contradictions and conflicts that have been created between the two great nations in the past decade or so under the instigation of Britain and the United States, from spiritual to material contradictions and conflicts, as well as the suspicion and hatred between the two great nations caused by these contradictions and conflicts. It is precisely because of the accumulated contradictions and conflicts, suspicion and hatred, that the burden of pain on the shoulders of every citizen of the two great nations of China and Japan has been increased, and the struggle of the two great nations of China and Japan for close cooperation to win the victory of the liberation of the East Asian nations has been hindered. Therefore, in order to achieve the complete victory of the Greater East Asia War today, it is necessary to "quickly restore the original state of China and Japan," and it is necessary to eliminate the obstacles to cooperation between the two great nations of China and Japan, fundamentally reduce the opportunity for Britain and the United States to sow discord, and to achieve this, first of all, both China and Japan must have a full understanding, have the spirit of "riding in the same boat and working closely together," and have the spirit of "not dwelling on the past."

First of all, we can frankly point out that in the past, China and Japan were not unaware of the necessity for both sides to "ride in the same boat and work closely together," but the reason why it is still "quite difficult" today, as General Hata said, is mainly because we have to ask, who were the people who "rode in the same boat" and "cooperated" with China in the past? This is very important! If those who "ride in the same boat" are only a political party in China, and even more so if they are only collaborating with Chinese bureaucratic politicians, local tyrants, and evil gentry, then the closer the cooperation, the more "difficult" it will be to restore the original state of the two nations of China and Japan! Because the darkness and corruption of Chinese politics in recent years, the withering and haggardness of the people's livelihood, and the decline and lack of vigor of the national fortune, are caused by the shamelessness and self-seeking of politicians, bureaucrats, local tyrants, and evil gentry, etc. If Japan "rides in the same boat" and "cooperates" only with those elements, then the result will only increase the misfortune of the two nations of China and Japan! There is no doubt that Japan in the past had a great desire to seek out those in China who could truly "ride in the same boat" and cooperate. If the object of the so-called "riding in the same boat and working closely together" is not the majority of the Chinese people, the just leaders of society, and the honest entrepreneurs, then the louder the slogan is shouted, the further the result will be from the reality of "cooperation," and it may even lead to more unfortunate consequences. Therefore, we hope that the Japanese authorities will consider and examine this, and further conduct "cooperation" with the broad masses of the Chinese people, as well as with just people or honest entrepreneurs among the Chinese people. That is the true and effective "cooperation," that can "quickly restore the original state of China and Japan," and that can truly help the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

Secondly, we want to point out that the "riding in the same boat and working closely together" between China and Japan also lies in the Japanese authorities strengthening the cooperative relationship between the Chinese and Japanese military and civilians under the principle of "not dwelling on the past." In the future, when dealing with the Chinese people, no matter what,

Adhering to the principle of "not dwelling on the past" and treating every Chinese person with the feelings and attitude of a friendly country and an ally is the only way to gradually restore the original state of harmonious coexistence between the two great nations of China and Japan, and then achieve mutual support and cooperation, and advance towards the path of victory. Of course, it is not easy to do this, because there are barriers in language, culture, customs, and habits. However, some things can still be done immediately; for example, in the negative aspect, for general unimportant political prisoners, under the principle of "not dwelling on the past," a lenient conclusion should be reached as soon as possible. On the positive side, we sincerely hope that the general friendly people in China, whether in government, military, business, or civilian life, will all recognize that China and Japan are now allies, and are fraternal countries. Everyone has a close relationship of sharing joys and sorrows and living and dying together, and they must no longer harbor the illusion that "no Chinese person does not resist Japan." Even if they discover that the Chinese people have made mistakes, they must not regard it as a major event, but should deal with it with the heart of being anxious and unbearable when hearing of a brother's fault, and mutual encouragement and admonition should be the first priority. It must be known that mutual understanding and trust between the Chinese and Japanese military and civilians is the true foundation of cooperation between the two sides.

Naturally, "riding in the same boat and working closely together" can absolutely not unilaterally hope for the awareness and efforts of the Japanese government and the public. At the same time, it is also necessary to ask the Chinese compatriots to be aware and make efforts, and to get along with friendly countries and their people with the same spirit of "not dwelling on the past." For example, the history of China and Japan began with the Greater East Asia War, opening up a new page in history. Let all the past be like yesterday's death, and let all the future be like today's birth. On the one hand, we expect Japan to show in practice how it cares about the liberation of the Chinese nation and how it strives for this noble goal; on the other hand, we ourselves must, under the principle of "not dwelling on the past," first cooperate with friendly countries in the work of liberating the East Asian nations.

We deeply believe that only if the governments and the public of Japan and China "ride in the same boat and work closely together," and only if they "ride in the same boat and work closely together" under the principle of "not dwelling on the past," can they eliminate the past contradictions and conflicts, suspicions and hatred, can they "quickly restore the original state of China and Japan," concentrate all the strength of the two great nations, embark on this year's journey, and shoulder the mission of the era!

### Southwest Pacific Front: Great War Results of the Japanese Air Force: Repulsing American Aircraft Attacking Narukami Island: Announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters Yesterday

Tokyo, 4th, Domei News Agency: This afternoon at 2 p.m., the Japanese General Headquarters announced the war results of the Japanese Air Force in the Aleutian Islands' Narukami Island and the Southwest Pacific area from December 30 to January 2 as follows: "The Japanese Navy Air Force fiercely attacked Merauke in the sea near New Guinea from December 30 to 31, destroying the enemy air force base under construction there, rendering it useless. The Japanese Navy Air Force stationed in New Britain Island and the Solomon Islands repulsed 90 enemy aircraft attacking Munda, Seeme, and Rabaul from December 30 to January 2. When enemy aircraft attacked Munda on January 2, 6 of the more than 30 enemy aircraft were shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft guns (21 unconfirmed). During the air combat near Narukami Island from December 30 to January 1, Japanese aircraft shot down 5 enemy aircraft. During the same period, the Japanese anti-aircraft gun team shot down one B-35 enemy aircraft.

Tokyo, 4th, Domei News Agency: The so-called general counterattack against Japan by the United States in 1943 has repeatedly launched air battles on the northern and southern fronts, but in the end, they were all repulsed because the Japanese army defended and attacked properly. On the 4th, the Japanese General Headquarters announced that the Japanese Navy Air Force had initially bombed Merauke in the southern part of New Guinea Island, and repulsed enemy aircraft attacking the Solomon Islands and New Britain Island. At the same time, the Japanese Navy on Narukami Island was also quite active. The so-called counterattack by the United States is turning warships into air battles, which is becoming increasingly obvious. The war results of the Japanese army's northern and southern operations before and after the New Year are recorded as follows: (1) New Guinea Island: Since the beginning of the year, the enemy has secretly established an air force base for the counterattack against Japan on the west bank of Thursday Island in the southern part of New Guinea Island. After being detected by the Japanese Navy Air Force in New Guinea Island, they launched two air raids on the 30th and 31st of the year, rendering the base unusable. (2) Solomon Islands and New Britain Island: The important locations occupied by the Japanese army in this area, Rabaul, Munda, Seeme, etc., have been attacked by enemy aircraft as many as 50 times from the 31st to January 2, and each time they have been repulsed by the Japanese army and suffered heavy damage. At dawn on the 2nd, the enemy used B-2 type seaplane bombers and 6 fighter planes each to form a large team and launch a large-scale attack. After being fiercely bombarded by Japanese ground artillery, one enemy seaplane bomber and one fighter plane (unconfirmed) were shot down, and the rest fled. Subsequently, 6 B-25 type planes, 4 seaplane bombers, and 4 fighter planes, a total of 14 planes, attacked. The Japanese army launched two fierce attacks with ground artillery, resulting in the shooting down of 2 seaplane bombers (one unconfirmed) and 2 P-25 type fighter planes. The other enemy aircraft had no choice but to flee in panic. (3) Aleutian Islands: The Japanese Navy Air Force on Narukami Island braved the winter's fierce winds and heavy snows and engaged in fierce battles with the attacking enemy fighters from the 30th to January 1. A total of 30 aircraft were attacked on the 30th, with the Japanese shooting down 2 aircraft and the ground artillery shooting down 1 aircraft. From November 1 to December 29 of last year, the enemy aircraft that attacked the Japanese army base in the Aleutian Islands totaled 99, with as many as 5 attacks, but each time they were repulsed by the Japanese army.

### Broadcast Speech by General Hata: Restore the Original State of China and Japan; Make Further Joint Efforts

Nanjing, 3rd, Central News Agency: General Shunroku Hata, Commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, delivered a radio address to his fellow countrymen in Japan on the evening of the 2nd, with the theme of welcoming the New Year. He expressed his determination to complete the war, saying that the Expeditionary Army had spent the past year destroying the Chongqing war effort while fully ensuring the security of the peaceful areas. However, the hardship of the soldiers was not only in completing difficult combat missions, but also in constantly destroying and preventing the stubborn guerrilla warfare or the special operations of the Yu army, in order to ensure the security and stability of the people. The contribution to Sino-Japanese friendship was undoubtedly not small. In addition, they also assisted in various constructions in China, and at the same time, they dealt with the various peculiarities of the mainland front with great care and effort. In order to complete the important task, all of our soldiers have been working tirelessly day and night, in order to improve their training. Today, the morale of the soldiers is getting stronger and stronger, and they are ready to meet the war in the coming days with the confidence of victory. At present, in addition to striving to strengthen the final battle system, we are also making every effort to eliminate the forces of Britain and the United States and maintain the front line, so as to wait for the world war to end with a favorable international position. With this, we are tied to the one hope of fighting the war to the end. However, if the Yu side lacks righteousness and wants to take advantage of the war between other countries to reap the benefits, and carries out a war with no ideals, it will never bring about the independence of the country and the happiness of the nation. This can be understood by reading the history of the world. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government and its people, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, in order to implement the Greater Asianism, have cooperated with Japan in the spirit of living and dying together, overcoming all difficulties and cooperating in the Greater East Asia War. I am deeply moved by this firm determination and great effort. At the same time, I firmly believe that China and Japan will ride in the same boat and work closely together, and one day be able to revive Asia and become the center of Asia. However, it is quite difficult to quickly restore the relationship between China and Japan to its original state, as there are still many obstacles ahead. This is something that both China and Japan should be aware of, and it requires further joint efforts from both nations in the future. The soldiers of our Expeditionary Army, who are located on the Chinese mainland front, the only decisive battlefield of the Greater East Asia War, deeply feel the importance of the task. However, we are determined to follow the Emperor's will, inherit the legacy of the hundreds of thousands of heroes, and strive for the final victory, in order to repay the enthusiasm of the hundreds of millions of compatriots at home.

### Japanese Ambassador to Thailand Returns Home to Report on His Work

Fukuoka, 3rd, Domei News Agency: Mr. Tsurbogami, the Japanese ambassador to Thailand, arrived here from Bangkok by plane at 4 p.m. today, and immediately took a train to Tokyo to report on his work. This is the first time that Ambassador Tsurbogami has returned home in seven months, and his mission must be important. After arriving in Tokyo, he often met with Mr. Aoki, the Minister of Greater East Asia, and Mr. Tani, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and may have to meet with Prime Minister Tojo.

### US War Expenditure for the Past Year

Exceeds 560 Billion Yuan

Argentina, 4th, Domei News Agency: According to a dispatch from Washington, the US Treasury Department announced yesterday that the total amount of US war expenditure in the first year of the war reached more than 560.8 billion, which is four times the amount of war expenditure when the United States participated in the First World War (1917).

### The Last Days of British Rule in India - Translated from the Osaka Mainichi Newspaper, December 24, Year 31

Rangoon Dispatch

In the past centuries, Britain has always adopted the so-called "divide and rule policy" towards the people of its colonies, causing them to quarrel with each other, and Britain has taken the opportunity to exploit, intimidate, and lure them, using all means. However, today, this inhumane policy has made Britain suffer the consequences. The most obvious fact is the recent chaos in India.

Britain Suffers the Consequences of Its Evil Policies

The opposition between the National Congress Party and the Muslim League, as well as the disintegration among dozens of small parties, are all sprouts of the seeds that Britain has sown in the past in order to exploit India. In the past six months, the nationwide disturbances led by the National Congress Party have spread like wildfire, and no less than thousands of police officers have been killed or injured. In particular, the losses from the destruction of railways, communication facilities, and other things are difficult to estimate. Britain, with Gandhi at the helm, began to arrest a large number of leaders of the National Congress Party, sometimes adopting repressive policies and sometimes adopting appeasement policies, but the British atmosphere, which has permeated the entire India, cannot be extinguished by the dying power of the British Empire.

An Agricultural Country Actually Suffers a Famine

As a result of this social chaos, a food problem has arisen.

That India, an agricultural country, would actually have a food problem is something that the British could never have imagined before the war. However, the facts are unforgiving. Transportation obstacles have caused the stagnation of goods, and the resistance of workers has greatly reduced production. As a result, the lives of the masses have fallen into the extreme bottom of hell. At present, the wartime storage of food and the increase in the production of general food have become urgent tasks. The authorities have had to jump up and launch a "drop in the bucket" style production increase campaign.

While ruling India, faced with such a major reef, the Governor-General of Linlithgow, who had been decided to be replaced, had to stay in office temporarily. At the same time, the traditional policy of division had to be somewhat revised. Linlithgow said in Calcutta on the 17th:

"Britain cannot recognize a government composed solely of Indians until the various parties reach the same experience. At present, it is very important for the various parties to cooperate in assisting the formation of a national government. As it stands now, it is not clear who is guiding the national government. Once this point is clarified, Britain can recognize the existence of the national government."

In the past, the condition for Britain to allow India to be independent was to wait for the end of the war; now it is different, the unification of India has become a prerequisite. Breaking away from the traditional policy of division and turning to unity within India, wanting to use the power of this unity to maintain the rule over India at the critical moment; this is another expression of British cunning. We are not entirely clear what tricks Britain is going to play, but the revision of the traditional policy shows the fading glory of the British Empire, which is an undeniable fact.

The Number of Casualties Reaches 5,400

As the conclusion of this dispatch, I would like to report the number of casualties of the masses and police officers since Gandhi's arrest on August 8 as follows:

The number of the general public arrested was 3,500, the number of injured was 2,500, and the number of dead was 1,750. The number of police officers injured was 300, and the number of dead was 750. The number of soldiers injured was 50, and the number of dead was 70. The loss of property is countless. 170 police stations were destroyed, 150 police stations were burned down, and 175 government buildings were set on fire. (Jun Fan)

### Tunisian Front: The Axis Forces Change from Defensive to Offensive; Advancing Towards the Algerian Border; The US 1st Tank Division Joins the Battle

The team has already engaged in fierce battles. After the Axis forces occupied the city of Mejez el Bab, they continued to suppress the enemy forces and advance forward, reaching the vicinity of Pont du Fahs, about 40 kilometers southwest of the city, and continued to attack westward. Also, on the Mediterranean coast west of Sfax, the Axis forces suddenly changed from defensive to offensive on the 2nd, forcing the anti-Axis forces to retreat to the area along the Algerian border. In addition, the Axis Air Force was also very active, dispatching a large number of aircraft on the 3rd to bomb the anti-Axis airfields and railway transportation facilities in the plains along the Algerian border. Also, the Junkers 87 type bomber squadron of the German Air Force raided the anti-Axis supply base in Bouna Port twice day and night, dropping bombs like rain. The port facilities and military depots, ammunition depots, etc. all caught fire and burned, suffering heavy damage, and three 12,000-ton large transport ships anchored in the port were sunk. At that time, the German fighter planes engaged in fierce air battles with the anti-Axis Air Force, shooting down 15 enemy aircraft.

Berlin, 4th, Havas News Agency: Since the New Year, the battles in Tunisia have become more and more fierce. The British and American troops in North Africa seem to have received reinforcements. It is understood that the US 1st Tank Division has now joined the British and American forces fighting in North Africa. The Axis forces continue to advance in all directions along the Algerian border, forcing the British and American troops to retreat. The British tank cars advancing northeast of Mejez el Bab were immediately defeated by German artillery fire.

Berlin, 3rd, Havas News Agency: According to information obtained here last night from the North African front, the German and Italian reconnaissance teams recently observed that General Montgomery had signs of launching a large-scale attack on the German and Italian tank positions. The situation in Libya remains unchanged. The activities of the British Air Force have increased. General Montgomery has also transferred to the 1st Tank Division of the British Army. In the air battle yesterday, the British lost three planes and the Germans suffered no losses. German dive bombers and fighter squadrons attacked the advancing troops of the British Eighth Army on the coastal highway on Friday, destroying several British armored vehicles.

### Kalmyk Steppe: German-Soviet Tank War; Germany Admits to Abandoning the City of Elista; Fierce Battle for Velikiye Luki

Berlin, 3rd, Domei News Agency: According to German sources, the German troops fighting in the Kalmyk Steppe (south of Stalingrad) destroyed all military facilities in Elista, the capital of the area, and then safely withdrew.

Berlin, 3rd, Havas News Agency: Well-informed sources here said that the German motorized troops encircled the Soviet troops near Elista in the Kalmyk Steppe and defeated the Soviet troops in fierce battles. These Soviet troops included those who had rushed to the front line.

Lisbon, 3rd, Domei News Agency: According to front-line reports received here, the German and Soviet troops on the Eastern Front engaged in fierce battles on the morning of the 2nd near Tsimlyansk, a key point on the left bank of the Don River, 180 kilometers southeast of Rostov. It is reported that the Soviet troops have advanced to the two river ports of Tshekovskaya and Bakulanovsky, but this has not yet been confirmed. In addition, fierce battles on a large scale have also broken out between the two sides in the southern area of Nalchik on the Caucasus Front. At present, the war has gradually shifted from Chikola to the area on the east bank of the Tereke River.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 3rd, Havas News Agency: The situation on the Eastern Front has been very active recently, and the following is a summary: (1) The areas southeast of Lake Ilmen, Toropets, Velikiye Luki, and Veliye are now the focus of the war, and the battles are extremely fierce. Regarding the situation on this line, the news from both sides is contradictory. According to the Soviet side, the city of Velikiye Luki has been captured by the Soviet army. Although the German side admits that the Soviet army has advanced to the suburbs of the city, it firmly denies that the German army has withdrawn from the city. (2) The Rzhev Front, which has been fought several times in the past, has now become relatively calm. (3) On the southern route, the Soviet army had previously claimed that its target was Rostov. Once this city falls, the German army in Stalingrad will be isolated, and the communication lines of the German army on the Caucasus Front will gradually be cut off. However, in reality, Rostov has not yet been threatened. According to recent Soviet news, the Red Army's offensive may target a certain point east of Rostov. From this, it can be seen that the Red Army has encountered a strong defense line and has to change the direction of its attack. (4) In Stalingrad, the German army still controls 22 of the 26 districts in the city. The Soviet troops who are fighting in the industrial area have recently improved their position, because the Volga River has frozen, and the Soviet troops in the city have established contact with the Soviet troops on the left bank. Fierce battles are still taking place in the rubble of the city. (5) Kalmyk Steppe: After the German army withdrew from the provincial capital of Elista, it began to reorganize its positions. The German army has built strong fortifications not far west of the provincial capital, running from north to south. Elista has only 9,000 residents. (6) Fierce battles are still raging in the area of the Tereke River. (7) The Soviet army near Novorossiysk is still continuing to launch small-scale offensives. (8) The weather north of the Caucasus is extremely cold, and the temperature has dropped to minus 40 degrees Celsius in some places, so the war has been affected. The climate in the Soviet Union is coldest in January every year, so this situation will continue for some time. However, the weather this winter is not as cold as last year.

### Pantelleria Island: German Reinforcements; Sicily Airfield Bombed

A Havas news dispatch from the Swiss capital reports from Rome: Several German detachments, transported on two giant transport ships, landed on the Italian-controlled island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean on December 25th of last year. These German troops came from the port of Marsala in Sicily, fully armed. At the same time, multiple German aircraft also flew to Pantelleria to reinforce the island. Pantelleria, located in the central Mediterranean, south of the "bottleneck area," is a crucial military point. The distance from Cape Bon in Tunisia to the port of Marsala in Sicily is only about ninety miles, making the situation particularly perilous. In recent years, Italian military authorities have built defensive fortifications on the island, making it one of the Axis powers' strongest fortifications in the Mediterranean. Furthermore, various circles in Germany believe that the arrival of German troops stationed on Pantelleria is a manifestation of the Axis countries' shared fate. German troops are now stationed on the Italian front lines, and Italian troops are also assisting in battles elsewhere, especially on the Eastern Front.

A Huitong News dispatch from the Swedish capital on the 3rd reports: According to this morning's publication of "Kai Za," Allied air forces bombed the city of Palermo in Sicily and the Heraklion airfield on the island of Crete on Friday night.

### Naval Battle in the Arctic Ocean

A Havas news dispatch from the Swiss capital on the 3rd reports from London: The British Admiralty announced today that a major naval battle took place in the Arctic Ocean a few days ago, but details were not released.

An Allied News dispatch from Berlin on the 3rd reports, according to German military sources: German naval forces, while attacking an enemy convoy in the Arctic Ocean waters, engaged in fierce combat with the enemy escort fleet, sinking one enemy destroyer and damaging several cruisers. In addition, four enemy transport ships were also sunk by torpedoes.

### British Warship Losses in Four Years

A Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon on the 4th reports from London: The British Admiralty announced on the 3rd that since the outbreak of World War II until the end of December 1942, the losses of the British fleet over the past four years are as follows: 5 battleships, 5 aircraft carriers, 25 cruisers, 98 destroyers, 50 submarines, 35 patrol ships, 18 minelayers and minesweepers, 6 river gunboats, 17 armed merchant cruisers, 2 auxiliary aircraft carriers, and 245 auxiliary vessels.

### Improved Relations Between Germany and Turkey; Turkish Ambassador to Germany Returns to Post

A Havas news dispatch from the Turkish capital on the 3rd reports: The Turkish Ambassador to Germany departed from Istanbul today to return to his post. At the same time, the German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, has also returned to this [Turkish] city, indicating that relations between Germany and Turkey have improved. Before leaving the country, the Turkish Ambassador told reporters from "Cumhuriyet" that relations between Germany and Turkey were quite sincere, and economic relations between the two countries were also strengthening. It is widely believed that the ambassadors of both countries, before returning to their posts, will make separate preparations to implement the economic agreement signed by both parties in June of this year as soon as possible. According to this agreement, Turkey will exchange raw materials for German military equipment.

### Germany Refreshes Diplomatic Ranks: Stahmer Appointed Ambassador to Japan; German-Japanese Relations Will Likely Become Closer; Changes in Envoys to Spain and Sweden Are Also Significant

An Allied News dispatch from Berlin on the 300th [date unclear] reports: The German government has recently decided to reshuffle some of its ambassadors abroad to refresh its diplomatic ranks. According to a statement issued by the German Foreign Ministry on the 2nd: The current Ambassador to Japan, Wöhlert, the Ambassador to Spain, Stohrer, and the Ambassador to Sweden, Weitershausen, are being transferred to the Foreign Ministry and will be assigned to other positions. The current Ambassador to Nanjing, Stahmer, is appointed as Ambassador to Japan. The position of Ambassador to China remains vacant, and will be temporarily represented by the current Chargé d'affaires in Japan, Kalt, until a formal decision is made. Furthermore, a senior official from the Foreign Ministry, Mörke, is appointed as Ambassador to Spain, and the former Chargé d'affaires to the United States, Thomsen, is appointed as the new Ambassador to Sweden.

A Huitong News dispatch from Berlin on the 3rd reports: The newly appointed German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, is known for facilitating the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy. Stahmer went to Tokyo in 1940 for negotiations, which lasted two months, and the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy was officially established in November of that year. Stahmer is extremely familiar with the situation in South America. After the last World War, he personally traveled to South America. In 1934, he assisted Ribbentrop in handling affairs and then served as Ribbentrop's consultant on South American affairs.

A Huitong News dispatch from Berlin on the 3rd reports: Political figures here commented on the renewal of diplomats, saying that from the standpoint of international policy, the positions of Ambassador to Japan and Ambassador to Spain are the most important in this reshuffle of diplomats. Stahmer has now been reassigned to the position of Ambassador to Japan. Stahmer has resided in East Asia for a long time and has served as Ambassador to Nanjing, so he must have a detailed understanding of Sino-Japanese relations, which are important issues in the Greater East Asia sphere. The position of German Ambassador to Japan has now been handed over by a military man to a diplomat. From now on, German-Japanese diplomatic relations will become even closer. Mörke is a capable diplomat who is now appointed as Ambassador to Spain at a time when Anglo-American forces are invading North Africa and Spain's national team is in an important political position. This is of great significance. The Anglo-Americans are using Sweden to engage in anti-German propaganda, which is extremely active. Thomsen's appointment as Minister to Sweden is also a noteworthy event.

### Advisor Ishiwatari Returns to Nanjing After Completing Official Duties

An Allied News dispatch from Tokyo on the 4th reports: Ishiwatari, the former Japanese Minister of Finance and current economic advisor to the National Government in Nanjing, returned to Japan on December 20th to consult with government authorities on important official matters. Having completed his duties, he departed for his post in Nanjing this morning.

### Gu Weijun Goes to India; Rumored to Go to England

An Allied News dispatch from Lisbon on the 4th reports: It is rumored that Gu Weijun has gone to India with the British parliamentary delegation visiting Chongqing and will also visit London. According to a dispatch from London, since the closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road, British and American material assistance to Chongqing has been cut off. Therefore, they have repeatedly made requests to the British and American governments. The British parliamentary delegation has already witnessed the plight of Chongqing, and it is expected that the British government will conduct negotiations with Chongqing based on the delegation's report.

### Wang Yunwu Arrives in Kunming

A special dispatch from Macau on the 2nd reports: Mr. Wang Yunwu, after taking office as the Deputy Director of the Yunnan-Guizhou Regional Office of the Chongqing Council for Economic Mobilization, arrived in Kunming by plane on the afternoon of the 1st to discuss the establishment of an office.

### Japanese Troops Occupy Lihuang and Macheng; Ganzhou and Yong'an Bombed by Japanese Aircraft; Airfields and Military Facilities Destroyed

A Central News Agency dispatch from Kaifeng on the 4th reports: Since last year, in order to completely crush the combat power of Chongqing's Fifth War Area, Japanese troops have continued to launch fierce attacks on the basic base of Chongqing's 21st Army Group. On the afternoon of the 1st, they completely occupied the county seat of Lihuang, where the headquarters of the army group is located.

A Central News Agency dispatch from Hankou on the 2nd reports: After the Japanese army completed their mopping-up operations in the vicinity of the strategic point of Luotian, they again launched a fierce northward attack with a portion of their troops. On December 30th of last year, they completely occupied Macheng, the stronghold of Chongqing's Provisional 51st Division, located twelve kilometers northwest of Luocheng.

A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 3rd reports: The Press Department of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China announced at 2:25 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd that on New Year's Day, our army's air squadron, with a joint large formation of fighters and bombers, launched a surprise attack on Ganzhou (southern Jiangxi Province), destroying the airfield and military facilities in the area, as well as the military supply warehouses on the opposite bank of Ganzhou, inflicting heavy damage. The entire air squadron safely returned to their original defenses.

A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 3rd reports: The Press Department of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China announced at 11:10 AM on the morning of the 3rd that on January 2nd, our army's air force, with a joint formation of fighter-bombers, launched a large-scale air raid on Yong'an (200 kilometers west of Fuzhou), fiercely bombing the Chongqing army's fuel and ammunition warehouses and various military factories in the city, all of which caught fire. All of our aircraft returned safely.

### German Official Criticizes the U.S. White Paper

A Huitong News dispatch from Berlin on the 4th reports: Persons close to the Foreign Ministry here commented that the U.S. White Paper, which discusses the events before the U.S. entry into the war, contains various archives that make it difficult for Roosevelt to defend to his own people his policy of involving the U.S. in the war. Roosevelt's release of the White Paper three days before the convening of Congress also reveals his motives. Upon closer examination of the content, it can be seen that his motive is to conceal Roosevelt's war policies, but even when examining U.S. foreign policy from 1931 to 1941, it fails to completely conceal his ugliness. The book is actually a U.S. propaganda document. Roosevelt's selection of facts from U.S. foreign policy in the past decade in an attempt to conceal his war policies only reveals his clumsiness. It should be known that Roosevelt's policies not only sacrifice the U.S., but also seek to make all mankind suffer. Such policies cannot create what Hull referred to in the preface to the White Paper, "promoting world peace and world order," which is self-evident.

A Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon on the 4th reports from Washington: The U.S. Department of State issued a White Paper on the 3rd entitled "War and Peace," with a full text of 60,000 words, recounting the various public and secret international diplomatic processes of the U.S. government during the ten years from 1931 to 1941, especially regarding the relationship between Japan and the United States. The White Paper admits that the U.S. government recognized at the end of November of the previous year that the negotiations between Japan and the United States had broken down. Therefore, it can also prove that the U.S. first notified the British government to prepare for war, which is indeed the case.

### U.S. Congress to Debate Six Major Policies

A Central News Agency dispatch from the capital of Argentina on the 4th reports: The 78th U.S. Congress will convene on the 6th. President Roosevelt is scheduled to submit a message to Congress as usual at the opening, clarifying the government's policies in the entire U.S. war policy. It is expected that there will be considerable turbulence at that time, and the following points will be the focus of debate in the new Congress: (1) the issue of war expenditure, (2) the issue of trade system and tariff regulations, (3) the Lend-Lease Act and the expenses related to the Lend-Lease Act, (4) the issue of Puerto Rico, (5) the issue of post-war reconstruction, and (6) the issue of the reorganization of wartime agencies.

### Small Scenes of Calcutta: A Dispatch from Calcutta Relayed from Macau

The unending layers of cloud-shrouded mountain peaks recede, and the vista unfolding before your eyes is a vast wilderness. Silver ribbon-like rivers quietly shimmer with dazzling light, and dense green forests extend tightly to the horizon, disappearing into the sea of clouds. The fuselage gradually descends, and approaching is a cluster of silver frames—the waves of the sea of clouds. There are no more dark or deep blue—that is, ridges covered with forests or bald peaks. The climate suddenly becomes hot, and in the clear sunlight, villages and houses can be clearly seen in the forests and grasslands. Red tile roofs, grass meadows like carpets, and silver ribbon-like rivers are covered by a clear blue sky and pure white clouds. This scenery is too beautiful and familiar, and it is often seen in Southeast Asia.

During the flight from Assam to Calcutta, overlooking the broad surface of the Brahmaputra River and its expansion to the vicinity of the banks, it seems to be a shallow muddy area.

Arriving in Calcutta, it was drizzling, and dusk was approaching, with moist and fresh air. On the car seat driving towards the city, looking at the scenery near Calcutta, under the Bodhi tree, the lush greenery provides shade, and the crows returning late chirp, with black wings in groups. This picture of the outskirts at dusk in both seasons, except for the lack of brilliant golden pagodas, makes one feel as if one is in Burma.

Calcutta is a famous big city in the East, with a large population and magnificent architecture. What catches the eye are the shuttling pedestrians and the vehicles in procession. The war does not seem to have changed its prosperous appearance. In the series of fast-moving car rows, many vehicles have been converted to charcoal gas furnaces. The wartime control of gasoline makes it impossible for even the most modern cars to retain their original appearance, and they have to carry such a bulging, silver-gray burden on the back.

At night, Calcutta has a different scene under the lights. Street lights are dimmed, the lights of vehicles are covered with a layer of shielding, and the lights of shops are all blocked indoors. The appearance of the city is covered with a dim and mysterious veil, but the hustle and bustle and activities of the city do not decrease as a result. Nightlife is as active as usual, and the city's noise symbolizes that the city's pulse is still beating continuously.

All the sensory pleasures of the city are not lacking here. Theaters and dance halls are crowded with guests, flowing in and out: the orchestras of big hotels play songs, treating tourists to a good dinner. But in the singing and dancing, even if you intend to forget reality, the ruthless reality is facing you all the time. The theater's announcement in large letters clearly indicates how the audience should act if the air raid alarm rings. Triangular signs lie on the hotel counters (and can be seen in other places), stating "Do not talk about military secrets." If you open the day's newspaper, then in the nearby or more distant places, the commotions are rising and falling one after another.

Here, limited to the reporter's narrow vision, the urban area is generally quiet. Although the walls of large buildings still clearly leave painted slogans: "Quit India." (According to today's newspaper, Gandhi's "Quit India" book has been banned). In a chance discovery, at the meeting place of the Bengal Provincial Congress Provincial Branch, the red, white, and green tricolor flag is still flying on the drying platform, and the windows are all tightly closed. (Shi Yi, September 23)

### The Municipal Government Extends the Winter Relief Campaign for the 31st Year; The Relief Fund is Expected to be 2 Million Yuan

The Shanghai Special Municipality will extend the winter relief campaign for the 31st year. Under the leadership of Mayor Chen Gongbo, together with prominent figures in the city, preparations are actively underway, and good progress has been made. A Fundraising Committee for Winter Relief Funds has been organized to carry out the work. The details are recorded as follows:

Expanding the Winter Relief and Disaster Relief Efforts

The municipal government believes that winter relief in this city has always been based on finding ways to provide relief. Although it has been held many times, it has not been possible to provide universal relief due to limited funds. In the past few years, a large number of poor people in this city have suffered from freezing and starvation. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, all ethnic groups in the Co-Prosperity Sphere have become more harmonious and united. Based on the standpoint of relieving one's own hunger and drowning, deep sympathy should be expressed to the millions of hungry and cold people in this city with a spirit of shared suffering and provide them with rescue. Therefore, it was decided to expand the scope of the winter relief campaign in the 31st year. In addition to the allocation of a portion of funds from the municipal treasury, the remaining funds will be raised by the Fundraising Committee for Winter Relief Funds from all sectors of the city.

Defining the Scope and Handling Agencies

The scope of the 31st winter relief campaign was expanded and the plan was defined by the municipal government as follows: (1) Relief areas: (A) Direct relief areas include the six districts of Nanshi, Husi, Hubei, the city center, Pudong South, and Pudong North; (B) Auxiliary relief areas include the seven districts of Chongming, Chuansha, Jiading, Baoshan, Huipu, Fengxian, and Beiqiao. (2) Handling agencies: (A) The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau organizes the Winter Relief Office for the 31st year to handle the direct relief areas; (B) The respective district offices handle the auxiliary relief areas. (3) Relief items include four items: shelters, porridge relief, clothing relief, and cheap meals. Certain affairs are handled by the Winter Relief Office with the support of the district offices, and relief is provided separately. (4) Distribution of relief funds: The amount of relief funds is expected to be 2 million yuan, with 1.5 million yuan allocated to direct relief areas and 500,000 yuan allocated to auxiliary relief areas. (5) Fundraising: (A) The municipal government allocates 500,000 yuan; (B) The remaining 1.5 million yuan is raised by organizing the Fundraising Committee for Winter Relief Funds to solicit donations from all sectors. In addition to the auxiliary 500,000 yuan, auxiliary relief areas may raise funds separately as appropriate to local conditions. (6) Relief date: from January 1 to March 31 of the 32nd year.

Selecting Candidates for the Fundraising Committee

Mayor Chen Gongbo personally serves as the chairman of the Fundraising Committee for Winter Relief Funds for the 31st year, and Ding Mochun, the Standing Committee Member of the Social Movement Association, and Zhao Zunyue, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, serve as vice-chairmen. Cen Deguang, the chairman of the Accounting Committee, is invited to serve as the honorary chairman of the Fundraising Committee, and honorary members and members are invited. The committee also has an executive committee, with a director-general, a deputy director-general, and directors, which are divided into five groups in charge of general affairs, finance, publicity, fundraising, and auditing to handle their respective affairs. The staff of each group are selected and concurrently serve from among the municipal government staff. At the same time, a special committee is organized to handle various entertainment events to raise funds. The office of the committee is currently located in the Shanghai Special Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.

Fundraising Methods are Divided into Three Categories

The total amount of funds expected for this winter relief campaign is 2 million yuan. In addition to the 500,000 yuan allocated by the municipal government, the remaining 1.5 million yuan will be raised by the fundraising committee. The methods include (A) writing to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations to solicit donations separately, (B) writing to honorary members and members to solicit donations separately (donation brochures will not be issued, and the donations will be directly sent to the bank entrusted by the Fundraising Committee for collection), and (C) holding various charity competitions and entertainment events, including (1) horse racing charity champagne race, (2) football charity match, (3) Peking opera voluntary performance, (4) radio broadcasting, (5) film, (6) drama, (7) charity dance party, (8) Qunfang Association, (9) Shanghai Opera, (10) Yue Opera, (11) storytelling, (12) comedy, (13) others, etc. The fundraising for this winter relief fund will be terminated on the day it ends, and the funds raised will be sent to the municipal government for winter relief.

### Thoughts on Women's Issues

— Hu Jiacui

Generally speaking, women are already legally, educationally, and professionally equal to men. However, in reality, there are many examples of inequality, such as brothers embezzling their sisters' property, fathers favoring sons and giving all their property to them while giving nothing to their daughters, because daughters will marry and the property will be transferred to others invisibly; in all major and minor schools across the country, the number of male students exceeds the number of female students: especially in the workplace, it is even more difficult for women to compete with men, and institutions everywhere refuse to hire female employees; society gives women blows everywhere. However, there are also not a few women who are self-improving and unwilling to lag behind. Historically, there have also been female politicians, female military strategists, female educators, female writers, etc. So, since women account for half of humanity, why is society still centered on men? The biggest reason is that women cannot be equal to men in the workplace. People who can stand on their own in society are nothing more than three types: one is those who are law-abiding and cautious in their work; one is those who participate in a certain group struggle, and as the group develops, the status of each member of the group also develops. There is also creation, such as establishing schools and revitalizing various agricultural, industrial, and commercial enterprises. This requires not only planning and design, but also hard work and down-to-earth implementation. Nowadays, most working women can only carefully achieve the first step, which is already not easy. There are very few who want to participate in a certain group struggle or start a certain business. In the past, Chinese women had a considerable status in the family. But in the current era of continuous progress, women should no longer be confined to their homes. Although some people advocate that women return to the kitchen and to the family, to educate their children, manage household affairs, and be virtuous mothers and good wives. However, in theory, since men and women have equal educational opportunities, they should also have equal professional opportunities. Establishing equal educational opportunities for men and women does not mean that women use education as a dowry, nor is it to please ordinary men so that they can marry knowledgeable wives. It is because China is poor, the country has no money to popularize education, and education is still enjoyed by the propertied class. Therefore, women who have the opportunity to receive education should also be asked to serve the society. In reality, women can no longer rely on men. The cost of living is so high that the heavy burden of family responsibilities is already too much for ordinary salaried employees to bear. If women can find jobs and support themselves, wouldn't it reduce the family burden on men? Furthermore, speaking of men with high positions and generous salaries who own assets, they are not satisfied with their wives, so although the law stipulates a monogamous system, in reality, they always have three wives and four concubines. Open and secret struggles emerge endlessly. Many women feel this kind of meaningless pain. On the one hand, it is indeed the responsibility of men, but on the other hand, it is also the shortcomings of women themselves. Their temperament is neither as gentle and obedient as Japanese women, nor as loving and passionate as Western women, so it is not easy to gain the sympathy of men and is not suitable to be an appendage of men. Because China has long advocated equality between men and women, Chinese women should also find jobs like men and go to society to struggle, without having to compromise and try to cater to men and become their appendages. Therefore, if Chinese new women are still unwilling to go to society to struggle and are satisfied with being wives and young mistresses, there is no doubt that it reduces a lot of strength in society.

Speaking of women who are satisfied with being young mistresses and wives, some of them no longer seek employment after marrying a husband, and some even give up their jobs. This is entirely due to economic conditions. Men often take economic conditions as a condition for marrying a wife, and women are tempted by economic conditions. After getting married, if life is indeed more comfortable than before, they are unwilling to go out to work again. Or, because they are entangled in household affairs, they have no time for work, and as a result, they regress, fall behind, and suffer more oppression from their parents-in-law in the family than old-fashioned women. So, they are gradually looked down upon by men. Men oppress women, saying that women are dependent and want women to obey, and even treat women as playthings. When women reach this point, they have no choice but to be played with, obey, and rely on, and they are always afraid. They are afraid that if their husbands fall in love with someone else, they will become abandoned women. There are not a few women like this. There are also many women who already have a certain status, but after getting married, because of their own negligence and laziness, their original status is gradually taken over by men. There are also not a few women like this. So, the reason why fathers do not give property to their daughters is the same. They are afraid that their daughters' property will be taken over by their sons-in-law invisibly.

What is the use of stipulating equality between men and women in form only, but not being able to achieve equality in practice? Formal equality is given by others, while actual equality must be fought for by women themselves. Therefore, if women want to be equal to men, they must not be afraid of hardships and stand on their own in society, and they can no longer depend on their families in a submissive and compromising manner. They must show their own strength so that their family fathers and brothers and people in society believe in women's ability to handle affairs, which is not only equal to men, but also better than men. However, if women want to stand on their own in society, on the one hand, they indeed need their own efforts, and on the other hand, they still need the help of men, because society is still centered on men after all. Now, I want to appeal to those leaders who are enthusiastic about social undertakings and wise officials to give women three kinds of assistance: job opportunities, the organization of women's groups, and the establishment of credit and loan institutions. Regarding these three points, women themselves should also make efforts. Finally, I hope that those who can be leaders for women should take society as the premise, and not center on individuals or a few people. Being able to give up the ego and seek the greater good means being able to give up personal interests and serve society wholeheartedly. Being able to recognize that the reason why people ask society for life and live in society is to serve society. I hope that our women leaders can all have such a view.

### This City's Cultural Institutions and Groups Hold a Grand Tea Party to Send Off Reporting Department Chief Yokoyama, Propaganda Department Chief Feng Delivers Farewell Speech on Behalf

Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, the Reporting Department Chief of the Japanese Army in this city, has been honorably transferred to a new position as the Commander of the Japanese Army Unit in Manchuria. The centrally-affiliated reporting agencies in Shanghai, such as the Shanghai Office of the Official Transmission Department and the International Propaganda Bureau, various cultural institutions and groups, as well as various newspapers, film companies, bookstores, and business groups, believe that although Reporting Department Chief Yokoyama has only been in Shanghai for a few months, he has made no small contribution to the cooperation and construction of various sectors of this city. Therefore, they are reluctant to see him leave Shanghai for his new position. On the afternoon of the 2nd, 28 units jointly held a grand farewell tea party at the Duchen Hotel Hall on Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road by the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department. The atmosphere was warm.

### Mysterious Thieves Specialize in Stealing Telephones

The Authorities Issue a Warning

Recently, the citizens of this city have been harassed and feel terrified by a mysterious gang of thieves. It has been found that in the past week, telephone theft incidents have occurred repeatedly in Shanghai. It is generally expected that these telephone thieves are an organized group, and they mostly steal on Saturdays or Sunday evenings after the homeowners go out to entertainment venues and then use their cunning skills. It is learned that most of the victims of these cases are foreigners, and according to reliable investigations, it is believed that the thieves employed by the gang are also foreign vagrants. However, since it is quite possible that Chinese people will also have their telephones stolen in the future, the authorities have issued a warning to all residents in the city, instructing them to pay close attention to the activities of this telephone theft gang.

### Category B Oil Shops Will Sell on the 7th

Starting from January 7, Category B oil shops will continue to sell for four days.

### Rationing of Oil by Population Is Being Trialed

In some areas such as the Laozha District of the Public Concession and the Fuxu District of the French Concession, the rationing of oil by population is being trialed with the cooperation of the Baojia system. Each person can purchase half a catty or four taels of cooking oil with a citizen's card. The trial results are very good. With the assistance of the Baojia Guidance Association, edible oil wholesale points in other districts are conducting household surveys. Once the survey is completed, the entire method of rationing oil by population can be implemented. In addition, the Xihui District is actively engaged in new measures to supply residents and is preparing a method of rationing oil by household to reduce the suffering of citizens buying oil. Recently, the first neighborhood in Xihui has started first, and each Lianbao chief will allocate purchase certificates for rationing oil by household on a regular basis. Each certificate allows the household to purchase half a catty of cooking oil. The second and third neighborhoods in Xihui are now following the method of the first neighborhood and will also be implemented accordingly, it is said.

### Madam Nie Passes Away

Nie Zengjifen (i.e., the old lady of Nie Guanchen, Yuntai, and Lusheng), with the late name Chonglaoren, was the youngest daughter of the former Qing Dynasty's famous minister Zeng Guofan. She passed away in Shanghai on the 30th of last month at the age of ninety-one. The coffin was sealed on the 2nd of this month. Friends from all sides were not notified, but on that day, no less than 500 people went to pay their respects and see the remains, such as Li Sihao, Huang Boqiao, Wang Yangxian, He Qianli, Ji Zhenggan, Tan Ze, and Japanese friends. Public and private groups, such as the employees of the Hengfeng Textile Co., Ltd. and the Buddhist Lay Buddhist Forest, sent representatives. They all called the old lady the only person in the world who possessed both blessing and virtue. She had no hobbies in her life and usually only did needlework, read, and write as homework. In her later years, she was in good health, and many friends from all sides asked for her calligraphy, which they all regarded as treasures.

### Record of the East Asia Economic Conference (V) Translated from the Late November 1931 "Allied Ten-Day Report"

Second day

Meetings of Each Department

(November 27) In the morning, the first department meeting (agricultural issues), chaired by Mr. Tadatsugu Ishiguro, held a discussion centered on agricultural countermeasures based on the ideal of East Asian economic construction. Mr. Kotaro Sengoku from Japan, as well as representatives from Manchuria, Mongolia, Central China, and North China, spoke in turn. Regarding

(1) The creation and maintenance of self-cultivating farmers as the backbone of the Japanese nation, and the accompanying problem of Manchurian pioneering immigrants.

(2) Issues of materials and financial assistance arising from the increased production of cotton and food in North China.

(3) Policies for the exchange of agricultural products between North China and Mengjiang.

(4) The issue of actively promoting village finance. Valuable opinions were exchanged.

In the afternoon, the first department meeting (mining industry) was chaired by Mr. Naoto Kohiyama, the chairman of the Iron and Steel Control Association, and a discussion was held centered on "mining industry countermeasures based on the ideal of East Asian economic construction."

(1) The establishment of a self-sufficiency system for each region's heavy industry and light industry.

(2) In order to achieve the above objectives, or to some extent, dependence on the mainland for technology and materials!

(3) The revision of the mainland-centric approach to heavy industry.

(4) The prioritized development of mineral resources.

The discussion was generally focused on the above points. The main content of the speeches was roughly as follows:

Mr. Kiyoshi Sago - President of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries

(1) The basic policy of industrial construction within the scope of Greater East Asia is to comprehensively exert industrial power, but at present, everything should be concentrated on enhancing combat power. Therefore, increasing the production of various weapons, aircraft, ships, warships, food, etc. must be the top priority. For this purpose, strengthening iron, coal, oil, aluminum metalworking machines, electricity, fertilizers, etc. is an essential basic undertaking.

(2) The location planning within the scope of Greater East Asia should emphasize mainland development. Japan is responsible for high-yield industries centered on heavy chemical industries; Manchuria is responsible for coal, iron, and electricity; North China and Mengjiang are responsible for coal and salt production; Central China is responsible for light industry; and the South is responsible for mining and oil.

(3) The current urgent measures are to strengthen the connection of the entire region of Greater East Asia in order to enhance the national defense industry. The industrial control mechanism must correspond to our country and expand to Manchuria, China, and the South.

Mr. Yoshio Mawatari - Managing Director of Manchuria Livelihood Necessities Company

Manchukuo has broken away from its previous strong dependence on Japan in terms of livelihood necessities (except for grains), and is now further transforming into an economic system that contributes greatly to Japan. However, in order to complete this task, issues such as factory and technology transfer still require Japan's support.

Mr. Shou Rong Lei - Managing Director of the North China Cooperative Enterprise Association

(1) While increasing cotton production, it is hoped that the existing textile equipment in North China will be greatly enhanced in order to adapt to the needs of various regions in the North China and Southern Co-prosperity Sphere.

(2) On the one hand, create a self-sufficient state of wheat, and at the same time, seek to increase and expand flour mills.

(3) Increase the production of the paper industry, especially high-grade paper.

(4) Promote the tobacco industry and the oil extraction industry.

The biggest requirement for promoting the above-mentioned light industries and miscellaneous industries in North China is the import of machinery and technology from Japan.

Mr. Tsugiro Masuda - President of Taiwan Electric Power

The importance of Taiwan as a military base must be re-recognized. Taiwan must be industrialized and armed, not only as a destination for investment, but also from a strategic and national defense perspective.

Mr. Hideo Toda - Chief of the General Affairs Division of the North China Development Company

(1) Strengthen the production of coal, iron ore, bauxite, fluorite, manganese, asbestos, etc., which are important mineral resources in North China.

(2) Establish and develop industries that process large quantities of mineral products, especially the ironmaking industry, aluminum manufacturing industry, ammonium sulfate manufacturing, and the sanhe soil industry.

(3) Many things hinder the increase in mineral production in North China, especially ship problems, materials, funds, technology, etc., which have become problems. Regarding materials and technology, it is especially necessary to rely on Manchuria and Japan to a considerable extent.

### Suggestions for Prohibiting Spitting Anywhere

— Wang Youzhi

To promote hygiene, shops everywhere have posted slogans like "Spit into the Cuspidor" and "Please Do Not Spit Anywhere." Of course, this cannot be said to be of no help to the movement to prohibit spitting anywhere. However, although the "Fine of Five Yuan for Spitting Once" has not yet been implemented, it has at least reached its prelude stage, and many people have already felt quite inconvenienced.

Take the prohibition of urinating anywhere as an example. Although there are notices in the alleys saying "Urinating Here is Prohibited; Violators Will Be Arrested," there are still many people who urinate underneath them, but those who go to urinate are definitely not intentional. If public toilets are reduced, or even nonexistent, there will definitely be more people urinating or even defecating in the alleys. Conversely, if there are public toilets nearby, passersby will naturally no longer urinate in the alleys.

Spitting is similar to urinating. It is not allowed to spit on the road, and of course it is not allowed to spit in the alleys. The main reason is not only to avoid obstructing the view, but especially to prevent the spread of germs. If you say to spit phlegm on paper or in a handkerchief, it is actually not easy to do. Some people often cough and spit phlegm, and sometimes even if they bring paper or a handkerchief, it is not enough. Or someone goes to a banquet or a friend's house, and puts a paper or handkerchief full of phlegm in their pocket. Although it can be thrown into the spittoon, it always feels unaesthetic. Moreover, phlegm is much more difficult to deal with than nasal mucus. Taking myself as an example, whether I have a cold or not, I often don't blow my nose into the spittoon, but wipe it with a handkerchief, and changing a handkerchief every two days is enough. But it is not the same with phlegm. When spitting phlegm, saliva often comes out with it. If the handkerchief is a little smaller, it will be too wet to bear after spitting two or three times, and there is really no way to put it in the pocket, and of course it cannot be used to wipe the nose again. Therefore, spitting phlegm into paper or a handkerchief is not the best solution.

In my most humble opinion, to remedy such places, it is best to set up more spittoons, preferably based on the standard of self-defense pavilions, either every post or every other post, set up a spittoon, and the self-defense team can be responsible for guarding it. When the post is over, put the spittoon in the police亭 to avoid theft and other incidents. Regarding the funding issue, if it is entirely provided by the authorities, the cost may be too large, so it may be possible to allocate or donate funds from the Baojia. Determine the number of spittoons to be placed based on the amount of funds obtained. In this way, those who spit phlegm can fulfill their responsibility to spit phlegm into the spittoon and not spit anywhere, and human and material resources do not seem to be a big problem. Just my sincere and foolish opinion, contributed to everyone for reference.

### Mother Dog

— Chunqiu

This is a humorous and satirical old story.

A half-baked pedantic teacher read and interpreted "Do not covet wealth acquired unlawfully, do not avoid danger faced unlawfully" as "Covet wealth, dog gets it; face danger, mother dog avoids it." Therefore, this pedantic teacher never forgot to envy mother dogs, hoping to be a "mother dog" in the next life instead of a teacher.

I think this story was made up by people to mock the teacher, which is a bit cruel. In fact, the lives of teachers who are used to eating rough food are already hard enough. The opportunity to "face danger" may be many, but the opportunity to "covet wealth" is probably never in a lifetime!

In recent years, what I have heard and seen has confirmed that the story of "Covet wealth, dog gets it; face danger, mother dog avoids it" is not a fantasy, but is indeed based on something.

Whenever a civil war or an international war is about to break out, the busiest, most active, and most anxious people are those rich people and big merchants. On the one hand, they turn all their assets into foreign exchange and gold; on the other hand, they immediately move to the safest place. If the momentum of foreign exchange and gold has passed, they immediately sell rice, hoard goods, and trade in public bonds and stocks; if they previously thought that a safe place has some signs of trouble, they immediately take a postal ship or plane to move to a safer place. They don't think about what country, what nation, or what compatriots are in their minds at all. Their life philosophy is completely: "Covet wealth, dog gets it; face danger, mother dog avoids it."

This group of rich people and big merchants who embrace the "mother dog" view of life love money and are afraid of death. When they "covet wealth," as long as they can get it, they are willing to be a "mother dog." When they "face danger," as long as they can avoid it, they are willing to be a "mother dog."

Extending this, under the hypocritical democratic politics of Britain and the United States, those international financial tycoons, in peacetime, of course try their best to exert their ability to "covet wealth, dog gets it." In wartime, on the one hand, they try every means to achieve the goal of "face danger, mother dog avoids it"; at the same time, they also use the great chaos of war to continue to exert the vicious means of "covet wealth, dog gets it."

### Viewing a Bonsai Exhibition

— Tangdi

Inconvenient transportation, many obstacles on the journey, living in seclusion on the sea, nothing to do, the scenery of Suzhou, the beauty of West Lake, although close at hand, I still can't enjoy myself: the great lakes and mountains, let the fallen flowers be ownerless. It is difficult to get close to the beauty of nature in the bustling city! As the year comes to an end, the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge has held a bonsai exhibition, gathering bonsai planted by famous artists on the sea in one hall. Facing a bonsai, the scenery is faintly visible, borrowing to receive the joy of spiritual travel, regulating the spiritual life of citizens, the intention is very good. In addition to the exquisite works of bonsai experts Kong Zhiqing, Zhou Shoujuan, Xu Zhuodai and other gentlemen, there are also Huang Jingwan, Yuan Zhaolan, Liu Hanlin, Yao Qiyuan, Tan Dingxuan and Xu's brothers Zihua and Ziling, who participated in the exhibition with many kinds of works. Zheng Meiqing's ten pots of pine trees, matched with antique ceramic pots and racks, are magnificent, especially making the association a lot of color. The number of fine products is rare in the past, among which Kong Zhiqing's "Peach Blossom Spring" and "Geese Bathing in Reed Cong"; Zhou Shoujuan's "Clear, Strange, Ancient, Weird," "Seeking Sentences at Pine Roots," and "Mishui Enjoying Hunger," or strange rocks are jagged, or ancient trees are forked. And Xu Zhuodai's "Ancient Temple by the Sea" and "A Corner of West Lake" are purely made of waste paper, and the color is realistic, which is a new style of bonsai. In addition, the various points displayed by the Xu brothers can be seen more beautifully with water and stone. In the cold winter weather... there is no spring color, it is really the ingenuity of seizing the work of heaven! Others such as Zihua's "Another World," "Curved Water Flowing觞" and Ziling's "Orchid Pavilion," "Red Cliff," "Twin Peaks Inserting Clouds," and "Wuxia Hanging Sails," etc., in addition to being enough for appreciation, are more geographically valuable. Therefore, the above-mentioned works have received many positive reviews. In the past three days, those who have come to visit the exhibition at Baliqiao have been no less than thousands of people. It is heard that the association, for the sake of promoting noble entertainment, will continue to exhibit for three days from the 4th to the 6th without collecting tickets, and it is learned that the association will organize a bonsai research association and print bylaws for solicitation after the exhibition. All my elegant scholars, why not come.

### The Teacher of All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

(1)

Getting old...good heavens, yes. He was born in 1848. He was a toddling child when he was taken to the "Great Exhibition"—there were few alive now who could boast of having seen such a thing. And he could even remember Brookfield in Wetherby's time. That was a very distant vista. Then—1870, easy enough to remember because of the Franco-Prussian War,—Wetherby was already an old man. Chips had been a year at Melbury, he didn’t like it there, he was ragged rather, and came to Brookfield. But Brookfield he liked, almost from the beginning. He remembered the very day he came to have his preliminary interview—a sunny day in June, with the air full of flower scents, and the plick-plock of cricket on the pitch. Brookfield was playing Barnhurst, and a small boy was making a good score; funny thing to remember so clearly. Wetherby himself was kindly and courteous; he must have been ill even then, poor fellow, for he died during the summer vacation, before Chips’s first term. Still, the two had met and talked.

Chips, sitting by the fire in Mrs. Wickett’s parlor, would often think, I am probably the only person in the world who has a really vivid picture of old Wetherby…. Vivid, yes; that was the word; the picture was a clear and sharp one that lived in his mind: the sunlight slanting through the dust in Wetherby’s study. ‘Mr. Chipping, you are a young man, and Brookfield is an old foundation. Youth and age should be well combined. Give your enthusiasm to Brookfield, and Brookfield will give you something in return. Don’t let anyone play tricks with you. I—er—heard that discipline was not always entirely satisfactory at Melbury?’

‘Well, no, perhaps not, sir.’

‘Never mind; you are very young; it is largely a matter of experience. You have another chance here. Take a firm line—that is the secret of it.’ (2)

Social Service

### Poverty Relief Movement: Readers Provide Opinions

All staff and workers of this newspaper recently launched a collective donation, unanimously supporting the poverty relief movement, collecting 3,000 yuan for the New Year's Eve feast, which was submitted to the accounting department four days ago, and the list was omitted. Li Fuyang donated 100 yuan for New Year's Day, with a balance of 8,637 yuan. Yesterday the weather suddenly turned cold, and the north wind was biting, shaking the hearts of the poor. However, many readers who sympathize with the newspaper's poverty relief still braved the cold to send them, and their kindness is admirable. Also received a letter from Yongyu, proposing two opinions: (1) Active relief: organize small production loan funds. (That is, lend a small amount of capital to the general healthy people to enable them to make a living and avoid freezing.) (2) Passive relief: organize medical aid funds. (That is, provide medical expenses to the general poor and sick, in addition to introducing free doctors, to enable them to restore their health.) In addition, I hope that this newspaper will publish more articles on social service work related to public welfare, such as health knowledge, family hygiene, and marriage and social guidance, so that everyone knows prevention and preparation to avoid the two major losses of spirit and material. (Editor's note: The two opinions will be submitted to the poverty relief committee for discussion.)

### Exhibition of Famous Porcelain from Past Dynasties: Selling Tickets to Help the Newspaper's Poverty Relief Fund

Chinese porcelain has always occupied a place in the world's art history, but what has been left behind by past dynasties has been lost more and more over the years. The survivors are rare and precious, and those who get them cherish them as treasures. It is often not easy to see them from the outside. In the past, the famous porcelain of past dynasties collected by the Forbidden City was once escorted by warships and exhibited in London. People from all countries who heard of it went to watch it and praised it. China's international status has increased a lot because of this. It can be seen that Chinese porcelain is very valuable, and it is not without reason. Dai Runzhai, the owner of Haitian, Liangxi, is a famous collector. He has been researching Chinese porcelain for more than 20 years. He has collected famous porcelain from the Han, Jin, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties in his life, which is extremely rich, and it is even more rare to collect ordinary porcelain. It has been decided to systematically introduce his collection of famous Jin porcelain, together with famous porcelain from the Han, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, at the Meiqi Building, No. 996 Jing'an Temple Road, 3rd floor, from the 6th to the 13th of this month, in order to display the relics of the ancestors and examine the evolution of Chinese cultural relics throughout the dynasties. Tickets are two yuan per person, and all donations will go to the newspaper's poverty relief fund. This exhibition, which should have a double meaning, will definitely be seen by people from all walks of life as soon as possible.
