### How to Eradicate the Black Market

With the establishment of the National General Association for Commercial Control in mid-March, and the promulgation of the Regulations for the Prohibition of the Movement of Materials, the general public expected that the price issue would be thoroughly adjusted due to the consolidated management of materials. Recently, due to the relaxation of grain movement, the black market for rice has shrunk to six-tenths of its previous size. This improvement in the issue of "food," which is "what the people regard as their heaven," seems to have given the general public a sigh of relief.

We have said before, and most people have also said, that the grain issue is the center of the price issue, and the rise and fall of general prices often shift with grain prices. However, the current facts do not confirm this assertion, because grain prices have already fallen, but other prices have not fallen accordingly.

Today, I would like to offer some opinions on how to eradicate the black market.

When implementing price controls, three principles must be observed: First, comprehensiveness and unity; second, equal emphasis on economics and politics; and third, the unification of "reporting," "supervision," and "execution," and especially the exertion of "determination." The success or failure of anything depends entirely on "determination." We believe that only under the sharp blade of determination can all problems be solved easily and success be achieved. For example, for prices assessed by the authorities, people may not dare to disobey on the surface, but secretly there are black market prices. The existence of such a black market is the biggest obstacle to overall price control. We must not be discouraged by this, but should think of ways to overcome it. Therefore, to implement price controls, we must then prepare the determination to deal with the black market issue, so that we can be consistent in word and deed, and eradicate the root of the problem. To eradicate the black market, the following points should be noted:

(1) Do not be hasty. Currently, the average price has increased several dozen times compared to before the incident. The current hope for price limits is that they can prevent prices from soaring uncontrollably, which would be considered a success. As for how many times higher they are compared to before the incident, there is no need to look back and worry. We must recognize that the price limit standards, which have been carefully considered by the authorities, are very practical and feasible. Only with this pragmatic attitude can we eliminate the germs that breed the black market imperceptibly. On the eve of price limits, the government authorities showed their greatest determination to implement them without fail. At the beginning of price limits, they held a sincere intention of leniency and understanding, so that everyone would not suffer losses in sudden fluctuations on the one hand, and on the other hand, they could gradually get used to this new environment in a stable manner in terms of commercial sentiment. However, since everyone has made preparations for price limits in fact and in sentiment, the authorities should strictly maintain the stability of the market in the future, and absolutely must not allow the recurrence of the evil phenomena of soaring and secretly rising prices.

(2) Understand the commercial situation. Although the personnel in charge of price limits are government officials, or mainly government officials, the work they do is of a commercial nature. If they do not study the inside information of the commercial market clearly in order to gain a full understanding of the unpredictable commercial situation, then the price limit measures will inevitably be like scratching an itch from outside the boot. Not only will they fail to limit prices, but perhaps under absurd measures, they will instead stimulate price increases. Understanding the commercial situation can not only make the various price limit measures reasonable and avoid the adverse effects of stimulating prices, but also, because of the understanding of the commercial situation, understand the temporary difficulties in the market at a certain time, and provide assistance as much as possible, so as not to cause price surges due to these difficulties. For example, a certain commodity in place A cannot be fully self-sufficient and has always relied on place B. Suddenly, due to a special accident or the interruption of transportation, the price of a certain commodity in place A will easily surge under this influence. Those in charge of price limits, if they can understand the commercial situation, will surely have a clear idea in their minds. On the one hand, they will understand the true situation of the temporary shortage of goods and consider allowing a certain limit of price increase. On the other hand, the government will provide convenience as much as possible to assist legitimate merchants in purchasing and transporting goods from other places that produce substitutes, balancing the degree of shortage. If price limits are implemented in this way, with discretion and reason, and with loyalty and wisdom, prices can truly be leveled. Otherwise, the price limiters will blindly limit prices on the one hand, and scare people with severe penalties on the other. The former cannot understand the difficulties of merchants, and the latter makes merchants dare not openly resist. As a result, they can only take the path of the black market.

(3) Restrict over-purchasing. Although the purchase of current market goods has implemented rationing for some items and stipulated purchase limits for others, as long as there is "money" and "power," there is inevitably the fact of over-purchasing. This constitutes a major factor in hoarding and speculation, because this method is too clever and convenient, so an effective method of strict prohibition must be devised so that those with money and power cannot over-purchase. If this measure is not strictly prohibited, powerful speculators may at any time over-purchase based on the price limits assessed by the authorities, and when the market tightens on that commodity, they will secretly set black market prices and sell them at high prices, making profits of ten or hundreds of times. Therefore, restricting over-purchasing is striking at black market speculation.

The above three points are just a way to draw firewood from under the pot, which can only avoid stimulating the growth of the black market. Speculators who are skilled in scheming can also skillfully see through the line of sight and try to satisfy their selfish desires. Therefore, it is even more necessary to actively supplement with a clear order strictly prohibiting the black market, with scouts going out in all directions, and a reconnaissance network covering the black market, so that the speculators' every move is nowhere to hide. Once black market transactions are discovered, merchants should be severely punished without leniency, and high-ranking officials who violate the law should be punished the same as commoners. Those who purchase black market goods should also be punished in the same way. If this can be strictly enforced, we believe that the black market can be eradicated and price limits can be successful.

### Japanese Army Air Force in Burma Continues Bombing India, Shoots Down or Destroys 77 Enemy Aircraft, Anti-Axis Base in Oro Bay Also Bombed

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 1st that the Imperial Army Air Force is continuing to attack enemy air bases and military installations in eastern India. The battle situation from March 26th to 30th is as follows. Damage inflicted on the enemy: A. On the 26th, one enemy aircraft was shot down in Imphal, and large fires broke out at five military facilities in the area. At Cox's Bazar Island, one enemy 1,700-ton transport ship was sunk and four 500-ton ships were severely damaged. B. On the 27th, victories were achieved in Cox's Bazar and Imphal. C. On the 29th, six enemy aircraft were shot down in Cox's Bazar. D. On the 30th, twelve enemy aircraft were shot down and one was severely damaged east of Cox's Bazar and at the Ramu airfield, and military facilities were destroyed, with large fires breaking out at nine locations. At Alisongho, south of Maungdaw, two military facilities and supply depots were destroyed. Our side suffered no losses.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Army Air Force in Burma has recently bombed enemy bases in eastern India for ten consecutive days, including Feni airfield, airfields near Chittagong, Maes Khal Island north of Maungdaw and Cox's Bazar, Ramu airfield east of Cox's Bazar, and Alisongho south of Maungdaw. Seventy-seven enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed, many enemy transport ships were sunk or damaged, and enemy military facilities such as docks were destroyed, resulting in great victories. During this period, except for seven Japanese aircraft that self-detonated or did not return on the 27th, all other aircraft safely returned to base. The newly discovered place names in this announcement of results, such as Ramu airfield and Alisongho, indicate that Japanese aircraft have heavily damaged enemy bases in eastern India. It appears that the British Indian Army's attempt to counterattack Burma is still active on the India-Burma border. However, due to the continuous and fierce bombing of enemy airfields and transport ships by the Japanese Air Force, the British Indian Army in eastern India is now in a state of panic. Also, regarding the results of the Japanese aircraft's attack on Feni and Chittagong enemy airfields on the 27th, the Japanese General Headquarters in Chittagong has announced that nine enemy aircraft caught fire after being hit, and there were also as many as eleven that were confirmed to be on fire. A total of two enemy aircraft on the ground were destroyed.

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a British headquarters bulletin from New Delhi, Japanese bombers and fighters attacked airfields in southeastern Bengal, dropping countless bombs, causing heavy casualties and significant damage.

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Melbourne, Japanese air forces heavily bombed the port of Cox's Bazar in southeastern Bengal on the 30th with large formations. On the same day, Japanese air forces also bombed the anti-Axis base in Oro Bay on New Guinea Island. Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to news from Melbourne, Japanese aircraft attacked Oro Bay in New Guinea again, destroying the anti-Axis base.

### Moro People of Mindanao Island Determined to Cooperate with Japan

Manila, 31st (Central News Agency) – The Moro people on Mindanao Island have never submitted since the Americans occupied the Philippines forty years ago, causing constant trouble. However, according to the commander of the Japanese military administration unit in Mindanao, who recently inspected the island, the Japanese have been able to win the friendship of the Moro people. Currently, there are more than 65,000 Moro people living in peace and working happily, with complete trust in the Japanese. The tribe is now wholeheartedly cooperating with Japan to increase production and maintain order. This situation has been created entirely because the Japanese army treats all ethnic groups in the Philippines equally, regardless of their religious beliefs.

### Soviet Ambassador Litvinov Has Lengthy Meeting with Hull

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to news from Washington, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov had a lengthy meeting with US Secretary of State Hull yesterday.

### Japanese Side Announces Appointment of Administrative Officials for the South Seas Area

### Fighting in Tunisia Spreads Northward

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a military correspondent for the Hague News Agency, the great battle in Tunisia is now spreading. As expected, the British First Army has now joined the Allied general offensive, but currently only a portion of its left flank is fighting in northern Tunisia, in the coastal area between Cape Serrat and Medjez el Bab. The British army is advancing with strong forces, attempting to force the Axis outposts in the Djebel Abiod area to retreat. The offensive of the British and American forces in other areas has been contained by German reserves. The British army, advancing north from Medjez el Bab, has also retreated without success. However, it is expected that a major battle will occur in this area, as air reconnaissance indicates that General Anderson is continuing to reinforce his left flank. On the other hand, further south in the area west of Kairouan, a strong American force is currently advancing east along a wide front. These American troops have no combat experience and have clearly been transferred from Morocco to the front. Therefore, although they are numerous, they have achieved nothing. Although the fighting is spreading, its focus remains in the north of central Tunisia, in the area of Maknassy. The central force of the American Fifth Army and the left flank of General Patton's force in the area of El Guettar have fought bitterly in that area for ten days, pushing to the Mediterranean coast. During this period, the American commander had to replenish his heavily depleted troops, even having to add previously uncommitted reserves. This shows that the Allied forces definitely have a numerical advantage on the entire African front, but this numerical advantage, coupled with the American forces in Maknassy and El Guettar, has been reinforced by elite British troops and is of no use, as the Allies have made very little progress to date. At the same time, the German and Italian armies have retreated, and the troops and supplies on the Mareth Line have not suffered significant losses. They have made all preparations to defend the new position along the isthmus between the eastern coast of Telferjat and the northern coast of Gabes. As of Tuesday evening, the American Eighth Army has only conducted blind probes of the shortened Axis new line with strong reconnaissance units. It is generally expected that a frontal offensive will occur soon, as the vast swamp in the area will not allow General Montgomery to implement his signature flanking maneuvers.

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – Military sources announced last night that German artillery and bombers, as well as fast-flying fighter-bombers, destroyed 71 American tanks in the El Guettar area of central Tunisia on Tuesday. It is reported that hundreds of American tanks, along with large units of French troops, have repeatedly attacked the German lines, but each time they were shattered by the concentrated fire of the German army before reaching the German lines. The French suffered heavy losses.

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – Reuters reported last night that the Allied-controlled Algiers radio station broadcast on Wednesday that British Marines had landed at the port of Sfax in Tunisia. London has completely denied this.

### No Major Changes in the Eastern Front Situation Due to Poor Road Conditions

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to reports, there have been no major changes in the situation on the Eastern Front. Soviet troops are constantly launching large-scale attacks near Lakes Ilmen and Ladoga, and in the lower reaches of the Kupen River north of Smolensk. Furthermore, Soviet troops are currently reorganizing and urgently seeking to replenish troops and supplies, but due to poor road conditions and the activity of the German Air Force, they do not appear to have achieved their intended goals. The German Air Force has repeatedly conducted organized air raids on the Soviet front lines and rear bases, inflicting great damage on the Soviet troops. Information obtained from Soviet prisoners of war indicates that approximately 30% of the Soviet mechanized units and tank units have been destroyed. The railways have also been heavily damaged due to repeated bombings by the German Air Force. Soviet troops in the Kupen area attacked German forces with approximately 20 tanks, but were ultimately routed by the rapid concentrated attacks of German dive bombers and artillery. The Soviet troops lost 13 tanks in this attack. North of Bykhov, German forces formed a shock force of grenadiers and engineers that penetrated deep into Soviet positions, causing the superior Soviet forces to scatter and flee. Also, a portion of the Soviet infantry in the area west of Vyazma, on both sides of the Moscow-Roslavl railway, has been caught in a German encirclement and faces annihilation. Soviet troops in the area of Staraya Russa, south of Lake Ilmen, recently suffered great damage and have abandoned their offensive intentions. Furthermore, south of Lake Ladoga, German forces launched a fierce attack on Soviet troops, completely annihilating two artillery battalions and destroying nine Soviet tanks.

### The Start-to-Finish of the Japan-Soviet Provisional Fisheries Agreement

Negotiations for the conclusion of the Japan-Soviet Provisional Fisheries Agreement have been underway between Japan and the Soviet Union in Kuibyshev since the end of last year, and have now been successfully concluded. On the 24th, domestic procedures in both countries were completed, and at 6:00 PM on the 25th (0:00 AM on the 26th Japan time), the agreement was formally signed at that location by the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sato, and the Acting Chairman of the People's Committee for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Lozovsky. The provisional agreement to that treaty, which was signed on March 20th of last year, expired on December 21st of last year. Before the expiration of the agreement, the governments of Japan and the Soviet Union had been negotiating since the beginning of February to extend the Japan-Soviet Basic Fisheries Treaty, which was signed in 1928, for another year, until the end of this year. The conclusion of the provisional agreement has now been achieved. The true intention of the Japanese government regarding this matter is to revise the Japan-Soviet Basic Fisheries Treaty and to conclude it as soon as possible. The provisional agreement that has now been concluded only delays and prolongs the current situation, which is very unsatisfactory. However, in any case, due to the conclusion of this eighth provisional agreement, Japanese interests in the North Pacific fisheries can be exercised satisfactorily this year, which can be said to be a fortunate event in light of the current international situation. Moreover, the incitement of Japan-Soviet estrangement by enemy countries such as Britain and the United States has proven to be futile in view of the friendly relations between the two countries, which have already concluded a neutrality treaty. Based on the Japan-Soviet treaty stipulated in the Treaty of Portsmouth, the Japanese fishing rights were confirmed, and the Japan-Soviet Basic Fisheries Treaty was concluded. The Japanese government is now urging the Soviet authorities to continue negotiations to revise the treaty. Regarding this matter, the government received a public announcement from Ambassador Sato upon completion of the signing, which was announced by the Information Bureau as follows:

(Announcement by the Information Bureau) 10:00 AM on the 26th, "Negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union for a fisheries treaty were also conducted last year, but were not successful by the end of the year. Therefore, since December, consultations have been held to conclude a provisional agreement in order to extend the effective period of the current fisheries treaty until the end of this year. Negotiations have now been successful, and on March 25th, the provisional agreement was signed in Kuibyshev by the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sato, and the representative of the People's Committee for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Lozovsky."

As a result of the past Russo-Japanese War, Japan and Imperial Russia stipulated Japan's fishing rights in the North Pacific and confirmed them in the Treaty of Portsmouth. Based on that treaty, the first fisheries treaty, which stipulated the exercise of Japanese rights, was concluded at the beginning of Meiji 40 (1907), with a term of twelve years. Due to the revolution that occurred in the middle of that period, and the collapse of the Imperial regime, the Japanese government concluded a basic treaty with the newly established government of the Soviet Socialist Federal Republics in January of Taisho 14 (1925) and confirmed it. After that, as a result of conducting negotiations to conclude a revised treaty, on January 23rd of Showa 3 (1928), the treaty with a term of eight years was signed by the then Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tanaka, and the Chairman of the People's Committee for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Karakhan, and the details of the changes were decided by the Hirota-Karakhan Agreement. The current treaty is, in fact, one in which the effective period has been extended year by year after the expiration of that treaty to the present day.

The Japan-Soviet Basic Fisheries Treaty signed in January of Showa 3 (1928) expired at the end of May of Showa 11 (1936). Prior to this, the two governments conducted negotiations to conclude a revised treaty, but no compromise was reached. In order to avoid a treaty-less situation, the first provisional agreement was concluded on May 25th of that year until the end of that year, and negotiations for revision were continued on the one hand. As a result, a draft agreement that both sides agreed to was obtained in December. However, the Soviet government misunderstood the true meaning of the Anti-Comintern Pact concluded between Japan and Germany at that time and refused to sign it, so the effort failed. As a result, on December 28th of that year, the second provisional agreement, with a term ending at the end of Showa 12 (1937), was concluded. At that time, the Japanese government felt extremely regretful.

After that, the Japanese government, based on legitimate rights vis-à-vis the Soviet Union, urged the Soviet government to conclude a revised treaty, but the Soviet government simply delayed and prolonged, and thus, there was a third (December 29th of Showa 12 (1937)), a fourth (April 2nd of Showa 14 (1939)), a fifth (December 31st of the same year), a sixth (January 20th of Showa 16 (1941)), and a seventh (March 20th of Showa 17 (1942)) provisional agreement was concluded year after year to extend its effectiveness. Although it was a temporary band-aid measure, it ultimately avoided the worst-case scenario of a treaty-less situation. Of course, the Japanese government, standing on its legitimate rights, would not be satisfied with the aforementioned measures. In the worst-case scenario of a treaty-less situation, Japan's exercise of its rights would provoke the worst possible situation between Japan and the Soviet Union, which was not the intention of the Japanese government, which sought world peace. For the benefit of all mankind, Japan was willing to endure self-restraint and acquiesce to the aforementioned measures. Thus, the seventh agreement originally expired at the end of last year. At the same time, in accordance with the provision of "to replace with a new treaty that can be concluded in 1942 during the current negotiations" in the seventh agreement, after the conclusion of the seventh agreement, the Japanese government continued to urge the Soviet government to conduct deliberations on revising the treaty. Until the end of November, negotiations had not been successful, and the 8th provisional agreement was consulted on since December of that year. Before the start of the fishing season this year, Sato and Lozovsky reached an agreement in their meeting on the 23rd, and it was finally concluded on the 25th.

As a result, the exercise of Japanese rights this year can be smoothly promoted. However, the sincerity of the Japanese government in concluding a revised treaty is asserted on the basis of legitimate rights as stipulated in the Treaty of Portsmouth and the Japan-Soviet Basic Treaty. The Soviet government should also observe international good faith this year, and in light of the spirit of the Neutrality Treaty, abandon all suspicions and anxieties, make an open announcement, accommodate Japan's demands, and promptly establish a revised treaty, so that relations between the two countries will become clearer as a result, and that the ambitions of Britain and the United States to dominate the world can be repelled, and that a contribution can be made to the construction of a new world for the common prosperity of nations.

Asahi Shimbun Editorial

Soviet territory fisheries are the foundation of Japan's North Pacific fisheries. What Japan's ancestors pioneered cost the Japanese people precious blood during the past Russo-Japanese War, and it was exchanged for these undying fishing rights. This was reconfirmed in the Japan-Soviet Basic Treaty. There is no need to repeat it here.

The operation of these fishing rights is regulated by the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Agreement. Needless to say, the eighth Japan-Soviet Provisional Fisheries Agreement that has now been concluded is an extremely appropriate thing. In the current tense international environment, especially as the British and American camps continue to spread rumors of a Japan-Soviet crisis, and are using all means to instigate estrangement between Japan and the Soviet Union, the conclusion of this agreement is of great significance. Japan-Soviet relations are firmly established due to the Neutrality Treaty between the two countries. Foreign Minister Tani also stated in the January Diet that Japan respects the Neutrality Treaty and will not change its policy of diplomacy toward the Soviet Union. This policy is based on the prerequisite that the Soviet Union also observes the Neutrality Treaty. The fact that the Fisheries Agreement has been successfully concluded this time also completely demonstrates the Soviet government's spirit of observing the Neutrality Treaty. The maintenance of normal Japan-Soviet relations has now been reaffirmed.

If we want to point out dissatisfaction, then the fisheries agreement that has now been concluded is only a provisional agreement with a term of one year for this year, and this provisional agreement has been renewed as many as eight times. This agreement, which is renewed once a year, is truly cumbersome. We hope that the long-term Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty, which is clearly stated in the agreement, will be concluded as soon as possible, so that Japan-Soviet neutral relations can be established on a foundation of certainty and permanence.

Here, the provisional agreement for this year was able to bring temporary relief, but we re-emphasize that the long-term Japan-Soviet Basic Fisheries Treaty, which we have hoped for for many years, should be concluded as soon as possible this year. (Sho: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, March 27)

### Purchase of Cooking Oil with House Tax Receipts; Sales Scheduled to Begin Tomorrow; Distribution Standard Based on Number of People per Household; Price of $2.55 per Four Ounces per Person

The supply of cooking oil in this city is scheduled to continue from tomorrow. The total amount to be distributed this time is estimated to be over 10,000 piculs. The method of sale is to purchase with winter house tax receipts. Each person is limited to four ounces. Details are recorded below.

Universal Supply, No Need to Rush

The sale of cooking oil this time will be distributed according to the population of each district and Baojia, and supplied to designated cooking oil retailers (all with numbered signs assigned by this office) for universal sale. Citizens will surely be able to purchase it, so there is no need to rush.

To avoid congestion, the names, numbers and addresses of all designated retailers in each district have been tabulated and posted for easy reference. If there is anything that is not clear, you can inquire at the retailer. Furthermore, the sale this time is only for soybean oil, which is priced at $1.836 per market catty, including taxes and war bonds, or $10.02 in legal tender (each four ounces costs $2.55).

Sales Method Has Been Determined

(1) In the Public Settlement and Hongkou, winter house tax receipts and the citizen's certificate of the head of the household must be presented. (2) In the French Concession, receipts for house taxes for the months of November and December and the identity card of the head of the household must be presented. (3) In Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong and Huxi, household registration certificates and the residence permit of the head of the household must be presented. (4) Each person is limited to four ounces this time, based on the number of people given rice on the back of the house tax receipt or the number of people listed on the household registration certificate. Regardless of the number of people in each household, the purchase should be made all at once and then distributed evenly without any withholding. (5) Daily sales hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

Implementation of Distribution by Headcount Still Pending

Regarding the issue of cooking oil supply in this city, the authorities of the two concessions issued a cooking oil certificate along with the rice and flour purchase certificates last month, in preparation for distribution by headcount. However, because the required amount of oil has not yet been sufficiently transported from the production areas, and the factories in this city have not been able to produce and squeeze it, it has not yet been implemented. The cooking oil industry wholesale department, seeing that residents are in urgent need of oil, has agreed to restore the method of selling oil by house tax receipts, with the approval of the military allocation authorities, as a temporary measure. The date on which the system of allocation by headcount with oil purchase certificates will be implemented is still pending a decision from the relevant parties.

31st Issue of Rice on Sale Starting Today

The 31st issue of rations for the two concessions will begin today. This time, each person can purchase two sheng of whole rice and half a sheng of broken rice for $7.50, and one catty and eight taels of flour for $3.50, totaling $11.

Sugar Allowance for Foreigners Increased to Two Catties

The English-language "Shanghai Times" reports that, according to reliable sources, the monthly sugar allowance for foreigners will be increased from 1.3 catties to 2 catties. The allowance for Chinese will remain at half a catty. Sugar purchase certificates for April have been issued and can be redeemed at designated retailers starting today.

### Donation Report for "Shen Bao" Readers' Scholarship Fund

The "Shen Bao" Readers' Scholarship Fund has been receiving donations from all walks of life in recent days in an endless stream. Yesterday, we received a generous donation of $1,000 from the gentlemen of the Sports Section of the Chinese Staff Club of the Municipal Council. We would like to thank them on behalf of the impoverished students. The scholarship donations received yesterday were: $1,000 from the Sports Section of the Chinese Staff Club of the Municipal Council, $100 from Liuyinxuan (submitted by Pu Jiting), and $5 from Mr. Yin, totaling $1,105 in legal tender. The remaining balance is $292,840.29.

### Restoration of Transportation Line in Eastern Zhejiang; Active Construction of Qiantang River Railway Bridge

Yesterday, a spokesman for the Army Press Department in Shanghai reported in detail on the construction in eastern Zhejiang, stating that since the Japanese army occupied Jinhua, it has been actively engaged in various construction projects, which are now making rapid progress. Regarding the transportation section, the railway from Jinhua to Meichi has been opened to traffic, and the route from Meichi to the northern bank of the Qiantang River is expected to be opened to traffic on the 15th of this month. In the future, the entire line from Jinhua to the southern bank of the Qiantang River can be declared complete. As for the Qiantang River Bridge, which was severely damaged in the war, the Japanese army is actively repairing it, and it is expected to be restored to its original state by next spring. This time, in addition to the Japanese army railway units, the construction relies on the cooperation of the China Railway Engineering Team and the local people to gradually restore the most difficult transportation construction. The completion of the railway is of profound importance to the lifeline of the country and the people. The restoration of the Zhejiang-East Railway can be transferred to Shanghai via Hangzhou, across the Jinghu (Shanghai-Nanjing) Railway to the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) Railway, to Dalian in Manchuria, and to Japan. In the future, it can also go from Japan through Korea, Manchuria, along the Jinpu Line through the Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Line to Vietnam, through Thailand and directly to Malaya. This is of great significance in the transportation aspect of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

### Retracing Footsteps in Japan of Yesteryear

— Zhou Fohai

A youth must have ideals, aspirations, and ambition. Otherwise, they lack a soul. Having ideals, aspirations, and ambition requires diligence, training, and effort. Otherwise, it's mere delusion. Not to be arrogant, but in my youth, I had a soul, yet I was never presumptuous. My youthful aspirations and diligent studies have already been written about in "Record of Diligent Studies." However, that article only covered up to studying abroad in Japan, entering the First Higher School in Tokyo, and graduating. Now, I will briefly describe my life during my study abroad period after that time, as well as my experiences engaging in social movements during summer vacations back home.

At that time, the Chinese government designated five Japanese national schools, and anyone who passed the entrance exam for one of these five schools would receive government funding. The five schools were the First Higher School (leading to the Imperial University after graduation), Higher Normal School, Higher Technical School, Higher Commercial School, and Chiba Pharmaceutical College. Among the five schools, the most prominent and admired by female students at the time was the First Higher School. Its students, wearing caps with two white stripes, draped in capes, yet shod in geta (wooden sandals), strutted down the street, heads held high, singing loudly. If they committed minor transgressions, not only would the police ignore them, but society would find them charming. At that time, I was determined to enter the First Higher School, but it was extremely difficult to get into. I greatly envied the Chinese students studying there. Now, I had actually passed the exam, and the hat with two white stripes was on my head. This not only meant that I would receive government funding, solving my financial problems, but also that my ideals had been realized. Therefore, my happiness at that time far surpassed that of an old scholar passing the civil service exam. After the results were announced, I immediately pre-borrowed one month's tuition (then thirty-six yen per month) from the Hunan students in Japan management office and went to Boshu to escape the summer heat and go swimming in the sea.

After school started, I began to study diligently. I woke up at six-thirty in the morning and went to bed at eleven at night, spending at most two hours resting out of the sixteen or seventeen hours each day. Because there was so much to learn, I was already extremely busy with schoolwork. The foreign language subject alone included English, German, and Japanese classical literature. However, these subjects could not satisfy my thirst for knowledge, and extracurricular work took up more time than schoolwork. First, reading Chinese classical books. Second, at that time, the tides of socialism and democracy were surging, especially the revolutions in Russia and Germany, which greatly stimulated young people. Therefore, I was very interested in them and diligently read related books and magazines. Third, I was also very interested in Western history and the international situation at the time. Because it was the end of World War I and the League of Nations was being established, reading related magazines and books also took up a lot of my time. Usually, I would read Chinese books from the time I woke up until I went to school. Sometimes, I would get so engrossed in reading that I would recite aloud, regardless of whether the Japanese students next door found it annoying. After returning from class, I would read extracurricular books and then have dinner. After dinner, I would go to the used bookstores near the Imperial University gate to browse, using it as a walk, for about an hour. I would read until after eleven at night, then drag out my bedding from the oshiire (closet) and go straight to sleep. On Sunday mornings, I would still study, and in the afternoon, I would walk to the Chinese Youth Association in Kanda to read Chinese newspapers or visit fellow countrymen. During my year in the preparatory course at the First Higher School, every day was like this. I not only did not socialize with Japanese classmates, but I also rarely interacted with Chinese friends. I had never been to Yoshiwara (red-light district) or Asakusa (entertainment district), and I had not even been to the movies once. Only on Sunday evenings, when the Chinese Youth Association showed movies, would I occasionally go. My only daily entertainment was visiting used bookstores after dinner. This experience made a deep impression on me, and I still often have dreams about it.

Because I read books on international affairs, I also gained some insights. In a moment of excitement, I wrote an essay analyzing the international situation at the time and predicting its trends, which I submitted to the "National Salvation Daily" in Shanghai, run by students who had returned from studying in Japan. It was actually published and received good reviews. My middle school history and geography teacher, Mr. Deng Zhuming, sent me a letter from afar to encourage me, praising me greatly. This was my debut work.

I lived this way for a year. After graduating from the preparatory course, students were assigned to different schools as usual. Because I wanted to choose a quiet place, I requested to be assigned to the Seventh Higher School in Kagoshima.

Kagoshima is located at the southern end of Japan, with beautiful scenery, a mild climate, and simple and honest people. It is the hometown of Saigo Takamori, truly a wonderful place. At that time, there were thirteen or fourteen Chinese students at the Seventh Higher School. Chen Tian'ou, who served as a section chief under me for more than two years when I was the director of the political department of the headquarters, and who served as my secretary for more than five years when I was the director of the Jiangsu Education Department, and who later served as my secretary again when I was the minister of the Ministry of Civil Service, was a classmate at that time and arrived in Kagoshima a year before me. After I left Chongqing, he is still serving as a secretary in the Ministry of Civil Service. My old friend who helped me for ten years is still struggling in the officialdom and cannot realize his ambitions. I truly feel sorry for him. Moreover, now that we are separated by mountains and rivers, and letters are difficult to send, how can the sight of the setting moon on the roof beams not make one nostalgic for old friends and feel sorrowful!

In the first year, besides schoolwork, I only focused on reading books on socialism and international affairs, and I had no time to read anything else. Outside of reading, my interest in writing essays and translating books greatly increased. That year, I translated the book "Overview of Social Problems," about sixty or seventy thousand words, and sold it to the Zhonghua Book Company, earning a manuscript fee of one hundred and twenty yuan. I saved this money for travel expenses to return home during the summer vacation to visit my family. At that time, Liang Qichao's faction ran a bi-monthly publication in Shanghai called "Liberation and Reconstruction," to which I often contributed. My articles were always published, and the manuscript fees were very generous. Most of this money was sent home to support my mother, and some was used to buy books.

My extracurricular entertainment consisted of sightseeing and going to the movies. Sakurajima, an island in the bay, is a volcano that erupted in 1915. When I went there, the summit still often emitted smoke, and the loquats and radishes on the island tasted especially good. Several classmates and I often rowed a small boat on Sundays to the island to play. Every afternoon, I would either ride my bicycle alone along the coast to the seaside cliffs called Isohama to see the sea, or climb the mountain behind the school called Shiroyama to enjoy the distant view. My movie-going friend was Chen Tian'ou. After dinner, the two of us would talk about movies and then, regardless of wind or rain, walk from our residence called Shiroyadani to the movie district, Tenmonkan Street. The round trip was about seven or eight li (Chinese miles), and we often ran in the rain at night, both of us holding an umbrella and wearing a pair of high-heeled geta. Sometimes, there was a good movie, but we had run out of money, and the government funding had not yet been sent from Tokyo. We would both be very anxious, hoping for the postman to arrive. However, if the postman came and delivered a regular letter, we would still be disappointed because remittance letters were always registered. I would sometimes tease him by entering from outside and shouting loudly, "Shorui!" (registered letter). He would think that the postman with the remittance had arrived and come out to look, only to find that it was me. Sometimes, while waiting for the postman, the fertilizer on the surrounding vegetable gardens would stink so badly that it would be annoying. Thus, I would loudly recite, "Before and after are manure buckets, no postman comes and goes," to amuse myself.

In the summer of 1920, I decided to return to Yuanling to visit my mother. After calculating, I had little money left besides the travel expenses. I wanted to make a suit, but after counting, I didn't have enough money to make one. So I had to return home wearing my student uniform. I didn't know that as soon as I arrived in Shanghai, I could no longer move forward. Because at that time, Zhang Jingyao was the military governor of Hunan, and our Hunan army rose up to drive out Zhang, the war situation was tense, and the roads were blocked. I didn't know about this situation at all in Kagoshima. This time, I was returning home entirely to visit my mother, but now I couldn't achieve my goal. Recalling how three years ago, when I left home to study abroad, my mother was sad herself but also afraid that I would be sad, so she hid in the kitchen and sobbed with her back to me, I wished I could immediately kneel at my mother's feet, fall into her arms, and comfort her. But thousands of miles away, what could I do besides looking at the white clouds and shedding tears of longing for my family? Writing to this point, imagining where my mother is now and what her situation is like, I truly feel so distressed that I don't want to live! Still using the methods of the Three Kingdoms period to engage in politics is really meaningless.

Since I couldn't go home, I planned to go to Hangzhou to play. Before leaving, I went to the Shishi Xinbao newspaper office to visit Zhang Dongsun, who was the editor of "Liberation and Reconstruction." Because of my contributions, I often corresponded with him. When I arrived at the newspaper office, he hadn't arrived yet. An editor with the surname Yu came out to greet me. Soon, a person came, who was an important figure in the Research Group, and who returned from a tour of Europe with Liang Qichao. I don't remember his name clearly. Yu introduced us, introducing me as someone named Zhou, who writes articles. His introduction was not wrong, but I was very unhappy. At that time, I had extraordinary ambitions and considered myself a future great politician or revolutionary leader. But now, I was being called "someone who writes articles," being seen as a mere writer. Thus, I felt it was a form of belittlement. Writers naturally have their value and importance, but my ambition was not there at the time. Later, when Zhang Dongsun arrived, we had a very投机 conversation. They often organized the "Mutual Learning Society" to translate famous works, and they asked me to translate one as well. I took on the task of translating Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution."

I stayed at the Zhiguo Temple in West Lake, and every day, besides translating books and reading, I would row a boat and climb mountains with a few friends. Sometimes, I would even jump into the lake to swim. I had visited every famous scenic spot near West Lake. However, West Lake was extremely hot in the summer. After the sun set, the lake water reflected the heat, making it feel especially stuffy. After staying for more than three weeks, because the heat was unbearable, I returned to Shanghai.

When I arrived in Shanghai, Zhang Dongsun told me that Chen Duxiu wanted to see me. Duxiu was originally a professor at Peking University, who hosted "New Youth" and promoted new ideas, which was disliked by the authorities at the time. So he resigned and came to Shanghai, and "New Youth" was also moved to Shanghai for publication. One day, Zhang Dongsun, Shen Yanbing, and I went to No. 2 Yuyang Lane, Huanlong Road (now it seems to have been renamed Mingde Lane) to visit Duxiu. At that time, Wu Tingkang, the Far East representative of the Third International from Russia, was present. Wu basically said, "Although the tide of new ideas in China is surging now, first, it is too complex, with anarchism, syndicalism, social democracy, and guild socialism, a mishmash with no mainstream, making the ideological world a chaotic situation. Second, there is no organization. There are many people who write articles and talk empty words, but there is no practical action at all. This will never be able to promote the Chinese revolution." His conclusion was that he hoped we would organize the "Chinese Communist Party." There was no result from the discussion that day. Dongsun did not agree, so he did not attend subsequent meetings. Yanbing and I agreed. After several meetings, it was decided to organize. Duxiu was responsible for the south, and Li Dazhao was responsible for the north. This was the so-called "Chen in the South, Li in the North" at the time. Those who joined in Shanghai at that time included Shao Lizi and Shen Xuanlu. Dai Jitao was also one. However, he said that as long as Mr. Sun Yat-sen was alive, he could not join another party. So although he drafted the initial draft of the "Chinese Communist Party Program," he did not join. At this time, it was only preparing the organization, and it had not been formally established. It was planned to establish organizations of a preparatory nature in Beijing, Hankou, Changsha, Guangzhou, and other places within a year, and then hold a conference of representatives from various regions in the summer of the following year to formally establish the party. As I was planning the plan and dispatching people to work separately, it happened that school was about to start, so I returned to the school in Kagoshima.

Why did I agree to organize the Communist Party and take the lead in participating? First, for two years, I had read many books on communism and the Russian Revolution. I unknowingly believed in the ideals of communism. At the same time, I was very dissatisfied with the politics of the warlords and bureaucrats in China at that time, and I was stimulated by the Russian Revolution, thinking that it was not enough to save China without eliminating those ruling classes and establishing a revolutionary government. This is the public reason. Second, there was a personal motive. An honest person doesn't do anything in secret, and a sincere person doesn't tell lies. I will never hide that there was a personal motive at that time: I will never tell a lie and say that the motive at that time was entirely for the country and the people. However, the personal motive was not to get promoted, not to get rich, and not to enjoy pleasure. It was like this at that time, it was like this later, and it is still like this now. Speaking of personal enjoyment, there is no one so stupid to do such stupid things. Even now, some people may think that our peace movement is for personal enjoyment. In fact, it is a great injustice. According to my personal situation now, I can't go to the movies that I love the most, I can't go to the old dramas that I love the most, I want to go to the park but I can't, I want to stroll on the road but I can't. At home, I am like a bird in a cage, and outside, I am like a prisoner being escorted. Every day, I only eat three meals and sleep on a bed. I can't乱作胡爲 like the warlords and bureaucrats of the past, indulging in extravagance and depravity. Not only that, but even the happiness that ordinary people can enjoy, I can't enjoy, and the things that ordinary people can do, I can't do. Is this situation enjoyment? Or is it suffering? Although I was a poor student at the time and could not foresee the situation now, I was definitely not aiming for this. The so-called personal motive at that time was political ambition, political ambition. At the First Higher School, it was around the time of the Paris Peace Conference, and diplomats from various countries were greatly showing off their talents. Therefore, I was very fascinated by Versailles at that time, harboring an ambition to become a great diplomat in the future who could negotiate and mediate, galloping on the international stage, and winning glory for the country. Later, after studying the history of the Russian Revolution, I had another ambition to become a revolutionary leader who could lead the broad masses of people, overthrow the ruling class, and establish a revolutionary regime. The impressions of figures such as Lenin and Trotsky often lingered in my mind. Tossing and turning, starting early and sleeping late, I wanted to become such a figure. Although I am now almost fifty years old and have achieved nothing, the豪情 of my intentions at that time could really soar to the clouds! A youth harboring such ambitions, and at a time when Chinese politics were corrupt and the revolutionary tide in the world was rising, how could I not organize a new revolutionary party based on the spirit of creation? This is the reason why I participated in the founding of the "Chinese Communist Party."

After returning to Kagoshima, besides attending classes, I still studied the writings of Marx, Lenin, and others, and published articles. At the same time, I wanted to lead the masses. Besides writing articles, the most important thing was public speaking. So I gathered a dozen Chinese classmates and organized a lecture meeting. We gave lectures once a week to practice public speaking. At that time, my classmates all said that I had a talent for public speaking and that my speeches were very moving. Hearing these encouragements, I became even more self-important, even calling myself the Chinese Lenin. Looking back now, it seems ridiculous, but in youth, one should have such a self-important attitude.

Several friends and I rented a house and prepared our own meals. We had Chinese food to eat every day, and life was more comfortable than in Tokyo. However, there were still many hardships. We would never change a pair of socks until they had holes in the bottom. There were many mosquitoes on summer nights, and we didn't have money to buy mosquito nets. Afraid of lighting mosquito coils, we could only use a newspaper to cover our heads. Although we could avoid mosquitoes, the ink smell of the newspaper was really disgusting! This year, I finished translating "Mutual Aid."

Then, I received letters from comrades in Shanghai, informing me that a conference of representatives would be held in July. Coincidentally, it was during the summer vacation, so I returned to Shanghai. The party affairs had developed really fast. Not only had the organizations we had planned last year been established in Shanghai, Hankou, Changsha, Beijing, and Guangzhou, but there was also a branch in Jinan. At that time, Chen Jiongming was in power in Guangdong and had not yet betrayed the revolution. So Duxiu went to Guangdong to serve as the chairman of the Guangdong Education Committee. Therefore, he could not personally preside over the conference of representatives. The representative from Guangdong was Gong Bo, from Beijing were Zhang Guotao and Liu Renjing, from Changsha were Mao Zedong and an old gentleman with the surname He, and from Hankou were Chen Tanqiu and Bao Huiseng. I don't remember who was from Jinan. Although Ding Mocun was not a representative, he was an active member of the CY (Communist Youth League) and was also in Shanghai. I was considered the representative of the students studying in Japan. In fact, no one from Kagoshima participated, and there was only one person, Shi Cuntong, from Tokyo. I was considered to represent Shi and myself. The Third International also sent Ma Lin as the supreme representative. Mao Zedong and three or four others and I lived upstairs at the Bowen Girls' School near Beile Road. At that time, the students were on summer vacation, so we rented it. There were no beds, so we all slept on the floorboards. For meals, we of course ate bao fan (a meal service). We held meetings every night at Li Hanjun's home on Beile Road. Ma Lin and Wu Tingkang also attended. On the fourth night of the meeting, Ma Lin, who had experience, said, "We must change places tomorrow night. We have been holding meetings here for several nights in a row, which will definitely attract the attention of the police." We said that since there was only one night left tomorrow and it was not easy to find another place, it would probably be fine. So we decided to stay in the same place. That afternoon, I suddenly had severe abdominal pain and diarrhea and couldn't go out. I slept on the floor thinking about the steps to carry out the work, and I fell asleep in a daze. At about twelve o'clock, I suddenly woke up and saw Mao Zedong poking his head into the room, gently asking me, "Has there been any trouble here?" I was shocked and asked him, and then I knew that something had happened.

It turned out that while they were holding a meeting, a stranger suddenly ran into the room. Because there were no guards at the door at that time, and Hanjun's home was shared with fellow villagers, no one stopped this person from going upstairs. After he entered the room and took a look, he said, "Sorry, wrong room." After he finished speaking, he immediately retreated. Ma Lin was actually sharp-eyed and said, "Quick, disband, it must be a detective." So they immediately disbanded the meeting. Only Gong Bo stayed to chat with Hanjun. In less than a quarter of an hour, French detectives, Annamese police, and Chinese informants surrounded the house and rushed upstairs. The detectives asked them why they were holding a meeting, and they said that everyone was a student from Peking University, who were discussing 出一种杂志和丛书, so they were holding a meeting. The detectives then asked why there were two foreigners. They said that the two were professors at Peking University, who had been invited to guide them. A Chinese detective pointed at Gong Bo and said, "Aren't you Japanese?" It turned out that although Gong Bo was confident that his Beijing dialect was as good as a Beijinger's, others felt that he sounded like a foreigner speaking Chinese. So they insisted that he was Japanese. After a long explanation, they were able to prove that he was from Guangdong. The police saw that Hanjun's bookshelf was full of socialist books, so they gave him a lecture, saying that he shouldn't read these books. After questioning for a while, they left. Fortunately, the police did not search them. Both of them had draft party programs in their pockets. If they had been found, there would have been no reason for them not to go to the police station! Gong Bo was on his honeymoon with his newlywed wife at the Dadong Hotel at the time. After the police left, he was afraid that someone would follow him, so he didn't dare to return to the hotel directly. He went around several amusement parks before returning to the hotel. Who knew that in the room right next to his, a case of adultery and murder occurred that night. Two shots were fired, killing a woman. Gong Bo's wife was really frightened out of her wits. Mao Zedong thought that the Bowen Girls' School must have also been discovered and was afraid to go back. He probed around from afar for a long time before daring to go in. These words were all what I heard them say later.

After listening to Mao Zedong's report, I felt that it was a pity that our efforts had fallen short. I discussed with him that we must continue the meeting tomorrow, but it was probably impossible within the Shanghai Concession. I suddenly remembered that Li Heming's (Jian) wife was from Jiaxing. Why not go to Jiaxing to hold the meeting? So I mustered my strength and ran to Yuyang Lane to discuss it, because Heming lived in Duxiu's home. We discussed and decided that Heming's wife would take the morning train to Jiaxing tomorrow and first hire a large boat to wait. We would take the second train and take a boat tour of South Lake. So we notified everyone separately that night. On the second day, people went to the North Station in twos and threes to board the train. I also went, despite my illness. When we arrived in Jiaxing, Heming's wife was already waiting at the station and escorted us onto the boat. The locals thought we were touring South Lake and didn't pay much attention. We sailed the boat into the lake, and suddenly a heavy rain poured down. We started the meeting on the boat, passed the party program and the party organization, and elected Chen Duxiu as chairman, I as vice-chairman, Zhang Guotao as head of the organization department, and Li Heming as head of the propaganda department. Before Duxiu arrived in Shanghai, I was acting as chairman. The "Chinese Communist Party" was thus formally established in a lone boat in the misty rain and vast lake. At that time, we had full of hope for this party and were determined to devote all our energy to fighting for it. Who knew that bad elements would join later, and it would become worse and worse, eventually turning into bandits who killed, burned, and massacred cities and villages, as cruel as Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng. Therefore, most of the figures at the First National Congress later announced their withdrawal from the party. Gong Bo went to Guangdong not long after, and then went to the United States to study, essentially withdrawing from the party. Li Hanjun, Li Heming, and I withdrew in 1924 or 1925. Liu Renjing was expelled and became a Trotskyist. Our supreme leader at the time, Chen Duxiu, also withdrew in 1926 or 1927. Zhang Guotao was still active in the east for a long time after the Kuomintang launched a campaign to suppress the Communists, but he also withdrew in 1937 and is now in Chongqing, working with Chen Lifu to carry out anti-communist work. I met Duxiu in Nanjing in the autumn of 1937 and Guotao in Hankou in the spring of 1938. Recalling the past, I have a sense of being in another world. When we founded the Communist Party, we never dreamed that it would deteriorate to become bandits. The person who started it is truly guilty!

After the congress, we assigned responsible persons to various places to go and work separately, and at the same time, we became active in Shanghai. We felt that practical work should start with the labor movement. So we established a "Labor Union Secretariat" to launch and direct the Shanghai labor movement. "Labor Union" is a Japanese term. "Secretariat" is a translation of a Russian term. Combining a Japanese term and a Russian term to form the name of a labor movement organization took a lot of thought and shows how naive we were at the time. But the spirit of hard work is admirable. For example, the workers in the Japanese-run yarn mills wanted to learn Japanese. I opened a Japanese night school in the area where the workers lived. I myself went to teach for two hours every other night. We all lived up to the slogan of "Go to the people." Not only that, the funds at that time were provided by Russia. Ma Lin and I met not at the New World, the Great World, but on the rooftop garden of the Wing On Company. Just as the secret work was in full swing, the summer vacation was coming to an end, and I had to return to school to attend classes. So I repeatedly telegraphed Duxiu to come to Shanghai to hand over the work before going to Kagoshima. Duxiu did resign from his position in Guangdong and came to Shanghai. Who knew that an unexpected event would suddenly occur after he arrived in Shanghai.

I don't remember now, but for some reason, Duxiu and Ma Lin had different opinions, although they had not met. Duxiu was a tough guy and insisted that Ma Lin admit his mistake before he would meet him. But Ma Lin refused to admit his mistake. While we were at loggerheads, one day I was at Duxiu's home discussing a compromise solution when Duxiu's wife pulled me into playing cards. It was extremely 滑稽. Duxiu's wife, Yang Mingzhai (a Shandongese who returned from Russia), and I started playing mahjong. Duxiu and Lizi were talking upstairs. Suddenly, Bao Huiseng ran over and said, "I just came from Fudeli and met Miss Yang on the road going to your place." It turned out that my secret residence was in Fudeli, Chengdu Road. I was in love with Shuhui at that time, who had been introduced to me by Heming's wife. After hearing Huiseng's words, I let him play my cards and returned to Fudeli. Shuhui was waiting for me, and I asked her to take a walk in the French Park. When passing Yuyang Lane, she wanted to see Duxiu's wife, but I stopped her. After walking in the park, I sent her home and went to see Ma Lin. He asked me to bring a letter to Duxiu, even taking out the title of representative of the Third International, and saying to Duxiu in the letter, "If you are a true communist, you must listen to the orders of the Third International." I took this letter back to Yuyang Lane, and it was already dusk. I knocked on the back door, and suddenly a Shandong man asked, "Who are you looking for?" I said, "Mr. Chen." He said, "He's not home." I immediately felt very strange and quickly left. I thought there was no one like this in Duxiu's family, so why was he so fierce? Not long after I returned to Fudeli, Chen Wangdao ran over in a panic and said, "Duxiu, Lizi, Huiseng, Mingzhai, and Duxiu's wife have all been arrested and taken to the police station. Your place must be very dangerous. Quickly burn the important documents and hide." After hearing the news, I was very surprised. Later, I heard everyone say that this was the whole story. It turned out that half an hour after I left, the police came and surrounded the place, arresting everyone. Huiseng took my place, and since he didn't report Miss Yang's matter, of course it was me who was arrested, not him. If I had listened to Shuhui and gone to see Duxiu's wife when I passed Yuyang Lane, Shuhui and I would have been arrested as well. I escaped these two dangers. What a coincidence! This is not the only danger, there was still danger. It turned out that Duxiu did not admit that he was Chen Duxiu after arriving at the police station. The police station thought that they had not arrested Chen Duxiu, so they ordered the informant guarding his room to arrest anyone who went to Chen's house, regardless of who they were. It happened that Chu Fucheng went to visit Duxiu, and the informant arrested Chu without asking questions. When Chu arrived at the police station, the superiors recognized him and asked him why he went to Chen's house. He of course said that he was visiting Chen. They then asked him if he knew Chen Duxiu. He said how could he visit him if he didn't know him. The police station personnel said that they would take him to see him. So they took him to the detention place. Duxiu was about to gesture to him not to point him out, but Chu shouted loudly, "Duxiu, what's going on!" So the matter was exposed. The police station then notified the informant guarding Chen's house that Chen Duxiu had been arrested and that no one else should be arrested, and I went to deliver the letter after the informant received the notification. Otherwise, I would also have been arrested. If the documents of the representative of the Third International had been found on my body, I would have been caught red-handed, and wouldn't I have been sentenced to several years in prison? These words were all what everyone told me later after they came out. I escaped this third danger, which was really a blessing for everyone. Otherwise, a group of people would have been imprisoned for several years. Lizi and Duxiu's wife were released on bail that night. But rescuing Duxiu was very troublesome. At this time, another important thing happened.

It turned out that in 1921, the United States convened the Washington Naval Conference. The Third International believed that this was a conference to carve up small and weak nations, so it convened a Conference of the Toiling Peoples of the East in Irkutsk to plan resistance. China was to convene sixty or seventy representatives of workers, peasants, merchants, and youths to send to attend. The time was very short, and there was no preparation, which made me very anxious. After discussing it several times, we sent people to convene people from major cities in the south, centered on Guangzhou, and major cities in the north, centered on Beijing. I personally went to the Yangtze River area. So I entrusted the matter of rescuing Duxiu to Lizi and others, and took a direct ship to Changsha.

When I crossed to Japan, the ship I took from Changsha to Shanghai was not only not a steerage cabin, but not even a fourth-class cabin. I sat and slept on bags of rice being shipped to Shanghai. This time, in order to disguise myself, I took a first-class cabin. When I ate for the first time, five or six waiters stood around serving the rice, and I felt very uneasy sitting there because it was my first experience. I thought that since we are all human beings, why can we sit and eat while they have to stand and serve? But after two or three days, I got used to it and didn't feel uneasy anymore. It can be seen that a person's sincere and pure soul can easily be corrupted. However, I still had a very strong basic concept of respecting humanity. I would never scold my adjutants unless they did something wrong, not to mention my other subordinates. But some people still said that I was a bureaucrat and had a big airs. This is a great injustice. There were many people I couldn't meet, but I really didn't have time. My time was to be used for the most effective work, how could I use it to listen to other people's resumes and complaints? There was not enough time to spare, and I even had to meet guests and deal with matters on Sundays. It was natural that I was not thoughtful enough, but how could I have big airs? Maybe my environment made me look like a bureaucrat, but in fact, my scholar nature has never changed in the slightest. There are many misunderstandings. Last year, when I returned from Japan, I took a night train from Shanghai to Nanjing. The weather was cold and early, and I never expected that anyone would pick me up at the station. When I got off the train, I saw senior colleagues from the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank standing in front of the train. I thought there were only a few people, so I nodded and thanked them before leaving the station. Later, someone told me that many people from the Social Movement Association and other agencies had gone to pick me up at the time, and they scolded me for having big airs because I didn't greet them. In fact, how did I know that so many people were going to pick me up? There is no need to explain these things, and I don't ask for anyone's understanding. But writing to this point, I can't help but naturally write it down. Let's get back to the topic and not say any more off-topic words.

When I arrived in Changsha, I stayed at the famous Dajixiang Hotel at the time. I went to see Mao Zedong overnight. He was running an Autonomy University at Zenggong Temple at the time. There were no professors, and there were no classes, but it was called a university, which shows the chaos in the cultural world at the time after the May Fourth Movement. He lived in the school. After I went in, I saw him reading a book under the lamp from a distance. It turned out that he was using a red pen to circle Li Houzhu's poems. He was startled when he saw me suddenly arrive. I told him the whole story, and we discussed the solution overnight. Within three days, we gathered more than twenty people. Of course, most of them were young students, and there was not a single farmer, but there were two or three workers. I met them separately, set the date and place for the meeting, and distributed travel expenses before leaving Changsha. Although the warlords at that time did not have special agents and there was no Blue Shirts Society, they did have their detective teams, but they were not very sensitive. Half a day after I boarded the boat, Zhao Hengti sent someone to search the Dajixiang. Last year, I decided to go home to visit my mother, but the road was blocked. This year, I arrived in Changsha but could not go home. The affairs of the world are really beyond human calculation! Not only could I not go home, but also because of the secret work, I couldn't send letters from Changsha, so I left Changsha in disappointment.

When I arrived in Hankou, I went to Wuchang to look for Chen Tanqiu. He was a teacher in a middle school. After discussing with him, we gathered more than ten people within two days. I went to visit the Yellow Crane Tower with him in my spare time. Looking at the scenery of the Yangtze River, it was really "Where is

### Materials Control Deliberation Committee Holds First Meeting in Shanghai Yesterday, Approves Four Important Cases

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) The National Government, in order to strengthen materials control and urge the National Commercial Control Association to perfect its operational functions, established the Materials Control Deliberation Committee. It held its first meeting at 4:30 PM yesterday (the 1st) on the third floor of the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank at No. 15 Huangpu Beach Road, Shanghai. All committee members and staff attended. First, Chairman Zhou Fohai presided and reported on the significance of establishing the Materials Control Deliberation Committee. Then, Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the National Commercial Control Association, reported on the organization and establishment of the association. Immediately afterward, four important cases were passed for deliberation until the meeting adjourned at approximately 8:00 PM. Details are as follows:

Attending Committee Members and Staff

Those attending included Chairman Zhou Fohai, Committee Member and Minister of Industry Mei Siping, Minister of Food Gu Baoheng, Minister of Construction Chen Junhui, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance Shao Shijun, General Manager He Bingxian, Chairman of the National Commercial Control Association Tang Shoumin, Committee Members from the Japanese authorities Minister Horiuchi, Minister Tajiri, Chief Secretary and Vice Minister of Industry Yuan Yuqian, Secretary Wang Jiajun, Director Tao Guoxian, Director Liu Ruxiang, Director Yin Yixuan, Director Tang Wenjie, Counselor Zhang Shizheng, Deputy Director Zhang Jun, Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau Wang Zhigang, Foreign Affairs Consultants Okada, Consultant Kabashima, Investigator Monota, Investigator Kuwahara, Secretary Toganaga, Secretary Ishisato, Major Suzutani, Accounting Lieutenant Colonel Shiomi, Accounting Captain Ishii, Director of the Economic Department Ishii, Director of the Economic Department Okuda, Colonel Nagai, Colonel Itotsuchi, Colonel Shimazu, Lieutenant Colonel Fukuchi, and 33 others.

Chairman Zhou's Report

Chairman Zhou Fohai reported on the significance of establishing the Materials Control Deliberation Committee, stating: After the National Government entered the war, it passed the wartime economic policy outline at the National Defense Conference, with the highest goals of ensuring military needs and stabilizing people's livelihoods. The main means of implementation are to increase production, conserve consumption, stabilize prices, regulate finance, and transform economic institutions. Based on this policy, the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Materials Movement were promulgated on March 11th of this year. At the same time, with the cooperation of friendly nations, the regulations on the movement of materials in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were lifted, allowing free flow of materials in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, except for the Shanghai area. In order to complete the purchase and distribution agencies, the government promulgated the Provisional Regulations of the National Commercial Control Association on March 11th. In accordance with these regulations, the National Commercial Control Association was established to handle materials control matters and assist the government in implementing national policies. By order of the Executive Yuan, Tang Shoumin was appointed as Chairman, Wu Zhenxiu and others as Directors, Wen Lanting as Supervisor, and Zhou Zuomin and others as Supervisors. It was established on March 15th and began operations. Subsequently, in order to improve the operation of the materials control and the National Commercial Control Association, the government established the Materials Control Deliberation Committee. The National Government specifically appointed me as Chairman, and Minister of Industry Mei Siping and others as Committee Members, and also invited Minister Horiuchi and others from friendly nations as Committee Members. Furthermore, staff were appointed under the committee to assist in the committee's affairs. The Executive Yuan appointed Vice Minister of Industry Yuan Yuqian as Chief Secretary, Director Wang Jiajun of the Ministry of Industry and others as Secretaries, and invited Investigator Monota and others from friendly nations as Secretaries. The committee has two tasks: on the one hand, it is a deliberation body of the National Government, and on the other hand, it is a communication and liaison body between China and Japan in materials control. The mission of the committee is very important. As the committee's work begins, I have been ordered to serve as Chairman. I feel that I am not talented enough and fear the dangers of my position. Moreover, the intricacies of materials control are numerous. Without careful planning, the National Commercial Control Association's operation, the organization of lower-level agencies, and the operation of purchase and distribution agencies will not succeed. I deeply hope that everyone will assist together. Today, all of you from friendly nations present are deeply aware of China's economic situation and have provided great assistance to the National Government's economic administration in the past. In the future, I hope that everyone will continue to exert their efforts to assist the committee so that it can exert its strength and fulfill the mission of ensuring military needs and stabilizing people's livelihoods.

Important Cases Passed for Deliberation

(1) Passed the translation of the organizational outline of the Upper House of Parliament; (2) Amended and passed the essential guidelines for the implementation of materials control; (3) Passed the essential guidelines for the establishment and implementation of the National Commercial Control Association; (4) Amended and passed the organizational outline of the National Commercial Control Association and the description and diagram of the purchase and distribution system.

### Public Notes Issued by Member Banks to be Honored by the United Bank

In order to strengthen the reserves of member banks, the United Bank Reserve Committee stipulates in accordance with the articles of association that member banks should submit property as reserves and issue public notes and treasury certificates for 70% of the assessed value of the property submitted by the member banks. These public notes and treasury certificates are registered and can be used as collateral to borrow at full value from the committee and member banks. At the same time, treasury certificates can be exchanged for public notes from the committee. The committee uses the following funds as reserves to meet public notes: (1) Funds deposited by member banks. (2) Balance of funds collected and paid by member banks on behalf of the committee. (3) Funds borrowed from other banks. As for public notes issued by member banks, holders who wish to cash them can request the committee to honor them at any time. The committee then collects the funds from the bank that used the public notes. However, if the market price of the reserve property submitted by member banks falls, they must be notified to replenish it at any time. If the replenishment is not fulfilled, the committee may sell the depreciated reserve property at the market price to offset the various notes used. The surplus is returned to the bank that used the notes, and the deficit is still collected.

### Economic Bureau Investigates Silver Houses and Pawnshops' Loans Secured by Commodities

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Recently, local merchants in the city have been using loans secured by commodities from silver houses and pawnshops to raise funds for hoarding and speculation, causing prices to rise and the people's livelihood to decline. It is reported that the Municipal Economic Bureau, in accordance with the provisions of the subsidiary rules for the regulation of loans secured by commodities of silver houses and pawnshops under the central government's provisional regulations for stabilizing prices, is thoroughly investigating the commodity-secured loan situation of various silver houses and pawnshops in the city in order to effectively prevent the above-mentioned abuses. They have formulated a survey form and instructed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the silver and pawnshop guilds, notifying the various firms to fill it out and submit it within the prescribed time.

### Shanghai Coal Industry Federation Decides on Control Measures

The Shanghai Coal Industry Federation, in view of the many aspects of coal industry management that need to be improved, has decided on the following control measures.

Merchants selling coal separately north of the Suzhou River

(including the two concessions, Nanshi, Huxi, etc.) must uniformly join the Shanghai Special Municipality Coal Small Retailers Federation and be under the control of the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company.

Merchants selling coal separately south of the Suzhou River

(including Hongkou, Zhabei, etc.) must uniformly join the Hongkou Coal Small Retailers Association and accept the instructions of the Shanghai Coal Federation. In addition to those who have already applied to join the association, approximately 340 coal small retailers must join the Shanghai Special Municipality Coal Small Retailers Federation, and approximately 40-50 (including Japanese merchants) must join the Hongkou Coal Small Retailers Distribution Association. These coal small retailers operate in the following areas according to the rules of the trade union!

(1) The sales area of members of the association is the area approved by the former Asia Development Board, Huazhong Liaison Department, as the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company. (2) If a member of the association has insufficient coal inventory, they should report it to the trade union. (3) Members of the association should post the retail price list in a prominent place at the door of the store. (4) The retail price of members of the association should comply with the price set by the former Asia Development Board, Huazhong Liaison Department, and should not exceed this price limit. Violators will be severely punished. (Mainland New Daily, March 31)

### Discussion on the Implementation of Commercial Control (2)

– Gao Maodong

(2) Establish a permanent inventory system to control various industries. Ordinary higher-level agencies often rely on laws and regulations to exercise their supervisory and governing powers over their lower-level agencies. In the control system, this supervisory power also has its important function, but it cannot achieve the function of controlling the receipt and payment of materials. To achieve this goal, a method must be designed to directly control the accounts of lower-level agencies. What is this method? It is to establish a controlling permanent inventory system. After the establishment of this accounting system, the inventory of various industries can be obtained at any time on the books of the Control Association. This can be achieved by using the methods used in cost accounting, but at the same time, the spirit of government accounting must also be adopted, and various memorandum records must be used to ensure that the accounting records are fully in line with the allocation of public affairs. With this approach, the so-called overall planning will have a precise numerical basis. The current registration method for registering inventory of various industries seems to be consistent with the above-mentioned accounting system advocated by this writer, as it uses records of receipt and payment balances. However, judging from the current situation of inventory surveys, inquiries are more common than inspections, which shows that the current method does not seem to have established a controlling permanent inventory system, so that investigators cannot compare the balance of the controlling account of the Control Association with the clear inventory account of various industries, thus greatly reducing the effectiveness of the inspection. In my humble opinion, the Commercial Control Association should raise the authority of the accounting function, establish a special accounting department, and establish a controlling permanent inventory system for various industries under commercial control. Then, with a book in hand, the materials of various industries in the country will be clear at a glance, and no one will dare to be vague.

(3) Implement warehouse management. Hoarding is an obstacle to control, and warehouses are a tool for hoarding. Merchants use warehouses and transfer warehouse receipts for speculative transactions, thereby undermining control. Therefore, to implement control, hoarding must be stopped, and to stop hoarding, warehouse management must be implemented. According to the current registration method, it is also a method of managing inventory, but it is not as strict and effective as implementing warehouse management. In modern economic society, only prices can control everything, and warehouse management is the way to control prices. Being able to control prices means being able to control the economy. For example, the central bank can control finance by raising and lowering interest rates only because it has the most abundant funds. The principle is the same.

### Commentary: The Financial Industry Should Support Small Industries

Yesterday, the financial industry and the production industry were discussed. Now, the importance of the financial industry's support for small industries is discussed. Generally, the small industries and handicrafts in our country, either due to insufficient funds or poor management, are small in scope and have not been fully developed. These industries account for the vast majority in our country, and their effectiveness and importance to the economy and society should not be underestimated. According to a survey by the Social Affairs Bureau in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), there were 26,128 shops in Shanghai (excluding the concessions) that also had handicraft characteristics, and 5,874 purely handicraft factories. Although there are no complete statistics now, it is generally increasing. Scattered in various places, such as textiles, bamboo and wood, ceramics, and other categories, the output is also considerable. At a time when materials are scarce today, the promotion of these small industries and handicrafts is imperative.

The financial industry should find a proper outlet here, which is to gradually prosper small-scale industries. The methods for the financial industry to support these industries are: first, financial assistance, such as loans for purchasing materials, loans for production, and loans for transportation and sales. The second is technical assistance, such as factory site selection, equipment allocation, improvement of manufacturing methods, planning of production and sales policies, and all other technical issues. After banks have more contact with these small industries, if they encounter similar natures, it is easy to promote cooperation between them, so that production efficiency will become more and more powerful. Then, the seedlings of today's industries will become a forest in the future, which will be a highlight of our country's industry, all stemming from the support of the financial industry today.

### Spokesperson of the Japanese Army Department Talks About the Results of the Su-Huai Mopping-Up Campaign

The spokesperson of the Japanese Army Department's Press Department in Shanghai reported the results of the Su-Huai mopping-up campaign at a reception for Chinese journalists yesterday. He said, "Since the Su-Huai war zone was jointly fought by the Chinese and Japanese armies, significant results have been achieved. When the Japanese army launched an offensive in Su-Huai, its main purpose was to annihilate the 89th Army under Han Deqin and the 8th Brigade of the 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army. Now, there are only a very small number of remaining New Fourth Army troops in Liutanghe near Hongze Lake. The Japanese army continues to mop them up, burying 320 enemy corpses. Han Deqin once asked Gu Zhutong of the Third War Zone in Chongqing for help. Wang Zhonglian's troops, the commander of the Yu-Su-Wan Border Region in Chongqing, provided assistance and infiltrated the Su-Huai area across the Jinpu Line. After being detected by the Japanese army, they immediately dispatched troops to surround more than 2,000 of Wang's troops in Suxian, inflicting heavy losses and burying 370 corpses. Since the start of the mopping-up campaign, they have been in contact with the 7th Brigade of the New Fourth Army in the South Jin of Chaohu Lake, and contact has also occurred at Xiatangji in Huainan. According to the spokesperson, the number of enemy troops recently surrendering and being captured has increased significantly. The reasons are estimated to be: (1) The Chongqing army has now clearly understood Japan's current policy. Since making factual expressions on the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the transfer of enemy property, they recognize Japan's sincerity towards our country and realize that blindly fighting only harms the national economy and people's livelihood. (2) After China and Japan cooperated in the joint operation, the sincere cooperation between China and Japan has been demonstrated. At the same time, the peace zone is becoming more and more prosperous and thriving, which is deeply moving. (3) The supply has been cut off and they have fallen into poverty. (4) The political power of the National Government is spreading everywhere, so they are grateful."
