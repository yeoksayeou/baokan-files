### On the Burmese War Situation

Mr. Nakajima, a minister in the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, clearly stated on the 27th of this month regarding the recent developments in the Greater East Asia War: "The anti-Axis forces intend to recapture Burma, but their preemptive offensive has been broken by Japan." This is the simplest explanation of the current Burmese war situation.

The importance of Burma in the East Asian war has long been recognized by all parties. Its importance is inseparable from the military, political, and economic aspects of the warring parties. Militarily, Burma is located at the westernmost end of the Greater East Asia War zone, between India, Chongqing, and the South Seas, and plays a pivotal role for both sides of the war. If the anti-Axis forces can control Burma, then firstly, they can advance northeast into the provinces of 省 (Guangdong), and this will allow the troop strength of these provinces to be transferred to 粵 (Yue), 湘 (Xiang), 贑 (Gan), 鄴 (Ye), and even 陝 (Shaanxi), 豫 (Henan), etc., without the need to divide and defend the poor frontiers of the southwest. Secondly, in the southeast direction, they can control the heartland of Vietnam and Thailand in the north, and support the back of Malaya in the south, coordinating with the navy in the Southwest Pacific from both air and land to peer into the South Sea Islands. Conversely, if the Japanese army can consolidate its occupation of Burma, the situation will be completely different. Not only can it protect the Japanese army's initial development and mobilization work, but it can also ensure a favorable posture for the offensive against India, and the anti-Axis forces' so-called "Pacific Counter-Offensive" will be forever difficult to achieve.

The important military position of Burma is as mentioned above, but its political and economic significance cannot be ignored. From a political perspective, Burma is the link between Chongqing and India, and it is also the vanguard position for Britain and the United States to control southwestern China from the mainland. Therefore, once Burma loses its independence and is controlled by Britain and the United States, the gateway to southwestern China will be wide open, and Britain and the United States will be able to take whatever they want. Therefore, China cannot completely break free from its colonial status and achieve independence and integrity. Conversely, if Burma can truly become independent, it can not only serve as a barrier for southwestern China, but also boost the morale of the Indian national independence struggle, and ultimately end the fate of British and American dominance in East Asia.

From an economic perspective, Burma is the Ukraine of India, and Burma is also the Caucasus of East Asia! In the former case, it is because Burmese rice has always been relied upon for the Indian people's food. Now, because Burma has been separated from India, it has not been two years, and the severity of the famine in eastern India has filled Calcutta, the "London of India," with starving people. Recently, Reuters had to send a telegram about people behaving like animals due to hunger! In the latter case, the oil production in Burma has great significance for the military and economic situation of India and Chongqing, but today it is used to attack India and Chongqing! At the same time, since Burma declared independence and nationhood on August 1 and declared war on Britain and the United States, all its resources, power, and even manpower have been determined to contribute to the final victory of Greater East Asia, and the severity of the blow to the anti-Axis countries cannot be described in words!

The anti-Axis countries naturally feel very painful about the situation in Burma! It is true that Britain and the United States are focusing their efforts on dealing with Germany in their global strategy, but the pain in their hearts over the decline of their imperialist hegemony in the East is far greater than their concern for Europe. Therefore, their ambition for East Asia - that is, their ambition to restore their position in East Asia - has never been forgotten. Especially for Burma, they are eager to strive for it because: without striving for Burma, it is not enough to shield India; without striving for Burma, they cannot fully implement their promise to aid Chongqing, nor can they support Chongqing's dragging out the war; without striving for Burma, they cannot establish a unified front among the land, sea, and air forces of the anti-Axis forces in the "Pacific counter-offensive" operation. But how to strive for Burma? Because the navy from the Mediterranean has not yet been able to move to the Indian Ocean, and because the air force and navy in the Pacific are in the distress of "consuming one ton of bombs per square," they mainly rely on the military forces of India and Chongqing, especially the latter. According to recent telegrams, the troop strength concentrated in the Nujiang and Dianshui areas of southern Yunnan is extremely large in number. At the same time, after the Commander-in-Chief of the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia held a military conference in India, there was news of him flying to Chongqing to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. Their meticulous planning for the war in Burma is clearly evident!

However, the supporter of Burmese independence is the Japanese military authorities, the protector of the East Asian people. They will not ignore this ambition and strategy of the anti-Axis forces in the slightest. On the contrary, they are never in a defensive position of being beaten passively, but firmly maintain the posture of an attacker. When the anti-Axis forces have not yet made a decision, they first launched military and political offensives. In the political aspect, as early as August 1, they helped Burma achieve independence and nationhood, and then assisted the Philippines in achieving complete independence and the Indian Provisional Government in announcing its establishment. In front of the oppressed colonial peoples, they used facts to explain the significance of the Greater East Asia War and exposed the true face of British and American imperialists. This political offensive is the greatest military cooperation, and its strength is still difficult to estimate now. Following closely behind the political offensive is the military counter-attack. The Nujiang River West Bank and Dianshui operations over the past two weeks can be said to have fundamentally dealt a powerful blow to the "recapture Burma plan." Even in the United States, this has been particularly noted in recent days. A Central News Agency telegram from the capital of Argentina on the 27th pointed out the precarious situation of the Chongqing army on the Nujiang River, giving the Americans great stimulation. The United States has admitted that the goal of the Japanese army's operation is to encircle and completely annihilate the Chongqing army on the west bank of the Nujiang River. Now, the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission's communiqué also admits that the elite Japanese troops are conducting lightning attacks and fierce assaults on the west bank of the Nujiang River, seizing river crossing points, and have a momentum of crossing the river eastward. Of course, it is not yet time to make a comprehensive assessment of the war situation in western Yunnan, southern Yunnan, and even the entire western Burma, but the overall situation is quite clear. We can already say that the anti-Axis forces' slogan of "recapturing Burma" has been shouted for a year, just like the "second front" in Europe, it is just empty talk. Now, before the anti-Axis forces' actions have even begun, they have not only been hit by a political iron fist, but have also suffered from a military steel whip. Britain and the United States are eating their own bitter fruit, which is not worth mentioning. Isn't the lesson learned by Chongqing still not enough?

Is it possible that the Command also did not receive detailed information about the situation?

### Italy Rebuilds National Army to Fight Alongside Allies Cabinet Meeting Passes New Army Bill

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - The US government held a cabinet meeting in Venice on the 27th, and approved the bill on the reconstruction of the new national army proposed by Minister of Defense Marshal Graziani. President Mussolini gave a speech on the spot: "Since the first cabinet meeting was convened by the Fascist government, the revival of the national spirit has made significant progress. Although the Italian people were thrown into the abyss of humiliation and collapse by the betrayal of traitors in July and September, the national spirit has now begun to extricate itself in order to escape this sea of ​​suffering. The new order of the motherland will soon reveal its outline in the military aspect. Marshal Graziani, with the assistance of General Gambara, will once again lead the nation to fight alongside the Axis and the Three-Power Pact comrades against the enemy. The "New National Army Bill" that was submitted to the cabinet meeting is based on the war experience of the past four years and aims to compile a modern and powerful army. Based on this bill, the Italian army, navy, and air force will be rebuilt, and there are also plans to set up an air defense force directly under the air force.

Northern Italy, 28th (Central News Agency) - The first article of the New Army Law passed by the Italian Cabinet on Wednesday states that the Italian Army ceased to exist when the Savoy Palace and military leaders funded and actually surrendered the dynasty and the national territories on September 8, thereby defiling the Italian Army, Navy, and Air Force.

The second article of the new law stipulates that the three armed forces of the Italian National Republic will be established on September 9. Soldiers of all ranks, whoever requests to join the new army and continue to serve under the Republican flag out of a sense of national self-consciousness, will be allowed to continue their service. Regarding pay and rations, the new Italian army will be subject to the same conditions as the current German army. The article also states that the Carabinieri Corps will continue to maintain order.

### Ambassador Cai Returns to Post and Gives Speech

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Chinese Ambassador to Japan Cai Peikai has returned to his post after completing his report on his work in China. He arrived back in Tokyo at 5:00 PM on the 26th and gave a speech to the Chinese press corps in Japan on the 27th, saying as follows: "I have returned to China to report on my work. After witnessing the unanimous spirit of the entire country, both in the government and in the public, striving to develop after China recovered the concessions and abolished extraterritoriality, and Japan's increasingly strengthened position under the wartime system, I am filled with unlimited joy at the bright future of Greater East Asia. In the current situation in East Asia, I feel that in order for China to thoroughly complete its mission of nation-building and to have the strength to share the responsibility of 精束亚 (refined East Asia), it is urgently necessary to realize comprehensive peace between China and Japan. China and Japan, from the standpoint of East Asian nations, are brotherly countries, and their fates are closely related. The struggle between the snipe and the clam only benefits the fisherman. This has long been the conclusion of knowledgeable people. Now, China and Japan have gone from understanding to friendship, and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War has led to cooperation and efforts towards a common sacred goal. Japan's sincerity will enable the Chinese government and public to have a deeper understanding. The ideals of "I love my country," "I also love my neighboring country," and "Building East Asia together" should permeate the hearts of everyone, concentrating all efforts to complete the great cause of the Greater East Asia War. As the ambassador to Japan, I sincerely have even deeper expectations for this."

### On the West Bank of the Nu River, Japanese Forces Achieve Major Victory; Longling, Mangshi, and Chongqing Troops Surrounded

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Yunnan front report, after the Japanese army's elite units launched a fierce offensive in Yunnan, they have achieved significant victories on the west bank of the Nu River. This operation has had a great impact on the Allied forces, especially the Chongqing side, who are deeply terrified by the Japanese advance. Observing the remarkable achievements of the Japanese army, both sides suffered significant losses. The Chongqing army abandoned over a thousand bodies, while the Japanese army only suffered a few deaths in action. The Japanese mopping-up units are currently suppressing the Chongqing army's 36th Division in the Mingguang River, Longchuan River, and Kongcha River areas, expanding their gains. As a result, the encircled troops are in dire straits and are attempting to flee north towards Liuku. However, the river crossing points are controlled by the Japanese army, and their retreat is further obstructed by the treacherous Gaoligong Mountains. Their retreat routes have been completely cut off, and they are frequently attempting to hide their weapons in the mountains and escape in civilian clothes. The encircled Chongqing troops in Longling, Mangshi, and Pingga are currently breaking through the Japanese encirclement to rescue these Chongqing troops, but have ultimately failed. The Chongqing side is doing its utmost to conceal the above facts, and fearing a Japanese advance eastward, they are gathering a considerable number of reinforcements from Yongping via Guanlan to the opposite bank of the Lishui River in Liuku, claiming that they are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. Furthermore, the anti-Axis side, having suffered defeat by the encircled troops, has reported that American military commentator Baldwin confirmed in the New York Times that the Burma Road is now entirely under Japanese control. Currently, the Chongqing army is requesting assistance from the British army in eastern India, but the British army in that area remains neutral, further exposing the discord among the anti-Axis powers.

Heavy Fighting Continues in the Gaoligong Mountains

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Commission announced on the 26th that heavy fighting continues in the Gaoligong Mountains along the Yunnan-Burma border.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Yunnan front report, a unit of the Chongqing army in Yunnan escaped from a certain mountain at dawn on the 20th, attempting to flee to the east bank of the Nu River via the Gaoligong Mountain road. However, because their retreat route had been newly established, the Japanese Fukuda unit further surrounded and attacked them. After fierce fighting, the 36th Division's 108th Regiment suffered heavy losses. The body of Chongqing army regimental commander Yang Yunhong was found in this battle. According to documents captured from the 108th Regiment Commander of the 36th Division in this battle, it has been definitively proven that, apart from the 36th Division Commander Li Zhihong, other military leaders such as the 36th Division Deputy Commander, as well as the Self-Defense Army Commander Zhu Zhenhua, the 108th Regiment Commander, and the 106th Regiment Commander, are all trapped within the Japanese encirclement. The elite units of the encircled army are currently compressing the encirclement. Furthermore, the Japanese army dropped surrender leaflets from aircraft on the 27th. According to Chongqing army prisoners, the encircled troops lack food and have lost their will to fight, and all hope to surrender. It seems that the Chongqing army's attempt in this Nu River operation has been completely thwarted, and they have no way to rescue the troops surrounded by the Japanese army, leaving them with no choice but to wait for death.

### Nine American Aircraft Attack Haikou Unsuccessfully

Haikou, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Nine enemy B-24 Liberator and North American B-25 bombers attacked the Haikou area of Hainan Island on the 26th in four waves at a low altitude of 300 meters. The Japanese naval air force and ground forces immediately responded and shot down a total of three aircraft, destroying one more, and repulsed the enemy. The Japanese aircraft also lost two aircraft, one of which rammed an enemy aircraft and perished with the enemy. In addition, several small transport vessels were lost.

### Japanese Army in Southern Shanxi Advances Smoothly

Beiping, Central News Agency – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base, Japanese elite units have been continuously advancing for days in the steep terrain on all sides of the eastern route in Southern Shanxi, confronting the Chongqing army. From the 7th to the 12th of this month, the results were as follows: 80 communist soldiers killed, 75 rifles captured, 127 bullets, 1 pistol, 1 printing press, 1,500 sheep, and a large amount of electrical wire, etc. Furthermore, the Japanese army mopping up the area near the Qin River, from the 2nd to the 23rd of this month, achieved the following results: 5 pistols, 6 bullets, 30 rifles captured, 1 light machine gun, 5 pistols, 836 bullets, 1 automatic rifle, 3,590 cattle and sheep, and a large number of hand grenades, field artillery shells, and landmines, etc. In addition, two grain depots and one telephone exchange were destroyed.

### Macao Correspondence: The Old Story of the Burma Campaign is Retold

We should remember that one of the main topics discussed by Roosevelt and Churchill at the Quebec Conference was the struggle for Burma, with two objectives: first, to reopen the Burma Road to prevent the Chongqing side from becoming disillusioned with the United Kingdom and the United States and leaving the anti-Axis alliance; second, to use important locations within the Chongqing territory as bases to carry out air raids on the Japanese mainland. Therefore, their initial goal was to seize northern Burma, breaking through the heavily guarded borders of Baoshan, Tengyue, Myitkyina, and Dunskiye, and begin constructing a northwest route connecting India.

As a result of the Quebec Conference, Mountbatten was appointed Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia, flew to New Delhi, and convened Auchinleck, Stilwell, and others to discuss future strategies. In the border area between Burma and India, the deployment of British Indian troops had been completed, and the air force had been greatly strengthened, glaring at the Japanese line, ready for battle. At the same time, in the naval aspect, because the Mediterranean war had come to an end, a part of the British fleet was drawn from the Atlantic and Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, preparing to launch a simultaneous land and sea offensive.

Britain and the United States Contend for Command

However, although Mountbatten combined land, sea, and air forces, ready to fight for Burma, internal opinions were divided. Mountbatten and the American Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific, MacArthur, clashed over the operational area and command authority. Chiang Kai-shek and Stilwell also disdained to be commanded by him. If the front line was like this, how could the rear be any different? American Secretary of the Navy Knox and British Home Secretary Morrison, on the question of the Pacific campaign and on the division of sacrifices between the two sides, both wanted to infringe on the other and let others fight like clams while they reaped the fisherman’s benefits. This kind of attempt fully exposed their weaknesses.

However, despite the conflict of authority and personnel friction between the United Kingdom and the United States on the issue of command, and despite everyone wanting to avoid responsibility and shirk sacrifices, the struggle for Burma was a military operation that they had to actively carry out. Otherwise, the Chongqing side would inevitably withdraw, and their anti-offensive posture in East Asia would have no basis for preparation at all.

The rainy season in Burma has passed. British Indian troops and Chongqing troops, under the banner of "recovering Burma," began to roll.

The Burma Pacification Campaign

Last May, the Japanese army began the Burma pacification campaign, attacking with irresistible force and launching a decisive battle on the notoriously treacherous Yunnan border. At that time, the Japanese Yunnan invasion force that began the attack first destroyed the forward strongholds of the Chongqing Chiang direct line army, which was attempting to recover Burma, crossed treacherous mountains over 3,000 meters high, and seized Tengyue, Longling, and Lameng, thoroughly disrupting Chongqing’s lifeline – the Burma Road station. Since then, the Chongqing army has continued to wage guerrilla warfare to seize the Burma Road, and has repeatedly suffered blows. In a battle in February of this year, the Central Army’s Reserve 2nd Division was destroyed by the Japanese army. However, at the instigation of the British in May, it once again dreamed of recovering Burma, attempting to seize the forward strongholds for reopening the Yunnan-Burma Road. Taking advantage of the rainy season, it sent the 36th Division (Commander Li Zhihong) under the command of Expeditionary Force Commander Chen Cheng to the west of the Nu River, leading Zhu Zhenhua (Deputy Commander of the 36th Division and Commander of the Tenglong Border Area Self-Defense Army) and Xie Pusheng, Commander of the Border Area Guerrilla Forces, to begin operations. Chongqing did not hesitate to exhaust the country’s resources, stubbornly defending the Burma-India border line, which the British regarded as their lifeline, but remained unaware. Its situation is truly pitiful.

Blockading the Nu River Crossing Points

The Japanese army's Yunnan invasion force began its offensive on October 15. That day, it occupied a certain area of the Chongqing army's base and thrust into Lengshui Gully, seizing the narrow road on the Chongqing army's rear. On the afternoon of the 16th, it captured a certain place, pursuing the defeated army. At noon on the 17th, it broke into a certain place, blockading the Nu River crossing points and completely cutting off the enemy's retreat. Over 15,000 Chongqing troops, centered on the 36th Division, became rats in a sack, running wildly and falling into the Japanese encirclement. At the same time, a certain forward detachment traversed the treacherous Gaoligong Mountains, known as the world's most dangerous, and occupied Lishi at 5:00 PM on the 16th. At 2:00 PM on the 17th, it thrust into the Nu River crossing point of Lichai Dam. A certain unit of the Japanese army, which had detoured northwest of the Nu River crossing point, also crossed a certain height on the 16th and advanced into a certain place. The two armies joined forces to seal the mouth of the great encirclement and annihilation battle. Under the general offensive of the Japanese army from the north and south, the Chongqing army had no foothold. According to prisoners, Li Zhipeng, the commander of the 30th Division, who was rumored to be launching a general counter-offensive in Burma, had long abandoned his troops and fled near Lichai Bridge.

On the other hand, the Chongqing army claimed to have dispatched 350,000 expeditionary troops to Yunnan to increase its military strength, and separately sent 50,000 elite troops to eastern India by air transport, heading to the British-American defense line on the Indian border. For this aspect of the British-Chongqing army, a certain unit of the Japanese army departing from Myitkyina, bypassing to the left and rear, began operations, attacking the front of the British-Chongqing army, breaking through its defense line, and linking up with the units attacking the base of the 26th Division, forming a large encirclement.

The area trapped within the Japanese encirclement includes the plains around Tengyue and the Longchuan River Valley, which is a fertile agricultural area and a logistics base for the Chongqing side. It is now harvest season, and waves of golden rice ears are rippling in the vast, boundless rice paddies. The loss of this area is a fatal blow to the Chongqing side, and the connection with the Chongqing army stationed in India has also been severed, and the attempt at joint British-Chongqing operations has completely lost hope.

### Japan's Extraordinary Session of Parliament Is Highly Valued by Our Government and People; We Should Cooperate with Friendly Nations to Fulfill Our Mission

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to political figures here, in the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Parliament, Prime Minister Tojo mentioned "China for the Chinese," and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu stated "East Asia is the homeland of East Asians." Therefore, our government and people attach even greater importance to this session of the Japanese Parliament. Under the leadership of our Supreme Leader, President Wang, our aim in cooperating with the Greater East Asia War and participating in the war is solely to revive China and defend East Asia. The situation in the Japanese Extraordinary Session of Parliament in the past two days is sufficient to show Japan's determination to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States, and at the same time, Japan's sincerity in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been shown to the world. Analyzing the current situation, Tojo said, "At this time of decisive battle, one hundred million government officials and people are using the current stage of the war as a turning point, and are all engaged in battle deployment, concentrating all their strength on destroying the United Kingdom and the United States for His Majesty the Emperor." In the future, our only path is victory. This is Japan's determination to strive for victory, and its unwavering belief in victory can also be seen. This is not only trusted by our country, but also by all countries and nations in East Asia. As for his foreign affairs remarks, Japan's diplomatic policy has also been explained in detail. The concept of building a new order has already been displayed, and it should be understood and supported by all East Asians. Prime Minister Tojo specifically expressed his respect for our country's will to create the ideal of "China for the Chinese" and to work hard to liberate the billion people of East Asia, and our country, from top to bottom, also deeply believes that "reviving China and defending East Asia" can certainly be accomplished. Looking at Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's statement, "East Asia is the homeland of East Asians," then destroying the United Kingdom and the United States and liberating East Asia is the responsibility that every East Asian person should fulfill. At the end of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's statement, he said, "What the Greater East Asian nations demand is co-existence and co-prosperity, mutual understanding and mutual concession. This spirit is the true face of Greater East Asia today." Therefore, the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia is the unanimous demand of the East Asian people, and the foundation for the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War can be said to be laid here. What our people especially pay attention to is Prime Minister Tojo's statement that the fundamental revision of the China-Japan Basic Treaty will be materialized, which will definitely help "revive China and defend East Asia." Our country, from top to bottom, can only exert all its strength and work hand in hand with friendly Japan to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States and accomplish this great mission.

Statement Issued by the Japanese Embassy

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Based on the fundamental spirit of adjusting national relations and respecting the integrity of our country's sovereignty and territory, friendly Japan has implemented the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. The issue of enemy property in China under the management of the Japanese army is also in line with the same intention, and batches have been transferred to the National Government for management, totaling 1,275 items. In the most recent period, friendly Japan has also decided to transfer the third batch of British and American enemy property in Central and Northern China (87 items) to our country for management. In addition to notifying our authorities, the Japanese Embassy in China issued the following statement: Based on the fundamental spirit of adjusting national relations and respecting the integrity of China's sovereignty and territory, the Japanese government has decided on a policy of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. This policy was put into effect on the day the National Government declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States. As for the issue of enemy property in China under the management of the Japanese army, it has also been decided to transfer it to the National Government for management in accordance with the same intention. On February 2, 1,003 items of British and American enemy property in various parts of Central and Northern China were transferred to the National Government for management. Subsequently, in June, 459 items of British and American enemy property in the Hankou, Guangzhou, and Xiamen areas were transferred to the National Government in succession. The number of items already implemented has reached 1,275. The Japanese government has now decided to transfer the third batch of 87 British and American enemy properties in North China to the National Government for management. The National Government has been notified today, including the Hotel des Wagon-Lits in Beiping, the American Fengyang Company in Tianjin, and dock warehouse buildings. In addition, there are churches and other cultural facilities. As for the remaining parts of the British and American enemy properties in China confiscated by Japan, they will continue to be transferred, and the necessary investigations are currently being conducted. Once the investigations are completed, they will be implemented gradually. In addition to the United Kingdom and the United States, the Japanese government has also decided to transfer the enemy properties of other countries in China, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway, to the National Government for management. A portion of them has been investigated and is scheduled to be officially notified to the National Government for takeover in the near future. We deeply believe that the National Government will, based on the purpose of receiving enemy property, take back the economic and cultural aggressive facilities of the United Kingdom and the United States in China for many years and make good use of them to actively cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War. The following is the category of enemy property in Central and Northern China that the National Government has taken over for the first three times: In North China: buildings and facilities 3, hotel industry 1, church facilities 41, school facilities 16, cultural facilities 1, totaling 62 items.

That area suffered from a cyclone last year, and is now suffering from famine this year, so the disaster is extremely serious. On Tuesday alone, 100 corpses of starving Indians were cremated in Calcutta. Another striking phenomenon is that large trucks marked with the letters (CDL), meaning corpse collection trucks, are coming and going on the streets of Calcutta.

Geneva, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The (Daily Worker) reported that the British India Association recently convened a conference of British industrial workers to protest the famine situation in India. At the conference, the Association's Secretary Melan delivered a speech, saying that the British government's urgent responsibility is to find ways to alleviate the famine in India, release political prisoners, and renegotiate with Indian leaders. Liang also said that the British government continues to export Indian food regardless of the serious Indian famine, causing food prices in India to rise endlessly, currently 250 to 1,500 times the pre-war prices. Therefore, without immediate countermeasures, 25 million to 30 million people will die of starvation. The conference immediately passed a resolution demanding the resignation of British Secretary of State for India Amery and the formation of a national government of India.

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The food shortage in Bengal, India, is becoming increasingly serious due to the Indian authorities' ineffective response.

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Minister of Propaganda Lin, who was previously ordered by President Wang to attend the National Assembly of the New People's Society in Beiping as the chairman, has completed his mission and returned to the capital on the 28th. The reporter went to visit him and received the following remarks: What impressed me most on this trip was that when the President came to Beiping last year, the teenagers and people who listened to the President's speech on the radio were moved and invigorated. The affairs of the New People's Society have also developed day by day due to the promotion of this appeal. The current situation in the North is much better than last year. The promotion of the joint people's movement, its goals and spirit, are in accordance with the central government's intentions, and progress is very rapid. When I arrived in Beiping, it was the beginning of the issuance of the decisive battle life saving program, which was tight and admirable. In addition to the provinces and cities in the North, there were also representatives from the Central China Youth Model Group participating in the Youth General Review, reaching more than 18,000 people. It goes without saying that they were living in open air, and all the emblems had been changed to the Blue Sky, White Sun, and National Emblem, with uniform steps and good order. What is most admirable is the spirit of unity and the vigorous vitality of the youth groups, regardless of the North. The state funeral for Central China was set for the 31st of this month. Due to war affairs, I was eager to return to Nanjing, so I had the funeral committee handle the prior memorial service on the 27th. The Deputy Secretary-General of the War Affairs Office will remain in Beiping to continue attending the General Assembly and participating in the state funeral.

### Southwest of Melitopol Fierce Bayonet Fighting Breaks Out; Intense Battles on the Right Bank of the Dnieper River

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency): The German News Agency, citing a war report from the Führer's headquarters, stated: The intense offensive and defensive battles between Azov and the Dnieper River, with their focus remaining southwest of Melitopol yesterday. The enemy attempted to create a breakthrough on a large scale, but it was rendered ineffective by German troops engaging in close combat or by counterattacks from German mobile reserve forces. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. The enemy, at the estuary of the Dnieper River bend, attacked north of Kryvyi Rih and south of Nikopol with a large number of infantry and tanks but also failed to achieve results. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, the enemy launched a new offensive north of Gomel and continued their attempts to break through German positions in the areas west of Klinzy and Smolensk. The enemy reportedly collapsed due to being unable to withstand the concentrated German artillery fire.

Strategic Encirclement Unlikely to Succeed

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency): German News Agency: The war situation report from the southern sector of the Eastern Front on the 27th is as follows: In the Melitopol area, the Soviet forces are actively redeploying troops to launch fierce attacks in the Melitopol area, indicating that their target is not only the southern German positions, but also an attempt to encircle and annihilate the German forces on a large scale. Soviet forces, with several divisions of infantry and powerful cavalry, attempted to break through German positions west of Melitopol. Although they briefly penetrated German positions in some areas, the Soviet advance was halted by German counterattacks from the flanks. Elsewhere, Soviet forces launched an attack on German forces south of Chaplynka, using tanks as their main force. They were fiercely attacked by German mechanized units, and an entire Soviet tank division was annihilated. In the Dnieper River bend area, on the 26th, Soviet forces attacked the breakthrough area northwest of Dnipropetrovsk with several infantry divisions under the cover of powerful tanks and aircraft. They were repulsed by German counterattacks, and the Soviet offensive made no progress, resulting in heavy losses and retreat. Soviet forces also attacked north and northwest of Kryvyi Rih with large mechanized forces and even broke through German positions for several kilometers, but they were repelled by a courageous counterattack by German mechanized units, followed by a rapid pursuit that cut off the rear of some of their tank units, completely annihilating them.

### Three-Nation Conference Discusses Balkan Issues; Rumors of Soviet Demands for Access to the Black Sea

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency): Representatives from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union held a meeting on the afternoon of the 26th, and those who attended from Britain and the United States subsequently attended a tea party at the British-American Club. The three-nation representatives continued to hold meetings at the guest house. US representative Hull, British representative Eden, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held discussions for three hours. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Moscow: The talks will last longer than the originally scheduled nine sessions, and the representatives of the two countries are about to discuss the most important issues in the talks.

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency): German News Agency dispatch: According to a "Social Democratic Newspaper" communication from London: British diplomatic sources believe that the Moscow Conference is currently beginning to discuss Balkan issues, and the scope of the discussion will likely include the Soviet Union's demand for access through the Dardanelles Strait, the Sea of Marmara, and the Bosphorus. Because this issue is largely related to Turkey, Turkish figures in London have appeared anxious recently. They are particularly concerned about the news that the British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, will go to Cairo, as Foreign Secretary Eden will return to Britain via Cairo after the conference, at which time the two can meet. The Moscow Conference may continue for another ten days. Furthermore, according to TASS news: Stalin met with Eden on Wednesday, with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kerr present.

Geneva, 28th (Central News Agency): The "New York Times" correspondent in Washington reports that the main issue discussed at the Moscow Conference is the establishment of a second front and other military issues. However, the discussion is not limited to this. The anti-Axis attitude towards Poland, Finland, and other countries where Soviet influence is clearly visible is also on the agenda.

### Knatchbull-Hugessen Left Ankara Yesterday

Amsterdam, 28th (Central News Agency): The German News Agency, citing a British report, stated: The British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, has recently left Ankara to travel to Jerusalem with his wife.

### War Situation in Southern Italy

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency): According to the Overseas Chinese News Agency: Since the 26th, although British and American forces have resumed activities on the southern Italian front, it cannot yet be considered a large-scale offensive. Their actions still aim to seize favorable positions with advance units before deploying heavy troops for a large-scale invasion. However, German forces have been effective in their defense efforts over the past few weeks, and the Americans have gained a foothold in the mountains, but have not made further progress. The German defense line in the upper Volturno River area has been quite effective. In the Agnone area, General Clark, on the right bank of the Matese Mountains, and the British Eighth Army, on the left flank near Venafro and Boiano, attempted to seize the forward outposts, but failed. Enemy pressure has slightly increased southwest of Campobasso, but there has been no significant progress in recent days. The right wing of the British Eighth Army has been moved to the immediate front line, and enemy artillery is also very active, with their actions suggesting a desire to concentrate artillery for a fierce offensive.

The center of the storm was in New Jersey, but New York City and Long Island were also hit by the storm day and night, although the damage was not as severe as in New Jersey.

### Seeking Common Prosperity in East Asia Based on Equality and Reciprocity; Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Clarifies War Aims

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency): Foreign Minister Shigemitsu answered questions from Mr. Yadanji Nakajima at the general budget meeting of the House of Representatives on the 27th. A summary of the main points was published yesterday; the full text is now supplemented as follows.

The construction of Greater East Asia is based on the voluntary cooperation of all ethnic groups within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. From Japan's perspective, the basic policy is to enable each ethnic group to achieve its aspirations based on the concept of equality and reciprocity. Therefore, it is necessary to break down the international relations that have hindered the principles of equality and reciprocity in the past and to promote cooperation and mutual assistance among the ethnic groups of East Asia based on the principle of mutual protection and harmony. The great spirit of Japan's founding is certainly not to monopolize Greater East Asia; it is the justice that has been respected by Eastern sages throughout history. Mr. Nakajima's opinion is most appropriate in content, and the government is currently studying concrete and effective policies and has already implemented comprehensive measures. Mr. Nakajima's question concerns Japan's basic foreign policy regarding the Greater East Asia War. I will briefly state my views and explain them. This war is the largest imperialist war provoked and initiated by Britain and the United States. The policy of Britain and the United States is to turn most of the world into their colonies. They are using Chongqing as their pawn, conspiring against East Asia, and plotting to permanently control India and the Philippines. Their sinister hand of aggression against East Asia has already extended into Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula during this war. They also want to seize Burma and then attempt to restore their dominance over China and all East Asians. The war aims of the United States stem from a desire to build a world empire and to further strengthen their control over the northern and southern Pacific and the Philippines, making it a base for suppressing East Asia. This clearly demonstrates that they intend to make the world a world of Britain, the United States, and their followers, which is their war aim. They are far from their own country and are engaged in mortal combat in the northern and southern Pacific, southern Asia, the Solomon Islands, and New Guinea with our loyal and courageous elite army and navy. Why are they making such great sacrifices in these pestilential lands? They are merely seeking to restore their world colonial empire. They disregard the sacrifices of other ethnic groups in order to realize this ambition and want to assimilate Japan and other East Asian countries into their colonies. They are now including Chongqing as one of the powers that will dominate the world, something they could not have dreamed of in the past. They intend to win Chongqing's favor by this and to play the sinister trick of using Asians to control Asians. After Japan implemented its new policy towards China, it abolished unequal treaties with Chongqing, changed laws restricting overseas Chinese, and made various ugly gestures to please Chongqing. Subsequently, regarding the independence of the Philippines, during its period of American rule, the United States used various means to delay it. Now that the American military has been driven out of the Philippines, and the Philippines has gained independence with the help of cooperating countries, the United States feels humiliated and seems to want to compete with Japan by granting the Philippines independence. They are now requesting to grant the President this authority. However, the independence of the Philippines can only be guaranteed by the awakening of East Asians. When Britain's control over India was weak, it used sweet words to deceive India. Once its internal control was restored, it disregarded its promises and enriched itself. Now, under the leadership of Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose, the Provisional Government of Free India has been established. It is expected that Britain and the United States will offer India the same conditions as Chongqing to win it over. However, India's return to its true form depends on the awakening of its people and their uprising. The British and Americans see East Asia as the most suitable colonial region for exploitation, while we recognize East Asia as the homeland of East Asians. We must defend this homeland. This war is a war of self-preservation and self-defense for East Asia. If Japan cannot defend East Asia together with East Asians, then not only will Japan lose its status as a great power, but the East Asian ethnic groups will never have the opportunity for autonomy and independence and will forever be regarded as colonies and subjected to oppression. In this sense, the Greater East Asia War is a war of national awakening and a war to revitalize East Asia. Therefore, it is a matter of course that the countries and ethnic groups of East Asia should cooperate fully to complete the war. Now that the dawn of East Asian revitalization has arrived, we must defend the homeland of East Asians and seek common prosperity. This is the aim of Japan's war. The ethnic groups of East Asia have become aware and must move forward bravely, returning East Asia to its original form. We believe that East Asia itself, the construction of Greater East Asia, is part of the construction of world peace. Therefore, we welcome the war to eliminate aggression, and we further seek to bridge cultural gaps, establish reciprocal economic principles, and develop resources without racial discrimination in order to contribute to the establishment of a new world order. On the other hand, colonial wars that violate justice rarely achieve victory, with the exception of the Opium War. Even the Americans had to struggle through a difficult war before gaining independence from Britain. The outcome of a war is not determined solely by the quantity of weapons or materials, but by the unwavering belief in victory, which forms the basis for completing the war and determines the power of our military. The spirit of the military and civilians on the front lines also lies in this. Today, Greater East Asia has been liberated, and the ethnic groups of East Asia are filled with joy and hope for the future, based solely on coexistence and co-prosperity based on mutual respect. Today's East Asia is one of mutual assistance and cooperation, thoroughly striving for the liberation and revitalization of Asia in a friendly and harmonious environment, and awakening the world. Today's East Asia is fighting to complete this sacred war. This is the true form of East Asia.

Following the establishment of the Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association's rationing cigarette organization, it is re-examining the ratings of each retailer to ensure fairness. It is said that to prevent violations, the inspection department has assigned inspectors to each district to conduct on-site investigations of the business of retailers in designated districts, such as spot-checking inventory and sales ledgers. It is said that several retailers have had their distribution licenses revoked or temporarily suspended due to inventory discrepancies.

### Basic Plan Obtained to Supply Food to All of Shanghai; Monthly Rice Ration Can Be Increased to Six Sheng Per Person

Central News Agency: The Shanghai Food Rationing Adjustment Committee recently decided that rice from three provinces and two municipalities would be purchased and distributed uniformly by the Rice Control Association. The committee held a discussion with the leaders of the Rice Control Association at the First District Public Office meeting room to discuss the issue of supplying food to Shanghai residents. After detailed discussions between the two sides, a concrete basic plan was obtained. Details are as follows.

Distributed by the Food Adjustment Committee

Regarding the rice from three provinces and two municipalities, it has been decided that after the Rice Control Association purchases it, the Shanghai Food Rationing Adjustment Committee will be responsible for receiving and distributing the supply to the five million residents of Shanghai, including major industrial organizations in Shanghai, friendly nations, and residents of the Zhoushan Islands area. The Food Rationing Adjustment Committee will negotiate with the China Rice Rationing Association for the food supply previously provided by the Rice Control Association, and the association will also pay the rice costs on its behalf. The packaging materials required for the transportation of food will be the responsibility of the Adjustment Committee.

Close Technical Cooperation

The two associations also carefully discussed technical methods and decided that the quantity and type of food to be supplied to the Adjustment Committee each month, as well as the delivery locations and prices, should be notified by the Rice Control Association to the Adjustment Committee before the 20th of the previous month to allow for advance preparation. At the same time, it was stipulated that the Adjustment Committee should notify the Rice Control Association of the rationing plan for the following month and the actual performance of the previous month before the 10th of each month. The close cooperation between the two associations will make Shanghai's food supply increasingly stable.

Monthly Quantity Increased to Six Sheng

In recent months, the amount of rice rationed to each person in the city has only been one sheng per period, which Shanghai residents have found insufficient. Although the authorities have increased the amount of flour to supplement rationing, residents are accustomed to eating rice and find flour-based foods inconvenient. The cooperation between the Shanghai Food Rationing Adjustment Committee and the Rice Control Association will gradually increase the amount of rice rationed to each person per month to more than six sheng in the short term. From now on, residents can be free from worries about food, and black market rice prices should fall dramatically. It is estimated that Shanghai needs approximately 230,000 bags of rice per month.

Yuan to Visit Nanjing to Negotiate Unified Distribution

Yuan Wendeng, Chairman of the Rice Control Committee, accompanied by advisor Mamoru Yamato and Pan Jinghe, Li Shanzhen, and others, took the night train to Nanjing yesterday to attend the material control review meeting to be held at 3 pm on the 30th and will also visit relevant authorities in Nanjing to earnestly request unified purchase and distribution of rice. According to Shanghai News Agency reporters: The Rice Control Committee's work of purchasing rice in various regions of the three provinces has entered the implementation stage. Branch offices have been formally established in various regions to purchase rice in accordance with established policies. Yuan's visit to Nanjing is to report and request instructions from the Nanjing authorities and to request the assistance of relevant parties to ensure the smooth progress of the grain control work. Yuan will stay in Nanjing for a short time and is expected to return to Shanghai in two or three days. Further reports say that the material control review meeting to be held in Nanjing will not only discuss the new grain control mechanism but also review the oil and grain transportation and distribution plan and the cotton purchase and distribution plan submitted by the Oil and Grain Professional Committee and the Cotton Professional Department of the Commercial Control Association. It is expected to be passed and implemented immediately.

### First District Economic Office Carries Out Special Investigation; Intensifies Investigation of Illegal Merchants

The Economic Office of the First District Public Office of this city has decided to intensify its efforts to crack down on merchants and civilians who violate the economic regulations promulgated by the municipal authorities. Yesterday, a person in charge of the office told a Commercial News Agency reporter: Although the authorities have been making every effort to investigate merchants who hoard goods or engage in other illegal activities, some cunning merchants are still trying to survive by carrying out limited activities under strict laws. The authorities have decided to severely punish such merchants. The office has dispatched a large number of investigators to conduct special investigations in various places to investigate the prices and hoarding of major and minor commodities. Whether it is a manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, or any private individual, if there is suspicion of hoarding, they will be detained and dealt with according to the law.

Investigation Targets

The investigators of the office have rich social experience and knowledge. They carry identity documents when performing their duties. The targets of the investigation are generally: Whether stores are hiding goods and refusing to sell them; selling goods above the price limit or increasing prices without approval; not marking prices on goods in the store; not issuing invoices or not recording them in the ledger when selling goods; moving goods privately without a permit; whether retail stores are participating in black market transactions; whether stores are adulterating or shortchanging the weight; and whether they are using substandard weights and measures.

Supervising Associations

It is also reported that the Economic Group Management Section of the Economic Office has reorganized all the major and minor associations in the city. Many new associations have also been established. Each association is now actively carrying out its affairs. In order to ensure that the affairs of each association are carried out effectively, the section has decided to further supervise the associations and also help them solve their difficulties.

### Materials Association to Discuss the Yarn and Cloth Rationing Plan Tomorrow; to be Announced and Implemented After Amendment and Approval

Central News Agency: The National General Chamber of Commerce has been authorized to purchase yarn and cloth, and has established an office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth to implement the purchase. All yarn and cloth manufacturers and holders of yarn and cloth stored in the Shanghai urban area have applied for sale as scheduled. The quality and price of all purchased yarn and cloth have been jointly verified by the Chinese and Japanese verification committees organized by the office, and the prices of various cotton yarns, white cotton cloths, and processed cotton cloths have been verified based on the announced price of 10,000 yuan for 20-count Blue Phoenix brand from the Executive Yuan. The prices have been verified and sent to the General Chamber of Commerce for submission to the Executive Yuan for approval. Most of the yarn and cloth that manufacturers and holders have applied to sell have been inspected and transferred for storage. Regarding the issue of implementing rationing of yarn and cloth for civilian use after purchase, the relevant authorities have drafted a comprehensive plan for the rationing of cotton yarn and cotton cloth and submitted it to the Shanghai Office of the Material Control Review Committee, which convened a meeting of directors to review and approve it. It will be announced and implemented after being amended and approved by the Material Control Review Committee meeting tomorrow (the 30th). It is reported that the General Chamber of Commerce will still be responsible for handling the rationing of yarn and cloth. It is learned that the General Chamber of Commerce will complete all the purchases of yarn and cloth and that the rationing methods for yarn and cloth will also be announced and implemented. Therefore, it has been decided that as soon as the order is received from the Executive Yuan, it will immediately close the Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Purchase Office and establish a Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Management Office to be fully responsible for the centralized distribution of cotton products.

### The Paradise of Stray Children: The Shanghai Fuyou Institute

Organization and Finances

The highest organization of the Shanghai Fuyou Institute is the Board of Directors, including: Honorary Board (Chairman: Mr. Wen Lantong, Mr. Xu Qianlin; Vice Chairman: Mr. Ding Fubao; Deputy Chairmen: Mr. Chen Yisheng, Mr. Chen Chunhua, Mr. Yu Baichuan, Mr. Huang Jingbo), Standing Committee of the Board (Standing Directors: Mr. Dong Bin, Mr. Yu Sihong, Mr. Ding Dongnan, Mr. Ye Xiaoliang, Mr. Qian Qiling, Mr. Shi Kuangming), and the Fundraising Committee. Underneath are four groups: the Institute Affairs, Finance, Publicity, and Fundraising Groups, as well as special committees. The actual work of the institute is overseen by Vice President Dong Bin, Director Feng Sen, and Secretary Jiang Tianyou. The Director is in charge of the Education and Teaching Affairs Department, which has a separate Children's Treatment Guidance Committee. The Affairs Department has a separate Children's Nurturing Research Committee. In terms of school affairs, there are divisions for teaching, student records, guardianship, statistics, library accounting, documentation, general affairs, sanitation, supply, and storage. The organizational division of labor appears to be quite meticulous, but the actual teaching staff, including the head teacher, numbers only thirteen. They cooperate and help each other, managing extremely complex and arduous tasks with a minimal number of people. Their compensation is also very meager, with the highest monthly salary being only 315 yuan and the lowest only 225 yuan, with simple accommodation provided. Their meals are no different from those of the students, consisting of simple vegetarian fare. They sacrifice themselves to serve, without diminishing their spirit of contentment. In order to continuously review their work and improve the education and nurturing of stray and distressed children, the teachers and staff devote their energy to improvement on a regular basis. They hold an Institute Affairs Meeting and a Life Review Meeting once a week, where they openly review and discuss matters in order to develop their work. They express satisfaction with their work and always seek criticism and guidance from others. It is precisely because the staff is so enthusiastic and hardworking that they have achieved such remarkable results in such a short period of time.

However, the Shanghai Fuyou Institute has always faced financial difficulties. Last year, it was fortunate to receive donations of over 260,000 yuan, which allowed it to barely maintain operations. This year, prices are several times higher than in previous years, the cost of living has skyrocketed, and the cost of supplies has increased accordingly. The difficult situation is not hard to imagine. In the spring of this year, they requested subsidies from the Shanghai Poverty and Sickness Relief Association. The Association's review committee members, Mr. Yao Huiquan and Mr. Li Wenwei, went to investigate and concluded that "the management situation is quite good, but financially it is currently running a deficit, and the collection of donations by the office is not very enthusiastic." Consequently, it was decided to subsidize 30,000 yuan, to be paid in three installments in January, March, and May. It was also suggested that there were many vacant spaces within the institute, and if the dormitories and classrooms were not separated, it would be possible to accommodate about 200 more street children, which would greatly benefit the cause of educating and nurturing distressed children. This suggestion was also accepted by the administrators of the Fuyou Institute. However, due to the continuous rise in prices and expenditures exceeding the budget, all plans could not be completed smoothly. The second fundraising campaign held in the spring had a target of 400,000 yuan to cover the regular educational and nurturing expenses for the end of the year. The results exceeded the set target, enabling the institute's operations to be maintained and improved. However, expanding the number of stray children being educated is said to be difficult at present, because the food expenses for the current 200-plus children (including food and fuel) already require a minimum of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per month. Clothing and education expenses are not even included in that figure. The majority of the funds raised previously have already been used to purchase food, fuel, and winter necessities such as cotton quilts. Therefore, it is said that the current daily expenses are already being covered by borrowing.

Leaving this paradise for 228 stray children and returning to the prosperous and bustling society, one still sees grimy beggar children crawling on the bustling streets and under towering buildings, and one still hears the cries of stray children. What crime have these children committed to deserve such a fate? This makes one all the more appreciative of the valuable work of institutions like the Fuyou Institute. However, they are also looking forward to the support of society. (The End)

### The Prime Suspect in the Assassination of Nanhui's Captain Yokota Arrested in Shanghai; Su Zhaofu and Eight Others Detained

Central News Agency Dispatch: The Shanghai Security Bureau's Investigation Team, acting on information received on October 20th, learned that Su Zhaofu and Liao Xuehong, the prime suspects in the October 5th assassination of Allied Forces Captain Yokota in Nanhui's Shashan Township, were hiding in Room 5 of the Laozhongyu Inn at the intersection of Xinqing Road and Changshou Road in the city. It was also learned that they had acquired a handgun belonging to the slain Captain Yokota in mid-October, and had robbed a noodle shop owned by a Mr. Zhu in Yangjiaqiao, as well as a residence in northern Shanghai, and had divided the loot.

Prime Suspect Apprehended

The team leader, after receiving the report, immediately dispatched Deputy Team Leader Yu Baolin, First Squad Leader Zhang Xuechang, Squad Leader Gao Xiuhe, and the informant to the location. They coordinated with officers from the Putuo District Police Department and apprehended the suspects Su Zhaofu, Ding Xuehong, and the thieves Pan Yongqing, Xia Zhaoxiang, Luo Youliang, Sun Daoyuan, as well as suspects Wang and Sun Zou, a total of eight people. They also recovered Captain Yokota's 7.63-caliber handgun, serial number 7619, and five bullets, which had been hidden in the mud beside Sun Zou's boat. The suspects were handed over to the Investigation Section for further interrogation. During interrogation, Su Zhaofu and Ding Xuehong confessed that at around 7 p.m. on October 5th, they and seven others, including the fugitives Jiang Weihan and Sun Laowu, took a small boat to Shashan, claiming to be guerrillas soliciting donations from the village head.

Assassination of Yokota

Unexpectedly, they encountered three Japanese plainclothes officers. Believing they were targets, Sun Laowu, with his Mauser C96 pistol, shot and killed one of the Japanese officers (Captain Yokota). Su Zhaofu then seized the Japanese officer's handgun. Together with Ding Xuehong, Pan Yongqing, and the fugitives Yang Haibo, Tian Heshang, Jiang Weihan, and Hua Ermazi, they used the stolen handgun to rob a grain store owned by Zhu Qibiao in Yangjiaqiao on the night of October 17th, taking 10,400 yuan in cash, a gold ring, and clothing. They also stole items from a household, which they divided among themselves.

Using the Loot

The suspects Pan Yongqing and Sun Daoyuan confessed that they received 500 yuan and 300 yuan respectively from Su Zhaofu as proceeds from the crime, which they spent. Luo Youliang confessed that Su Zhaofu had hidden the crime weapon in his house. Xia Zhaoxiang, however, was cunning and refused to confess to any robbery, claiming he was merely passing by when he was arrested. The suspect Yang Wu, a prostitute, stated that she was introduced to Su Zhaofu by a tea server named Shi from the inn. Sun Zou stated that Ding Xuehong forcibly took the handgun from Luo Youliang's house and hid it in the boat. She did not participate and Ding Xuehong moved it to the mud on the bank of the river next to the boat. The case is still under thorough investigation.

### Emergency Relief Funds for North China; Efforts Made to Expedite Remittances; Charity Sales of Paintings, Calligraphy, and Antiques

The Shanghai All-Circles North China Emergency Relief Association convened its eleventh executive board meeting at 4 p.m. yesterday at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Attendees included Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Li Sihao, Zhang Yunbo, Yao Lingxiang, Chen Binhe, Sun Mingqi, Hu Qiqi, and Zhao Jinqing. The meeting was chaired by Wen Lanting, and Yu Jiyu served as the secretary.

Report on Association Affairs

(A) Reports: 1. A letter was sent to Director Sun, as per the decision of the tenth executive board meeting, requesting that he forward a request to Minister Ding to allocate the 10 million yuan pledged by Mr. Sheng Youyi before the association's closure at the end of October, in order to complete the procedures and benefit the disaster victims. 2. A reply was sent to Committee Member Fu Qiangeng, stating that, as the grain relief efforts had been ongoing for a long time, the sacks were damaged, and efforts should be made to repair and replace them. 3. On October 14th, personnel were sent to the Flour and Wheat Special Committee to inquire about 680 bags of Red Goldfish Brand No. 4 flour donated to the association and stored at the Dashengchang Mill at the North Gate of Chang'an Bridge in Wuxi. Upon verification, it was confirmed that the flour was indeed there. Therefore, it is still necessary to process the export permit for the materials to facilitate their transport north. 4. On October 22nd, the association paid 8,744.80 yuan for the provincial tax, the Chamber of Commerce handling fee, and the military tax (12.86 yuan per bag) for the 680 bags of Red Goldfish Brand No. 4 flour. 5. On October 22nd, all account books and receipts from the Jinshi Painting and Fan Exhibition were submitted to the audit team for review. The team instructed the exhibition to provide the original receipts. In addition to the 2,932.60 yuan in cash and checks received, 161,000 yuan remained in the Tobacco Industry Bank and was transferred to the Bank of Communications for safekeeping. Receipt No. 5182 was obtained and handed over to the exhibition. 6. On October 26th, a request was made for the issuance of a permit for the second batch of relief grain shipments. The Chamber of Commerce waived the handling fee of one-tenth of one percent, amounting to 38,979.50 yuan. A letter has been sent requesting the refund of the 7,520 yuan handling fee for the first batch of relief grain shipments to be transported north, in order to report and ensure consistency.

Resolutions (B) Discussion: It was previously resolved to allocate 4 million yuan in cash, with 800,000 yuan each to the provinces of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi, to be distributed by the respective provincial governments, and 400,000 yuan each to the cities of Beijing and Tianjin, to be distributed by the Red Swastika Society. However, as the grain accounts have not yet been settled, it is proposed to retain the 800,000 yuan for Beijing and Tianjin and remit the 800,000 yuan to each of the four provinces first. However, the only bank currently capable of remitting funds to North China is the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the amount that can be remitted is limited. However, remittances can be made to Beijing, Tianjin, and Jinan. There is still no way to remit funds to Henan and Shanxi. How should this situation be handled? Please decide on this matter. It was resolved to first pay 800,000 yuan each to Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi, and 310,000 yuan each to Beijing and Tianjin, and find ways to remit the funds. Paintings, calligraphy, antiques, wine, and furs have all been appraised. It was proposed to display them at the Ningbo Native Place Association for three days for charity sales. Is this feasible? Please decide on this matter. It was resolved not to display them and to sell them separately through charity sales. (C) Ad Hoc Motion: It was previously decided at a meeting to borrow 1 million yuan for disaster relief in Anhui. Due to the fact that it will take time to collect the funds donated by Mr. Youyi, the aforementioned borrowed funds should be disbursed immediately.

### Important Broadcast by the Central Government Tomorrow Morning

To further improve the situation, it has also connected to the power lines of the Shanghai French Tramway and Electricity Company, formerly of the French Concession. These two connections have been completed, and in the future, the company will do its best to supply most of the electricity needed by the former French Concession.

### Monks From Various Countries Gather in Shanghai to Participate in Memorial Service

The Great East Asia Memorial Service is about to open. Eminent monks from allied countries and abbots from famous monasteries in China have arrived in Shanghai to preside over the service, performing rituals for the repose of the spirits of the war dead and ancestors of various families. The solemnity and grandeur of the arrangements within the hall are unprecedented. Families of various surnames believe that this is a rare opportunity to commend the spirits of their ancestors, and the number of people registering at the service's office and major temples in the city is constantly increasing. In order to ensure the cleanliness and solemnity of the venue, the organizers of the service have announced that attendees will not be allowed to bring any items inside, including incense, candles, and joss paper. These items will be provided by the service for purchase.

Yesterday's News Time: 7:10 PM

Economic Commentary

### The Pain of Unemployment

The German News Agency quoted a New Delhi dispatch yesterday, commenting on the impression given by the Indian Governor's first public statement: "Seeing a poverty-stricken and semi-naked nation seeking a night's sleep, waiting for the next day's hardships and starvation." These words describe the state of famine in India. However, we believe they can be borrowed to describe the pain of unemployment in Shanghai, and this would not be inappropriate. The hunger and suffering of the countless helpless poor people wandering the streets of this city are all due to unemployment, and the greatest cause of unemployment is still the war. Since the outbreak of war, factories have successively closed or reduced their operations. It is not only the working class, but also skilled technicians who are forced to find no means of making a living, ending up wandering the streets or even waiting for death. This situation has become a widespread phenomenon throughout the country, not just in a corner of Shanghai. This is precisely the economic problem of the entire society discussed yesterday, which must not be taken lightly.

Since the Allied nations returned various factories, and since all parties are actively restoring various production activities, the pain of unemployment in society may be partially alleviated. Originally, increasing production depends on the simultaneous concentration of manpower and material resources. On the one hand, the country is calling for increased production, and on the other hand, it cannot sit idly by and watch the people's unemployment, because these two things are as interdependent as lips and teeth. The Job Introduction Section of the Social Welfare Department of the First District Public Office of this city began registering unemployed people in December 1942, starting with technical personnel. Since August of this year, they have been providing job introductions for ordinary talents. If such work can be expanded and promoted by the state's governing bodies and assisted by public social organizations, it will be of great help to the poverty of society and the production of the country. It is truly profound and mutually beneficial!

### After the First Phase of Wheat Allocation, Flour Mills Are Working Overtime; Second Phase of Procurement About to Begin

The first phase of wheat procurement for this year has concluded. The target of 2 million bags has been fully achieved. The Flour and Wheat Special Committee has allocated the wheat to flour mills in various locations. Yesterday, it was learned that the flour mills near the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways have been producing flour continuously since receiving the allocated wheat, and the situation is extremely tight. In order to implement the previously established flour and bran allocation plan as soon as possible, the Flour and Wheat Special Committee has urged the mills to step up their work. The larger mills have increased their nighttime shifts, and the mills that had been shut down due to the incident have resumed operations.

A Portion of the Flour Exchanged for Materials

In addition to supplying flour produced by the mills to various provinces in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, Committee Chairman Sun Zhongli and Vice Chairman Inoue Yasutada of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee have consulted with the authorities in North China regarding the quantity to be transported north and transportation issues. Specific measures have been agreed upon, and it is reported that a portion of the flour is already en route to the north.

Preparing to Commence the Second Phase of Procurement

After the completion of the first phase of wheat procurement, the second phase of procurement will follow. Based on the experience of the first phase, the second phase is expected to be even more successful. The Flour and Wheat Special Committee will send personnel to the branch offices in various regions to inspect and improve any shortcomings in business and technology.

Various Industries Request Increased Allocation

Since receiving the allocated flour, various industries in the city have been able to reduce costs. However, the allocated amount is often insufficient to meet actual needs, so they have requested an appropriate increase. The Special Committee acknowledges that this is indeed the case and will consider supplementary allocations. However, it has also been discovered that some parties are secretly trading the allocated flour on the black market. Therefore, the Committee will be even more rigorous in its review process. Once discovered, in addition to permanent suspension of allocation rights, the offenders will be punished according to the law.

### Material Control Review Committee to Convene Eighth Meeting

The eighth meeting of the Material Control Review Committee, to which a Shanghai delegation is sending representatives to attend, is scheduled to be held on the afternoon of the 30th at the Nanjing International Club. The main objective of this meeting is to review the procurement of essential materials such as cotton, oil, grain, tobacco, and medicine. The Shanghai delegates are Mr. Zha Nana and Mr. He Yuanji from the National General Chamber of Commerce for Unified Business Control, as well as Mr. Pan Liangxian, a specially appointed commissioner of the Material Control Review Committee.

### Overseas Chinese Business Federation Handles Remittances From Southeast Asia

The Overseas Chinese Business Federation was established last year by Overseas Chinese merchants in Shanghai, initiated by Guo Shun, Huang Kangquan, Li Ze, Hu Guigeng, Chen Shuilu, Zheng Zhaobin, Lin Chaopin, Hui Wanpu, Jing Yimen, and others. Its office is located at 354 Xingya Building on the Bund. Since its establishment, it has been making every effort to handle Overseas Chinese affairs and facilitate trade. The Federation believes that postal and shipping connections between Southeast Asia and Shanghai are of great importance. Although it has been less than a month since the resumption of these services, remittances from overseas to Shanghai have been increasing significantly. The Federation assigns committee members to handle the collection of funds at any time, with simple and expeditious procedures. All expenses are borne by all directors and supervisors of the Federation, and no fees are charged to external parties.

### Stock Exchange Ready to Open; Trial Trading to Begin

The Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, since holding its reopening ceremony on the 29th of last month, has now fully approved and announced its list of brokers. The Ministry of Industry has issued broker licenses, allowing them to pay their deposits and commence business in accordance with the law. The listing of Chinese stocks has also been reviewed one after another, and the market layout, such as the installation of telephone lines, has been completed. The detailed operating rules have been approved by the Ministry. Yesterday, it was learned that the exchange is ready for operation and will begin a trial trading period on November 3rd to train its employees. There will be no formal transactions with the public. Once the training is completed, the official opening date will be announced, which is expected to be in mid-December. It is also reported that the exchange's business will include: (1) spot trading of various securities; (2) forward trading of various securities. However, the reopening will temporarily only allow the spot trading of Chinese stocks, with settlement to be handled every Monday. Brokers are absolutely prohibited from manipulating market prices and other illegal activities, and violators will be punished in accordance with the business rules. The operation of the exchange will be governed by the exchange's articles of association, as well as the Exchange Law, the Company Law, and other relevant laws and regulations.

### City Grain Bureau Clarifies Nature of Native Liquor Association

Regarding the Shanghai Special City Liquor Retailers Association and the fact that the scope of the Shanghai Native Liquor Vendors Association has not been clearly defined, the latter Association was concerned that disputes might easily arise. It therefore requested the City Grain Bureau to clarify the situation. The Bureau issued an order explaining: "The Native Liquor Vendors Association refers specifically to the vendors of Taixing native liquor who do not establish fixed business locations in Shanghai and operate on a mobile basis. Other types of liquor and liquor stores established in this city are not included. The establishment of the Association is in fact a unified organization for the sale of Taixing native liquor. The Bureau finds that it does not conflict with the Shanghai Special City Liquor Retailers Association. The Shanghai Special City Liquor Retailers Association shall continue to promote its affairs in accordance with its original charter."

### Stock Trends

Yesterday, the stock market trended towards stagnation. Overnight news from abroad was entirely priced in. Major players were unwilling to release their holdings. The volume of floating shares being sold off was quite limited. Furthermore, news of the stock exchange potentially resuming operations mid-next week stimulated investor confidence, and bargain hunting by substantial investors was not uncommon. Consequently, most stocks experienced a slight increase compared to their closing prices the previous day, with significant trading activity. A breakdown of various industry stocks for today is as follows:

Department Stores: Wing On Company fluctuated but ultimately did not recover its initial position. Sincere and Sun Sun Department Stores both rose slightly. Innerwear prices saw a marginal increase compared to the previous day. The Wing On and Kwong Wah Department Stores saw gains of approximately 10%. Textiles: Wing On Textiles experienced slight fluctuations, while both Meyer and Asia factories remained stable. Yung Shing saw a slight decrease in trading volume, while China Textiles continued to decline slightly. Sinwo remained stable, while Taikong and Tian Lun showed strength. Mei Lun and New Fueng Lun were supported by buyers. King Fook Hosiery and King Lun both saw minor increases, while China Silk continued to decline.

Pharmaceuticals: New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory saw slight ups and downs but ultimately trended upwards. Sino-French prices dropped slightly but remained generally stable. Five Continents, Sino-Western, New Star, and Chiu Foo Pharmaceutical all halted their declines and trended towards stability, while Sincere Pharmaceuticals experienced a decline.

Finance: Chekiang Industrial Bank saw some initial gains but gave back a portion. Trading volume in Shanghai was not high, and prices remained the same as the previous day. The buying price for Tientsin Native Bank, Kin Cheng, and Salt Industry remained the same as the previous day.

Culture: World Book Company saw slightly lower trading prices both domestically and internationally. Commercial Press and Chung Hwa remained stable.

Real Estate: Yung Hsing Real Estate saw considerable initial trading activity, exceeding its face value outside of the foreign concessions. Prices rose in the afternoon. Lien Hwa and New Yi Real Estate saw a decline.

Public Utilities: Chapei Water & Electric and China General Edison Company remained idle at their quoted prices, showing a potential for a break.

Industry: The decline of Great China Match continued unabated. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company saw trading activity within the foreign concessions. Chiu An Industry alone remained stable. New Asia Construction fluctuated at one times its face value. China and Kwok Wah Investment remained stable. Hong Yuan Confectionery regressed and entered the foreign concessions. Ta Tung Trading also showed weakness. Three Joy and Hing Wah were offered within face value but lacked buyers, especially the latter. Great China Industrial remained relatively stable. Mee Lun Confectionery and Kwong Sang Hong also showed weakness and declined. Standard Monosodium Glutamate continued to trade at a high of 65%.

The first edition of the "Pocket-Sized Chinese Stock Guide" has been reprinted due to large-scale distribution to subscribers in recent days and enthusiastic purchases from various parties, leaving few copies remaining. Starting today, exclusive distribution will be handled by the Enterprise Weekly, located at 996 Jingan Temple Road (Mee Lun Building at the intersection of Bubbling Well Road).

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government bonds suddenly underwent changes yesterday due to excessive speculation in futures, which was expected. This caused widespread unease, leading to widespread selling, causing prices to plummet. Consequently, all transactions were being closed out, and brokers were preoccupied with these trades. Therefore, there was no time for other instruments. Since deals were only for closing positions, spot trading naturally became neglected. Category C bonds fell sharply at the beginning of trading yesterday, and gradually declined, eventually falling twenty points more than the previous day. No one asked about other bonds.

Interbank Loan Rate: The Interbank Loan Rate of the Bankers Association remained unchanged at 1.2%.

Grains: Grain prices continued to be high yesterday. Rice prices rose because the Rice Control Association had begun procuring from various producing areas, leading to a gradual decrease in free trade. Prices rose due to reduced supply, eventually approaching two large denominations. Oilseed prices also tended to be firm.

### Dialogue on the Resolution of the People's War and Germany and Japan's Awakening with Tokutomi Sohō and Honda Kumataro

In this way, a transformation has occurred. Although this war has been going on for four years, since the disastrous defeat at Dunkirk three years ago, it has only been able to defend itself with the help of the United States. Here, the United States is clearly dealing with the war with two minds. One is to defeat Japan in this war, and the other is that everyone has known for the past seven or eight years that the United States thought it could control the world. Many books have been published that bluntly state that the United States should control the world, while on the other hand, because Britain is protecting itself, it is unclear whether it is willing to do anything. We often hear British generals say that only with the help of the United States can peace be ensured in all parts of the world. In this way, the desire to control the world has been aroused among Americans. Since Britain expressed its dependence on the United States, until Roosevelt became President in 1932, he implemented a new economic policy, which came at a very high cost. A lot of national funds were used, but ten million people remained unemployed.

Therefore, Roosevelt felt the need to shift people's attention abroad, and that was to start a major war, and the desire of the people to create a new world. Not to mention the navy, even among the intellectual class, it has risen. However, in Europe, unfortunately, because of the rise of Germany, Britain is at its wit's end. So Roosevelt wanted to play a good show. The following year after the Manchurian Incident, Ambassador Grew telegraphed to the country from Tokyo, warning that "Germany in the West and Japan in the East are planning to dominate the world," and to actively view them as evil-doers who will threaten the United States itself. The European war was challenged by the United States aiding Britain and France against Germany. After the defeat of the Norwegian campaign before the disastrous defeat at Dunkirk, Chamberlain stepped down and Churchill came to power. At the same time, Britain also suffered tragic conditions. When Churchill became Prime Minister, he decided on two major policies for carrying out the war.

First, in this war, it may not be possible to regain control like the previous time. Therefore, in order to avoid defeat before winning, abandon everything and utilize the United States. Therefore, it is willing to sacrifice national dignity and national glory, mobilize the United States, and use American power to compete with the Axis powers. The other is to hand over the domestic political leadership to the Labour Party. Millions of troops and millions of laborers are controlled by the working class. Only under this premise can the domestic political leadership be handed over to the Labour Party. As for foreign policy, regardless of everything, concentrate on relying on and utilizing everything in the United States. These are the two major policies set by Churchill. After the start of the war, the Soviet Union was also used. Therefore, Britain has been fighting with the strength of others from the beginning. However, the United States believes that this world war is, in a certain sense, a war of inheritance of the British Empire. There are three expected successors to this British Empire: Germany in Europe, Japan in the Pacific, and the United States in the Atlantic. Then the competition for determining the scope of each labor force can also be established. The British Empire is gradually shrinking. Willkie of the United States uttered wild words recklessly, and Churchill expressed his indignation and anger, saying: "I am not doing the liquidator of the British Empire." The United States has troops stationed in important places within the territory of the British Empire, and has gradually sent troops to all properties that can be regarded as assets. In this way, the war waged by Britain is a war of political intent, a war of political nature, not a war for survival like ours.

Britain has been fighting for four years. The recent battle situation is surprisingly advantageous, but that is thanks to the United States. Therefore, it has aroused the American desire to inherit the legacy. In Africa, the United States has built semi-permanent airfields, Iran has American troops stationed there, and there are also American troops in Iceland. The United States probably intends to use Ceylon. That being said, the British naturally hope that the war will end sooner rather than later. If the war continues to drag on, even if they win, it will not be Britain's victory, but America's. As a result, Britain fears that it will become a state of America. Isn't Britain harboring this fear? Then, in our position, even though we are suffering, we should resist to the end and defeat them. Italy has already been deceived and surrendered by Britain and the United States, and as a result, the independent country of Italy has also perished.

We suffer on this side, and of course the other side also suffers. Such a big war, of course, has its ups and downs (to be continued). (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, October 19)

### On the Issue of Coal Briquette Control

— By Mr. Zhang

In present-day Shanghai, coal briquettes are indeed an indispensable fuel. They are cheaper than charcoal and more convenient than firewood. As such, residents who use coal briquettes as fuel account for nearly 85% of the city's population. This startling figure further proves the critical role coal briquettes play among fuels and the significant impact its production volume has on the safety and well-being of the city's residents!

Over the past month, the supply of coal briquettes has dwindled day by day, and the sense of panic has increased in tandem. Especially in recent days, citizens have faced the threat of running out of fuel, which, if prolonged, will greatly undermine public livelihood and stability. The root cause of this situation, without a doubt, is the decrease in coal dust allocated to coal briquette factories by the authorities. Meanwhile, the imperfect control system and the declining profits of manufacturers are also major reasons for the acute shortage of spot supply and the abnormally high black market prices.

Alleviating the suffering of the people and finding ways to bring the essential fuel, coal briquettes, to a state of balanced supply and demand is indeed a major issue that the authorities should urgently study and realize!

Increasing the allocation of coal dust to manufacturing plants will provide them with ample raw materials for producing briquettes. This will result in robust production, naturally balancing supply and demand, and the black market will disappear on its own, while the panic will subside without needing any medicine. However, the authorities have their own difficulties in reducing the allocation of coal dust. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the authorities will adhere to the principles of "expanding sources and reducing expenditures," both by facilitating the sourcing of coal and by striving to conserve unnecessary and dispensable consumption, which will slightly aid the production of coal briquettes.

However, adjusting the coal briquette control mechanism and slightly increasing the profits of manufacturers are also issues worth noting.

Regarding the issue of adjusting the coal briquette control mechanism, it is necessary to first understand its original organization, its development process, and the overview of the current organization. Only then can we examine the merits and demerits of the organizational structure and the imperfections of the current organization, and have a relatively appropriate improvement for future organizational adjustments.

Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the supply of coal briquettes has been similar to the present situation. It took the efforts of the authorities and Sino-Japanese coal companies to establish the following control mechanism:

The above chart shows the most complete organization of the control mechanism. At the beginning of its establishment, it was naturally incomplete and lacked coordination. The effectiveness of the control was, therefore, very limited. By the time it reached a complete state, although its effectiveness was not as satisfactory as ideal, the mission of control was still largely accomplished.

The detailed organizational procedures of the chart are now described below, so as to clarify the situation of the control at that time.

The China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board and the Coal Control Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council were parallel institutions, possessing the special authority to permit movement within the Shanghai area. The Coal Federation was an intermediary between the Asia Development Board and the coal briquette association, and the major Chinese coal companies. It had the power to review and approve the quantity of raw materials and roasted coal allocated to each coal briquette manufacturer each term, and to issue permits to the major companies. Therefore, in reality, the Coal Federation exercised the major power of allocation. The first department of the Coal Briquette Association was composed of Japanese manufacturers, while the second department was jointly formed by 29 large and small Chinese manufacturers in Shanghai. The organization of the first department involved fewer livelihood-related matters and will not be discussed for the time being. As for the second department, its work mainly consisted of conveying orders from the authorities and investigating the monthly production, sales, and inventory quantities of each factory. The major Chinese coal companies were composed of more than ten coal companies. Its mission was merely to purchase allocated quantities from the Japanese Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Iwai & Co. and sell them to coal briquette manufacturers, collecting commissions. As for the responsibilities of the Coal Control Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in addition to mobility permits, its main tasks also included issuing business licenses to small vendors and secretly investigating price changes.

At that time, the permit for raw materials issued by the Asia Development Board to manufacturers was valid for ten days, allowing transport from Japanese coal depots in Pudong to the designated coal briquette factories. The permit for small vendors to transport coal briquettes from factories to shops was valid for one month. It remained in use in the early days of the Asia Development Board's restructuring (into the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai).

The responsible person for the Coal Control Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council was Mr. Duifg, and the person in charge of coal briquette control affairs was Mr. Cornwell. There were two types of permits issued by the Committee: one was a Customer Permit, valid for one month, used for transporting briquettes from factories to small vendors; the other was a Picul Permit, valid for 24 hours, used for factories to deliver directly to designated customers.

In the first half of this year, due to the abundance of briquette manufacturing materials, the production of coal briquettes was in a state of oversupply. In view of this, the authorities gradually cancelled all of the above permits, making the materials free to move.

As for the current organization, apart from the Coal Control Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council which has long been cancelled, the rest remains the same as before.

The above is an outline of the control mechanism. Although the allocation of raw materials still has to be determined by the Coal Federation, the movement of coal and coal briquettes is a free policy. The cause of this black market and shortage lies here.

Regarding the profits of coal briquette manufacturers, according to the cost table formulated by the Second Department of the Coal Briquette Association in April of this year, the distribution is as follows: Raw material cost: Raw material coal: 307.89 yuan, Coal dust: 69.42 yuan, Transportation and shortage: 21.00 yuan, Yellow mud: 8.00 yuan, Expense costs: Roasting coal: 35.00 yuan, Water and electricity: 8.00 yuan, Labor and meals: 25.00 yuan, Interest: 8.00 yuan, Repair and depreciation: 46.00 yuan, Office expenses: 27.00 yuan, Manufacturer's profit: 14.69 yuan, Total: 570.00 yuan. Note: The cost is based on per ton as the standard. According to the above table, (in April) if the manufacturer sells at a wholesale price of 570 yuan per ton, it can obtain a net profit of 14 yuan and 69 cents. Currently, the wholesale price of the same industry is 550 yuan. Although the price of allocated raw materials is cheaper than before, the increase in transportation costs, coal ash, raw mud, and cost of expenses directly affect the increase in manufacturing costs, which indirectly affects the reduction of profits. In Shanghai, where the cost of living is high, who would be willing to invest in this low-profit industry? Therefore, general manufacturers secretly sell the raw materials used to make coal briquettes at high prices to seek huge profits. In this way, the output of coal briquettes is, of course, reduced.

As for small vendors, they purchase from manufacturers at 550 yuan per ton, plus transportation and other expenses. Then, what is the net profit they get when they sell to customers at 650 yuan per ton? What's more, recently, various manufacturers have been adding other expenses under different names – in this way, is the creation of a black market inevitable?

Recently, the Materials Control Office has been sending personnel to investigate and eliminate the black market. However, I believe that this is not a fundamental solution. On the contrary, it will cause the supply to be even more lacking.

Finally, I sincerely hope that the authorities will, on the one hand, slightly increase prices to enable manufacturers to obtain legitimate profits, and at the same time strengthen the control of various manufacturing plants, so that the allocated coal and the quantity of production and sales form a regulated proportion. In this way, manufacturers will obtain considerable profits and, given the strict control of the authorities, will not be able to carry out their tricks and secretly sell coal. With more raw materials, production will naturally increase, and the black market will disappear without being suppressed. However, this is a relatively easy rescue method to implement at present. As for the most complete system, of course, it still depends on the authorities' urgent implementation of the rationing system.
