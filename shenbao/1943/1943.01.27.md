### On the Youth Movement

Youth is the morning sun, is spring, is the roaring tide, possessing boundless radiance, warmth, vitality, and future prospects. This is speaking from the perspective of youth itself. Youth is the lifeblood of the nation, the pillars of society, and the masters of the future destiny of mankind. This is speaking from the perspective of youth's position in the nation, society, and among mankind. Because youth has these characteristics, the era of youth is an era worth singing about, worth weeping for, worth revering, and worth going mad for. Other countries aside, just speaking of our own country, from ancient times to the present, countless youths have gloriously struggled for the sake of the nation, for the sake of society, and for the destiny of all mankind, causing many middle-aged people to feel ashamed and older people to sigh with admiration.

Presently, China is situated in a new era. In this new era, can it do without the participation of young people? No, it cannot. Can we engage in empty talk about the youth movement while being detached from reality? No, we cannot. The present is an era that requires the revitalization of the youth movement. However, the first question is, who do we hope will lead the youth movement? We believe that the leaders of the youth movement must have their own minds and bodies that are pure and flawless, must have words and actions that are completely consistent and can serve as a model for young people, must possess a noble and pure character, must have correct thoughts, and must be able to thoroughly understand the psychology and aspirations of modern Chinese youth, and be people who can strive to satisfy the normal desires of modern Chinese youth.

Secondly, given the arduousness of the current era and the protracted nature of the war, the government authorities should have a comprehensive policy for the youth movement. This policy must be tailored to China's history, China's social realities, and the common psychology of Chinese youth; otherwise, blindly copying foreign youth movement systems and blindly imitating foreign youth movement policies will inevitably result in "exerting effort without gaining favor." The disastrous failure of the youth movement in Chongqing over the past six years is precisely because it disregarded the national conditions and blindly copied foreign models. It is especially worth mentioning here that we must absolutely reverse the special agent system implemented by the Chongqing regime, which has ruined the youth movement. This special agent system has sacrificed countless innocent and pure youths and has destroyed countless amiable, lovable, promising, and capable young cadres for the nation and society. At the same time, it has also created opportunities for the Communist Party. Again, the authorities should treat the youth with a compassionate and nurturing heart, viewing each youth as their own children. Even if the children go down the wrong path, or unfortunately go down the wrong path due to motives of loving the country and loving society, they should use methods of persuasion and guidance, and use a compassionate and faithful attitude, to influence them, to move them. We can say that there is absolutely no incorrigible and unfilial person who cannot be sincerely moved. On the part of the youth themselves, in the current new era, first of all, they should oppose pessimistic and disappointed sentiments toward the nation, the ethnicity, and the youth movement. They should oppose the words and actions of generally wanting to be peaceful civilians and losing the attitude that they should have in wartime. They should even more oppose being dejected and corrupt. The atmosphere of "gathering together all day long, without speaking of righteousness" is precisely the most dangerous phenomenon currently. Here, on the one hand, we hope that the authorities will use an open and magnanimous attitude and a compassionate and gentle method to do their best to dispel the dark clouds in front of the youth; on the other hand, we even more hope that the youth themselves will recognize reality, grasp the correct outlook on life, and intensify their studies and self-cultivation without the slightest relaxation.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in the Don Region, German Forces Continue to Batter Stalingrad, Combat Situation is Quite Intense

German Headquarters, 26th, Havas News Agency - This afternoon, the German military bulletin stated that fighting with Soviet troops in many parts of Eastern Europe has intensified. Although German troops are outnumbered, the enemy still has no opportunity to exploit. In Stalingrad, a small unit of Croatian troops, along with German troops, are concentrated in the central and southern parts of the city. German aircraft are assisting in the battle, and the combat situation is extremely difficult. In the Kupensk and Manik areas, Soviet troops were repelled after fierce fighting. To shorten the front lines, German troops withdrew to predetermined positions. German armored and mechanized units in the Manik area continued their offensive and were quite successful. The enemy forces retreated to the northeast. Fierce fighting continues in the Don region. Enemy forces southwest of Voronezh launched another attack and were mostly repelled, suffering considerable losses and heavy casualties. Soviet forces southwest of Rzhev and Velikiye Luki attempted an attack but were unsuccessful. Although the Soviet offensive south of Lake Ladoga was covered by tanks, it still did not achieve its desired outcome.

Moscow, 26th, Reuter - Last night's special communique from the Soviet Information Bureau stated that Soviet troops have recaptured the city of Voronezh on the upper Don River.

Berlin, 26th, Havas News Agency - Although the Soviet offensive south of Lake Ilmen is fierce, it has not achieved any major breakthroughs. Fighting in the central sector of the Eastern Front is also only of a local nature. However, the fighting between Voronezh and the Black Sea is the most intense, and it is impossible to predict when it will weaken. The German counter-offensive and the harsh weather have thwarted the Soviet offensive, but the Soviet forces are still trying to attack, hoping to break through the German lines. The German forces are now adopting a strategy of shortening the front lines and conducting mobile warfare. One week ago, the southern sector of the Eastern Front held by German troops extended from Voronezh in the north to the Terek River in the south. In order to concentrate their forces and avoid the risk of being attacked on the flanks, the German forces began to shorten the front lines. The fighting between the Donets and Don rivers is now concentrated in a few key strongholds. Soviet forces once penetrated the German lines but were immediately annihilated by our troops. Soviet forces are also very active in the lower Don River, and their motorized units were advancing westward when they were cut off by German troops. Some were destroyed by German troops, and some were forced to retreat. German troops are making progress in operations in the Manych Steppe. German troops in the Kupensk area were shifting their positions westward, but the Soviet forces still did not dare to advance lightly. In the mountainous areas of the western Caucasus, the Soviet forces recently concentrated five divisions, attempting to break through our lines, but were defeated by a fierce resistance from the German and Slovak allied forces. Although the Soviet forces have penetrated the German lines in several places in the Stalingrad area, and although German supplies are difficult, the morale of the soldiers remains as firm as ever.

General Dittmar Broadcasts Praise for the German Sixth Army

Berlin, 26th, Havas News Agency - General Dittmar gave a radio broadcast here, stating that the German Sixth Army is bravely fighting in Stalingrad and has a major impact on the Soviet offensive in the southern sector of the Eastern Front. If General Paulus were to abandon Stalingrad, the Soviet forces would use the transportation lines leading southwest and west through Stalingrad. The German defense of Stalingrad prevents the Soviet forces from attacking Rostov from the lower Don River, thereby cutting off the connection between Ukraine and the Caucasus. The heroic resistance of the German troops has given the German command ample time to plan countermeasures. Although the Soviet forces have occupied some territory, their economic position is still not secure. The Soviet forces will likely continue their offensive, but the opportunities for the German troops have already increased.

Berlin, 26th, Havas News Agency - The German newspapers here unanimously praised the heroic resistance of the German troops in the Stalingrad area last night and revealed that the German Sixth Army and two Romanian divisions in the Stalingrad area are in a serious situation. The current defensive strategy adopted by the German troops is aimed at containing the progress of the Soviet forces. The pressure on Stalingrad is the greatest in all sectors of the Eastern Front today. The heroic resistance of the German soldiers there is the greatest achievement, which will not only be praised by contemporaries, but will also be immortalized in future generations.

### Rommel Arrives in Mareth, Concentrates Troops to Establish Defenses and Hold Firm, Fierce Fighting Reported in the Ossetia River Basin, Germans Occupy Jebel Boudabbous Mountains

Berlin, 25th, Havas News Agency -

Military sources have recently stated that General Rommel's troops, although subjected to continuous bombing by British aircraft in the area bordering Libya and Tunisia, have avoided contact with enemy forces with minimal losses and have crossed the Tunisian border. All motorized units and infantry are safe and sound. General Rommel is currently concentrating his forces in Mareth (70 miles from the Tunisian border). It is expected that the German forces will hold this area and maintain it for a long time.

Berlin, 26th, Havas News Agency - Rommel's Axis forces in Tunisia are now free from enemy resistance, as Montgomery himself admits. When the German-Italian allied forces withdrew to the northwest on January 24 and 25, Montgomery missed the opportunity to attack the flanks of the German-Italian allied forces from the south. Montgomery's attacks on the flanks of the Axis forces have been ongoing for three weeks, but have not been realized. This shows that the British military operations have not been commanded as desired. The British offensive has also been thwarted. The British vanguard had contact with the Axis forces some time ago, but failed. It seems that the British must first adjust their supply bases, reorganize their troops, and then talk about war again. The Axis forces have the advantage of terrain and can wait for the enemy to exhaust themselves. At the same time, the strength of the Axis forces in Tunisia is growing daily, the supply problem has also been solved, and the key points of Tunisia are under the control of the Axis forces, so the enemy forces will not be able to succeed again.

Rome, 26th, Havas News Agency - This afternoon's Italian military bulletin stated that between January 19 and 24, the Axis forces in Tunisia captured 4,000 enemy soldiers, seized or destroyed 13 enemy tanks, 70 cannons, approximately 200 vehicles, approximately 100 machine guns, and countless other war materials. West of Tripoli, there were only skirmishes yesterday. Enemy troops attacking Tunisia were repelled and eight armored vehicles were destroyed. German aircraft shot down four enemy aircraft, and anti-aircraft guns shot down one enemy aircraft. A British aircraft shot down in Bacinono on the evening of January 22 has been found to have crashed into the sea. Enemy aircraft attacked Avola and Amabiliema, causing minor ground damage. In the Mediterranean, an Italian submarine sank an 18,000-ton transport ship under enemy escort.

Swiss Capital, 25th, Havas News Agency - According to sources from the Axis and British-American sides, fierce fighting continued in the Ossetia River basin in Tunisia yesterday. The Allied Headquarters in North Africa issued a war report stating that the German offensive in the area has stopped, but the German forces have occupied the Jebel Boudabbous Mountains. British and American aircraft bombed the port of Bizerte yesterday. The French Dissident Headquarters also issued a war report stating that General Leclerc's troops, starting from north of Lake Chad, have reached the Jebel Mefou Mountains. French troops are also fighting in the Gafsa area in southern Tunisia, which is becoming increasingly important as it will be the place where the Axis forces will link up their left and right flanks. However, according to news from Berlin and Rome, there were only local battles yesterday, and the Axis forces achieved some success, capturing many prisoners and occupying several strategically important locations. German aircraft continued to bomb Allied communication lines and shipping along the coast of Algeria.

Swedish Capital, 26th, Havas News Agency - London dispatches report that political figures in the British capital are quite disappointed with the slow progress of the Tunisian war and the failure of the British Eighth Army to pursue the German-Italian allied forces. Newspapers are also critical. The military correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" wrote that it is a mistake to say that General Rommel's forces are weak and cannot hold the so-called Mareth Line. The well-known British military commentator Liddell Hart also stated in the "Daily Mail" that Montgomery's failure to cut off General Rommel's troops should not be excused by the British War Office. If Britain could have used trained paratroopers and transport aircraft in time, Montgomery could have found a way to land behind the German and Italian forces and surround them. Based on the experience gained in North Africa, it is difficult for us to transfer the war to Western Europe.

### US Food Production Declines, Strict Rationing to be Implemented, General Price Index All Increase

Buenos Aires, 26th, Central News Agency - According to dispatches from Washington, US Food Commissioner Wickard and Manpower Commissioner McNutt jointly met with reporters on the 25th and issued a warning on the issue of rural labor supply. They stated that there are still three million people in the United States engaged in unnecessary work, and these personnel must be sent to rural areas before the agricultural season this summer. The food problem is extremely serious, and if the rural labor supply fails this year, a major crisis will occur in the future.

Lisbon, 25th, Havas News Agency -

Washington dispatches report that, according to the Department of Agriculture, the United States will strictly implement food rationing in the near future, and that food production in 1942 decreased by approximately 13 percent compared to the previous year. In addition, food must be provided to Britain and other Allied countries, so the food situation is not optimistic.

Argentine Capital, 26th, Havas News Agency - Washington dispatches report that US Agriculture Secretary Wickard declared in his annual report that the United States will take stricter measures to restrict food in the near future, even if the 1943 harvest is bountiful, this measure may not be avoided. The US government needs 50 percent of the food in 1943 to supply the military and transport it to countries where the United States provides food under the Lend-Lease Act.

Lisbon, 25th, Havas News Agency -

According to news from New York, US prices increased by an average of 10 percent last year, but food increased by 20 percent. The general price index increased from 93.2 to 101 between December of the previous year and December of last year, while the food price index increased from 92.6 to 108.3. This has once again sparked discussions about the crisis of inflation in the United States.

### Finnish Political Leaders Visit Sweden

Stockholm, 26th (Haitong News Agency)

Local newspapers hold a reserved attitude towards the visit of Finnish cabinet members and leaders of the Finnish Social Democratic Party to Sweden over the weekend. Apart from rumors, nothing has been revealed about the purpose of this visit. The Swedish people are very concerned about the fate of Finland, especially in recent times. Great attention is being paid here to the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Finland. The upcoming Finnish presidential election is also a topic of discussion here. Sweden also attaches great importance to the situation on the Eastern Front, as increased Soviet pressure on Finland also increases the threat to Sweden from the East.

### The US and Britain, Under the Deadlock in North Africa, Attempt to Stir Up Trouble Again in the Balkans to Reverse the Current Declining Trend in North Africa

The North African campaign, which the United States and Britain have been clamoring about, is no longer as powerful as it once was. More than two months have passed since the landings, and on the one hand, it has suffered fierce counterattacks from the Axis forces, causing two major setbacks. At the same time, within their own line, there was the assassination of Darlan, and the antagonism between Giraud and de Gaulle, fighting each other, revealing their ugly state. In order to make up for this failure, the United States and Britain have had to work hard to reinvigorate themselves and attempt to reverse the declining trend in other areas, so they are seeking new battlefields in the Eastern Mediterranean and West Asia, and presenting signs of their stirrings. What is the truth? It is something the world is eager to know. This newspaper has made a special international long-distance call to inquire about Special Correspondent Enomoto, to hear his report. Mr. Enomoto has been stationed in Turkey for many years and has recently traveled to Berlin to investigate the new situation in the Balkans.

This newspaper reports that according to recent foreign telegrams, it is widely rumored that US troops have landed on Cyprus, that riots have occurred in Iran, that the feelings of the people in West Asia towards the British and American forces have deteriorated, that British, American and Soviet diplomacy surrounding Turkey is very active, that the German army is strengthening the defenses of Crete and the Aegean Islands, and that the Bulgarian Army Chief's visit to Germany following the De Ro summit, and other events in West Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, give people a sense of unpredictability. Regarding these various matters, we would like to have a comprehensive report, and now we ask you to first describe the dynamics in West Asia.

Enomoto: The most noteworthy aspect of the recent situation in West Asia is the increasingly active military advance of the United States. Currently, from Palestine to Syria, Iraq, and Iran, the strength of the US military is estimated to be around 60,000 to 80,000, with approximately 400 aircraft. It is reported that the US side has drafted a plan to increase its forces to 250,000 by the end of March this year. In addition, there are also British and allied Polish, Greek, and Yugoslav troops, so the total strength of the British and American forces in West Asia is currently estimated to be between 200,000 and 250,000. If the US reinforcement plan can be realized as scheduled, then by the end of March, the total strength of the British and American forces will reach 400,000. Currently, US air force bomber squadrons, British commando units, and Greek troops are concentrated on Cyprus, preparing for a counter-offensive in Southeast Europe. The British and American plan seems to be aimed at instigating strikes and riots in the Balkan countries in March and April, in order to disrupt the Axis's rear lines in the Balkans, while the troops gathered in West Asia will first attack Cyprus and the Dodecanese Islands in coordination, following the example of the previous Great War, to attempt a landing operation in Thessaloniki. In Turkey, the British and Americans have also opened up many of the borders between Turkey and Syria, as well as the Aegean coast of Thrace, and have introduced many British, American, Australian, and New Zealand troops, engaging in the construction of airfields, trenches, barracks, and roads.

This newspaper: It is widely rumored that there are food riots in Iran, which shows that the feelings of the Iranian people towards the British and American forces seem to have deteriorated considerably.

Enomoto: There are two accounts regarding the food riots in Iran. Although the British, Americans, and Soviets deliberately exaggerated the food panic in Iran, according to information from travelers who have actually inspected the recent situation in Iran, the food situation in Iran is not as bad as they claim. The story of the food riots is nothing more than a strategic propaganda by the British, Americans, and Soviets using the name of internal unrest in Iran to expand their occupied territories. Iraq, which has already declared war on the Axis powers, seems to have joined the war as a result of the regent of the Nuri al-Said puppet regime, Abdul-Ilah, visiting Cairo at the end of December last year and reaching an agreement with the American forces in West Asia under Alexander. It is reported that the conditions for Iraq's participation in the war are to join the Atlantic Charter, guarantee independence after the war, and have a say in the postwar period. However, from the British and American perspective, the main purpose is to first summon approximately three Iraqi divisions to serve as coolies for the British and American forces in West Asia and to completely occupy Iraq's military bases. As a result of the participation in the war, the anti-British sentiment of the Iraqi people has been strengthened. (Ding: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, January 19)

### Inland Students Conscripted into Military Service

Macau Correspondence

Those Aged 18 to be Called Up, Assigned to Services According to Level of Education

January 20th

Recently, many young students have come from Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places. It is said that the Chongqing authorities have stipulated that all students of conscription age must be called up for service. According to the "Conscription Office," students who are 18 years old should be enlisted immediately and that starting from January of the 32nd year of the Republic, lots will be drawn and those selected will be conscripted in order of selection. Service assignments will be based on their level of education. As for the method of conscription, the principle is that students are conscripted based on their place of origin. However, if their families have permanently moved to another location, they will be conscripted there. After students draw lots, those who have completed elementary school or junior high school will not be conscripted. Those who have completed senior high school, vocational school, or university and are less than one year away from graduation will be allowed to postpone their enlistment until after graduation. Regarding the length of student service, it is stipulated that those who have served for two years will be allowed to return to school. Those who have obtained the qualifications of reserve sergeants will have their service reduced to one year and six months, and those who have obtained the qualifications of reserve officer candidates will have their service reduced to one year. It is planned that the length of service will not be extended during wartime. To encourage teachers, it is planned to reduce the length of service for normal school students to one year. After students are conscripted, they will be assigned to officer corps, army and air force academies, training teams, student teams, model teams, mechanized units, military police regiments, artillery and engineering units, communications units, etc., or serve in military political, administrative, transportation, and military medical work, depending on their level of education and aspirations.

### Washington Holds Consecutive Meetings to Discuss Dealing with the War Situation. General Marshall May be Appointed Commander of the Allied Forces in the European Theater. A Department to Deal with Submarine Tactics is Also Planned.

Lisbon, 26th (Domei News Agency)

According to reports from London, British newspapers yesterday speculated that U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall might be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in the European theater. The Washington dispatch of the London Daily Mail said that according to the opinions of some "deep observers" in Washington, General Marshall will be appointed as the commander of the Allied forces in Europe. The London News Chronicle also carried unconfirmed news from Washington that General Eisenhower might be replaced by General Marshall. After the establishment of the North African puppet regime, General Eisenhower and Murphey, the representative of the U.S. State Department, were criticized by the American and British public. The public believed that Eisenhower's choice of the former French Interior Minister Peton as the governor of Algiers was his own idea, and was therefore criticized. Some American newspapers also criticized Murphey for interfering too much in the political situation in French North Africa as a mistake.

Lisbon, 26th (Domei News Agency)

According to reports from Washington, representatives from the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing are holding daily meetings there to discuss ways to deal with the two major threats. The so-called two major threats are the Axis submarine warfare and the internal strife in the political situation in French North Africa. Sources close to the U.S. government said that, according to estimates by experts in Washington, the submarine threat causes the Allied side to lose one million tons of ships per month. How to concentrate ships to supply each war zone and how to step up shipbuilding are being discussed. The second issue proves that the North African campaign has exposed the fragility of the Allied diplomatic and political relations beyond expectations. U.S. Secretary of State Hull recently declined to comment on whether there has been any progress in the dispute between de Gaulle and Giraud, which shows that this matter occupies an important position in international negotiations. According to Macmillan, the situation in North Africa is a version of other similar situations, which can occur at any time and urgently needs to be fundamentally resolved.

Lisbon, 26th (Haitong News Agency)

According to news from Washington, the U.S. Secretary of State said yesterday at an intelligence conference that the Allied countries are currently considering unifying the Allied war strategy. Political circles believe that the Allied countries will appoint a commander in charge of the Mediterranean war, or will merge the headquarters of General Eisenhower, the commander of the Allied forces in North Africa, and General Alexander, the commander of the British forces in the Near East.

Stockholm, 26th (Haitong News Agency)

A correspondent from Swedish newspapers stationed in London reported that British politicians have many speculations about the Washington Conference. The previous rumor that the Allied countries would form an Allied military conference composed of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing after the conference has been denied by London. They believe that without a change in Soviet foreign policy, it is impossible for this military conference to be established. The main topic discussed at the Washington Conference was the North African issue, so it might as well be called the British-American Conference. The United States and Britain, in view of the danger of submarine warfare, may also set up a department to deal with submarine tactics, under the command of Admiral Nobel.

Giraud and de Gaulle Will Sign Military Agreement

Stockholm, 26th (Haitong News Agency)

Swedish newspapers report that the official communique of the London Washington Conference has not yet been released. The "New General Daily" said that the British people know the facts of the Washington Conference from the reports of British newspaper representatives stationed in the United States. Informed sources in London are optimistic about the future cooperation of the Allied countries. According to the London "Daily Telegraph," the Allied Military Committee, including representatives from Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, will make important decisions within a few weeks. The committee maintains close cooperation with other Allied countries and discusses major military and political events. The first issue to be resolved is the North African issue. Giraud and de Gaulle will sign a military agreement stipulating the candidates to participate in North African politics. In addition, the issue of the supreme commander of the Allied forces in the Mediterranean region will also be resolved by the committee. U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall may take this position.

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) The German Foreign Ministry, based on newspaper reports and private telegrams, believes that Churchill is currently holding talks in the United States. However, whether he will go to Moscow on his way back to report the results of the talks in the United States is questionable. The German Foreign Ministry believes that Churchill's second trip to the United States is aimed at resolving the chaos in the North African political situation. The discord between Britain and the United States over the North African issue has reached its extreme, and it is necessary for Churchill to go to the United States in person to have a heart-to-heart talk with Washington. Therefore, Churchill's trip to the United States is a measure to ease the tense situation in North Africa. After Peton was appointed as the new Governor of Algeria, the discord between Britain and the United States in North Africa was further deepened. According to the opinion of German diplomatic circles, another issue discussed by Churchill and Roosevelt is the relationship between Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States, and the Soviet Union. The British Foreign Ministry has recently been very uneasy about the Soviet Union's attitude, because the Soviet Union has not said a word about the plan after the Allied victory. Therefore, Britain and the United States should decide on a common policy towards the Soviet Union. Recently, the Allied countries have been extremely anxious about the threat of German submarines and the sinking of Allied ships. Therefore, the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting will obviously discuss countermeasures to deal with German submarines. In addition, the differences between British and American policies towards South American countries are also within the scope of the Washington Conference's discussions. The German Foreign Ministry believes that Churchill is trying to obtain guarantees from the United States to limit Washington's power in South America to a certain extent. However, it is very difficult for Churchill to achieve his goals with the above-mentioned missions.

### Administrative Governor of Western Tunisia Assassinated

Rome, 26th (Haitong News Agency) It has been learned here that Gadaore, who previously had considerable influence in western Tunisia, was appointed as the administrative governor of western Tunisia by General Eisenhower, but has now been assassinated by Arab nationalist activists. Gadaore was considered a traitor in the eyes of the people of western Tunisia.

### German Scientific Laboratory Discovers Method for Treating Freezing Deaths

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) A German scientific laboratory has recently discovered a method to prevent freezing deaths. The results obtained from animal experiments are very satisfactory. In the past, it was not clear what caused death from severe cold. Now, after German scientists have experimented, it is known that the cause of freezing death is lack of oxygen at low temperatures, which causes the blood pigment in the body to stiffen. Therefore, the old method of using hot water to revive frozen people can now be replaced with short-wave therapy, which is more effective. Germany is now adopting this new treatment method, which has been very effective. The mortality rate has been reduced from 78% to 35%.

### Norwegian Coastal Defenses Are Well-Prepared, British Troops Attempt to Land Without Success. Afterwards, Reports Claim Two British Vessels Sunk.

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) Haitong News Agency learned from responsible sources here last night that seven British motor torpedo boats attempted to break through the Norwegian coast on Saturday night in order to land their demolition troops near the town of Reinvik. However, the British ships were repelled by the German coastal defense forces and patrol boats before reaching the Norwegian coast. At that time, the results of the battle could not be observed due to poor visibility. However, according to a subsequent report from the aircraft, only five British ships returned to their country. From this, it can be seen that one British torpedo boat has been sacrificed in this battle.

### German Economic Minister Funk Delivers Speech

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) German Economic Minister and National Bank President Funk delivered a speech at the German Academy yesterday, entitled "The Spiritual and Material Foundations of the German Wartime Economy." The main idea was that Germany still has a large amount of manpower available for use, and that the production efficiency of totalitarian countries cannot be compared with that of free capitalist countries. The productivity under the control of the National Socialist wartime economy depends on its central planning and management. The merger and closure of some German factories is carried out in accordance with this policy. The use of transportation and labor must be based on the interests of the country. This can enable Germany to always outperform the enemy in the scope of wartime production. Germany and Italy's leadership of the European economic organization has formed a European "productivity group." The economic cooperation between Germany and Italy is aimed at increasing the economic power of the Axis countries and will be expanded into the basis of world trade in the future. The decision of Europe's fate does not lie in the war between Germany and Western Europe, but in the war between Germany and the Soviet Union, which has little to do with the Americas. If Germany and its allies do not fight for survival, it will be difficult to prevent the communization of Europe, which is also difficult for the Americas to tolerate. However, the Jewish capitalists of the United States and the Jewish Communists of the Soviet Union have colluded with each other, engaging in this world war with the same spirit and purpose.

### Australian Wartime Cabinet Continues to Meet

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency)

According to a dispatch from Canberra, the Australian government convened a wartime cabinet meeting on the 25th under the personal supervision of Prime Minister Curtin to hold important consultations on domestic and foreign policies. The content of the cabinet meeting is highly confidential and has not been released. The meeting continued on the 26th, and all cabinet members attended. After the cabinet meeting, Curtin delivered a broadcast speech to Australia, Britain, and the United States. The Australian Parliament is scheduled to meet on the 27th, and there are many important proposals to be discussed, such as supplementary budget proposals, which urgently need to be resolved. The Labor Party internally opposes Curtin's war policies, so it is expected that the current cabinet has encountered a major crisis. In addition, the Labor Party also held a party congress on the 26th, and other opposition parties held congresses at the same time to increase their momentum.

### New Building of Japanese Embassy in Germany Completed, German Deputy Foreign Minister Transfers Building

Haitong News Agency Berlin, 26th The new building of the Japanese Embassy in Germany was handed over to Japanese Ambassador General Oshima yesterday afternoon. The building is located in the center of the Berlin embassy district on Tiergartenstrasse and was designed by famous German architects. It is made of marble and good wood, and the interior decoration is very exquisite. At the handover ceremony yesterday, the German representative told Ambassador Oshima that the German side had exhausted its efforts in the construction of the building to make the residence of friendly Japan comfortable. German Deputy Foreign Minister Hullmann, representing Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, handed over the golden key of the building to the Japanese ambassador yesterday. Ambassador Oshima replied, saying that the new building is a symbol of the friendship between Japan and Germany and a guarantee of the victory of the Axis countries. After Japan uses the building, the cooperation between Japan and Germany will become closer.

### Chilean Military Preparations

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Central News Agency) The Chilean government, unable to withstand the high pressure from the US government, has finally severed diplomatic relations with the Axis countries. According to reports from Santiago, the current military situation in Chile is roughly as follows: (Army) The current army has four divisions, approximately 80,000 men, with excellent equipment and well-trained, the best in Central and South America.

### Nanjing Municipal Government Allocates 200,000 Yuan to Handle Winter Relief

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) This severe winter has arrived, and the poor are crying for food. The Nanjing Municipal Government, in view of this, convened a meeting of responsible persons from various charitable organizations yesterday to discuss the matter. It was decided that the municipal government would allocate 200,000 yuan to handle winter relief, 100,000 yuan for small loans, and 100,000 yuan for relief funds.

### Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Will Establish Federation

Hanoi, 25th (Domei News Agency) The overseas Chinese in northern French Indochina will hold a ceremony here on February 1 to establish a federation to strengthen their support for the Nanjing government's war efforts.

### Chengdu Miscellany January 20 (Transmitted from Macau)

Li Guangpu, the director of the Xikang Finance Department, came to Chengdu from Kangding. It is said that since Xikang Province was established in the 28th year of the Republic, the provincial-level financial revenue has increased from more than 900,000 yuan to more than 13 million yuan. The county-level self-governance finance is currently being reorganized. It is expected that the county-level self-governance financial income of the entire Xikang Province can reach more than 30 million yuan when the reorganization is completed.

One hundred and thirty-nine counties and cities in Sichuan Province have established temporary parliamentary assemblies, with a total of 3,532 councilors, of which 3,398 are male and 134 are female.

### Japanese Revised Cabinet Control Strengthening Prime Minister's Authority

The defects of the Japanese cabinet system have become a common ailment of successive cabinets. The main reason for these defects is the egalitarianism of cabinet members. The position of the Prime Minister is merely the nominal head of the cabinet, and he actually has no power to direct cabinet members and maintain the unity of national policy. According to Article 55, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, the Prime Minister is in a position to assist and advise, and is essentially different from the Minister of State. According to Articles 2 and 3 of the Cabinet Official System, although he has special status and authority, he cannot be considered to have the power to direct or order other ministers. This point has always been an unresolved issue. Since the end of the party cabinet and the formation of a unified national cabinet, there has been a unanimous call to strengthen the authority of the Prime Minister for the sake of unifying national policy.

If the Cabinet Official System is revised to strengthen the position and authority of the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister uses the qualification of Minister of State to direct and order other ministers, it would conflict with the Constitution. However, in the position of administrative minister, the Prime Minister's position is superior to that of the ministers of each province, and it is not impossible to give instructions. Therefore, it can be legislatively recognized that the position of the Prime Minister is higher than that of the ministers of each province in administrative matters.

During the Abe Cabinet era in Showa 14 (1939), there was an imperial edict stating: "Overall control over the exercise of the National General Mobilization Law, etc." This measure centralized the implementation of the National General Mobilization Law to the Prime Minister. It stipulates that all provincial ministers must first consult with the Prime Minister regarding the implementation of the National General Mobilization Law; the Prime Minister may directly instruct the provincial ministers regarding the implementation of the National General Mobilization Law. The above-mentioned imperial edict is a precedent for strengthening the Prime Minister's authority in administrative matters. This wartime authority special case can also be regarded as following the previous example. The main issue is that the Prime Minister can instruct the ministers of each province. The so-called instruction is not legally considered to have any compliance, but it has considerable binding force. At present, it can be considered as recognizing the guiding position of the Prime Minister. (Transcribed by Ren from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, January 10th.)

### Approved by the Military Distribution Authority, Sugar and Oil Will Be Distributed According to Population, Based on the Household Registers of Baojia, Various Procedures Are Being Planned and Prepared

In order to maintain the legitimate needs of Shanghai residents for sugar and oil, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office and the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office have adopted a rationing method and handed it over to registered retailers to sell in accordance with the prescribed methods. Recently, in order to prevent reselling for profit and eliminate malpractices, a special request was submitted to the military distribution authority for approval to implement the distribution of sugar and oil according to population. Regarding the method of distribution according to population, the cooperative and the wholesale office have completed drafting and have separately issued notices to all retailers for re-registration. All preparations are in order, and the implementation will be announced publicly after consultation with the relevant authorities. A reporter from this newspaper learned from the sugar and oil offices yesterday that: (1) The distribution of sugar according to population has been determined to be piloted in the Nanshi area starting from the fourth phase. Distribution will be based on the household registers compiled by the Nanshi Baojia, and will be distributed according to population with the assistance of the Baojia organizations. The amount distributed will be based on the total amount approved by the military distribution authority and distributed evenly. The price will be calculated in accordance with the prescribed price limit. As for the remaining areas, starting from the fourth phase, sales will temporarily be based on house tax receipts, with each receipt allowing the purchase of 50 yuan of sugar. If the pilot project in Nanshi is effective, it will be implemented citywide starting from the fifth phase. (2) The distribution of oil according to population was first piloted by the wholesale office in cooperation with the Baojia districts. The results were quite good after households purchased oil with oil purchase certificates, and the activities of the oil squeezing gangs in the past have been slightly curbed. Currently, preparations are being actively made to implement the distribution of oil according to population in the near future, based on the household registers of the Baojia, and all methods are similar to the distribution of sugar according to population.

### Japanese Military Authorities Release Statement Explaining the Honest Attitude to Hold in the "War of Ideas"

From the Dōmei News Agency in Shanghai, a Japanese military spokesperson declared yesterday at the regular meeting for news reporters that the large number of Chongqing troops defecting to the Nanjing peace camp is the most powerful evidence that Chongqing's view in China has been weakened since the Nanjing government officially entered the war. Nanjing's declaration of war clearly indicates that the National Government has decided to cooperate with Japan to defeat the common enemy and establish a new order in East Asia. The strongest point of the Nanjing policy lies in this, which has a great impact on weakening Chongqing's anti-Japanese ideas. This can be proven by the increasing number of Chongqing troops surrendering voluntarily recently. Since Nanjing's entry into the war, there have been repeated discussions on strengthening China's industrial power to assist Japan, and strengthening military power to consolidate peace and order within the Nanjing jurisdiction. The spokesperson reiterated the contradictions in Chongqing's thinking, stating that on the one hand, Chongqing has decided to fight to the end to protect China's independence, and is led by Chiang Kai-shek to drive the people to achieve this goal. On the other hand, Chongqing must continue to rely on assistance from other countries, which shows that Chongqing's position is self-contradictory and holds the opposite view to Nanjing's policy. In this "war of ideas," Nanjing is indeed holding an honest attitude.

### China and Jiaotong Banks Prepare to Provide Agricultural Loans

Since the reorganization and resumption of business of the China and Jiaotong Banks in September of last year, they have been operating general commercial banking businesses in accordance with the regulations of the two banks promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, focusing on developing trade, supporting industry and commerce, promoting production and industry, handling investment and lending businesses for industry and commerce, and adjusting industrial and commercial economy with the cooperation of the Central Reserve Bank. Currently, the steps for resuming business in various branch offices are actively underway. In addition to the resumption of business in the branch offices in Hankou and Nantong, the branch offices in Wuxi, Suzhou, Bengbu, Wuhu, and other places can be resumed gradually after the Lunar New Year. It is understood that the two banks are preparing to handle rural lending businesses in the mainland in order to adjust rural capital and revitalize the economy. Currently, Jiaotong Bank has sent personnel to various townships to investigate the actual situation in rural areas. Those areas with abundant rural products and a definite need for funds will be given as much lending as possible.

### Foreign Minister Chu Returns to Nanjing After Completing Official Duties

Chu Minyi, member of the National Government and Minister of Foreign Affairs, returned to Nanjing by train yesterday afternoon after spending a week in Shanghai since his arrival on the 19th of this month. Minister Chu's visit to Shanghai was the first since the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States. Therefore, in addition to attending the establishment ceremony of the National Diplomacy Promotion Association on the 20th, he specifically visited the envoys of various friendly countries, the heads of the army and navy, and other leaders to express his gratitude. He also met with leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai for cordial talks, which were very harmonious.

### Grain Bureau Sets Deadline for Reporting Changes in Household Registration in Each District

The Municipal Grain Administration believes that the meticulousness of the distribution of grain according to population is of great importance to the changes in household registration in each district. In order to prevent any omissions in the distribution of food rations to citizens in the urban area, it specifically ordered the district offices in each district and the fang offices in Nanshi to report the changes in household registration in their respective districts in detail to the bureau before the end of each month. This will ensure that the distribution of food becomes more meticulous.

### Difficulty Finding Housing Near the End of the Year, Temporary Sheds and Stalls to Be Demolished Later

The authorities previously issued a notice through the Putuo District Baojia Association, ordering the parties concerned in the factories in the district to demolish all the temporary sheds and stalls in western Shanghai before the end of this month in order to avoid fires and prevent the spread of diseases, otherwise they would be strictly investigated. According to sources, after learning about this regulation from the authorities, the residents of the temporary sheds, because the end of the year is approaching and it has become more difficult to find housing since the implementation of the Baojia system in this city, have jointly requested the authorities to postpone the demolition. In consideration of the hardships of the poor residents of the temporary sheds, the authorities have extended the deadline for demolition to the end of April.

### Japanese Consuls-General of Three Provinces Hold Meeting to Decide on Economic Strategies for Central China Promoting the Initiative of Chinese People to Develop Construction Power Abolishing Regionalism and Implementing Comprehensive Development

The meeting of the Japanese Consuls-General and Consuls of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces was held at the Shanghai Office of the Embassy on the 23rd of this month. Although the details of the meeting on economic matters have not been specifically announced, the following general policies have been determined: (1) Promoting the economic activities of the Chinese people, enabling them to give full play to their original strengths and automatically participate in economic construction. (2) Correcting the regional groupism of each region and implementing comprehensive and unified economic countermeasures. (3) Opposing the complete application of the Japanese-style controlled economic system in China, but carefully considering the actual situation in Central China and adopting practical and feasible measures. (4) Comprehensively reorganizing various control organizations. (5) Actively developing surface and underground resources to enrich economic power.

### The Eighth Batch of Coal Distribution Postponed to Lunar New Year The Coal Distributed is a Type of Jiaozuo Coal Briquettes

The Shanghai Dazhong Coal Company has been purchasing goods in large quantities from various coal-producing areas in China and transporting them to Shanghai in a steady stream, distributing them to various counterparts in the industry on schedule. However, the bituminous coal distributed by the company to its counterparts is all submitted to the authorities in advance, and standard price limits are set. Therefore, any counterpart who obtains the goods must buy and sell according to the price limit and must not secretly increase the price to seek profits, because all counterparts who obtain the goods have been given generous profits under the law. According to news from the coal industry yesterday, the eighth batch of coal distribution was originally planned to be officially distributed in the near future, but because various procedures have not been fully completed, it may be postponed to the Lunar New Year. As for the type of coal distributed this time, it is a type of Jiaozuo coal briquettes, which is suitable for burning in major pancake and fried dough stick stalls. The total is

Three thousand five hundred tons

a decrease of 500 tons compared to the previous period, but the market price per ton has not yet been revealed. However, all counterparts in the industry have prepaid half of the payment to the Dazhong Coal Company, and the remaining half will be paid in full when the goods are shipped. It is understood that the amount of bituminous coal shipped to Shanghai recently has not decreased slightly compared to the past, which has greatly benefited the inventory. Due to the frugality of various circles, the demand for bituminous coal has sharply decreased. In the face of this situation of oversupply, the supply of spot chips has not increased, so the entire coal market situation is very stable.

### Central China Tobacco Distribution Association Bans Black Market and Implements Price Limits Cigarette Shops Must Register by January 31 Those Who Violate the Rules Will Have Their Distribution Stopped

The prices of all kinds of cigarettes will also be determined by the association, and prices must not be raised without authorization. Those who violate the rules will have their distribution stopped in order to thoroughly eliminate the black market cigarette prices. It is heard that in the future, cigarettes in various parts of Central China will also be distributed and sold by the association step by step through the establishment of branch offices. It is also learned that yesterday (the 26th), the following were designated by the association: (1) Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association (2) Tobacco Exchange Industry Association (3) Yongtaihe Company (4) Huayuan Tobacco Company (5) Chinese Cigarette Shanghai General Distributor (6) Nanshi Huayuanxingji Tobacco Company, and a large number of registration survey forms were issued to the cigarette shops.

For the first level of ex-factory prices of 7,500 yuan or more, the ad valorem tax rate is 55%; for the second level of ex-factory prices of 5,501 yuan to 7,500 yuan, the ad valorem tax rate is 50%; for the third level of ex-factory prices of 3,501 yuan to 5,500 yuan, the ad valorem tax rate is 45%; for the fourth level of ex-factory prices of 1,501 yuan to 3,500 yuan, the ad valorem tax rate is 40%; for the fifth level of ex-factory prices of 1,500 yuan or more, the ad valorem tax rate is 35%.

### The Way to Preserve Wealth (6)

— Nie Yuntai

What is the way of Heaven? The Book of Changes says that the alternation of Yin and Yang is the way. This Yin and Yang is not illusory; everything has facts to follow. Where there is day, there must be night; where there is cold, there must be heat; where there is spring and summer, there must be autumn and winter; where there is high tide, there must be low tide. Observing these natural phenomena of mountains and rivers, everything is a cycle of waxing and waning, increase and decrease. From this, we can extend it to human affairs, which are also like this: prosperity and decline, joy and sorrow, worry and happiness, order and chaos. However, the Yin and Yang of heavenly timing have certain standards that remain unchanged for all time; the prosperity and decline of human affairs change constantly with the movement of people's hearts. This kind of impermanent change still originates from the fixed standards of the way of Heaven, which is a cycle of Yin and Yang. Let me explain this as follows: If people like to be arrogant, there will definitely be a time when they suddenly lose their footing. If people like to be lazy and comfortable, there will definitely be extremely difficult days to come. If people like to be stingy and greedy for money, there will definitely be sons and grandsons who indulge in gambling and extravagance to ruin the family fortune. If people like to be cunning and calculating, there will definitely be foolish and stupid sons and grandsons who are deceived by others. Those with wisdom can naturally pay attention to and see these changing human affairs, knowing that they are exactly the same as the rising and setting of the sun and moon and the coming and going of cold and heat. The way of Heaven is like a Taijitu, half white and half black, with a boundary in between. If Yin and Yang lose their balance beyond this boundary, changes will occur, which is called Yin arising from the extreme of Yang and Yang arising from the extreme of Yin. In other words, extreme prosperity must decline, and extreme decline must lead to growth. The great sages of ancient times understood this principle, so they taught people to always put themselves in a disadvantaged position, that is, to be humble and yielding, to give away wealth without becoming poor, and to restrain oneself and benefit others. Common and ignorant people are absolutely unwilling to do such disadvantageous things. Modern scholars will scoff and say that this is passive morality. They do not know that all the great and active undertakings in world history have been done by people who follow this passive morality. Because being passive and self-restrained leads to actively benefiting others; giving away wealth without being greedy leads to managing public interests; and being humble and yielding makes people respect and admire us, making it easier to do things smoothly and succeed. The first step seems like a loss, but the second step is still a great advantage. Shallow and ignorant people can only see the surface of everything and cannot see the opposite. It's like playing chess, only seeing one move and not seeing the second or third move, not knowing that worldly affairs are all like playing chess. When I make a move, the opponent must respond to my move, and immediately there will be a second or third move following. Buddhism explains the principle of cause and effect, which is actually the highest science and philosophy in the world. I use playing chess as an analogy: every word we say and every deed we do is a move we make against others. The thoughts and intentions we have in mind when we speak and act are a move we make against Heaven. All people and all living things are our opponents in chess. If we show kindness to a dog, the dog will wag its tail and be friendly to us. If we speak harshly to it, it will drag its tail and walk away. The same is true for people. If I am humble and generous, people will be grateful. If I am arrogant and mean, people will resent me. These are still small opponents. If we bully those who are incapable, or secretly harm people, or use clever means to take advantage of them, causing them to suffer losses without even realizing it, or use our special position, such as being an official or the manager of a company, to secretly seek personal gain, or if we are already wealthy and do not want to help those in disaster while enjoying comfort in our own homes, these things are beyond the control of the public and the law cannot do anything about them. He considers himself to have won the chess game, and his opponents have all lost. However, the way of Heaven does not allow him to win and will act as his great opponent on behalf of the public, making a gentle move that leaves all his chess pieces in a stalemate, ultimately leading to his utter defeat. This is called "Man has a thousand calculations, but Heaven has only one." We are playing chess with people every day, but in reality, we are playing chess with Heaven. The more we win against people, the more seriously we will lose against Heaven. Conversely, if we are willing to be more lenient with people and help them at every turn, preventing them from losing, we will not lose too much ourselves, and we may even win a big game of chess against Heaven. The aforementioned Fan Zhongyan is the most obvious example. He was extremely poor to begin with, but after being a general and prime minister for decades, he still had no private land or mansions when he died. From the perspective of ordinary people, he was busy for nothing in his life. However, he won a big game of chess against Heaven, and his sons and grandsons were all noble, prosperous, and talented. The other ones such as Yerü Wenzheng, Lin Wenzhong, and Zeng Wenzheng were all willing to lose chess pieces, and in the end, they all won a big game of chess against Heaven. Those who could win chess pieces, made tens of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, but later lost everything when Heaven made a move. The ancients said, "Man can conquer Heaven, but Heaven can also conquer man." Heaven's decree is the unchanging principle of Heaven. The law of Yin and Yang requires balance. When people do things excessively, they lose that balance. Because our heart light reaches and counters the moderation of Yin and Yang, reactions occur and we are subject to the constraints of the laws of Yin and Yang, causing us to return to a state of equilibrium. Heaven plays chess without moving its heart or hands, and people are naturally defeated. For example, when we throw a ball against a wall, the ball will naturally bounce back. The greater the force of the throw, the greater the force of the rebound. The wall does not move its hands or exert any effort. Therefore, the Book of Documents says, "Calamities sent by Heaven may be avoided, but calamities brought on by oneself cannot be escaped." Mencius said, "What comes out of you will return to you." This means that self-made karma will receive its due reward, which is exactly the same as what the Buddhist scriptures say: "self-created cause, self-reaped result." Man conquering Heaven is not really conquering Heaven, it means that people act according to the principles of Heaven, and the victory they ultimately obtain is actually a victory of heavenly principles. Originally poor and lowly, later prosperous and successful; originally worried and troubled, later peaceful and happy. Such a victory is still a victory of heavenly principles. Although I say that virtuous people win a game of chess against Heaven, in reality, Heaven also wins. It must be known that the way of Heaven will never lose.

### Money and Banking Industries Well Prepared to Begin Year-End Closing Four-Day Holiday Scheduled from February 5th to 8th

Following the decision by the money industry to set the year-end closing date for the 31st year of the Republic of China as February 4th, all industries will follow suit and handle their year-end closings accordingly, with a four-day holiday scheduled from February 5th to 8th, and trading resuming on February 9th. According to news from the money and banking industries yesterday:

Notifications for Closing of Overdraft Accounts

(1) Due to the busy collections and payments related to the year-end closings of various banks and industries, the money shops have begun to handle their closings. All overdraft accounts, unless otherwise stipulated in a contract, have been separately notified to return all outstanding balances and interest before the year-end closing, calculated at 5 yuan. Interest owed up to January 30th will be calculated, and interest owed will be calculated at 28 yuan up to the year-end closing date. The time for receiving and returning checks for the lunar New Year's Eve by various banks and money shops, as well as the exchange time for notes by the money and banking industry exchange, will be discussed by the money industry clearing house and the joint bank reserve association. The daily upper and lower interbank lending rates in the money market have been formally announced yesterday and will be open until February 3rd, with interbank lending rates resuming on February 9th.

Dispatching Personnel to Collect Outstanding Debts

(2) In addition to handling year-end closings, various companies, factories, and firms have separately dispatched personnel to collect outstanding debts from previous periods. Except for this period, lending transactions will be suspended, and all transactions will be based on cash. Each will also carefully manage their financial position and repay outstanding overdraft accounts to the money shops in order to maintain the inherent commercial credit. Due to the year-end closings, the money market has scheduled shutdowns to close accounts, and trading will resume on the market after February 9th. Since the Central Reserve Bank and the money and banking industry reserve clearing house handled interbank lending for money shops, liquidity has remained stable, which is a normal phenomenon before the year-end closings. Therefore, all industries are determined to safely pass this year-end closing period.

### Changes to License Fees for Marriage, Funeral, and Coffin Transportation

According to reporter investigations, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Headquarters Traffic and Air Defense Section's proposal to change the license fees for marriage, funeral, and coffin transportation has been approved by the authorities and will be implemented today (the 27th). The fee schedule is: (1) Marriage procession license fee: 10 yuan per license; (2) Funeral procession license fee: 5 yuan per license; (3) Coffin transportation fee: 3 yuan per coffin.

### Ueno Taichu Succeeds as Head of the Education Department

The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that Mr. Ueno Taichu has been appointed as the head of the Education Department of this bureau from the 23rd of this month to fill the vacancy left by the former head, Mr. Hawkes Pugh.

### Japanese Military Spokesperson Discusses the Counteroffensive in Burma: Allied Forces Can Advance by Land, but Conflicting Opinions Make Implementation Difficult

A Reuter dispatch from Shanghai: Yesterday, a Japanese military spokesperson, at a reception for the press, criticized Chongqing's intensified propaganda regarding Allied offensives aimed at retaking Burma. The spokesperson stated that neither the Chongqing troops in India nor the Indian army possess the capability to counterattack Japanese forces in Burma. The spokesperson further noted that in addition to geographical difficulties, the Allied forces face disagreements among the Chongqing, British, and American commanders in India regarding the direction of attack and who should lead the assault. The spokesperson described Chongqing's hopes of recovering Burma by land as mere fantasies, elaborating on the difficulties the Allied forces would encounter in entering Burma and various obstacles along the Indo-Burmese border. Reportedly, the Allied forces have three possible routes for invading Burma: firstly, advancing from India through the Indo-Burmese border; secondly, attacking from Yunnan; and thirdly, launching a large-scale naval assault on the southwestern coast of Burma. However, the Indo-Burmese border presents immense challenges for the Allied forces. When the Chongqing troops retreated from Burma, they undoubtedly experienced the hardships of weather and terrain. If the Chongqing troops attempt to re-enter Burma, they will inevitably face the same geographical difficulties. Moreover, the approaching rainy season will worsen the situation. The strength of the Chongqing troops in India is estimated at three infantry divisions, one artillery brigade, one supply transport regiment, one cavalry battalion, one signals brigade, and one engineer battalion. Chongqing strongly desires the British to launch an offensive from the west, while the British and Americans prefer Chongqing to attack from Yunnan. The three commanders have failed to reach a consensus on this point despite repeated discussions, highlighting a major issue among the three Allied nations. The Chongqing troops are certainly incapable of launching an offensive from Yunnan and even believe the Japanese army's small-scale mopping-up operations in Burma are a prelude to a Japanese invasion of Yunnan.

### Abolition of the Chinese Inquiry Office After the Establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry

A Reuter dispatch from Shanghai: News last night indicated that following the establishment of Japan's Greater East Asia Ministry, the Chinese Inquiry Office, which the former Asia Development Board established on Jiaxing Road in Shanghai in March 194*, will be abolished on Thursday. Hereafter, all applications and notifications from Chinese citizens to various Japanese government agencies should be handled by the Second Section of the General Affairs Department of the Japanese Embassy here. Civil disputes between Chinese and Japanese residents should be handled by the Judicial Affairs Department of the Japanese Consulate-General, and other issues should be addressed by the Chinese courts.

### French Concession Police Hope for Resident Cooperation in Rat Catching: The Claim of Catching One Rat Per Night is Incorrect

The French Concession's Avenue Joffre and other districts had previously distributed rat traps to households and businesses due to rampant rat infestations, initiating a rat-catching campaign. News recently obtained from the police clarified that the purpose of this campaign was solely to encourage residents to pay attention to rats within their homes and capture them as much as possible. The previous rumor that the authorities required each household to catch at least one rat per night, otherwise fines would be imposed, is entirely inaccurate. While the French Concession health authorities are actively encouraging residents to catch rats, they have not mandated a specific nightly quota.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Schedules Distribution of Butter Permits

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued Notice No. 6243, scheduling the distribution of butter permits at the distribution office located at 234 Route Ma Ho on the 28th and 29th of this month and the 2nd and 2nd (sic) of February. Registered butter users can bring their police identification cards to collect their permits at that time. Those who fail to collect their permits within the specified dates will have their registration revoked immediately.

### Tap Water Contains a Salty Taste: A Natural Phenomenon Every Year; Lower Water Levels in the Huangpu River Cause Seawater to Enter the Pipes, Containing Salt, but it is Absolutely Harmless to Health

Recently, the tap water in the International Settlement has contained a strong salty taste and appears turbid, raising concerns about drinking water hygiene and causing public anxiety. A reporter from this newspaper specifically interviewed the chief engineer of the water company, who stated that this is a natural phenomenon that occurs every year in the twelfth month of the lunar calendar. This is because the water level in the Huangpu River is significantly reduced at this time, and the high tide outside the Wusong Estuary rushes into the Huangpu River. The Yangshupu water source in the International Settlement is located close to the Wusong Estuary, so seawater may enter the water pipes, causing the water to taste salty and become turbid. This is beyond human control. However, the chief engineer assured that the presence of salt in the tap water is absolutely harmless to health. The situation is expected to return to normal in about two months, after the water level in the Huangpu River rises. The French Concession, with its water source located in the area of the 16th Dock, further from the sea, has not experienced the same phenomenon.

### Shanghai West Congee Kitchen Distributes Congee Application Forms

The Shanghai West Congee Kitchen, sponsored by the Shanghai 31st Year Winter Relief Office, is issuing congee application forms in advance of the congee distribution to estimate the number of recipients. It is reported that the demand for these application forms is extremely high, indicating that there are many impoverished people in this city in need of relief. This city is not lacking in charitable individuals, and we hope that they will generously contribute to this worthy cause.

### Overview of Important Administrative Matters of the Shanghai Municipal Council for the Past Year (Yesterday) (To be continued)

Regarding the Currency System

Regarding the currency system, the Council received a letter from Mayor Chen of the Municipal Government, stating that the National Government, considering the declining value of the old legal tender and to stabilize the financial situation, decided to abolish the equal value of the Central Reserve Bank notes and the old legal tender, effective May 31st. To implement this plan, the Government decided to exchange old legal tender for Central Reserve Bank notes at a rate of two to one in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as in the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing. Furthermore, all debts and obligations denominated in old legal tender should be converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at the same rate. The purpose of this measure is to enhance the position of the Central Reserve Bank notes as the sole legal tender in China and to protect the people from the effects of the old legal tender inflation. Mayor Chen hoped that the Council would fully cooperate in this matter and assist in reducing the prices of daily necessities. The Council immediately replied, stating that it had already taken steps to adjust all income and expenses to be denominated in Central Reserve Bank notes and guaranteed to cooperate fully with the Municipal Government to jointly suppress prices, at least to the extent possible.

On February 14th of the previous year, the Council published a notice stating that, effective that day, all payments of new and old accounts to the Council in cash would only be accepted in Central Reserve Bank notes. Subsequently, on June 9th, another notice was issued, declaring that, effective June 19th, all payments to the Council should be made by cashiers' checks from the Central Reserve Bank of China or banknotes issued by that bank. On June 12th, the Council issued another notice, stating that all security deposits previously paid to the Council would be deemed to have been converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at a rate of two to one. After the National Government promulgated the regulations prohibiting the circulation of the old legal tender, the Council issued a notice on June 24th stipulating (1) that the use of the old legal tender would not be permitted in the International Settlement from June 25th; from that day forward, Central Reserve Bank notes would be the sole legal tender; (2) unless otherwise notified, subsidiary currency notes with a face value of five jiao or less issued by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and China & South Sea Bank could be used within the Settlement at a rate of two to one; (3) anyone found to be in violation of this notice would be prosecuted according to the law. The Council informed Mayor Chen that all cases of violations of the rules prohibiting the use of the old currency would be investigated, and if the evidence was conclusive, the violators would be prosecuted in the Chinese courts.

The Newspaper's Broadcasting Time Yesterday Was 7:30 PM

### "Helping Students is the Greatest Good, Doing Good is the Greatest Joy": Middle School Group to be Selected Today; Applications for University and Business/Trade Groups Have Closed; Over 30,000 Yuan Received in Donations from All Sectors Yesterday

"Helping students is the greatest good," and "Doing good is the greatest joy." After receiving over 30,000 yuan in donations from all sectors for student aid yesterday, and encouraged by the donors with these words, the staff of this newspaper feels both grateful and humbled. We respectfully dedicate these words to all the gentlemen who generously donated to support education. The details of the donations received yesterday and the middle school group's examination today are as follows:

Middle School Group Selection Set for Today

The middle school group's selection examination will be held today, both morning and afternoon, at the Shanghai YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road. The high school grades 1-3 will be tested from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM, the junior high grade 1 from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM, and the junior high grades 2-3 from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM. In addition to the exam papers provided by this newspaper, students are requested to bring all necessary supplies and arrive on time for the examination.

University and Business/Trade Applications Closed

Applications for student aid from the university group and the business/trade supplementary school group closed last night. Over 400 application forms were received. The selection, investigation, and review of the university group will be conducted after the list of approved student aid recipients for the elementary school group is announced and the investigation of the middle school group is largely completed. The exam and vacation start dates for the various schools, including elementary, middle, and university, vary considerably. Therefore, the application registration, selection, and investigation procedures must be completed in order, according to the closing date and the sequence of examinations. The student aid office staff will strive to manage the time efficiently within the meticulous procedures to alleviate the students' longing.

Yu Kee and Yick Kee Generously Donate Large Sums

Yesterday morning, Mr. Yu Kee and Mr. Yick Kee, who generously donated large sums, personally visited the newspaper office to offer encouragement for the student aid project. Mr. Yu Kee and Mr. Yick Kee were especially concerned that the number of elementary school applicants reached over 800 and feared that limited aid funds would not be enough to cover everyone, resulting in many elementary school students unfortunately dropping out of school. Mr. Yu Kee and Mr. Yick Kee have been reading this newspaper daily and felt deeply disturbed. They personally donated over 20,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes and instructed that the funds should be allocated to the elementary school applicants as much as possible. Their benevolent words were deeply moving. The newspaper's student aid committee will properly manage these funds with the compassion of Mr. Yu Kee and Mr. Yick Kee for the children, aiming not to disappoint their expectations.

Donations Received Yesterday

The student aid funds received yesterday included 10,000 yuan from Yu Kee, 10,000 yuan from Yick Kee, 2,000 yuan from Xing Shao Er Zi, 1,000 yuan each from Wang Wen Yuan (gifts from friends and relatives celebrating his son's full-month), Yu Kee, and the Yan Wu Family Tian An Trust, 500 yuan each from Qin Run Sheng, Wu Kee, and the Mei Chong De Hall, 800 yuan from Mr. Li, 300 yuan each from Yong Kee and Hao Kee, 200 yuan each from Mr. Tian and Ren Kee, 180 yuan from Jun Sheng, 100 yuan each from Yao Kee and Hu Yun E, 50 yuan each from Sheng Kee, Fan Wen Jiang, Gao De Yong, Chen Guan Kee, and Zhong Shan Kee, 30 yuan combined from Mr. Yuan and Mr. Xia, 20 yuan each from Xie Yin Chu, Mr. Lu, Zuo Gen Fa, Ling Zhuan Zhen, Yang Da Wen, and Yang Tian Zhang, 10 yuan each from Gao Gen Hui and Bi Wu Zhong, 8 yuan from Da Ding Lu, 5 yuan each from Hui Ji Hui Zhao and Liu Qing Nan, and 4 yuan and 8 jiao from Zhu Yuan Kang (found). The total amount received was 30,125 yuan and 8 jiao in Central Reserve Bank notes. The previous balance was 144,351 yuan, 8 jiao and 5 fen, bringing the total balance to 174,477 yuan, 6 jiao and 5 fen.

Wang and Qin Donate Wedding Gifts to Student Aid

Yesterday, we received letters from (1) Mr. Wang Wen Yuan of Da Feng Industrial Company, stating: "As we celebrate the full month of my son Geng Nong, we have received generous gifts from friends and relatives. While I cannot decline them, I believe that during these extraordinary times, we should be thrifty. Therefore, I am contributing the funds originally intended for the banquet, rounded up to a whole number, to your newspaper's student aid fund, totaling 1,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Please accept it." (2) Mr. Qin Run Sheng of the China Pottery Bank stated, "As my son Xing Yuan is getting married, we are grateful for the gifts from friends and relatives during these difficult times. We have decided to donate the cash value of these gifts separately to various charitable organizations to provide relief. A portion of these gifts, totaling 500 yuan in national currency, is being donated to your organization to benefit friends and relatives."

More Donations, Fewer Dropouts

The total number of students applying for student aid in the university, middle, elementary, and business/trade groups this year has reached over 3,000. Thanks to the generous donations from all sectors in recent days, each additional day of donations translates into fewer young people dropping out of school. Reading the donation reports every day is like witnessing the righteous rescuing impoverished students from fire and water, helping them reach the other shore. The donations received yesterday mean that at least 200 elementary school students will be able to carry their schoolbags back to school. This scene fills us with joy amidst the sorrow as we see students on the verge of dropping out of school break into smiles. We earnestly hope that all sectors, recognizing the large number of students requesting assistance and upholding the principle that "helping students is the greatest good and doing good is the greatest joy," will continue to donate. Once we have collected enough funds to provide assistance, we will inform everyone.

Various Schools Set Up Free Tuition Slots

This newspaper yesterday received letters from various schools offering free tuition: (1) A letter from Shanghai Jian Cheng Middle School stated, "After reading your newspaper's articles appealing for help for impoverished students and the long queues of those requesting student aid, anyone with a heart will be moved. Our school, as an educational institution, is limited by its finances and unable to broadly assist the impoverished. We feel ashamed at our inability to do more. We are now offering ten free tuition slots each for the first year of high school and junior high, specifically for your newspaper to select and recommend deserving candidates. If we exceed this quota, we can first transfer the free tuition slots donated to our school by Mr. Hua, Mr. Shen, and Mr. Shao, to jointly assist outstanding impoverished young people. There should be no boundaries between us." (2) A letter from Ms. Wu Yi Zhi, Principal of Shanghai Women's Middle School, stated, "Your organization's student aid fund for impoverished children, benefiting the needy, is truly commendable. Our school, advocating for education, dares not lag behind. We have established five free tuition slots in the senior year 2 and senior year 3 classes. We hope your organization will select and recommend excellent candidates, and we will waive all tuition and miscellaneous fees to do our part." (3) A letter from the Fourth Vocational Supplementary School stated, "Recently, prices have risen sharply, and most schools have appropriately increased tuition fees to maintain operations. However, ordinary impoverished children find it difficult to afford education. In light of this, our school has established regulations for free tuition slots. We have always admired your organization's efforts in supporting the younger generation, sparing no effort. Therefore, we are specifically writing to inform you and request that you recommend students from your organization's student aid supplementary school group to our school for supplementary studies, with a quota of ten students, limited to one subject, as a small token of our appreciation."

Mr. Pu Ji Ting Donates an Overcoat

This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Pu Ji Ting, offering a pair of riding breeches overcoat as a commemorative gift to anyone who donates 2,000 yuan. We are grateful for Mr. Pu's kindness. The overcoat will be temporarily stored here. His original letter stated, "I am sending a used pair of riding breeches overcoat, which is of high quality and in perfect condition. During this difficult autumn, I cannot bear to wear it. I am specifically presenting it to your newspaper and hope that you will appeal to all benevolent individuals that anyone who donates 3,000 yuan or more to the student aid fund for impoverished children will receive this overcoat as a commemorative gift. It is a small token of my appreciation, hoping to inspire others. I hope that they will generously contribute to benefit the young people and perform a great deed."

Crowded Scene of Applying for Student Aid

Few funds, many students, insufficient distribution, hoping that all sectors will donate more. Tian Ming Zuo

### Shanghai Municipal Council Reports on the Situation of Public Utility Companies Last Year

After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the previous year, the various public utility companies in the Settlement were taken over by the Japanese army, placed under military administration, and entrusted to Japanese trading companies for management and normal operation. The status of each company's operations last year is summarized as follows:

(1) Shanghai Electric Tramways Co.

Last year, the operating expenses of the Shanghai Electric Tramways Co. increased dramatically. In order to make up for this, the Council approved an increase in tram fares from June 5th, to be collected in Central Reserve Bank notes. At the same time, the Council approved the restoration of full-line service on Lines 5 and 8 and the conversion of all tramcars (except trailers) to first class, effective June 5th.

(2) Shanghai Waterworks Co., Shanghai Power Co., Shanghai Telephone Co., Shanghai Water Co.

Last year, at the request of the Japanese authorities managing the above four companies, forwarded by the Japanese Consulate-General, the Council agreed to revise the tariff rates of these companies and to collect them in Central Reserve Bank notes, effective May 20th from the end date of the user's period.

(3) China General Omnibus Co.

Due to a lack of fuel, the China General Omnibus Co. suspended all bus services, causing transportation difficulties between the Settlement and the West Shanghai area. In order to remedy this, the Council, with the understanding of the French Concession Public Works Department and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, approved the application of the Hua Zhong Urban Omnibus Co., the custodian of the China General Omnibus Co., on November 27th to resume some routes in the Settlement and the West Shanghai area, running buses powered by charcoal and coal. As of the end of last year, the bus lines in operation were as follows: Route 25, from Jiangwan Road Shanghai Shrine, via Dixi Road, Wusong Road, Haining Road, North Sichuan Road, Sichuan Road, to Avenue Edward VII; Route 26, from the Great World, via Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, Avenue du President, Columbia Road, to Avenue Haig; Route 27, from Jing'an Temple, via Avenue du President, Route Frelaut, Columbia Road, to Chenjiaqiao Town.

### All-Shanghai Open Basketball League: Xingren Wins Group A Championship; Red Team Finishes Second with Nine Wins and One Loss

The All-Shanghai Open Basketball League held its most exciting finale last night, starting at 7:00 PM at the Chinese YMCA. In the women's division, the You Team overcame Lingsheng with a score of 16 to 14, winning the women's championship. In the second game, Xingren defeated Beifeng with a score of 40 to 31, completing a perfect ten-win, zero-loss season and winning the Group A championship. In the final game, the Red Team defeated Lianxing with a score of 32 to 26, finishing second with nine wins and one loss. There is one final game tonight between the Mengnuoke and Bing Teams. Group A will then have been successfully completed. The Meng Team is extraordinary and had great hopes for the championship, but after suffering a treacherous blow from a teammate, they were repeatedly defeated last night, although their performance was still commendable. If they can defeat the Bing Team tonight, they will share third place with Lianxing and Huanan. If they lose, they will share fifth place with the Giant Team. Currently, the Group A championship has been won by Xingren, with the Red Team finishing second with nine wins and one loss. Lianxing, Huanan, and Mengnuoke follow. The Giant Team is in sixth place. Beifeng, Hualian, and the Tongren Three-in-One team are tied for seventh place. The Bing and Yihai Naval teams are in last place with ten losses.

The situation at San Fung Printing and Dyeing was stable, while the situation at Shinfu was slightly less favorable. Among food stocks, Amoy Canning saw a high price of 380 yuan under the double benefit of generous interest payments, but there were still no sellers. Wah Feng Enamel rose from 76.5 yuan to 80 yuan. There were still few buyers for financial stocks. It was heard that buyers for the Zhejiang Industrial Bank had bid as high as 900 yuan. In the utilities sector, Zhabei Water and Electricity saw 66.5 yuan, while China Electricity highest 46 yuan, at noon each back half a yuan, still squeeze up one yuan to five corners, all parties are determined, and transactions become more frequent.

### Public Bonds in High Demand, All Exceeding the 50 Yuan Level

The public bond market saw further increases yesterday, with sellers becoming even scarcer, creating a situation of high demand. It is likely that credit conditions have eased for all banks, and some now have surplus funds. Since the environment has improved, people are gradually becoming more optimistic. Buying dear and selling cheap is the common rule of the cycle. Yesterday, Class C bonds initially traded at 7 yuan, then saw 7.5 yuan and 8 yuan. After that, they slowly rose, with the highest bid reaching 9.5 yuan before any actual bonds were sold. Finally, the market retraced to 7.5 to 6 yuan, but it was still a yuan better than the previous day. Class A bonds traded at 7.3 to 4 yuan, Class B at 7.1 to 2 yuan, Class D at 54.7 to 8 yuan, and Class E at 5.6 to 7 yuan. All of them broke through the 50 yuan level. However, the volume of transactions was extremely low.

### Small Rebound in Military Notes and Joint Notes

Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Money Exchange Association's call loan interest rate remained at 17%, unchanged.

Yesterday, military notes rebounded slightly. Interbank trading was priced at 5.5524 yuan. Small money shops and bank branches traded at 5.55 and 5.56 yuan. Joint Reserve Bank of China notes had rebounded slightly by one jiao. Dealers were buying at 3.85 yuan and selling at 3.90 yuan.

### Soybean Cakes: Profitable Sales

Yesterday's market conditions for miscellaneous grains saw only soybean cakes being traded somewhat. Due to profit-takers selling, prices immediately fell back. Specifically, Kaiyuan Long soybean cakes were traded at 160.5 to 160 yuan for four cartloads; Feizi soybean cakes were traded at 105 to 105.5 yuan per cartload. February futures of Yuan Long cakes were priced at 107 yuan per cartload.

### Fine Cloth Rises by Two Yuan

Yesterday's cotton cloth market started strong but weakened later. Fine cloth, etc., rose by two yuan. Sijunzi serge rose from 11.10 yuan to 11.30 yuan, then fell to a low of 10.50 yuan, and was at 10.90 yuan at noon, relatively stable.

### Woolen Cloth Trading: First Discussing Shipping Documents

There is a shortage of both domestic and imported woolen cloth. Standard prices continue to rise. Many have already reached the price limit, and some have exceeded it. Buyers are gradually losing interest. Also, with the Lunar New Year approaching, brokerage houses' overdrafts must be repaid. Therefore, actual transactions are not as numerous as last week. Even shops with ample cash will first discuss the issue of shipping documents when they find suitable goods. Only if they can obtain shipping documents, deliver the goods, and then receive payment will they consider the deal. Otherwise, they will not trade if they are asked to pay first and then receive the shipping documents and goods, or if the goods are delivered privately without shipping documents. This is because there is no fixed date for issuing shipping documents, and goods without shipping documents cannot be recorded in the account books or issued with sales receipts. This demonstrates the importance of shipping documents for woolen cloth these days.

### Persimmon Cakes Continue to Arrive: Opening Price Forty Yuan Lower Than Before

Recently, several more cartloads of persimmon cakes have arrived, bringing supply and demand into balance, so the trend is easing. Yesterday, one cartload was sold, with a price forty yuan lower than before. Previous inventories have been cleared, so although a price decline is observed, it is unlikely to fall too low.

### Price of Secondary Wood Ear Fungus is Relatively Favorable

Some ordinary quality black wood ear fungus has been shipped in by merchants from outside the region. The quality varies, and some contain impurities and debris. Therefore, the opening price is relatively favorable. A batch was traded at 3,200 yuan. Even after rescreening, the cost remains high, so there has been little change in market prices.

### Shipments Halted: Prices of British and American Cigarettes Rise Again

Due to the Hua Zhong Tobacco Association still handling registration of businesses in the same trade, shipments of British and American goods have essentially stopped. Overall, procedures for allocation and shipment are unlikely to be completed within the Lunar New Year. As a result, prices are rising due to market expectations. The price of Great Britain brand is 12,400 yuan; Old Knife brand is 10,400 yuan; Pin Hai brand is 7,700 yuan; Wu Hua brand is 6,850 yuan; and Fairy brand is 8,100 yuan, all one to two hundred yuan higher than the previous day. Japanese cigarettes Jin Paipi are 3,000 yuan; Jin Da Lou is 3,750 yuan; Red Rose is 2,700 yuan; All Luck brand is 3,500 yuan; Nian Zhi is 3,050 yuan; and Compass brand is 2,850 yuan, all remaining stable. Domestic cigarettes Pyramid is 6,450 yuan; Beauty brand is 5,900 yuan; Gold Rat brand is 4,100 yuan; White Gold Dragon is 4,200 yuan; and Golden Dragon is 4,200 yuan, showing only a slight price increase.

### Match Prices Resume Surge

In the market for daily necessities, prices for various goods continue to rise, especially match prices which are trending upward again. Soap prices are mixed, with some steady and others rising. Candles remain calm and unchanged. Phoenix brand is 4,050 yuan; Beauty brand is 4,200 yuan; Golden Tripod brand is 3,400 yuan; and Miscellaneous brands are 2,250 yuan, an increase of one to two hundred yuan compared to the previous day. Gu Ben soap is 800 yuan; Bai Xiang Mao is 725 yuan; Huang Xiang Mao is 660 yuan; Scissors soap is 750 yuan; White Riley candles are 560 yuan; Monk's Cap brand is 480 yuan; and Miscellaneous brands are 340 yuan.

### Daily Medicines: Speculators Still Involved

The market price of medicines is rising due to extensive involvement by speculators. The market is showing brisk activity. Headache powder is 38 yuan; Universal Oil is 49 yuan; Bagua pills are 44.5 yuan; Partridge vegetables are 70 yuan; and Longhu Rendan is 40 yuan, all showing an increase compared to the previous day's prices.

### Cabbage and Winter Bamboo Shoots Sell Especially Well on the Streets

In addition to cabbage from Chongming, Jiangbei, Jiaozhou, and Tanggu being shipped to Shanghai, recently, cabbage from Tianjin has also arrived in Shanghai. With the Lunar New Year approaching, many citizens are buying it, and street sales are especially strong. However, the supply is not large, so prices have risen repeatedly. Cabbage from Chongming and Jiangbei, which was around 50-60 yuan per dan at the beginning of the month, with vendors retailing it for 80-90 cents per jin, has now risen to 120-130 yuan per dan, with vendors retailing it for 1.80-2 yuan per jin. Cabbage from Jiaozhou is currently priced at 170-180 yuan per dan, with retail prices ranging from 2.20 to 2.50 yuan per jin. Cabbage from Tanggu is priced at 2.40-2.50 yuan per jin, and cabbage from Tianjin is priced at 2.50-3 yuan per jin.

Winter bamboo shoots from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, have been on the market for a while, but the supply is limited. With peak sales season upon us, supply is insufficient. Vendors at the Hongsha Ni Bamboo Shoot Market are now selling them for 13-14 yuan per jin, up from 10 yuan. South goods stores are selling them for around 12.5 yuan per jin. Ordinary bamboo shoots from Longyou are selling for 10.5-12 yuan per jin, and small bamboo shoots are selling for 8-9 yuan per jin.

### In the Depth of Winter, Firewood and Charcoal Sales are Active

Firewood: In the depth of winter, the weather is frigid. In addition to coal, firewood is also used for starting fires, so the demand for firewood is high. Residents use it to ignite coal stoves, so sales have been exceptionally active recently. However, the supply of firewood is not smooth, and the inventory of packing case firewood is dwindling. Therefore, the price is rising frequently. Currently, top-grade chestnut firewood is priced at 50-60 yuan per dan, and medium-grade is 54-55 yuan per dan. Small sections of wood used for vehicle fuel are even more brisk, with each dan rising to over 70 yuan and still hard to find. Large, dry pine firewood is 58-59 yuan per dan, and medium-grade is 55-56 yuan per dan. Due to the shortage of packing case firewood, retail prices have also risen to 1 yuan per jin. Miscellaneous tree root firewood is 70-80 cents per jin.

Charcoal: With the end of the Lunar Year approaching, the need for charcoal among residents has increased significantly. It is used for starting stoves and is in high demand in restaurants for heating hot pots, so prices remain firm. Currently, coal shops are selling pine charcoal at around 200 yuan per dan. After sifting out the debris, the retail price at the store is 2.5 yuan per jin. Pieces that are slightly more uniform are sold at 3.4-3.5 yuan per jin. Stream Jiang charcoal costs 41-42 yuan to 53-54 yuan per basket, medium baskets cost 32 yuan to 35-36 yuan, and small baskets cost 25-26 yuan to 30 yuan.

### On Thrift

— Objective

Recently, everyone is talking about thrift. Thrift is "frugality." The Chinese have always regarded "frugality" as a virtue, and sages and classic texts often use it to encourage people. In books like Chao Zha's "Gems of Wisdom," the "good words" about "frugality" can be said to be "inexhaustible."

Of all the writings I've read on thrift, Sima Guang's "Instructing Jian to Observe Frugality" is the most satisfying. Based on his extensive knowledge, he lists stories of frugality among historical figures and of people who brought misfortune upon themselves through extravagance. The most memorable passage is: "When Zhang Wenzie was prime minister, his personal lifestyle was the same as when he was a clerk in Heyang. His relatives advised him, 'Your Excellency now receives a considerable salary, yet you live like this; although you are confident in your frugality, outsiders criticize you for being as poor as Gongsun Hong wearing a cloth quilt. You should conform to others a little.' Zhang sighed and said, 'Although my current salary is enough to clothe and feed my whole family in luxury, what am I worried about? I am worried about the common human tendency that it is easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality. Can my current salary always be available? Can I live forever? If things change tomorrow, my family, accustomed to extravagance, will not be able to suddenly be frugal and will inevitably be lost. How can I, whether in or out of office, alive or dead, always be the same?' Alas, the deep foresight and long-term planning of a great sage is beyond the reach of ordinary people!"

Next, Sima Guang expounds on the virtues of "frugality" and the evils of "extravagance." He says: "Yushi said: 'Frugality is the shared characteristic of virtue; extravagance is the greatest of evils. "Shared" means common; it means that those who have virtue all come from frugality. Frugality leads to few desires; a gentleman with few desires is not controlled by material possessions and can act in accordance with the right path; a common person with few desires can be careful in his conduct, moderate in his spending, stay away from crime, and enrich his family. Therefore, it is said: Frugality is the shared characteristic of virtue. Extravagance leads to many desires; a gentleman with many desires becomes greedy for wealth and status, distorts the right path, and hastens disaster; a common person with many desires becomes demanding, wasteful, loses himself, and ruins his family; therefore, officials inevitably take bribes, and villagers inevitably steal. Therefore, it is said: Extravagance is the greatest of evils.'" Sima Guang instructed his descendants on frugality not just with empty words but also by practicing it himself. However, his practice was not for the sake of seeking fame and reputation. Therefore, he says:

"Throughout my life, I have dressed to keep warm and eaten to fill my stomach; I do not dare to wear dirty and tattered clothes to deceive the public and seek fame. I am simply following my nature!"

Extravagance is certainly undesirable; but if one is hypocritical, like what is described in "Officialdom Unmasked," the evil of "hypocritical frugality" is just as bad as "extravagance."

Sima Guang was one of the most forceful opponents of Wang Anshi's New Policies. Although their political views differed, both great men were able to maintain "frugality" and had clean integrity and pure and noble character. Therefore, in history, they "each have their own merits."

### Third Place Winning Essay: My Plans for This Year

— Yuan Ying

Training Myself in the Forging of the Times

The mention of plans makes me feel ashamed, apprehensive, and fearful.

Last New Year's Eve, an old teacher wrote in my yearbook: "The past year has passed; how will you spend the next year, that brief but also long period?" So, in order not to fail his kind intentions and to set a path for myself, I made a plan on the morning of this year's New Year's Day.

However, throughout the year, the busyness of events cooled my enthusiastic heart, which had been encouraged and hopeful, and the instability of the environment shattered all my wonderful plans; I involuntarily lived a life I did not want to live, letting the "brief but also long" days of the year quietly slip away. If the old teacher were to ask me again, "How did you spend this year?" I would not know how to answer; in reality, I myself do not know how I have been living.

For now, let the past be past! I am deeply considering how I will use this new year.

This year—this new year—will be a segment in my life's history. This autumn, I will begin to write a new page in my life's history. But because of the ills and corruption of the current education system, and the ever-increasing hatred and weariness I have felt for it over the years, I am unwilling to continue spending my youthful years and energy in a place I hate and am weary of. Moreover, everyone knows that now is neither a good time nor a good place to study properly! Why should I continue to have my father's hard-earned money spent on useless things?

"Step into society!" is my main plan for this year, although this is only a hope. In present-day China, society and school are completely isolated in two different worlds; there is no bridge between them, no connection. Everything in school, except for a diploma, is of no use in society, and everything in society cannot be learned in school. Why should I waste countless time and money studying useless things? I am a living person, I want to read living books, learn living knowledge! And society is our real school, a school that is burying countless rich books and knowledge. I should step into this school.

Of course, I also know that this society is not a good society; it is like a cesspool, full of countless darknesses, countless evils. I also know how difficult it is to find a door, needing boasting, needing hypocrisy, needing... But all of this cannot stop my steps. I do not escape, nor do I flinch. I will muster all my courage, strengthen my belief, and step into society with big strides.

Society, some say it is a furnace, some say it is a touchstone, and some say it is a den of evil. But whatever it is, I have to throw myself into its corner, to observe, to learn, and even to expose myself.

On the other hand, it is also to share some of the burden of life that weighs heavily on my father.

Another major plan is to work even harder for the free school. In the second half of last year, this work took up most of my time and energy; but only this work can inspire my passion and eliminate my depression. Although the work is hard; on rainy nights, carrying a large pile of notebooks, I hobble along the muddy road with weary steps; on nights when the northwest wind shakes the windows, I often work late into the night to grade papers;... but all of this only increases my joy, my comfort. In this turbulent era, I have at least fulfilled some small obligations to society and contributed some small amount of strength; compared to some people, I should be proud!

Therefore, this year, as long as the school can continue, I will continue to offer my small amount of strength, for the children, for the society, for the motherland, and for humanity!

During the summer vacation, if nothing special happens, I will continue to write my first creation until I finish it.

Because many good themes and deep impressions of many typical characters have been active in my mind for a long time, I also plan to write a few more short stories, and use image-based artistic techniques to erect these familiar people and things.

If I want to summarize it in one sentence: my plan for this year is: study! Work! Writing!—but the main things are studying and working.

This era is a great forging, this society is also a great furnace. This year, I will begin to throw myself into the depths of this furnace, and train myself, enrich myself, and strengthen myself in the forging of the times.

Müller said: "Rather than being discouraged by not being able to fully carry out one's plans, it is better to feel happy and have a hundredfold of courage when you see that a small part of the plan can be realized."

I know that the years of this year will still disappear swiftly, only "brief," not "long." Wait until New Year's Eve this year, when people are busy thinking about new plans for next year, let me review how I spent that brief year! (Note: Yuan Ying is 18 years old, a senior in high school at Nanguang High School, and a teacher at Yangguang Free School.)

### The Idiot and His Idiotic Deeds

— Chen Bi Yun

Xuehua, whom I hadn't seen for a long time, suddenly blew into my house like a gust of wind. I warmly welcomed her. I said, "Miss Tang, you've become famous. Are you rushing to Shanghai to see the publications that have printed your great works?"

She pulled a face and blamed me for being so polite. Then she said that coming to see the Shanghai publications was indeed one of the purposes of her visit, but the biggest purpose was that she had heard about an idiot and his idiotic deeds and wanted to be idiotic too. When she said that, I naturally didn't understand and urgently asked for the details.

According to Xuehua, she had come to be a teacher at "Jiying" Elementary and Middle School on Yu Garden Road. As soon as she mentioned "Jiying," I immediately jumped up and said, "That's the school where my three children study. I've been there. It would be great if you could teach there. But I don't know what you mean by idiot and idiotic."

She said that the school's principal, Fang, was the idiot, and that she had done some idiotic things. She didn't want to sit comfortably as a young mistress but insisted on finding something to do. She also didn't want to do anything that would make money, such as hoarding goods or engaging in other businesses, but wanted to open a school. Having opened a school, she didn't want to earn a single penny. The tuition and miscellaneous fees collected were particularly low, with no exploitation. She would even waive or reduce them, but the salaries and other expenses she paid were not discounted, and she always paid what was due. As a result, she not only didn't make any money but also lost 15,000 yuan in half a year. The money was all borrowed from friends. Some friends certainly approved of her, but others regarded her as an idiot, calling her school an idiotic deed...

After hearing these words, I couldn't help but exclaim, "Really?" Because for the past six months, I had only paid attention to the progress of my children's studies, and I hadn't paid attention to anything else at the school.

Xuehua said in all seriousness, "If it weren't true, would I be here? Wouldn't she be quieter in the countryside? Why would she come to Shanghai, where the air is thick with smoke, to make a living, especially since her health isn't good?"

I said that the school was in a very quiet location, which would probably only be good for her health and not harmful. She said that was right, otherwise it would cause her poor health to become overly idiotic. She also told me that the school building problem had been completely solved and that several more classrooms could be opened. Almost all of the new and old colleagues were excellent female teachers, and she got along with them very well. So, she thought that her idiocy in running so far wasn't for anything else but only to be able to do some things that would directly benefit society, and she had gained considerable comfort from that.

After Xuehua left, her words did cause me to have some thoughts. How many idiots and idiotic deeds are there in society? If everyone is an idiot and everything is idiotic, what kind of society will it become? Conversely, if nothing is idiotic, everyone is opportunistic, and everyone is selfish and seeks profit, what kind of society will it become?...

I couldn't think any further, so I had to write it out and ask everyone to think about it. (Proceeds donated to the scholarship fund)

### A Teacher for All Ages

— By James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

(9)

Regardless of his particular views on the Boers, he held orthodox views, like everyone else, on Lloyd George and that famous "budget." He did not pay attention to either one. Several years later, when Lloyd George came as a guest to the Brookfield Speech Day, Chips was introduced, at which time he said to him: "Mr. Lloyd George, I'm almost old enough—ahem—to remember you as a young man, and—ahem—I confess that in my view you seem to have—ahem—improved—ahem—a good deal." The headmaster stood beside them, somewhat stunned; but Lloyd George laughed heartily, and in the ensuing ceremony, talked to Chips more than anyone else.

"Just like Chips," someone later commented. "He could get away with anything. I suppose at his age it was all right to say what you pleased to anybody…"

The successor to Wetherby's headmastership was old Meldrum, who had been headmaster for thirty years, and in 1900, suddenly died of pneumonia; before a successor was appointed, Chips became the acting headmaster of Brookfield. There was only a slight chance that the school board might change his temporary acting appointment to a permanent one; but when the school board appointed a young man of thirty-seven, whose medals shone brightly and who could silence the hall by simply twitching an eyebrow, Chips was not really disappointed. Chips could not compete with such a man; he never had, and never would, compete with such a man, and he knew it. He was, through and through, a gentler and less fierce animal.

He resigned in 1913. Those years before his resignation were filled with clearly remembered pictures.(22) Social Services

### Mr. Zhang Yipeng Discusses the Purpose of the Anti-Anglo-American Association Scholarship

The general situation of the Anglo-American Association's scholarship has been published in yesterday's local edition of this newspaper. The reporter further sought clarification by interviewing Mr. Zhang Yipeng, the person in charge. According to him, the effectiveness of scholarships in helping poor students is obvious to all. There have been many such events held in various places, but with the sharp increase in tuition and miscellaneous fees along with the cost of living this year, it cannot be popularized without subsidies from various organizations. Since the Anti-Anglo-American Association has this great aspiration and has repeatedly entrusted us with full authority, based on our long-standing desire to serve the people and reward rising talents, Mr. Shen Siliang, Pan Yangyao, Lu Gaoyi, Huang Jingwan, and I feel obligated to do so. However, the spring semester is about to begin, and we must intensify our work. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will supervise and guide us from time to time so that we can achieve a successful completion.

### Letter from Tian Anshang: Saving Money to Help the Poor and Support Education

(Above omitted) Your newspaper continues to protect education, which is highly commendable. If it can further encourage scholars with the virtues of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and cleanness, it will show a greater determination to improve customs and morals. My annual income, after economizing on expenses, can have more than two thousand yuan in surplus. Not daring to follow the custom of spending lavishly on the New Year, I respectfully donate 500 yuan to your newspaper for the relief of orphans, the poor, and the elderly and weak, and the remainder will be donated to the scholarship fund.
