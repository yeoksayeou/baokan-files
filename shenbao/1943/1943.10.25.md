### Miscellaneous Thoughts on Increasing Salaries for Teachers and Staff

Two news items were reported in the newspapers yesterday and the day before regarding the issue of salaries for primary school teachers and staff. The first was that teachers and staff from various municipal primary schools in the city went to the Municipal Finance Bureau to petition. Because their salaries were too low, making it impossible to make a living, they had previously sent representatives to the municipal government and educational circles to request an increase in living expenses, but without result. Therefore, they petitioned the Finance Bureau again. The Director of the Finance Bureau, Mountain, in principle accepted the requests they made, but before a detailed calculation could be made in conjunction with the Education Bureau, he could not give a definitive answer, but he could assure them that the salaries of municipal primary school teachers and staff would definitely be made higher than the average for private primary school teachers and staff, to ensure fairness. The second item was that subsidies for teachers and staff of private schools in the city would soon be issued. Because the municipal government, in view of the poverty of the teachers and staff of private schools, followed the request of the Municipal Education Association and agreed to grant a monthly subsidy of 500,000 yuan. The source of this funding was obtained by the municipal government with the consent of the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and was to be paid from the fees collected by the Tax Bureau to assist the municipal government. It was originally scheduled to begin in August, but as a result of discussions between the Municipal Finance Bureau and the Tax Bureau, the Tax Bureau could only raise 300,000 yuan in May, and would raise 500,000 yuan each month from October to December. The first batch of subsidies, totaling 800,000 yuan for September and October, has already been collected from the Finance Bureau by the Municipal Education Association. As for how to allocate it, the Education Association had already convened representatives from various district education associations to form a management and allocation committee to decide on various allocation principles and application procedures, striving for simple and thorough procedures, and scheduled to begin distribution from the 27th of this month.

After carefully reading these two news items, we have the following gratitude and several expectations:

Teachers and staff are role models, such a sacred profession; nurturing talent is such a great mission. With such a sacred profession and such a great mission, the salary they receive is unable to maintain a living. It seems unbelievable at first, but it is an ironclad fact. The existence and expansion of this fact will undoubtedly affect the decline of talent and the reduction of the quality of teachers, directly affecting the development of national education; indirectly, it affects the nurturing of nation-building talents.

The extent of the lack of popular education in our country accounts for the largest percentage among modern countries, and there are many illiterates everywhere, especially the out-of-school rate of school-age children is the most serious. How can the responsibility of national revival and social improvement be entrusted to illiterates? Then, promoting national education and eliminating illiteracy is the basis of the national education policy. Therefore, the need for teachers is self-evident. How can the treatment of teachers be so meager, and the responsibility that teachers should fulfill be so harshly demanded?

Although the municipal government's provision of living subsidies to teachers and staff of private schools in the city has a "drop in the bucket" feeling, the authorities' attention to this and the implementation of subsidies is commendable. However, the promised monthly subsidy of 500,000 yuan, which was to begin in August, has now been extended by one month and reduced by 200,000 yuan, which is regrettable. As for who between the Tax Bureau and the Municipal Government should bear the responsibility for paying the full amount, we, standing in the position of teachers and staff, cannot and do not need to distinguish, because they are both public funds, and there is no right to question. We would like to pray for the help of the Municipal Government and the Tax Bureau on behalf of the teachers and staff to pay the full amount as promised.

The salaries of municipal primary school teachers and staff should in principle be based on meeting the standards of living, rather than using "making them higher than the average for private primary school teachers and staff" as the basis. Because although municipal and private schools are different, the need for teachers and staff to make a living is exactly the same. The qualifications of municipal and private school teachers and staff may have strict and lenient forms, but there is no need to form an official divide in their salaries. We hope that when municipal school teachers and staff request salary increases, stating the reason that they cannot make a living is sufficient, and there is no need to use the subsidy for private school teachers and staff as a reason for comparison. At the same time, we hope that the education and finance authorities will "make a detailed calculation" as soon as possible and announce it, so that municipal school teachers and staff can work with peace of mind as soon as possible.

Secondly, in addition to the hope that the treatment of primary school teachers and staff will gradually improve, we also believe that the authorities and relevant parties should pay attention to cultural figures who also bear a heavy mission and are equally poor, especially those who rack their brains and live on royalties. The typesetting wages have reached the stage of seventy or eighty yuan per thousand characters, while the royalties for writers still linger at twenty or thirty yuan. There is a reason why there are few era creations and ingenious masterpieces.

### Japanese Troops in Western Yunnan Approach the Outskirts of Lushui; Reinforcements Move Northward to Attack

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th – According to broadcasts from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Council issued a report on the Yunnan front on the 22nd, stating that Japanese troops have approached the outskirts of Lushui, a key point on the west bank of the Nujiang River. The fighting near Qigongfang, Suzi Prefecture, Yunnan Province, is extremely fierce. Japanese troops advancing north from the opposite bank of Liuku have repeatedly launched fierce attacks to break through the Chongqing army's defenses. Recently, with air and ground reinforcements, they have moved northward to attack and are currently engaged in fierce battles on the outskirts of Lushui. Fighting also continues near Lunma Tundong Street.

The Battle Zone is Entirely in High Ground

Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 24th – After the Japanese troops in the Yunnan-Burma border launched operations, the Chongqing army in the Gaoligong Mountains has become trapped, which is also a fact admitted by Chongqing. According to a New York dispatch, the US special envoy recently explained the situation in that area, saying that the war situation in western Yunnan is becoming increasingly important, and the Chongqing army is in a major crisis. The Japanese army has recently launched an offensive, and troops advancing north along the highway from Myitkyina have recently arrived on the four banks of the Nujiang River, where they have joined forces with two other Japanese forces advancing north from the south. One of these forces charged through the Ma Zhangguan area, attacking the Chongqing army along the Gaoligong Mountains from Tengchong. Another force moved north along the Nujiang River from Longling to control important river crossing points in order to cut off the Chongqing army's retreat. The combat zone this time is entirely in high ground, at an altitude of 10,000 feet, which is the highest area in the world's battlefields. During combat, it is necessary to climb steep ridges and use hand grenades, rifles, mountain guns, etc. It is not yet clear whether the Japanese army will cross the river to fight. If the Chongqing army does not change its strategy and recapture the bridgeheads on the west bank of the Nujiang River, it will be impossible to launch a counterattack in northern Myanmar. If a Myanmar operation is launched this year, the Japanese army will be able to gain the advantage of preemptive action.

### Japanese Troops in North China Frequently Win Battles

Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th – Since the Japanese army in North China launched the autumn anti-communist war in mid-September, the elite troops of the local Japanese army have been continuously sweeping and suppressing the communist army inside and outside Shanxi Province. In view of the fact that the communist army in the Taiyue Military Region is building base areas in the dangerous areas of central and southern Jin Province, in order to destroy them, they took sudden action on October 2nd to destroy the communist army's base facilities everywhere, and frequently won battles. According to reports, the remaining communist army in the area, that is, the communist army that failed to be wiped out in the Taihang Mountains campaign, is still lurking in the area and continuing to stir up trouble. In order to thoroughly destroy them and to make the people in the Taiyue area thoroughly understand the true meaning of Japan's new policy towards North China, with a view to establishing an administrative organization, this operation was launched. However, the elite troops of the Japanese army have achieved great results in this autumn anti-communist war.

### German Defenses Strengthened Along the Coast of Salonika; No Change in Situation on Italian Front

Central News Agency, Berlin, 24th – Huitong News Agency reports: Should anti-Axis invasion forces attempt to enter Salonika from both the sea and land, they will be blocked by strong fortresses. The various small islands in the Aegean Sea and the mountains on the mainland have been transformed into strong defensive strongholds by the German army. German engineers have learned from the defenses in Norway, as the terrains in the two places are similar, and the construction method of the local fortress positions is based on the anti-Axis campaign in the Balkans in 1918 as a reference. Steel walls are used along the coast to prevent the advance of landed troops. Machine gun nests are set up under the rocks along the coast. These facilities cannot be seen from the air. All other armaments and road facilities are also very complete.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 24th – The German News Agency's special correspondent in the Mediterranean region, Boellner, said: "The general situation on the Italian front on Friday was not much different compared to last week. In the north of the Gabania depression and in the Apennine Mountains, the superior numbers of British and American troops tried again to break through the German defenses and launched a fierce attack from the northeast, attempting to split the German flanks, but to no avail. Along the front line, the German army and the enemy engaged in stubborn battles. Whenever the British and American troops attempted to advance, the powerful German artillery, especially the mobile artillery, fired on the advancing enemy troops, inflicting heavy losses on them. This made the enemy feel that the gain of capturing the dilapidated towns was not worth the loss. For example, the occupation of Baranello was only of secondary importance, and before occupying the completely destroyed town, the British and Canadian forces had at least four regiments annihilated. The narrow strip of land occupied by the anti-Axis forces could not compensate for the loss of manpower and material resources they suffered. The fighting along the entire southern Italian front is proceeding as the German army expected. The initiative is still in the hands of the German army. On Friday, the main pressure of the British and American forces, supplemented by reconnaissance attacks, was focused on the upper reaches of the Volturno River and the railway line leading to the west coast of Italy. All offensive actions of several anti-Axis troops were blocked by German heavy artillery, and twice by German grenadiers. In the course of these battles, five British and American tanks and armored reconnaissance vehicles were either destroyed or immobilized. South of Baranello, the German heavy artillery and tanks launched an attack on the powerful British army near the Apennine Highway, forcing the enemy to abandon their preparations. In that area, German Stuka bombers and fighter-bombers raided enemy vehicle convoys along the much-damaged mountain roads. In the evening, a strong German bomber force bombed a British repair factory in the port of Naples, and launched a successful attack on the enemy ship concentration points in the western port area."

### Philippine Congress Adjourns and Releases Military Prisoners

### German Front Shortened, Defensive Posture More Stable

Central News Agency, Berlin, 24th – Huitong News Agency reports: A German military spokesman told foreign journalists yesterday: "The terms 'gap' and 'breakthrough' often appear in recent German war reports. Their meaning is that when the Soviet army launches an offensive, the German army first bombards the positions with artillery fire, and then withdraws from the positions it defends to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. When the Soviet army stops its artillery attack and the infantry implements the offensive, the German army will also launch a counterattack. For this reason, the Soviet army can temporarily break into the German army's positions, but can recover them with slight losses. In this autumn battle, the German army has used this strategy to shorten its positions, which has been quite effective, and can often make the Soviet army's large forces unable to be used. Because the German army has shortened its front, its defensive posture has become increasingly stable."

### Turkish Envoy to Hungary Discusses Diplomatic Policy and Decides to Stay Out of the War Vortex

Central News Agency, Budapest, 24th – In response to Hungarian journalists' questions about Turkish diplomatic policy, the new Turkish envoy to Hungary, Kussu, declared: "Turkey is determined to remain outside the vortex of war.

The interests of the Turkish people are not being violated now, and we hope that they will not be violated in the future." Regarding Turkey's policy towards the Balkans, he said: "Turkey should reach an understanding with the Balkan countries, and Turkey believes that the Balkan countries should also understand each other's difficulties, so Turkey always supports the Balkan Treaty." The Turkish envoy also made a heartfelt speech on Turkish-Hungarian relations, stating: "The traditional friendship between Turkey and Hungary is not a question of dispute, but a noble tradition to be maintained." He said: "He will take advantage of every opportunity to serve the interests of both countries."

### Floral Silk in This City Can Be Freely Moved; Chamber of Commerce Explains Movement of Materials Between Counties

The relevant trade association for cloth factories in this city believes that since silk-woven sofa fabrics and curtain cloths are not included in the items to be purchased, it follows that intra-city movements of these items should be allowed, so long as the movements remain outside the areas under special control. These movements should be treated the same way as cotton and sundry goods. There should be no reason to detain such goods. Inquiries reveal that members have reported that local police officers, lacking accurate information, are mistakenly impeding and restricting these movements. This is hindering the progress of post-war commerce. The relevant trade association has sent a special request to the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association, which in turn will send letters to all police stations within the city, instructing the police to release such goods. This would help merchants who are facing difficulties. The Second Police Station of this city, upon receiving this letter, immediately ordered its various sub-stations to inform their officers that the silk cloth in question is not an item to be purchased, and that it should be allowed to move freely. Indiscriminate seizure of such goods is not allowed.

The National Chamber of Commerce Control Association explains that movements of materials between counties and districts, if there are no special regulations, should be allowed. There should be no restrictions on free transport. Should there be unreasonable impediments, such incidents should be reported through legal channels. If these attempts are ineffective, the issue may be reported to the Association for handling.

### Special Wheat-Flour Commission Discovers Multiple Instances of Smuggling of Flour in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Four Other Locations

The National Chamber of Commerce Control Association's Special Wheat-Flour Commission has been actively promoting the unified purchase and distribution of wheat-flour and bran in various locations. However, unscrupulous manufacturers have been attempting to reap excessive profits by disregarding the law and the plight of the impoverished segments of society. They are purchasing and trading in wheat-flour without the proper permits, and are smuggling and transporting these goods. This situation is significantly affecting the livelihood of the population and is having an outsized impact. The Chamber of Commerce has notified and instructed all its branches to pay close attention, and has carried out stringent investigations. In one instance, the Yi Ji foreign firm of Nanjing attempted to smuggle over 3,400 bags of flour to Bengbu. Upon learning of this, the Chamber of Commerce dispatched staff to carry out a thorough investigation. In the area of Nanxiang, the Li Chang and Tai Chang flour mills transported 3,090 bags of flour from Nanjing. After investigation, it was found that they did not obtain the proper permits. The Chamber of Commerce immediately seized the flour. The Zhenjiang office discovered a transport train carrying 200 bags of privately transported wheat flakes. Together with the local police, they dispatched staff to seize and store the goods. The flakes will be purchased at the price of bran. In the area of Wuxi, multiple factories are producing flour from wheat without reporting these activities, and are privately selling the produced flour. The Chamber of Commerce has already reported this to the authorities in charge, requesting severe punishment.

### The 25th Rationing of Rice Opened Yesterday in Southern Part of This City

### Glassware Dealers Agree on Allocation Quotas: Small Dealers Receive 10%

Since the relevant authorities implemented a rationing system for various essential and non-essential materials, speculators have been severely threatened. However, due to possible improprieties by a few guild leaders, disputes have frequently arisen. It is now understood that the authorities are paying close attention to these malpractices and have decided to find ways to correct them in order to meet the original purpose of the rationing system. According to inquiries by a Shanghai News Agency reporter yesterday, the local glassware trade association has historically been divided into large and small dealers. Because the allocation of glassware has been entirely enjoyed by the large dealers, while the small dealers have not received any allocation at all, disputes have arisen everywhere. Subsequently, through the mediation of individuals such as Huang Ru-liang and Lu Geng-chen, an agreement has been reached whereby the large dealers, including the Japanese trading firms, will allocate 10% of all incoming goods to the small dealers. Therefore, this dispute has been resolved. Currently, the small dealers have organized their own distribution team and have established an office at 50 Kanfen Lane, which began operations immediately. In order to ensure that all members of the trade understand the situation, the association will issue a notice to prevent misunderstandings.

### Third Police Precinct Selects Trainee Detectives

Therefore, all preparations have been completed, and all retailers have been designated. These retailers were selected from all businesses in the first and second districts based on recommendations by trade associations.

The numbered cards will be printed within the next week and distributed by the various certificate issuing offices to household heads, who will be notified to make purchases from nearby retailers according to their numbers.

### Streetcar Conductors Should Treat Passengers with Courtesy

Recently, streetcars on all routes have become extremely crowded. Although the streetcar company has increased the number of vehicles, this has not been enough to alleviate the problem. However, streetcar conductors often use the large number of passengers as an excuse, claiming that there is no room in the cars, or because passengers are rushing and causing inconvenience to their work, they unreasonably speak harshly and use abusive language towards people, which is deeply regrettable. It is now understood that the streetcar company has decided to strictly prohibit such behavior, and anyone may report such incidents. However, it is necessary to provide a detailed record of the conductor's number, as well as the time, circumstances, and your own real name and address, so that legal action can be taken.

### Re-Registration of Households in Xinzha Security District

The Xinzha Security District under the First Police Bureau of this city is currently re-registering households and has issued household survey forms, ordering each household to fill them out again. The Xinzha Security District Committee attaches great importance to this matter and has brought it up for discussion at its executive meeting. It plans to require each household to fill out four copies (one for the head of the household, one for the head of the neighborhood, one for the head of the district, and one for the police bureau's security district office). The standard for filling out the form is to include only those who actually reside within the district. Each household survey form must be reviewed and stamped by the head of the neighborhood as proof. To prevent corruption, the Xinzha Security District Committee solemnly declares that security district personnel are not allowed to collect fees for household survey forms. If any of the above occurs, citizens are welcome to report it, and it will be strictly investigated and prosecuted. If citizens make mistakes while filling out the form, they may exchange the discarded form for a new one at the police station.

### Shanghai Deaf-Mute School: Cultivating Talents, Organization and Equipment

Although the establishment of the Fu Ya School [Shanghai Deaf-Mute School] was somewhat late, it quickly gained an important position in Shanghai.

The education of deaf-mute children requires more complete facilities than ordinary education, to compensate for the inadequacies of teachers' oral instruction and finger pointing. Principal Wang spoke of the school's past facilities with unconcealed emotion. In the period when it was affiliated with the Hongqiao Road School for the Blind, although the equipment for deaf-mute education could not be said to be "having everything," it was barely sufficient for the needs of sixty to eighty students. At that time, in addition to ordinary academic subjects, special courses in crafts were offered, so that each student could learn a specialized skill to prepare for future livelihood. Unfortunately, everything was lost in the war. Later, it moved to No. 37 Bilitan Road. Although the equipment had to be simplified due to the limited resources, the environment was still very good. At that time, there were nine classrooms, as well as a library, auditorium, dining hall, sports ground, basketball and soccer fields, and very well-built dormitories for boys and girls. Now, they have only become beautiful memories.

The new school site at 33 Huangjia Sha Road is a detached Western-style house with three floors and seventeen rooms, divided into five classrooms, as well as one office, dining room, and recreation room each. Five dormitories for boys, girls, and young children are distributed on the second and third floors and are arranged in a relatively orderly manner. It is said that the dormitories have nannies responsible for taking care of the daily lives of the boarding students, paying special attention to cleanliness and hygiene, and also encouraging students to focus on cleanliness spontaneously in education. Other laundry rooms, bathrooms, kitchens, and toilets are simple, but they are well-managed, and can be compared with those of large universities. The playground is also adequately equipped, so the environment can be said to be suitable for deaf-mute education. In terms of organization, according to Principal Wang, the school is currently divided into a two-year preparatory course, a four-year primary school, a two-year senior primary school, a three-year junior vocational course, and an affiliated normal training course. All deaf-mute children between the ages of seven and fourteen from respectable families can enroll. The enrollment procedures require advance registration, with parents filling out an application form. After review and acceptance, they will be notified immediately for formal enrollment. The tuition fee for this semester is 340 yuan, miscellaneous fees are 60 yuan, and accommodation fees are 200 yuan, for a total monthly fee of about 500 yuan. However, in reality, the number of people receiving free or half-price education is also not small. There are 62 students this semester, 45 boys and 17 girls, with 19 boarding students, including 12 who are refugee children. All students are deaf-mute children, but a few have been able to make simple phonetic sounds.

A Glimpse of Teaching

The current school building is not bad either. Entering the gate is a schoolyard that is not too big but not too small either. Along the bamboo fence, flowers and plants are planted. It is a place with a serene and elegant atmosphere. Inside the classroom, the achievements of deaf-mute students, the watercolor paintings on the walls, the portrait sketches, and the handicrafts in the glass cabinets all give people a good impression. The classroom next to the wall is the preparatory class. A deaf-mute female teacher is using gestures and other methods to teach more than a dozen deaf-mute children. Seeing her busy and nervous appearance, it is clear that teaching them is much more difficult than teaching ordinary children. According to Principal Wang, the preparatory course is two years long, equivalent to a regular kindergarten. After completing the course, they will enter the primary school.

On the second floor, the first and second grades share a classroom. Each grade has a female teacher teaching separately. The first grade is learning pronunciation. The teacher randomly points out one or two girls to recite simple texts. Surprisingly, they can all produce a pronunciation that is very close to standard Mandarin. Deaf children are not mute, which is definitely not an ideal. The second grade is practicing calligraphy. Each student is copying an article that is not very short, and everyone copies it neatly, and the handwriting is clear and correct. You can't tell that it was written by low-grade children. Two teachers are teaching the third and fourth grades. The students are relatively older, and teaching is done using sign language. The fifth and sixth grades share a classroom, and a teacher implements small group teaching. Each group has five or six people who sit around a table with the teacher. Everyone has their own textbook. The teacher explains each word and sentence using gestures and written communication. The students are studying carefully. When this group is being taught by the teacher, the other group studies independently. The teacher is busy enough to be out of breath.

The main subjects at the Shanghai Deaf-Mute School now are: civics, pronunciation, visual language, sign language, Mandarin, ruler usage, written communication, Japanese, English, general knowledge, written arithmetic, abacus, history, geography, hygiene, art, physical education, calligraphy, etc. Among them, the art course includes Chinese painting, charcoal painting, pastel painting, watercolor painting, and utensil painting.

The normal training course attached to the deaf-mute school is divided into junior and senior levels, with the aim of cultivating teachers specializing in deaf-mute education to meet social needs. Those who graduate from high school or normal school can enter the senior training course, which lasts for one year and focuses on practical training. Those with junior high school education or equivalent academic ability can enter the junior training course, which lasts for two years and emphasizes both learning and practice.

In addition to ordinary academic subjects, there was originally a junior vocational course, which was scheduled to be two years long, teaching art, Chinese typing, mechanical drawing, and embroidery. Now, because the school building is relatively small and the school equipment is not complete, it has not been possible to hold it. If enthusiastic people in society can provide assistance, Principal Wang said he is determined to restore it in the shortest possible time.

Principal Wang solemnly stated that the school not only focuses on academics but also makes every effort to cultivate good character in deaf-mute children. Because deaf-mute children and young people have relatively simple minds and are easily influenced, teachers must lead by example, and students must encourage each other to create an excellent academic atmosphere and cultivate citizens with sound moral character.

Comments from the Economic Sector

### Construction Ministry's Construction Bonds

According to recent newspaper reports, the Construction Ministry will issue a considerable amount of construction bonds to finance its three-year plan. The planned three-year plan is divided into three parts: water conservancy, transportation, and urban construction. In water conservancy, the decision has been made to first dredge East Taihu Lake and open up the wasteland along the coast of East Taihu Lake. At the same time, the new canal in northern Jiangsu will be excavated. In transportation, the decision has been made to first open up new highways to facilitate wartime transportation. In urban construction, the decision has also been made to gradually carry out urban construction step by step.

At a time when countries around the world are competing to implement five-year plans and ten-year plans, a three-year plan cannot be considered an exaggeration. However, the amount of money needed is probably quite astonishing. Some feel that in order to prevent the amount of construction bonds issued from becoming too large, the urban construction part should be reduced in scope or even temporarily abandoned. Because people at the current stage feel that cities are safer, they flock to live in cities. If cities must be built at this time, wouldn't it further encourage the concentration of the population in cities? Therefore, it seems that more or even all of the time, funds, and manpower should be used for water conservancy and transportation construction, because one will help increase agricultural production, and the other will help the exchange of materials. Construction is production, and production is construction. The ultimate goal of issuing construction bonds is still to ensure wartime production, which is beyond doubt.

In addition, the huge amount of public bonds that the Construction Ministry will issue in the future should first be digested by the people to absorb the surplus purchasing power in the hands of the people. It should not be underwritten by issuing banks first, to avoid the drawbacks of currency issuance and rising prices.

### Establishment of Trade Association Offices in Various Districts

After the authorities made adjustments to the trade associations in this city and merged them into unified organizations, most of the trade associations in this city have completed adjustments and started working. Assisting the authorities in adjusting and balancing prices to maintain the people's livelihood is being actively carried out. The city's area is vast, including various special districts such as Nanqiao, Beiqiao, Chuansha, and Chongming, which are far away from the city center. Therefore, various trade associations have established offices in various districts as needed to facilitate the promotion of services throughout the city. The competent authorities have approved the establishment.

### Food Prices in Nanjing to Comply with Official Prices; Municipal Government Strictly Orders Trade Associations

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) The official prices for various food items in Nanjing for the latter half of this month have now been publicly discussed and finalized by the respective trade associations, and submitted to the municipal government for approval and official announcement for implementation. It is reported that the municipal government has specifically ordered members of the trade associations to earnestly implement the prices. In addition, economic police have been dispatched to conduct inspections at any time. It is hoped that all citizens will assist the authorities in reporting violations of compliance by various stores so that they can be severely punished.

### Trade Associations to Report Monthly Transaction Information

The authorities in this city are making considerable progress in stabilizing the people's livelihood, controlling materials, and suppressing prices. Yesterday, it was learned that all companies and firms, regardless of their nature of business, must classify their inventory at the end of each day, report the types and quantities of goods purchased, and submit a list to the trade association. The trade association will then report it to the relevant authorities for reference. As for the methods for transporting materials and obtaining certificates, the relevant authorities are still trying to manage them to prevent materials from being hoarded and diverted.

### Shanghai Markets Show Increased Stability Last Week

The financial and industrial situation in Shanghai was still stable last week. Compared with recent events, there has been no change. People's minds are at ease. Since the government implemented wartime economic policies, financial management has become more meticulous, and the use of funds has become more flexible. The rationing system for various daily necessities for the people's livelihood has been gradually strengthened. Attempts to manipulate hoarding behavior have completely disappeared. Even if illegal merchants are hoarding materials, it is no longer enough to stimulate the psychology of the society and the people. Therefore, all financial, industrial, and commercial sectors are operating normally under the management of the government authorities. Therefore, the market conditions for exchange rates, silver, public bonds, stocks, military notes, and joint banknotes have changed only slightly. The money supply has become loose, and the overnight interest rate has risen from two cents to one cent and six points. The supply and demand of food products such as rice, grains, beans, oil, sugar, and flour are becoming more abundant, and prices are stable. The rationing system adopted by the authorities for soap and matches has eliminated speculation, and black market prices have fallen.

### Banks and Money Shops in Nanjing Accept Prize Savings

(Nanjing, 24th, Central News Agency) The Central Reserve Bank has joined forces with various banks and money shops in Nanjing to organize a prize savings week. Since the intensive preparations and publicity in recent days, the general public has already understood the meaning of the savings campaign organized by the authorities. Therefore, all banks and money shops in the city, in addition to the Central Reserve Bank itself, will uniformly begin accepting savings from the public starting on the 24th and lasting until the 31st of this month. During this period, any citizen who deposits a fixed deposit of 500 yuan or more will be given a special preferential interest rate and will also have the hope of winning a prize as an incentive.

### Japanese Military Expert Discusses the Pacific War Situation

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) A military expert here discussed the Pacific war situation, saying: "Since the U.S. military began its counteroffensive on the Solomon Islands in early August last year, the Pacific war front has entered a new phase. Since then, for one year and three months, the Japanese and American forces have deployed their full strength of land, sea, and air forces to launch fierce decisive battles one after another. The Japanese army, in order to cope with the changes in the war situation, withdrew from Guadalcanal Island in early February this year and changed its strategic policy, adopting a defensive posture against the enemy's offensive, and annihilating the enemy forces that came to attack everywhere. This tactic is called the 'bleeding operation' and has achieved considerable results.

"After withdrawing from Guadalcanal Island, the Japanese army subsequently withdrew from Kolombangara and Vella Lavella Island in early October. Also, since the Japanese army withdrew from Buna on the New Guinea front, the Salamaua and Lae fronts have also gradually moved north. Currently, the Japanese and American forces are engaged in fierce battles in the area north of Finschhafen. The Japanese army has achieved great results in the withdrawal operation. The American Economic Magazine, which was published on the 13th of last month, also stated: 'Recent offensive operations in the Pacific have proven that the U.S. military's counterattacks on various islands are not only slow but also require great sacrifices.' This proves that the new tactics adopted by the Japanese army have made the enemy feel disturbed. This is because the Japanese army's bleeding tactics are the only way to conduct operations before the Japanese army launches an offensive. In the Great East Asia War, the Japanese army must go through the following

three stages to achieve final victory: the first stage is to obtain military resources and strategic strongholds in the southern regions to establish Japan's invincible position. The strategy adopted by the Japanese army during this period was to attack and suppress the enemy, while the British and Americans retreated and prepared for a counteroffensive. In the second stage, the enemy launched a total counteroffensive against Japan because its productivity had reached its peak. Japan adopted bleeding tactics in response and actively strengthened its combat power during this period. The third stage is to use bleeding operations to consume the enemy's combat power and then launch another offensive while the enemy's camp is in chaos, destroying the enemy's military power in order to make the enemy surrender. From the outbreak of the war to the start of the U.S. counteroffensive last August, it was the first stage of the war situation. In this short period of eight months, the Japanese army successively consolidated its position against the enemy forces in Greater East Asia, secured the treasure trove of military resources in various southern regions, established an invincible position, and laid the foundation for certain victory. However, according to historical records, offensive operations are difficult to accomplish in one stroke when countries with equal strength fight each other, especially in a vast battlefield, coupled with the development of modern weapons technology. Because

after the attack progresses, it is isolated from the supply resources such as soldiers, weapons, ammunition, and food. It is necessary to prepare a long transportation and supply line, and under the accumulation of damage such as battles and diseases, the dangers of these conditions actually exceed the benefits gained from the favorable conditions during the attack. Therefore, the danger gradually increases, and failure of the offensive is a common phenomenon. At this time, the attacking army should immediately decide on the strength of both sides, assess the limits of the possibility of attack, and correct the strategic tactics. Take the appropriate battle line as the limit, stop the attack operations that have been carried out, adopt a defensive posture, gradually carry out combat power with the smallest possible cost, prepare the rear supply line, and devote efforts to maintaining the military power during the second stage of attack operations. It is important to eliminate the enemy in one fell swoop. And at this time, it is impossible to consider the gains and losses of local geography. Therefore, the withdrawal operation from Guadalcanal Island is also very remarkable. The Japanese army's withdrawal operation from the island was a very successful way to change the strategic method in response to the shift in the war situation amidst various difficult war situations. This battle case can be

eternally recorded in military history. The soil only occupies 2,000 square miles, and Buna is just a remote city, but the Japanese army has contained the enemy forces for about half a year before implementing withdrawal operations in these two places, and during this period, the Japanese side's sacrifices and casualties were only 16,734 people, and the aircraft that self-destructed and did not return counted as 139. On the other hand, the damage suffered by the enemy US-Australian forces was great, with more than 25,000 casualties, 230 aircraft shot down and destroyed, more than 30 artillery pieces destroyed, and 25 tanks destroyed. Also, from the end of June last year, when the enemy U.S. forces landed on Rendova Island, to the early October when the Japanese army retreated from Kolombangara Island and Vella Lavella Island, the damage suffered by the enemy in the vicinity of New Georgia Island was about 11,200 people, about 700 people on Rendova Island, and about 1,000 people near Vella Lavella Island, totaling 15,000 people. The Japanese army was preparing the the the Salamaua and Lae areas, and gradually began to advance from the beginning of the month, and completed the assembly in the northern area of Lae in the middle of the month. During this period, the Japanese side fought about 2,000 people. The enemy's damage is estimated to be 12,000 people. If combined with the naval operations of the same period, from the first naval battle of the Solomon Islands to the night battle on the Kolombangara Island waters, the naval battles of the past year in the South Pacific City were calculated, and the Japanese side's losses included the sinking of 20 ships, the destruction of 30 ships, the sinking and destruction of 20 ships, and the self-destruction, non-return, and injury of 700 aircraft. The enemy's losses included 150 enemy ships sunk, and 50 ships fired, with battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers sunk, 60 ships sunk, 20 ships sunk, and 3,000 aircraft hit, its damage number is extremely large, the enemy

Since the United States has been loudly advocating counteroffensive against Japan, it has been one year and three months since then, and it has sacrificed huge manpower and military needs. What it has gained is only to move north from Guadalcanal Island to Vella Lavella Island in the Solomon Islands, and to advance slightly from Buna in New Guinea. This shows the difficulty of its counteroffensive. From this point of view, we can see that the Japanese army's attrition operations are not passive operations, but active operations. As mentioned above, the greatest goal of attrition operations has been mentioned above. The Japanese military is actively enriching its combat power during this period, so that it has the means to prepare the second offensive power in order to win the final victory. Also, since the Quebec meeting, the anti-Axis countries have shouted the war with the Pacific war front as the first principle. Some people in the anti-Axis countries also advocate that "the anti-Axis army now seems to be equal to letting go

Japan is powerful. If we know that we will seek to magnetize the Axis forces by next year, and then transfer it to Japan for combat, it will take a lot of effort." One foot proves that the enemy is also deeply concerned about giving Japan the surplus of time, which will make Japan's military strength have great achievements.

### Section One, September Fire Summary

The Section One Fire Department's record of fire and rescue work for September is as follows:

Emergency ambulance dispatches: 119 times. Hospital vehicle dispatches: 192 times. Hospital vehicle (transporting infectious disease patients): 55 times. Total: 366 times.

Furthermore, the number of fire incidents this month has increased compared to last month. In past years, fires have always been more frequent in winter than in other seasons. Therefore, it is necessary to remind citizens to be vigilant. In addition, the fire that occurred at 5:20 PM on September 22nd at Changxin Chemical Factory, No. 471 Xiaoshadu Road, was the main reason for the increased fire damage this month. The number of emergency ambulance dispatches in the rescue service was less than last month, presumably because the number of infectious disease patients is gradually decreasing.

### Section One, Infectious Disease Statistics

### Second Act of the Jimin Cup Basketball Tournament: Renyu Wins Over Xiqing; Women's Green Team Defeats Mixed Team

The Jimin Hospital initiated the Jimin Cup Charity Basketball Tournament to raise funds for guidance. The second battle started at 7 PM last night at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Center. As a result, Renyu reversed the defeat and overcame Xiqing with a score of 24 to 18. In another scene, the women's San-Yi (Three Provinces) team mistakenly registered and changed to a mixed team to fight the Green Team. As a result, the Green Team won with a score of 18 to 9. During the game, there was also a charity ball auction, hosted by Huang Yanfang and Huang Zhenshi. Li Houshi generously donated and purchased it at a high price of 40,000 yuan. The women's performance took the stage first. The Green Team's Quan Yunzhi and Huang Mingyuan scored in succession, while the mixed team's Liu Zhenbao and Huang Fuping could not reverse the tide. The Green Team defeated the mixed team with a score of 18 to 9. In the finale, Xiqing's Funik made the first record. Yeren added icing to the cake. Renyu's Zhuo Guorong acted as a foil, scoring two points. The two sides formed a seesaw battle. Renyu waited for Wang Chuqing to hit a long shot, and reversed the score to 8 to 7. Xiqing pursued directly. At the end of the first half, Xiqing led 12 to 11. After changing sides, Renyu was cautious. The battle became increasingly tense. Lin Weicong and Sha Kejin were successively penalized off the field for four fouls. The performance gradually became relaxed. Renyu had to make every throw, and their stamina was frightening. They won with a score of 24 to 18. The final battle is scheduled for the 26th (tomorrow) at the same location, with the final between West Ken and Renyu.

### "Gone with the Wind" Impressions: A Call for the Student Aid Movement

Saving money in the most difficult of lives, I watched a struggling performance of "Gone with the Wind" in Paris for ten dollars.

I am a poor student. With the help of the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund, I was able to enter the high threshold of the university. Therefore, I have a special feeling for watching "Gone with the Wind." Watching the fiery scene on the stage, my emotion is twofold: on the one hand, it is the excitement that the plot gives me; on the other hand, it is the response caused by the spirit of hard work.

The "Gone with the Wind" described on the stage, whether in theme or form, seems to be different from the original work, and even further away from the movie "Gone with the Wind." "Gone with the Wind" takes another path. It depicts a group of young people in the Northern Expedition era - a group of petty bourgeoisie under the tide of激邊下小階級. Blind enthusiasts (such as the Ke brothers), utopian dreamers (such as Zha Ti), and opportunistic revolutionaries (such as Gan Folan) all have a rough silhouette. Wei Xili and Bai Ruide, as the protagonists, the former is a typical representative of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals. They have perfect character and are enthusiastic about the revolution, but cannot be a soldier; the latter sympathizes with the revolution, but stands far away and becomes a frivolous cynical - a complete individualist. If I guess correctly, I think the theme that the playwright wants to write in "Gone with the Wind" is only one point: that is, the petty bourgeoisie's illusion about the revolution. This is a very intimate work for us.

The hard-working performers are all the best in terms of acting skills. In my opinion, the distribution of this performance may not be the most ideal match; however, the performers' efforts, regardless of whether the play is heavy or light, all give us a "spiritually full" and "lively" impression. Coming from the Shanghai Professional Troupe system, the hard-working drama workers, from directors and actors to technical guards, have a special characteristic: that is, their serious and meticulous work. I think this is really the best morality for drama workers, and it is worthy of our emotion and praise.

And the most significant meaning of this hard-working performance is the promotion of the student aid movement. For all student aid funds or loan funds, the enthusiastic donation of social figures is certainly a most valuable act, but cooperation like the hard work and Shen Bao Student Aid Fund, I think it is particularly worthy of approval, because it is active, and the meaning is also twofold - it is a drama movement, and at the same time, it has made a practical promotion of the student aid movement.

I am a young man who has been cultivated by Shen Bao Lang Xue. After watching "Gone with the Wind," I could not help but be happy and amazed, and I could not help but express my personal ten superficial views. I hope that because of the promotion of the hard-working troupe, the student aid movement can become more prosperous and popular! (Wu Shanqing)

### Qianye Guild Holds Meeting on Internal Market at the End of October

The long-term (six-month) credit loans for the ten-end period of industry and commerce in Shanghai have been prepared by each of the exchange houses and each of the industrial and commercial customers. According to the regulations of the Exchange House Association for handling long-term credit financing, all payments are settled in full on the two-day closing dates at the end of October and April to maintain customary transactions. According to the Central News Agency reporter's exploration with the person in charge of the Qianye (Money Trade) Association, the industry has completed the long-term credit accounts released for the ten-end period of this year with most of the local merchants, and the situation is very good. For the firms that have always been known for their transactions, the extension will be granted until the end of April next year for those who must continue to conduct business on credit. However, in recent years, due to the authorities' crackdown on hoarding, suppression of prices, and tightening of loans, the long-term credit financing is only for those who have had previous transactions and are legitimate industrial and commercial businesses. The industry has decided not to accept loan requests from other households in order to comply with the government's financial management policies. The business of the ten-end period is only handled by the exchange houses, and the bank loans are subsidiary matters. According to the current business of the banks, there are two types of business: mortgage loans and credit loans. The loan period is still handled in accordance with the current laws and regulations of the authorities. Now it is learned that the Qianye Association will hold a discussion and decision-making meeting on the internal market for the ten-end period at 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 25th). As for the new long-term credit financing after the ten-end period, each bank will still handle it, and will only accept applications from those who have legitimate uses or develop productive businesses and have substantial guarantees.

### The Life of a Typesetter

— Happy in It

I am a typesetter in a printing factory. Speaking of it, the printing factory also belongs to the cultural industry. Although I am called a worker, I cannot be confused with a group of peddlers and porters, because my work is quite labor-saving. I do not need to carry on my shoulders or lift with my hands. I specialize in using my hands, brain, and eyesight. Therefore, my qualifications must be more intelligent, and I must also know some foreign languages, such as English, Japanese, German, etc. In particular, Japanese is more frequently used today. Almost every manuscript needs it. Speaking of it, we are also technical personnel, so this kind of work cannot be undertaken by outsiders.

Speaking of the harshness of our living conditions, it is truly extremely low. The monthly salary I get is only 300 yuan (including breakfast expenses). May I ask, at this time of high 物価(prices/inflation), how can this meager salary of 300 yuan be used? Not to mention supporting parents and raising children, even personal pocket money is not enough.

Although nominally our shop provides lodging, unexpectedly the shop only provides one porridge and one meal a day. Lunch is not provided. Now even the white porridge for dinner has been reduced to being mixed with sweet potatoes, taro, or 趨類 (similar) things to fill the stomach. It is also pitiful to say that after working hard for a day, the only meal of white rice per person is at noon.

Speaking of accommodation, what we sleep on is neither a bed nor a mattress. We sleep on the floor of the workshop, so the ground is our tatami.

I work indoors all day without seeing the sun. It seems that there is no green 相見(chance to meet) the sun. The daily working hours are from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Due to lack of nutrition and unsanitary conditions, the colleagues' physique is quite weak. If there is a slight carelessness, there is a possibility of getting sick. Fortunately, I am a person who has always paid a lot of attention to exercise. I must practice boxing in the morning and evening spare time, so my body is still healthy. I am not often sick all year round.

Although my treatment is so low and my life is so hard, I do not feel depressed because of this, because I am very interested in this work. Although I am working all day without a moment of 空　(free time), I think that my war industry is the cultural industry, the future is bright and great, and serving the public is my responsibility.

### *Shen Bao* Weekly, Resumed Publication No. 7: Savage Bloody Battle in Nassau Bay: Warriors Fired Up and Fearless

Since our forces landed in Nassau Bay, the situation on the New Guinea front, centered on Lae and Salamaua, has been intensifying, with fierce decisive battles erupting one after another. The battlefield as of yesterday was riddled with large craters filled with stagnant water. Our brave warriors, like enraged lions, valiantly ambushed the enemy's large land forces equipped with superior heavy weaponry. Their heroic demeanor was no different from that of divine soldiers. Many wounded soldiers, after receiving brief bandages at field hospitals, hastily returned to the front lines. How could one not call such a struggle heroic, seeing soldiers with blood-soaked bandages on their limbs, holding guns with one hand while using a cane, and officers with wounded arms still tightly gripping their swords and commanding relentlessly? If the Solomon Islands battle was a "bloody battle," then the New Guinea front is a "death struggle." What follows is from Lieutenant Yanagida, a military doctor:

Eagerly Going to Battle

The American landing in Nassau Bay occurred on June 30th. To prepare for the enemy's large-scale counterattack, our forces gradually fortified their positions. The weakness of our forces in the Mubo area was most concerning, and reinforcing that area was a matter of utmost urgency. Thus, amid the enemy's torpedo boats' rampant attacks, a certain unit's main force was sent to that area using suicide boat maneuvers. The main force of a certain self-proclaimed elite unit, upon arriving at its destination, did not rest. It immediately launched an attack on the American stronghold of Wau. The enemy air force, upon learning of this, immediately mobilized. Large enemy aircraft such as "Consolidated" and "Boeing" soared through the sky like blood-sucking demons, dropping heavy bombs and strafing with machine guns, leaving almost no room for even a rat to hide. The main force of the self-proclaimed elite unit was powerless against this and, therefore, the planned strategy could not be implemented at all.

Great Disparity in Numbers

However, the enemy forces in Nassau Bay were constantly reinforced, and with land and air coordination, they launched a fierce counterattack against our forces. The officers and soldiers of that unit continued their Ashura-like death struggle amidst constant artillery fire, sacrificing themselves for their country. Their strong endurance in battle was evident. Subsequently, as the situation intensified, an order was given on a certain day in a certain month to shorten the front line and retreat to positions near Salamaua, while fortifying the coastal positions. The enemy's firepower and equipment were quite superior, with mortars and heavy mountain guns constantly roaring. Regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy, day or night, the sound of artillery fire rumbled on, and shells rained down. "The enemy's artillery shells are cheap!" one brave soldier exclaimed. How many shells do they have? It's truly admirable. Sometimes, even shells with the fuses removed were sent over. The shells that don't explode but fall after piercing the top of the tent are truly terrifying! However, the enemy only fired when they had to, and when they did, they would uproot primeval forests that had never been touched by an ax, kicking up a sky full of ochre earth. The scene was particularly tragic!

Conversely, our forces, due to a lack of transportation capacity to the front lines, were unable to resupply ammunition and provisions, so they never fired a shot in vain. Moreover, when we fired one shot, we would receive twenty or thirty in return; if we used mortars, they would respond with field and mountain guns; if we used field and mountain guns, they would return the favor with heavy artillery. Therefore, our artillery units could only rely on quality to overcome the enemy's artillery, which relied on quantity. This could be called a "spiritual challenge." Every shell fired by our brave warriors contained the spirit of "one shot, one enemy eliminated." There was even an instance of destroying seven enemy mortar positions with a single shot from our last mountain gun. When the soldiers, amidst their fierce struggle, heard the news that the artillery reinforcement unit commanded by Captain Suzuki had landed in Salamaua amidst towering waves with an unwavering determination to win, and were dreaming of tomorrow's battle in their encampment, they were unexpectedly caught in a heavy bombing raid by a large formation of enemy aircraft, and Captain Suzuki and many of his officers and soldiers sacrificed their lives for the country. It was ultimately difficult to unleash the full potential of this unit with such personnel. Furthermore, reinforcements were not permissible under the present circumstances, especially since the front lines desperately needed artillery support. As a result, the commander of a certain artillery unit made a sorrowful decision. He planned to temporarily disband the unit and distribute its members to other units, in the hope of maximizing the unit’s artillery capabilities.

Winning Through Quality

At that time, the survivors of the unit submitted a blood oath, signed by Sergeant Unosuke Yotsukura and several others, to the commander of a certain artillery unit. The content was roughly as follows:

"When a soldier faces the battlefield, who would care about personal adversity? The unit landed at Salamaua without any loss of personnel or equipment. Moreover, upon receiving the advance unit, the morale of the unit members was extremely high, looking forward to completing their mission in tomorrow's battle. Unexpectedly, they were caught in a heavy bombing raid by enemy aircraft, and unfortunately, lost the unit commander and several comrades-in-arms. However, in order not to betray the teachings of the unit commander, even if only one soldier remains, he will share the fate of the artillery. Therefore, the remaining members, with Lieutenant Kikuchi at the core, are united in spirit, willing to fight to the death for the honor of the unit. Even if the unit has only one artillery piece left, it will certainly fulfill its mission to defeat the enemy, to comfort the spirits of the unit commander and fallen comrades, and to serve the emperor. We are now prepared to carry out tomorrow's orders, and hope that our situation will be understood and that the unit will not be dispersed."

The unit commander, holding the sealed blood oath, could not help but sigh after reading it: "I have never been so moved by the sincerity of my subordinates!" Every word was filled with loyalty and a noble spirit, and its sincerity was enough to move even the gods. Could this not be said to be the essence of the artillery spirit? Just as the first-line ground units were engaged in a desperate battle under the heavy bombardment of enemy artillery and the intense bombing of enemy aircraft, the Jinno unit suddenly joined the battle. The Jinno unit was a well-trained elite force that had been mysteriously appearing and disappearing since landing in Salamaua. They bravely and resolutely charged into the enemy's ranks, crushing them as easily as smashing dry weeds. Their night raids and assaults were very effective, so they once told the chief of staff, "As long as we have a steady supply of food, we have nothing to worry about." Therefore, the enemy deeply resented them. In addition, the Oba suicide squad also penetrated deep into enemy territory, engaging in arduous battles and destroying the enemy's artillery positions.

However, the enemy's counter-offensive momentum in Salamaua was becoming increasingly blatant and aggressive. Looking toward the enemy's positions, one could see Douglas transport planes dropping long, unidentified objects via parachute every day. What exactly were they? This mystery was finally solved after a few days. One day, we learned from an allied pilot that those were medium-caliber 4.5-inch anti-aircraft guns. It turned out that the enemy was transporting anti-aircraft guns by plane! The number of "wells" and "ponds" on the allied positions that resulted from enemy artillery fire was increasing daily. The brave soldiers fighting in the waterlogged trenches were suffering from moisture-related foot ailments, and their condition was heartbreaking, but they were all determined to fight to the death and defend Salamaua.

On a certain day in a certain month, several dozen enemy soldiers infiltrated a gap in the Takahashi unit's position and began building fortifications. They were immediately discovered by Sergeant Miyai. He immediately led six of his subordinates in a brave and ferocious attack, disregarding their own lives. The enemy soldiers were initially caught off guard and thrown into confusion, but seeing that their attackers were few in number, they regained their composure and returned fire with automatic rifles. Sergeant Miyai immediately charged into the enemy's ranks alone, rampaging through their lines. Eventually, his sword broke and his arrows were exhausted, and he died a heroic death. In addition, one other soldier was killed and three were wounded, leaving only Corporal Fukutomi and Private First Class Amada. As the enemy, relying on their superior numbers, counterattacked, the sun had already set without anyone noticing. Corporal Fukutomi and Private First Class Amada took advantage of the cover of darkness to crawl closer to the enemy's position and threw hand grenades. The enemy soldiers, sleeping soundly, were unsure of what was happening and fell into chaos, retreating in a panic. The two of them held the position until reinforcements arrived the next morning, and were therefore praised and commended by their superiors.

Spirit of Attack

On a certain day in a certain month, American forces suddenly landed between the Busu River and the Hopoi River. At 9:00 AM that morning, the wireless suddenly malfunctioned. To our surprise, around 11:00 AM, the sound of rumbling shook the earth, and approximately thirty B-24 and B-17 aircraft flew toward Lae. Soon after, the enemy planes, in formations of three, began a continuous iron bombing, centering on OOO. The intensity of the bombing was truly indescribable. The bombs were time-delayed, detonating after one or two seconds. They were all large objects weighing around 500 kilograms. The bombing caused the earth to shake, and the terrain changed in an instant. The craters formed by the explosions were about 20 meters in diameter and 6-7 meters deep, filled with water like ponds. They were everywhere.

As the night turned to dawn, large ocean liners were spotted far out at sea. Destroyers were guarding the transport ships. Submarines were surfacing. Countless P-38 fighter planes were flying overhead. There was a total of seventy ships. One large ship was later destroyed by our navy planes. One cruiser and four to six transport ships were sunk. In addition, two destroyers were heavily damaged and caught fire, and twenty-seven P-38 fighter planes were shot down. The headquarters has already announced this great victory.

To prevent the enemy's landing force from crossing the Boso River, the machine gun unit was deployed along the river, maintaining strict vigilance, ready to crush any enemy that appeared. A few days later, our field guns and machine guns suddenly roared. All the officers and soldiers were extremely tense. After all, we were outnumbered. Thus, the soldiers who had been groaning in the field hospitals, hearing the sound of the gunfire, all braced themselves and got up. Soldiers leaning on canes and holding guns, officers with wounded arms, and comrades who had lost limbs all rose up together. Who had ever seen such a battle? As long as we have breath, we will fight relentlessly! Moreover, we recognize death on the battlefield as the highest honor for a soldier. What a noble spirit! This is the spirit of relentless attack! (By Special Correspondent Tagata) (Translated from the October 17th *Asahi Shimbun*)

### Anecdotes of Aerial Warfare in the South Pacific: An Evening Chat with a Reporter Returned from the South Pacific

On the still sea, the waves surged and mixed, and pieces of dry wood fell down like shavings. The burning, falling pieces of dry wood were the remains of the U.S. Army's "secret weapon," the P-39 single-engine fighter plane, shot down by our new fighter planes. After intense concentrated bombing, the waves rippled, and at that moment, the enemy's plane was shot down. In early summer, May, I departed from Tokyo, and in early June I arrived at the forward base. Since my arrival, I have seen such fierce battles every day.

The enemy's best fighter plane is the "P-39," and the "P-38" is also formidable. It is a twin-engine, twin-boom fighter plane made by Lockheed, the fastest, for fighter use. There are two types for reconnaissance. When attacking Russell Island, a highly skilled naval pilot, a naval lieutenant, engaged an enemy "P-38" in aerial combat. During the engagement, they climbed, each trying to outclimb the other, while shooting. In such a situation, the one who retreats is sure to be shot down; the key to victory is to head straight for the target. Until now, most enemy pilots were afraid to engage and tried to escape. But at that time, the enemy did not escape, no matter how much they were shot at, and of course we did not escape either. Boom! Boom! The distance gradually shortened. Just when it seemed they were about to collide head-on, the enemy raised the nose of his plane slightly. As a result, the Lieutenant's plane dived under the enemy plane, and they brushed past each other. At that moment, the machine gun fire from the enemy rained down on the Lieutenant's cockpit. Such fierce combat proves that there are very brave people among the enemy pilots.

Enemy Brave But Reckless

Many enemy fighter planes have indeed been shot down. As a country, the United States is gradually weakening here. In fact, the enemy's losses are very severe. As long as we keep shooting them down, the number of fighter planes and submarines at the enemy's base will decrease. However, the enemy keeps replenishing new fighter planes from Guadalcanal and Russell Island. The enemy is certainly getting reinforcements. These new planes are newly manufactured. Naturally, they are flown by new pilots, inexperienced enemies. Because they do not know how formidable we are, they adopt such reckless tactics, the "moving target" tactic. The enemy pilots are probably all students, so-called young calves who are not afraid of tigers. But all they have is speed, which is not at all intimidating to our brave pilots. As soon as their plane is hit, they immediately open their parachutes and bail out, landing on the sea, where they get into rubber rafts, and the enemy's high-speed torpedo boats come and rescue them. The enemy has many high-speed boats operating in certain areas, and any pilots who fall into the sea can be rescued. Seeing this, we cannot help but feel deep resentment.

Night Air Raid Situation

Among the enemy planes that come at night, it seems there are some excellent aviators mixed in. But there are also some cowards among them. Once, three planes were sent to attack the XX base. Because of the thick fog that day, all three enemy planes broke through to the base. In the raid, they split into two planes and one plane. Emerging from the clouds, the two planes and one plane bumped into each other and, as if they were enemies, fired all their weapons at each other upon seeing a plane, staging a self-destructive tragedy. As a result, all three planes were hit and damaged. Such a hilarious incident was truly amusing. The moment of shooting down enemy planes that come at night is a truly magnificent and joyful scene. A huge flying fortress, which had always fired bullets wildly, suddenly turned into a blazing inferno. The enemy's flying fortress, which had never been shot down, was finally shot down. How joyful this was to us! Looking up at the sky, everyone clapped their hands with joy. Although there were many bombings, seeing such a scene was thanks to being at the front line. Once a flying fortress is shot down, the enemy airmen immediately parachute down, and we wait to capture those guys who sneak out of the jungle, and ask them about their situation. It is said that 90% of their pilots are students, aged 23 or 24 to 27 or 28. Some are from Harvard University, some are from the University of Washington. According to the prisoners, 30% of the entire army is suffering from malaria, but quinine, the magic drug for treating this disease, has been taken by the Japanese side, causing the enemy considerable suffering.

The enemy was already suffering, and now they are suffering even more. This can be understood simply by looking at the supply situation. The enemy uses transport planes to carry food and ammunition, and then drops them by parachute. Unfortunately, this cannot last long, because they have to land a large army. No wonder they neglected submarine work. As for the enemy troops' landing situation, it is also pitiful. They always gather their transport ships only when the weather is bad for two or three days, when Japanese planes cannot operate actively. The scale of the landing is quite large. When the large fleet of ships arrives near the destination, it takes two hours to unload the cargo from the rear ships. After the landing is completed, fighter planes patrol the sky, while preparing anti-aircraft gun positions, building air defense trenches, and building an airfield. (Translated by Peng)

### Seven Years: In Commemoration of the Seventh Anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's Death

— Traveler

Seven years! Surrounded by demons and monsters, sheltered by jackals and wolves, we have lost our great guide to lead us in our struggle. Seven years! Under the shroud of darkness, in the faint dawn, we have lost the guiding light to show us the path we should take. Seven years! In the onslaught of violent winds and crashing waves, we have lost this lone wolf, to hold us fast. You have rested in "eternity" for seven years, but the sound of your "Outcry" forever echoes in our ears, dispelling our "wandering" from losing our way. The "Ah Q" era has long since died. What remains now is an "eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, an era of revenge." What you said before "Seven Years" will be eternally practiced by us, the survivors: "Using flesh and blood to blunt sharp blades, using blood to extinguish flames, to see a bright dawn in the dim light of swords and fire, that is the dawn of a new century." (Ugly Assistant Studies)

### Song

— Wen Ying

I love song.

When the conductor's baton forcefully cuts through the air, when a tragic song rolls out from the chest of every choir member, my heart beats fiercely. The voices gather in the air to form a whole, and the undulating sounds, moving, inspiring thousands of people, also touch and inspire the singers themselves.

The melody of the soprano section is like a brilliant silver hoop, high-pitched, bright, and gracefully inlaid on the edge of the magnificent song, guiding each section to advance rhythmically, quickly or slowly. Sometimes, like seagulls on the big river, flying to the depths of the white clouds, and then suddenly falling down, nimbly skimming the surface of the water; the singing rises freely, circling smoothly, repeating a moving melody, and suddenly falls and sinks into the waves of the rich male voice section, stirring up some scattered, silver waves on the river.

The alto follows closely, calm and elegant, the clear voice supporting the high pitch of the soprano, completing the necessary supplementation of the harmony. The sound waves tremble, shyly hiding and carefully undulating in the range of the chorus, it stretches out flatly, like the rhythm of a train crossing the desolate wilderness, clearly and solemnly drifting in all directions.

The tenor section moves brightly, like the brilliant sun rising from the east, reddening half the sky. It sings the main melody with the soprano section. Skillful composition techniques arrange it to walk on a winding, discontinuous, high and low road, unfolding a series of surging waves, one chasing the other and flooding forward. It soars in the musical space like an eagle, holding its head high, flapping its two strong giant wings, bravely turning over, and drawing a powerful curve to clearly separate the male and female sections.

Rolling in with a low, magnificent, and solemn sound is the raging tide of the bass section. It is suppressed under the mountains, squeezed out such a melancholy and old sound as if squeezed between the valleys, running a tune that progresses by octaves. The effect of the triad, or even the seventh chord, is thus brought to its ultimate and perfect completion.

If the soprano is like the thriving spring, the alto is like the withered grass and flowers, the cool and refreshing autumn, the tenor is like the vigorous and lush summer, and the bass is like the severe and gloomy winter, then the four-part chorus is a complex synthesis and harmony of the four seasons, with many rich interests.

Like the Yangtze River struggling to surge out of the mountains, a song emanates from the mouths of the singers. Sometimes it is as quiet as a lake after a storm, so clear that it can reflect people; sometimes it is like the sea under a storm, stirring up turbulent waves. Sometimes it is full of energy, shaking with the freedom, satisfaction, and joy, shaking with the triumph and success, shaking with the serene and quiet joy, the sounds dancing and flying, and suddenly turning into a sad, mournful melody, so desolate and miserable, the sounds lengthening, feeling the tremor of enlightenment. Sometimes it is full of anger, passionate and high-spirited, like the long cry of a war horse, like the roar of iron birds, the singing rising step by step, straight into the sky. The conductor's baton suddenly stops, all sounds suddenly cease, falling into silence. At this time, how many dreams, how many emotions, how many hopes are intertwined in people's hearts; this moment of silence after the end of the song contains a sublime artistic charm and a silent sound.

I don't like quiet, and I am even more afraid of loneliness, but I am willing to shut myself up in a narrow room, facing a phonograph and a pile of records, letting it turn and sing some passionate songs, and my heart flies. The four walls of the small room expand around me, and I wander in the vast and boundless, brilliantly illuminated land of music. The songs of Schubert, Verdi, and Tyndall, ballads, cantatas, will give me infinite fantasies and make me long for the hopes of tomorrow more urgently. Of course, I prefer to throw myself into the crowd, raise my head, hold my breath, and listen to the singing of a group of young choir members. In that kind of scene, their songs will shake my heart more violently. Our excellent composers also often give me encouragement and inspiration. In their creations, I can smell the warm breath of the motherland.

I love songs, they make my soul and emotions, polluted by this society, purified and washed. I sincerely thank the composers and singers!

### Female Prisoner

— Guan Renfa

Time passed quickly in the Cheng mansion. A year had gone by, and in that year, aside from breastfeeding little Shi in place of her mistress, she couldn't remember anything else.

The Cheng residence was so lively today! Cheng Fu must be incredibly happy. An old man nearing fifty, celebrating the joy of having a son. Today was the first birthday of the little master. How could they not arrange a banquet to celebrate?

Aying, in her heart, was also very happy. She had fed this little master so well, making him fair and plump; this was entirely her merit.

"Aying, bring little Baobao so the guests can take a look." Cheng the wealthy man's kind voice entered Aying's ears. This suggestion was made by a guest surnamed Wang, and with the agreement of the crowd, Cheng the wealthy man didn't refuse. Moreover, he thought, "I have such a good child, truly wonderful."

As Aying carried the little one through the banquet, everyone praised the child's blessed appearance, fair and plump, and gave Aying a reward. When the viewing was over, little Shi had also fallen asleep. Just as she was about to put him down, another auntie handed her a fast letter. She was very anxious; in the past year, the letters from her hometown were all regular mail. This time, the fast letter seemed rather strange. She immediately opened the letter. Inside, two goose feathers stood up. Looking at the letter again, her eyes were filled with golden stars. She fainted. The letter was filled with misfortune, nothing but misfortune. Her husband had contracted typhoid fever and, without money for treatment, had died. Her son, not getting enough milk, had withered and died.

She went mad. She wanted to find her enemy. Where was he? Who was the little one in that cradle over there? Wasn't he her enemy? She immediately rushed over! "Wah! Wah!" "Haha..." She fainted again.

"You ungrateful wretch..." "Ungrateful and treacherous..." "..." A string of curses poured over her, but she continued to laugh madly. She no longer felt comfortable in the Cheng mansion. She was now in a bitter iron cage. Her life, would her life end here?

### Father

— Yan Yan

The calendar on the wall had thinned to a small part, but it continued to be torn off page by page. Finally, the clear black characters announced to me: the day to pay the tuition was approaching.

Father's face, day by day, became more gloomy – even gloomier!

Early in the morning, with a hopeful heart, he set off at a quicker pace, bustling under the scorching sun. I understood the motivation and purpose of his journey.

In the evening, dragging his tired, thin body, he slowly stepped into the house and collapsed onto the bed. I looked at him: his complexion was a ghastly pale, and his brows were furrowed even more tightly! I knew that he had again let time pass in vain and had surely wasted many good words and painful, unnatural smiles, and perhaps had suffered no small amount of mockery or embarrassing expressions and glares!

"Ah... Ah!" Continuous, muffled sighs began to echo in this small room.

I feared listening to that monotonous sigh; I couldn't bear to see that defeated face; I also couldn't bear that the elderly him, for our sake -- me, brother, sister -- was enduring hardship!

I was older and should help shoulder some of the burden; but, now? …

I planned a method. But. Heavens! This, is this my original intention? How could I be willing to explain it to Father?

This morning, Father was again sitting silently in his chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. The surrounding noise could not disturb his train of thought, like a meditating old monk or a soldier who had transcended this mortal world. But, was it really for such noble aloofness? Rather, it was clearly that he was completely focused on that evil word, "money"!

When my gaze fell on the melancholy face of the old man, my heart was filled with all kinds of suffering.

Suddenly, brother and sister ran in, carrying a letter high, shouting, "Dad, a letter from school! A letter from school!"

The letter temporarily interrupted Father's train of thought; at the same time, it also attracted my gaze. Yes, this was a letter from school.

With trembling hands, Father seemed to struggle to take out the notice inside.

Brother and sister were on either side, each craning their necks, vying to read. After all, the first to finish reading was Father. However, he still held that mimeographed slip, with a dazed look, just staring at the ceiling in a daze.

"Dad, really, why don't you ever pay our tuition?" Having just finished reading, brother immediately said accusingly.

"..." Father didn't even blink, still sitting as before, without giving him an answer.

After a long time, sister still hadn't understood; she snatched the slip from Father's hand, asking me to explain.

The general meaning of the notice was: if the tuition isn't paid again, they would be expelled!

Then, sister also began to complain to Father. Soon after, tears were rolling down her face, shimmering.

"To... tomorrow we'll pay!" Father still looked at the ceiling, slowly uttering these words.

This immediately made brother and sister turn their tears into smiles; running and jumping again, they disappeared in an instant!

Heavens! Tomorrow? Pay tomorrow? Correct! The words are easy to say, but, the money? Where is the money?

Father began to sigh again.

Tuition… tomorrow… money… sorrow… sigh… all of this encouraged me – finally, it made me resolutely speak out the unwilling solution:

"Dad, I want to go apprentice in business!"

Father was unexpectedly startled: "Go apprentice in business? ... Why don't you want to continue studying?"

"It's not for anything! I just feel that studying doesn't have much meaning!" As I spoke, I turned my head. This insincere statement made me burst into tears.

Finally, Father understood: "Child, don't ever destroy your future foundation for me! Books, you must always read them. Dad suffers because he didn't read enough books; there were several opportunities, but knowing that I was incompetent, I watched as the positions were given to others; otherwise, Dad wouldn't be as poor as I am now! As for the money, you don't need to worry, Dad will find a way! If not, we can sell some things! ..." I couldn't bear to argue; in my heart, I didn't know whether it was bitterness or joy. But, I was uncomfortable! Suddenly, I stood up, ran to the bed, and buried my face in the pillow, crying loudly.

### Shanghai Football League is About to Begin Examining the Strength of the Top Seven Teams in Group A East China and Lianyi are the Strongest

This year, the Shanghai football scene, due to the Western Football League (originally the Shanghai League) ending and becoming history, is now under the leadership of the Shanghai Football Association, which is on the rise. This epoch-making transformation has not only relieved our teams of the humiliation of being oppressed by the Western League but has also regained the sovereignty lost for decades. Therefore, it leaves a worthy and special page of glory in the history of Chinese football.

The Shanghai Football Association convened an inaugural meeting last month, and subsequently, the first board meeting decided to organize a competition committee and a judging committee to actively promote the work, host the Shanghai Football League to succeed the "Four League Competition," and decided to hold two major cup competitions, the "City Cup" and the "International Cup." It is expected that this year's football season will have an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere.

A Total of Fifty Teams Participate

Regarding the Shanghai Football League, it has been set to begin on November 6. It is divided into three groups: A, B, and C. Approved by the competition committee, there are seven teams in Group A, eight teams each in Parts 1 and 2 of Group B, and nine teams in each of Parts 1, 2, and 3 of Group C, for a total of fifty teams joining the competition. It is noted that the previous Western League football participants consisted of only twenty-seven teams in Groups A, B, and C combined. This year, it has almost doubled, showing a thriving atmosphere. In the future, the competition among the heroes and the exciting situations can be imagined.

Changes in Major Players

It is noted that the seven teams in Group A include the strongest and most elite lineups in Shanghai. Among them, the four teams that participated in last year's Four League Competition are Lianyi, East China, Portuguese Business, and Jewish. The Scotto Cup champion St. Francis has merged into St. John's, renamed St. John's United. Three Police (formerly French Police) and Three Provinces have emerged, forming the situation of seven heroes. Among the strengths of the teams, East China and Lianyi are the strongest. However, the lineups of the two teams have had subtle changes this year. Sun Jinshun and Zhang Lingen of Lianyi have returned to their parent team, East China, while Xu Wenkui and Zhang Zhaopeng of East China have joined Lianyi together. Such adjustments are not beneficial to either side. Looking at the current lineup, the shortcomings of both teams remain similar. Lianyi's original illness of relying too much on Zhang Lingen will inevitably be addressed by transferring Qu Yunxiang. In the front line, Xu replacing Sun fills the vacancy, but the movement afterwards creates a situation of four missing one. Therefore, the attacking power is extremely weak. Returning to East China, the weakness of the central defender line is its biggest problem. After this adjustment, the defense has the three musketeers Zhang (Lingen), Zhuang (Youren), and Li (Qing), forming an oversupply situation. The central defender sees Zhang Zhaopeng's departure, but Sun Tiegeng's return should help boost the offensive. However, lacking an A-Kui, the difference is negligible. Therefore, the lineups of these two teams, East China and Lianyi, have undeniable weaknesses, which is a great pity!

Portuguese and Jewish are Mediocre

As for the two four-person strong teams, Portuguese Business and Jewish, their performance in last year's Western League Group A was mediocre. This season, Portuguese Business continues as always. If veteran Kao Zhitannen returns to his old ways, their performance may improve. Jewish, due to the main player Fa Fanxiao joining St. John's United, has a weaker lineup. The above two teams should have no hope of contending for the championship.

Three Police is the Former French Police

The Qiaolian team has emerged this year, possessing all the elite of the Scotto Cup champion St. Francis, such as Pan Liman, Xu Erz, M. Pantoson, Greenburg, Carolie, En and others, plus Jewish's Fa Fanxiao, St. John's pillar Yagov, and Shao Youjun, their military strength is flourishing. In the near future, in the cup, they will compete with Lianyi, which is not easy. Therefore, among this season's four-person teams, this team is the strongest. Three Police (formerly the Third Police) is good at hiring strong and capable men. Veterans like Huang Maoji and Stoff, and young players like Qiu Kuntian, are fierce and brave. What their strength will be will only be seen after the start of the league.

Three Provinces' Skill Progresses Rapidly

Three Provinces is the Xuhui Middle School team. Under the guidance of Wang Yifu, their skill has progressed rapidly, and their spirit of observing discipline and respecting sportsmanship is not seen in current teams. It is hoped that Xuhui can maintain this, and as the team is full of young and energetic youth, if given time, their future is unlimited. However, as it is their first time participating in Group A, they may not be able to compete with the various teams. They should still hold the principle of "not being arrogant in victory and not being discouraged in defeat, and strive forward." We place endless hopes on them!

In addition, the various teams in Groups B and C are the second-tier teams in Shanghai, all participating. When they meet on the battlefield, they will be evenly matched, and heroes will show their skills. There will inevitably be fierce competition and wonderful performances. (Zhang Liang)

### Universal Cup Round Gateball Competition Both Men and Women Participate Discussing the Lineups of Each Group

Round gateball was invented by Qing Nancangjun for youth sports competitions. Since its introduction, it has been extremely popular. This time, Xia Shikui initiated the Universal Cup Round Gateball League. As the name suggests, it is a step to promote this novel sport, complementing Qing Nancangjun's hard work. The league was originally scheduled to be held at Guangxia Middle School on the 17th of this month, but was postponed to the 23rd. It was further postponed a second time due to rain, and it has been set to start next Sunday at the original location. This wonderful game is intentionally teasing the fans, making their desires eager and keen. Taking advantage of this repeated postponement, we visited the strength of each group and briefly recorded it, also as a reference for fans:

Group A

Eight teams have joined, and the strength of each team is quite even, with Qianghua, Four Youth, and Nanyang being the strongest. In addition to the original good players Zhang Shaoqing, Qu Xilin, Kong Guangyi, Du Bensheng, Qianghua has also acquired the sharpshooter Bao Songyuan, adding wings to a tiger. Coupled with the return of Pan Zhongen, serving as goalkeeper, they have an extra layer of protection. Their momentum is overwhelming, giving the impression that the championship belongs to them. The Western Youth team, which brings together the elites of the Giant and Knack teams, is no less threatening than Qianghua. Their understanding of round gateball surpasses the Chinese teams. The team has more than two round gateball practice matches per week, deeply understanding the essence of the game, and having a considerable understanding of running, attacking, and defending. Players such as Tao Bolinji, Sasskin, Kai Milov, and others are ambitious, striving to win the round gateball throne, which is a real worry for Qianghua. Secondly, Nanyang, in addition to the original good players Zhang Banglun, Han Longhai, Fan Qingxian, and Li Zhuang, has also received the assistance of Lu Guyong and Zhang Xiliang. The strength of their lineup shows their meticulous planning. Therefore, the situation in Group A will inevitably become a three-legged race among the above three teams, and the wonderful performances to come can be imagined. The remaining teams such as Tonghua Film, Weiren Team, and White Team, although their strength is slightly weaker, relying on God's favor, are by no means idle teams. Perhaps there will be unexpected situations. After making this prediction, I also look forward to seeing unexpected changes, refreshing our eyes and ears.

Group B

Few have joined. Zhonghua, Qinghua, and Qianghua are stronger, and there is a dark horse, the Jewish team. Originally, they belonged to Group A, but the league authorities, because the team has a history in football and basketball but are participating in round gateball for the first time, downgraded them to Group B. Based on their tall stature and level of basketball skills, they may make the "dark horse" make a splash, and they will be the strong enemy of Western Youth B and Qiangren.

Women's Group

Six teams of heroines are competing, which is a good phenomenon for women's sports. Before this grand event has begun, there should be no pronouncements to reduce the interest of some teams. It is hoped that each team will not be discouraged. Know that winning or losing the championship is originally a kind of reward, and the performance of sportsmanship and virtue is even more important than this. Even more so, at a time when women's sports are being vigorously promoted, it is hoped that each team will do their best to display their skills, and not let down the hard work of the advocates. Therefore, I believe that the women's group will become the world of the Green Team. The Green Team has gathered the strong players of Qixiu, Jingwu, and Aiguo, and has invited the inventor, Qian Xucang, to guide them. Good flowers need green leaves to set them off. It is pleasing to the eye. Their attack has the three tiger generals Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shuzhen, and Li Yunzhi, and their defense has the all-rounders Wang Weizhen, Yan Wen, and Liu Zhenbao. They are complete and lacking nothing, so they should not have difficulty directly attacking the Yellow Dragon. However, the barbarian team Western Youth has a tall stature and great strength, and they practice very hard. Their ambitions should not be underestimated. The emerging Three Provinces team has strong players such as Shi Ruijuan, and they should not be completely ignored. Therefore, this unique competition among the heroines will surely change the tastes of fans and create a lot of highlights. Other teams, such as Puji and Jewish, although their strength is weaker, are all eager to have a good performance. It is truly a feast for our eyes.

The above is only my personal opinion, and I hope that the advanced will give guidance, and I have great expectations! (Mei Bixian)

### Wrestling's Great Effects Everyone Should Promote this Excellent Chinese Sport

"One can work hard to avoid disease; but one cannot escape death: Dietary supplements can avoid disease, but cannot strengthen the body, the only wonderful way to strengthen the body is exercise, only then will muscles and bones be strong, and internal organs firm." These are words from the book "Scientific Internal Strength Boxing", which has indicated to us that exercise is the only effective way to strengthen the body.

Exercise is Necessary to Strengthen the Body

Undoubtedly, the weak long for the strong to be envious and self-satisfied, however, developing a perfect physique through exercise is even more glorious. But those who have just started exercising must not be discouraged if their results are not as ideal as they hoped. You must find out the reason why you cannot get satisfactory results; perhaps the method is wrong, or the exercise is excessive or insufficient; you must also understand that the development of a person's physique is limited, and it can never develop forever. The exercise we usually worry about is only to pursue a perfect physique that meets our own physiological conditions, and not an unlimited desire. We must admit that people with naturally large bones seem to be more convenient and easier to achieve results when they exercise. But it cannot be denied that the method of exercise is more important. If the exercise method you adopt is reasonable, then even if you are a person with small bones, you can still get an extremely healthy body. Here I will start to introduce an excellent exercise method that was originally a national treasure but has gradually declined - wrestling.

Wrestling was Originally Called Jiaodi

Wrestling was originally called Jiaodi, or Shoubo and Sumo, and is also known as Shuai Jiao. It was first discovered in our country during the time of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. At that time, emperors and aristocrats liked this Jiaodi play. Until the end of the Qing Dynasty, this skill was most common. Soldiers of the Eight Banners, especially Mongols, were good at this skill. European and American countries also have wrestling, but it is different from Chinese wrestling, which emphasizes skill. Japanese judo seems to be similar to Chinese wrestling, but its skill seems to be not as profound as Chinese wrestling. Chinese wrestling takes the essence of various boxing techniques. As the saying goes, "Three years of boxing is not as good as one year of wrestling." This means that learning boxing for three years is not as good as learning wrestling for one year. The ingenuity of our boxing techniques is well known. And wrestling is the gathering of the elite of boxing techniques, its depth of skill can be imagined.

Thinking Can be Agile

Wrestling not only gives you a strong physique and broad muscles; it also trains you to be quick in action and agile in thinking, because when two people are wrestling, everyone wants to use skill to control the opponent. Thus, quick actions are produced, and thinking can also be sharpened by this. If you can practice wrestling for a long time, your attitude will also become calm, and your mind will become stable. If you want to compare wrestling to anything, then attacking is like a tiger, defending is like a mountain; being still is like a virgin, moving is like a fleeing rabbit. This sentence could not be more appropriate.

Internal Organs Can Also Be Strengthened

In addition to exercising muscles and bones, wrestling can also strengthen internal organs. The so-called "internal training of breath, external training of muscles, bones, and skin." When practicing wrestling, moving forward, backward, left, right, upward, and downward, combining rigidity and softness, and taking care of all aspects. Therefore, it is a full-body exercise, not a partial exercise. As for practical use, in addition to strengthening the body, it can also be used to defend against enemies. Therefore, wrestling is an excellent sport.

Wrestling Class Has Been Organized

Unfortunately, this skill has almost been lost. Although there are also three or five venues in Shanghai that teach this skill, most are simple and crude. Moreover, most of the people who participate in the practice lack moral cultivation, so wrestling cannot be properly passed down, which is a pity. Now, enlightened people in the Youth Association, in view of this, have organized a wrestling class, and have specially hired the famous wrestling expert Mr. Tong Zhongyi as an advisor, and have also asked the author to join in and serve as a coach. Mr. Tong is a senior wrestling expert and can be called a master. Although he is over sixty years old, he is energetic and his bravery has not diminished over the years. According to Mr. Tong, this is the result of his decades of wrestling practice. From this, it can be seen that wrestling can not only strengthen the body and defend against enemies, but also can enjoy a long life. (The author also has several old friends, all over seventy years old, who are strong and healthy, and they all maintain daily exercise), this cannot be denied. As for the author, it is only through the Youth Association's opportunity to promote sports that I am promoting the wrestling movement, in order to preserve the national essence forever, and to achieve the goal of strengthening the country and strengthening the people. However, the author's own strength is limited, and I hope that people with high aspirations will promote it more, then it will be fortunate!
