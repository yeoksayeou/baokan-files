### Practicing Wartime Living

We have been at war for almost three months now. During these three months, the government has repeatedly proclaimed the principles of participation in the war and the contributions that the people should make during wartime. It has also dispatched high-ranking officials to major cities to promote the significance of participating in the war, hoping that the people will practice wartime living. In terms of propaganda, it has indeed made considerable efforts. However, if we reflect on it, how much wartime sentiment is there in the daily lives of most citizens? How much wartime sentiment is expressed in social trends? It is quite regrettable that, according to the current situation, not only can we not talk about "wartime sentiment," but the lifestyle of most people is even more dissolute and extravagant than usual. Taking Shanghai as an example, since the start of the war, the business records of dance halls, gambling houses, entertainment venues, restaurants, and other so-called dens of dissipation have undoubtedly exceeded pre-war levels. Who would believe that their country is cooperating with the Allied nations to fight the enemy given this phenomenon?

When any country in the world goes to war, it invariably changes its lifestyle. This is because the government has effective control, and the people must absolutely obey. Even in enemy countries like Britain and the United States, which pride themselves on material enjoyment, wartime living has undergone drastic changes. For example, in various parts of the United States, since October 9th of last year, meat has not been eaten every Tuesday. In New York, in particular, meat must not be eaten twice a week. In Britain, various foods are distributed by rationing, and the quantity is reduced again and again. In the largest hotels, each meal must not exceed five shillings. Since October of the year before last, each person has been allocated only two or three eggs per month. In the Soviet Union, the supply of food is even more different than before the war. As for the national life of Germany, Italy, and Japan, they are even more austere and enduring. Looking back at us, we are also living in wartime, but there is such a difference. Can we not be ashamed?

"Wartime sentiment should be expressed in daily life." Today, we once again issue a special warning to some of our compatriots. On the one hand, we hope that government authorities at all levels will pay attention to this reality. Simply leading the shouting of slogans and issuing slogans is counterproductive to participating in the war and will not help.

In order to speed up the implementation of wartime living, we hope that the Shanghai municipal authorities and the concession authorities will quickly plan and supervise policies. Here are some suggestions that can and must be done:

(1) Make every effort to reduce banquets and social events. If necessary, control the quality and quantity. Abolish the aristocratic shark fin in banquets, and limit the cost of each table to no more than three or four hundred yuan. It is best to cancel the additional consumption of tobacco and alcohol, otherwise it should not exceed one-third of the cost of the meal.

(2) Drama and film, while indispensable in the context of legitimate entertainment, should be enjoyed by the public, not just for the appreciation of a part of the propertied and leisurely class. Therefore, ticket prices should be popular and reduced as much as possible. Currently, the ticket price of theaters is as high as thirty yuan, which is too far from the meaning of popularization. Dance halls and gambling houses are not within the scope of legitimate entertainment and should be absolutely banned.

(3) High-end cosmetics, luxury goods, and precious fabrics should be subject to heavy taxes.

The above are just some of the observations at the moment. Of course, there are many more things that need to be rectified. We believe that every wartime citizen should sympathize with this proposal. For those involved in this type of industry, although they may temporarily lose their livelihood or suffer from unemployment, we hope that the authorities and all sectors of society will provide relief. On the one hand, they should understand the meaning of wartime living and find other ways out.

In short, a country at war without wartime sentiment is something that the government and the people should be ashamed of. To speak highly of participating in the war without any wartime sentiment is self-deception and even more shameful. Furthermore, how can we, in the rear, live such a dissolute and extravagant life, and be worthy of the Allied soldiers fighting on the front lines, and the vast majority of compatriots suffering from the pressure of high prices?

### Welcoming the Japanese Cultural Delegation to Shanghai

The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association held a national congress in Beijing, and Japan specially dispatched a cultural delegation to participate. We have written articles to pay tribute and express our sincere expectations. Now that the members of the delegation are passing through Shanghai on their way back to their country, we take this opportunity to express our warm welcome and offer the following views:

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Sino-Japanese relations have begun to change rapidly. Especially since the beginning of this year, Japan has begun to implement a new policy toward China, which has led the Chinese people to change their feelings toward Japan. The Sino-Japanese cultural circles, which have been isolated and separated for decades, have also begun a new period of cordial handshakes, and the light of common belief has already shone between the two sides. We firmly believe that both the delegation members who have come from afar and our Chinese welcomers will deeply feel the heartfelt joy and the brightness of the future of Sino-Japanese culture.

However, it cannot be denied that due to the evolution of political relations between China and Japan over the past fifty years, the separation of the two sides' views, and the interference of Anglo-American capitalist culture, not only does the psychology of the people still retain regrettable traces, but the lack of understanding between intellectuals on both sides has not been completely eliminated. Mr. Toyosuke Yoshida is right: If Japan is defeated, then this is not just Japan's defeat, but the defeat of the entire Asia. This principle is deeply known to Chinese intellectuals in the arduous anti-imperialist struggle of national revolution. However, they are now not only unable to actively cooperate with Japan, but some are directly fighting against Japan. The Chinese intellectuals who are now self-conscious are troubled by this dilemma. After Japan's policy change, the new cultural policy toward China must first solve this trouble of the Chinese intellectuals and resolutely give them the ideological line they seek. (Shenbao Monthly, Reissue No. 3) We believe that what Mr. Yoshida hopes for is more effective through the efforts of the Japanese cultural circles than to say that it is the responsibility of the Japanese authorities. What the Chinese intellectuals and the millions of people behind them are paying attention to today is not the theory of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but whether Japan understands the spirit of China's national independence and liberation, and the sincerity and extent of practice of this understanding. As Mr. Yoshida said: "It is not just verbal sincerity, but showing the Chinese intellectual class that Japan truly understands its national spirit through practice. There is no other good strategy to get the Chinese intellectual class, and then the Chinese people, to nod." We hope that the members of the delegation will gain more opinions from Chinese folk intellectuals and young people on Sino-Japanese culture during their stay in our country, understand the accumulation in their hearts, and then bring them back to Japan as the basis for Sino-Japanese cultural cooperation today. We firmly believe that only in this way can we truly promote Sino-Japanese culture and promote East Asian culture, and lay the foundation for the eternal cooperation of the two great nations of China and Japan.

At the same time, we hope that the cultural circles in Shanghai, when warmly sending off the members of the delegation, will, in addition to banquets and cordial talks, state more about the current truth of Chinese culture and the cultural circles and their urgent demands, provide more of the public's will, and offer more suggestions on the future cultural work of the Japanese cultural circles in China. In this extraordinary era, only by everyone expressing their sincerity, and not being afraid to face reality, humbly and earnestly cooperating with each other, can we solve all current problems, and truly help Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and the promotion of East Asian culture. Shanghai is the center of Chinese culture. We hope that the Japanese cultural delegation members will stay for a few more days, so that the members' trip to China can obtain more abundant information, and also make the future of the culture of the two great nations of China and Japan achieve more satisfactory results.

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) Those who accompanied the special envoy to Japan, Chen Gongbo, with the qualifications of Chang, include Sun Lifu, Shen Guanzhun, Huang Pusheng, and Lin Ji. The brief resumes of the four attendants are noted below: (Sun Lifu) Currently the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 41 years old this year, from Tianjin.

After returning to the capital, he served as a secretary of the Ministry of Propaganda, and then his current position. He has translated "Complete Japanese Translation of the Theory of Peace."

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) After the National Government participated in the war, the friendly nation of Japan, in order to assist our country in completing independence and freedom, successively returned the exclusive concessions in various places, the Beijing Legation Area, and abolished extraterritoriality and restrictions on the movement of materials. Therefore, the National Government expressed its gratitude to Japan and strengthened it, and referred to the recovery and construction of Manchukuo during the war, so that the relationship between China, Japan, and Manchuria would be further strengthened and closely cooperated. A clear order was issued a few days ago appointing Chen Gongbo, President of the Legislative Yuan, as a special envoy to Japan, and Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance. It is learned that Special Envoy Chen flew to Japan at 10:30 a.m. on the 6th. Those who went to the scene to see him off included Ambassador Cai to Japan, Vice President, Lin Garrison Commander Deng, Director-General Zhou of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and all members of the Legislative Yuan, with enthusiastic emotions.

Fukuoka, 6th (Central News Agency) Special Envoy to Japan Chen Gongbo and his entourage arrived here by plane at 47 minutes past noon this month.

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) Special Envoy Chen's visit to Japan this time is the first time the National Government has sent an ambassador to visit a friendly country after participating in the war. Chen's trip will not only express our country's gratitude and strengthen the relationship with the friendly country, but also express our country's determination to participate in the war to the ruling and opposition parties of the friendly country. There is a close relationship between China and Japan, and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War has formed a situation of shared survival. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, government officials of China and Japan have visited each other many times. In May of last year, Foreign Minister Chu's visit to Japan, and in September, the three special envoys of Japan, Hiruma, Arida, and Nagai, came to China for a return visit. At the end of December, the Chairman himself visited Japan again. In February of this year, Prime Minister Tojo's visit not only increased the friendly relations between China and Japan, but also helped the progress of the current situation due to many talks. It is believed that Chen's visit to Japan this time will be even more rewarding. Not only will the relationship between China and Japan become closer and more harmonious, but the total strength of the East Asian axis will also be strengthened, which will help the completion of the Greater East Asia War. China has been participating in the war for three months, and is actively seeking the establishment of a wartime system in the political, military, economic, and cultural aspects. Japan is an advanced country and the leader of the East Asian national liberation war, and has achieved great results in this war. The various wartime organizations and institutions in the country are worthy of being learned by the backward countries in East Asia. Special Envoy Chen's visit to Japan this time will enable our country to learn from the wartime system and become more complete, so as to exert the total strength of the country and make a greater contribution to the East Asian national liberation war. Therefore, Special Envoy Chen's trip has great significance.

Dr. Shioya Answers Reporters' Questions

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) After the closing of the Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, most of the representatives from various regions have returned to their original places. The Japanese delegation, led by Chief Shioya and 14 others, is also scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 6th and then return to their country. The reporter, taking advantage of the fact that the Japanese representatives are all famous professors in Japan, and most of them are authorities in the economic and cultural circles, paid a visit to Dr. Onsen Shioya, the head of the delegation, at 7:00 PM on the 5th to ask for his opinions on Sino-Japanese cultural matters. Although the doctor is in his seventies, he is energetic and has a gentle attitude. His answers to the reporter's questions were extremely sincere. The following is a summary of the questions and answers:

Q: When is Dr. Shioya planning to return to your country? A: I am scheduled to go to Shanghai tomorrow. After a short stay, I will take a boat back to Japan.

Q: Is this your first time in Nanjing? What are your impressions? A: I have been to Nanjing three times, but this is my first time after the Incident. I have many personal impressions. Before the Incident, what I saw in Nanjing were mostly historical sites, just like going to the Roman era, such as the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, Jiming Temple, and Sui Garden, which are only for reminiscing. This time is very different from the past. There is a fresh atmosphere. Various constructions also symbolize the future of the new China. This is just like the different situations before and after Prime Minister Mussolini came to power in Italy. I can't help but congratulate the future of China.

Q: I heard that Dr. Shioya has said that "China and Japan are the same race, the same continent, the same script, and the same path." Can you explain this in detail?

A: I don't want to say too much. I would like to use two or three idioms and precedents to illustrate. Westerners have an idiom that blood is thicker than water. The relationship between China and Japan is like this. Geographically, the two countries are as close as lips and teeth. The relationship between China and Japan is like this. In ancient times, Japan had no characters. After the Thousand Character Classic was introduced to Japan, there were national characters, which were later changed to kana. This is the relationship of the same script. No explanation is needed to know how close it is. As for the same path, China and Japan are both countries that are established on agriculture. After the family system developed, Japan had the saying "If there is a way but no teaching, what is the way?" The earliest Chinese book to be introduced to Japan was the Analects. Confucianism also spread throughout the country. Confucianism has a nurturing relationship with the Japanese national essence. This Confucianism is also the inherent culture of China. However, the result is that Japan has become a country that is ideal for Confucius. Chairman Wang once said that a pure Three People's Principles is the inherent culture of China. I deeply believe that the Three People's Principles can not only lead to the Kingly Way, but also to the way of governing the country and pacifying the world. There are many other examples. This one example is enough to prove that the two countries are on the same path, both disciples of Confucius, which is what Chairman Wang called "East Asian compatriots and East Asian comrades."

Q: Today happens to be the day of sacrificing to Confucius. What are your thoughts?

A: I have visited Qufu 13 times and met Mr. Kong Decheng. I am still responsible for managing the Yushima Seido. I was originally scheduled to go to Shanghai today, but because it is Confucius' birthday, I changed it to tomorrow. You can imagine how I feel. Q: Dr. Shioya, you have stayed in Nanjing for more than a week. What are you most satisfied with? What are your thoughts? Please share.

A: I am a literary person and I study literature and art. Literary people must have passion and sincerity. My words and deeds come from sincerity. From my observation, what I am most satisfied with this time is that most young people have realized the extent of cooperation between the two countries and have entered into a state of sharing life and death and defeating the common enemy. It is not only necessary to use force, but also to revitalize culture. During this meeting, everyone was able to treat each other with sincerity, which is very gratifying. In addition, what I feel is that Chairman Wang is busy with all kinds of affairs and is diligent in his political affairs, which is especially moving. However, I hope that those who are responsible for assisting him can see more effort than today, because the great cause of building the country and revitalizing Asia cannot be achieved without mutual effort and cooperation.

Q: What do you hope for the Japanese living in the local area? A: I believe that the Japanese living in the local area have many opportunities to contact the people of your country. They should study more and adapt to local customs. This is also a way to promote friendship. The Japanese who have a sense of superiority should especially cherish themselves. Q: I heard that Dr. Shioya's family has been studying Chinese studies for generations and has a deep understanding of Chinese poetry. Since you are visiting China this time, you must have some good works. Can you show me one or two?

A: Yes. I remember that when Chairman Wang visited Tokyo in the old days, I presented a poem at the Imperial Hotel, which contained the line "Same race, same script, seeking old friendship, sharing life and death, forging a new alliance." I was drunk that day. This time I came to Nanjing, I have three works. One has been published in the Mainland New Daily. The other two were presented at Chairman Wang's banquet, and the other was written today to participate in the Confucius ceremony. (The original poems are below) (1) Presented at Chairman Wang's banquet: "Reunion to talk about old times facing the fragrant wine, discussing matters that can turn clouds and rain, if there is no friendship like Lin Xiangru and Lian Po, sharing life and death is empty talk." (2) Feeling inspired by participating in the Confucius Ceremony on Qingming Festival: "It is lamentable that the world situation is chaotic, the peace of East Asia depends on you, you are originally classmates of Confucius, the long-term plan for good neighborliness lies in this writing."

### Fierce Battles in Northwestern Caucasus, German-Romanian Forces Launch Fierce Counterattacks, and Prepare for Combined Sea and Air Offensive, German Forces Strengthen Positions South of Izyum

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) Last night, the German News Agency reported that the German military's successful strike east of Oryol greatly consolidated the main line of defense. On Sunday, the main battles on the Eastern Front took place in the southeastern part of the Kuban bridgehead in the northwestern Caucasus. In the past few days, German forces have completed the shortening of their lines in the area and inflicted heavy damage on Soviet forces. It is said that German-Romanian forces, in fierce counterattacks, surrounded and annihilated large Soviet forces. South of Lakes Ilmen and Laga, Soviet forces launched counterattacks against the recently improved German positions, but suffered heavy losses and were unable to continue their attacks. According to the military reporter of the United Press, the Soviet offensive against the Kuban bridgehead has greatly intensified over the weekend, and its scope has exceeded the local nature. Although there is no indication of a large-scale offensive at present, it may be its prelude. The concentration of a large number of Soviet artillery units in the lower reaches of the Kuban River and the large-scale activities of the Soviet Air Force are probably related. Soviet forces, with several divisions and a powerful tank force, launched fierce attacks on the east side of the bridgehead. Before the attack, they shelled with heavy artillery for several hours, but have not yet achieved any victory. The Romanian forces have performed well in repelling enemy offensives. If the Soviet command wants to take advantage of the relative quiet on other fronts to inflict a major blow on the German base in the western part of the Caucasus region, it is not impossible for the Soviet Black Sea Fleet to join in a combined sea and air offensive. The German defenders are prepared to deal with this development.

Stockholm, Sweden, 6th (Central News Agency) According to news from the Eastern Front, since the 4th, Soviet forces have launched a large-scale offensive in the Kuban River estuary area, centered on the eastern part of the Taman Peninsula, to the port of Novorossiysk, a vast battle line of more than 70 kilometers, where the two armies engaged in fierce battles overnight. In particular, the tank battles between the two armies were even more fierce in the area directly connecting the central oil field of the Taman Peninsula. As of noon on the 5th, the German and Romanian forces were still holding their original defensive positions. The Soviet offensive was unsuccessful and suffered heavy losses, losing 23 tanks. There were no changes on other fronts. It was only reported that German forces south of Izyum are currently strengthening their positions. Soviet newspapers have recently published articles warning the people that the German forces' full-scale offensive is approaching, and they hope that the front and rear will strengthen their defenses. The Associated Press Moscow correspondent also reported on the 5th that the German forces on the Southern Front have completely secured all strategic points and have grasped the railway network, so they can launch a large-scale offensive at any time in all southeastern directions, and occupy an extremely advantageous position, and expressed pessimism about the trend of the war situation.

### Axis Forces Re-deployed, Major Battle in North Africa to Restart, British Tank Units Also Transferred to Front, Plan to Launch Offensive Jointly with US Forces

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) According to the military special correspondent of the United Press, General Montgomery has moved his tank forces further forward to the front line, and his artillery units have also begun test firing to explore the range of the German and Italian defensive fortresses in front. It can be seen that the British army will soon attack Marshal Rommel's position. The British attack will generally begin when the US forces under Patton are also ready to take large-scale action. The anti-Axis command obviously attaches great importance to coordinating the cooperation between the British Eighth Army and the US Fifth Army. The US military had only unimportant activities on the weekend, attempting to partially improve its position, but was easily repelled by the Axis forces. In the early stages of the Tunisian War, the US military suffered particularly heavy tank losses, so the US Fifth Army may still be very short of this important offensive weapon. Before obtaining sufficient supplies, General Patton may not be able to launch a new large-scale attack. Therefore, how long the current hesitant state of the US military will last depends entirely on whether the anti-Axis supply lines are used quickly. The British forces under General Anderson in northern Tunisia, assisted by French rebels, have made progress, but this is only because the area is located west of the new position defended by the Axis forces after withdrawing from the Jebel Abiot area according to plan. Due to the ingenuity of the German-Italian rearguard strategy, the British army was able to approach the main new line of the Axis forces after several days of battle. The characteristic of the situation in northern Tunisia is that the German army under General Arnim and the British army under General Anderson have not yet used the majority of their troops in battle.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) According to the German official news agency, there were only local wars in southeastern Tunisia on Sunday. US tanks under General Patton advanced eastward on the road from Gafsa to Gabès and southeast of Maknassy, but were repelled by the Axis forces. The situation in northern Tunisia was also quite quiet. British troops are still scouting and probing in front of the Axis positions on the mountains east of Sédjénane, but all have been repelled by the Axis vanguards. US tank forces advanced from the area east of Gafsa towards the road to Gabès, but the Axis forces responded with a superior force. After losing three tanks, the US forces quickly retreated. Southeast of Maknassy, the US military once again attempted to capture the Axis positions on the small mountain. It was quite successful at first, but then the Axis forces launched a fierce counterattack, repelling the US forces to their original positions and seizing several motorized artillery pieces, many infantry light weapons, and two reconnaissance vehicles. According to a Reuters correspondent with the US military in central Tunisia, there is a fierce battle near Kebili, where German forces continue to fiercely resist the right flank of General Patton's forces. Fifteen German dive bombers bombed the US artillery units east of El Guettar this morning. Algiers Radio also said that the German counterattack was particularly fierce east of El Guettar. The Axis command has redeployed its troops further east, and serious battles will occur soon.

### France, Belgium, and the Netherlands Suffer Tragic Bombing, Many Civilian Casualties

Paris, 6th (Central News Agency) The French Ministry of Interior announced that the death toll from the American bombing of Paris on Sunday afternoon is likely to increase significantly. Fifty-nine of the large number of injured people admitted to hospitals have died. According to previous reports, the air raid killed a total of 200 people and injured 500. According to official announcements, Boulogne-Billancourt was the hardest hit by the bombing. American planes dropped a total of 55 bombs, destroying 29 houses completely and severely damaging another 63. The residential area of Suresnes was hit by four bombs. In addition, the Farman factory and the Coty cosmetics factory were also destroyed. Locals believe that the American bombing of the Coty factory proves that it was not targeting military facilities.

Paris, 6th (Central News Agency) According to the Stéphani Agency, on Sunday afternoon, the British and American air raids on Paris not only bombed the Longchamp Racecourse and the Boulogne-Billancourt Sports Ground, but also bombed two venues where sports games were in progress. In addition, one sports ground where a charity football match was being held was also among those attacked.

### French Government Announces Today as National Day of Mourning

Paris, 6th (Central News Agency) The French government announced today that April 7 will be a national day of mourning. On this day, a state funeral will be held for those who died in the British and American air raids on the French capital. Entertainment venues will be closed to express mourning.

Moscow, 5th (Central News Agency) Lieutenant General Maltier, the new head of the British military mission to the Soviet Union, arrived in Moscow today.

### Detailed Account of the Japanese Army's Attack on the India-Burma Border, Contact Line Between Chongqing and the UK Severed

(Special Telegram from Sunbrapum, Burma, 28th, Yamamoto Special Correspondent) The Japanese army occupied the key street of Sunbrapum on the northern border of Burma and India on the night of March 11. This place is located 135 miles north of Myitkyina and is the Bo River point along the main stream of the Irrawaddy River. The jungle is dense, wild animals roar, and behind the mountain, the Kachin tribe lives. "Brapum" means "mountain" in the local language. From the top of the mountain to the mountainside, bamboo-roofed earthen houses are scattered among them. On the top of the mountain, there are also European-style bungalows for the British to use for hunting and traveling. During the enemy's agitation, the British and American commanders used air transport from India to supply food and supplies to this place, which was the base on the front line. The fall of this place completely cut off the attempt to contact the Chongqing army in Yunnan, and had a great impact on the British and Chongqing armies.

(Same place, 29th, Yamamoto Special Correspondent) After the elite Japanese army annihilated the British army that was agitating in the jungle area on the northern border of Burma and India, they finally completely occupied Sunbrapum on the night of the 11th, blocking the enemy's attempt to connect the Chongqing and British armies, and completely shattering the illusion of a counterattack on Burma. The officers and soldiers of each unit traveled along the Irrawaddy River, in the dense jungle area, climbing mountains and crossing dangers under the attack of enemy planes, fighting hard for a month and a half, and their hardships cannot be described in words.

This attack lasted for a month and a half, and the action was limited to the night. In order to avoid the surveillance of Japanese and enemy fighters, from the early morning mist until the dark dusk, they hid in the jungle, using painting as the night, and took a temporary nap. The action started in the evening. The three meals a day were limited to 9:00 PM, 2:00 AM, and 8:00 AM - at this time in Burma, the sky was not yet bright. Therefore, the soldiers, due to habit, all had the night vision of civets and owls. When they started attacking along the broken cliff road on the Irrawaddy River, which was only one meter wide, they only groped in the dark with their hands, and loaded vehicles and horses were often in danger of falling.

The roars of tigers, leopards, and other beasts were the accompanying music that could be heard from time to time. The reason why this team's nighttime attack was easy to march was due to the hard work of the advance reconnaissance team.

This advance team held mountain knives with the Burmese natives in the deep mountains, cutting thorns and opening paths in the jungle mud path, and building bridges and repairing roads. Landmines were densely laid everywhere, and if they were stepped on carelessly, they would explode with a bang. There were also tethered landmines that were triggered by pedestrians; loaded vehicles and horses, everywhere, and it was impossible to guard against them. The removal of these obstacles was also the hard work of the working team. Use a wooden rolling machine. Model Chen was in a row, and the ox was used to pull it. This cattle unit was a clever way to remove landmines. Sometimes the work of this advance working team changed drastically. Usually in the dry season, rain is rarely seen, but in northern Burma, after the thick morning fog, there is a sudden rain, and the road becomes muddy. Where the landmine exploded, a large gap was opened, and no matter how much soil was filled, it was difficult to level it immediately. They can only cut wood from the jungle instead of stone to fill the gap, so that vehicles and horses can pass.

The most annoying thing in jungle warfare is the sneak attack of mountain leeches above and mountain lice below. Mountain leeches are as small as Ren Dan grains, and often sneak in without being noticed, sucking blood. Although they do not feel pain or itching, the bitten area is as red and swollen as a small finger. Mountain lice are as small as Austrian worms and can sting the hands and feet like a bee sting, which is very painful.

Crossing 100 miles of Myitkyina, from the Irrawaddy River to the foot of the Kumon Mountains, the supply of food and fodder is extremely difficult. In addition to the porridge in the courtyard, they only rely on the pith of the papaya tree and banana tree trunk to fill their hunger. However, the soldiers all endured it as before, marching hard, approaching the northern India border connecting Yunnan and India, crushing the ambitions of the Chongqing and British armies, and completely occupying its important point, Sunbrapum. The great achievements of the Kojima unit and other units will forever occupy a glorious page in the history of the Greater East Asia War.

(Special Telegram from Taiping Street, Yunnan Front, 29th, Special Correspondent Zekai) The Japanese Yunnan Expeditionary Force swept away the enemy from the Gaoligong Mountains to the other side of the Nu River and around Tengyue, blocking the contact between the Chongqing and British armies. Furthermore, it advanced westward from Tengyue to the Burmese border to carry out a sweeping war.

The main force of a certain unit that departed from Tengyue on March 7 advanced along the south road, advanced into Yacheng on the 9th, and arrived at Taiping Street via Zhan Da on the 11th. A unit even set out to a certain place near the border on the same night, smashing the enemies in various places. A unit departed from Gan'ai, separated from the main force, and annihilated hundreds of the remnant enemies commanded by General Ming near Dazhai. Arrived at Taiping Street on the 12th. This expedition caused the former ambiguous local divisions in Nandian, Zhan Da, and Gan'ai to cut off contact with Chongqing and pledge allegiance to the Japanese army.

The Tusi is a land management agency among the Thai people living in the western region of Yunnan Province. The land in this area is generally managed by the Tusi Yamen, and then distributed and entrusted to the local chieftains of each village by the Tusi Yamen. The people only have the right to use the land but no right to buy and sell it. It is a general manager of a land public ownership system. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Daily News on March 31)

### The Soul of the Japanese Navy

The heroic achievements of the Second Special Attack Force have been officially announced by the Ministry of the Navy, and the entire nation is deeply moved. Tatsuo Kawai, the then Japanese ambassador to Australia, was escorted by an exchange ship to return the remains of the four heroes who raided Sydney. At the time of the announcement of the incident, he sent a talk to the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun.

-- Former Ambassador to Australia, Tatsuo Kawai

From the start of the war until I returned to my country on an exchange ship last summer, I was confined to the ambassador's residence in Melbourne for eight months. During this period, the 20 employees of the embassy were not allowed to take a step beyond the threshold. Initially, because the Australian government prohibited newspapers from being delivered, I could not know the situation outside. Later, after negotiations, it was allowed. Then, on June 1 of last year, we were suddenly shocked by a piece of news in the newspaper. The newspaper said:

On May 31, a small Japanese submarine sneaked into the mouth of Sydney Bay and fired a torpedo at a warship belonging to our navy, and was sunk.

Is this true? We held our breath, our nerves felt paralyzed, we tightly grasped the newspaper, and hot tears fell down. At that time, in that kind of place, who could have imagined that Japanese naval warriors would actually sneak into the throat of the enemy capital south of the Solomon Islands! This attack by the invincible Japanese naval soul shocked the seven million people of Australia and its entire territory of three million square miles. The kind of surprise and shock that swept the country was witnessed by my own eyes.

Australian Naval Funeral

After five or six days, the Australian government notified me through the Swiss consul general, who was the protecting power of Japanese interests:

"The four Japanese soldiers who died in battle will be buried with naval honors, and then cremated."

I immediately agreed. He also said:

"When the funeral is held, in view of the current relationship between Japan and Australia, the Japanese ambassador cannot attend, but he can present a wreath."

### A Record of the Sneak Attack on Sydney: The Second Special Attack Unit Submarine Displaying Power

I left everything to the Swiss Consul-General to handle. The funeral for the four brave warriors was held on June 9th, with Rear Admiral Muirhead-Gould, Commander of the Sydney Naval District, as the chief officiant. The Swiss Consul-General represented Japan and attended, and it was extremely solemn. Afterwards, the Swiss Consul-General told me about the situation very clearly.

The remains of the four brave warriors, covered with the Rising Sun flag, were placed in four coffins and carried to the burial ground by sailors. A company of sailors, dragging their rifles and with heads bowed, solemnly lined up to escort the funeral procession. After three memorial shots were fired, the remains were cremated to the sound of military music.

It wasn't until August 13th, when the exchange was about to depart, that the remains of the four brave warriors, which had been placed in a church in Sydney, were handed over to me. The embassy staff hastily made four shrines and reverently placed the spirits inside. In the courtyard of the official residence, a fragrant branch of the Phoebe zhennan tree was broken off to serve as a substitute for the Eurya japonica. Everything was done in a hurry, just to express our heartfelt sentiments. The scene at that time! It is forever engraved on our hearts and will never be forgotten.

The Families of the Brave Warriors

On the exchange ship from Melbourne to Lourenço Marques, it was so crowded that there was no place to put the spirits. During the four-week voyage, the four shrines were placed in my room. Gazing upon them morning and evening, I was filled with grief and longing as I recalled the heroic deeds of the four brave warriors. When the Kamakura Maru arrived in Yokohama, I met the bereaved families of the brave warriors. The parents of Petty Officer Masao Totsuka immediately asked me:

"Were all the bullets he took with him fired?"

The beloved daughter-in-law of these parents, after seeing the remains of Petty Officer Masao Totsuka, did not grieve excessively. Fearing that she would commit suicide and follow her husband to the afterlife, they rushed from the countryside to her residence and asked her, "Do you have to die in this war?" She replied, "Yes, sooner or later, I will die." "Then your mother will stop thinking about finding you another husband." The two held the daughter-in-law who had lost her husband and slept together for one night.

"Loyalty and Courage" Moved the Enemy Country

The two older brothers of Ensign Takeshi Omori said:

"Takeshi was our youngest brother. Our mother died when he was two years old, and he was raised by a stepmother. Our father, when working in the fields, would also bring him along. He gradually grew up. When we brothers were together, we all said we wanted to be filial to our father. Now Takeshi is the most filial."

In encountering the attitude and words of the families of the fallen heroes, I understood the reason why the Australian government held a naval funeral. It turned out that their heroic deeds of loyalty and courage to their country had deeply moved everyone's hearts. Like father, like son; like elder brother, like younger brother. These Japanese fathers and mothers produced the war gods who attacked Pearl Harbor and also produced the brave warriors of the Cowra, HMAS Stalwart, and Sydney special attack units.

An Enemy Commander Praised

Under the Southern Cross, they went on an expedition across the ocean, with the ambition of using their horse hides as shrouds and seeking to fulfill the will of their motherland. The heroic souls of these four brave warriors stirred the hearts of the entire Australian people. They will study the reason why the colored race of Japan is so strong. Australia, which considers itself the 49th state of the United States, buried these four brave warriors with naval honors. Rear Admiral Muirhead-Gould, Commander of the Sydney Naval District, even said in a broadcast:

"Japanese soldiers came to attack in iron coffins. They had no hope of returning alive. How many Australians have even a fraction of the courage to sacrifice themselves for their country that these brave warriors possess?"

Sincerity Moves Heaven

Sincerity can move heaven. The four brave warriors silently and without words, fulfilled their duties, and also moved the Australian enemies who did not speak the same language. Chinese sages said:

He who practices benevolence establishes his will, acting before speaking.

Beyond a thousand miles, all are brothers.

The Tang Dynasty people, skilled in lengthy orations and broad debates, already praised actions without words. Originally, Japan can be said to be a country that does not emphasize words. The self-sacrifice of these special attack unit warriors is a concrete manifestation of the Japanese five-foot body. When recalling these noble heroic souls, there will surely be many who commemorate them not only with words but also with deeds, not just me alone.

### Second Batch of 500 Tons of Cooking Oil to Be Sold Soon: Expected to Be Implemented Around Mid-Month; Sales Method Remains Unchanged

Since the widespread sale of retail cooking oil began in this city a few days ago, the situation has been extremely good. According to a Central News Agency reporter, after the widespread sale of this batch of cooking oil is completed, the city's cooking oil wholesale office has secured another 500 tons of cooking oil, which is expected to be available for sale around the middle of this month. The sales method remains unchanged: the concessions will still use housing tax receipts, while the city area will use household registration certificates and residence permits. The amount of oil sold per person, regardless of whether it is in the concessions or the city area, is still set at four ounces.

Purchase Oil with Certificates; Refusal Is Not Allowed

The first batch of oil purchases with housing tax receipts from the cooking oil wholesale office has already begun, with 367 retail oil shops throughout the city selling simultaneously. It is understood that the distribution of this batch of oil to retail oil shops is based on the population of each district and Baojia, and the amount of oil received by each oil shop is a fixed amount. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason for it to be sold out. Citizens can go to the designated oil shops within the stipulated time, with their housing tax receipts and household registration certificates, citizen certificates, etc., to purchase the oil they are entitled to. Each shop must absolutely not refuse to sell without reason. If any of the above situations occur, citizens can report it to the wholesale office or the police authorities for investigation and handling, and their distribution rights will be suspended.

(2) Type B retailers should also, within the above-mentioned deadline, bring their application receipt to the office to exchange for a sugar purchase certificate. Payment should be cleared. Failure to exchange the certificate by the deadline, or failure to pay by the deadline after receiving the sugar purchase certificate, will be regarded as a voluntary abandonment, and no further allocation will be made.

### The Xinzha Baojia District Inspects Air Raid Lamps

The Xinzha Baojia District Committee recently, due to the continuous rainy days, is deeply concerned that the air raid lamps previously installed at important intersections and in the lanes may be damaged by moisture. Once an air raid begins, it may cause problems. For precautionary purposes, the committee has notified all Lianbao to promptly inspect the lamps and report the names and addresses of the responsible persons (caretakers) to the District Committee for record. In addition, since the liaison officers of each Bao during previous air raids used flags as identification and did not have fixed armbands, which caused obstacles to their work, a special liaison officer armband has been made and distributed to each Bao, two for each Bao, to be distributed to the liaison officers for wearing during air raids. Each Bao is also notified that all air raid personnel, such as the fire brigade, ambulance team, shelter team, guidance team, and reserve team, must be prepared.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Prevents Autumn Flooding: Plans to Connect the City's Drains; Large-Scale Project to Be Completed Within the Year

According to a source at the Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council to the Times reporter, the Works Department of the Municipal Council, in order to prevent the flooding that is often encountered every autumn, which causes backflow into low-lying roads and the formation of water channels, is actively manufacturing 4,000 feet of culverts (drains). Most of them have already been made.

Five Tide Gates Have Been Built

The Municipal Council's flood prevention plan, the scope of which is connected to the culverts, is from the intersection of Dahua Road and Edinburgh Road, via Metcalfe Road, to MacKay Road and the Suzhou Creek. All other large-scale flood prevention projects have also been launched. Among them, the most noteworthy is the construction of five tide gates to automatically prevent flooding. A sixth tide gate will also be built in the near future, but it must wait for the drains to be connected so that the tide can flow into the Suzhou Creek from MacKay Road.

Flood Prevention Plan Covers the Entire City

The flood prevention plan is implemented throughout the city, but except for the above-mentioned areas, the connection of drains in other areas has not yet been completed. As for the higher-lying areas, the drains are not intended to be connected. It is also learned that the Works Department has this plan, which was initially conceived in view of the large-scale autumn floods in 1940 and the influx of tides. The goal is the Suzhou Creek and the Huangpu River. In the event of an accident, the public concession drains will be connected to the western district of Shanghai. Regarding this large-scale flood prevention project, the source said that it can be completed within this year.

### Waterproofing Committee of the Municipal Works Bureau Dredges the Various Creeks in Western Shanghai; Sets a Deadline for the Demolition of Shantytowns Along the Creeks; Establishes Shelters to Handle the Aftermath

The Waterproofing Committee of the Municipal Works Bureau has determined that the areas along the Fahua Creek, Zhuan Creek, Yong'an Creek, Xiaohe Creek, Zhupu River, Zhuyuan Creek, and No. 14 Creek in western Shanghai are not only detrimental to hygiene due to years of siltation in the creek flows, but also prone to flooding as the mold and plum rain season is approaching. Therefore, the Works Group of the committee is finding ways to dredge and prevent flooding and has decided to order the demolition of houses built along the creeks within a set deadline. It is estimated that there are about 500 households in the shantytowns along the various creeks. The houses are divided into three types: grass sheds, wooden bungalows, and wooden buildings. They are all temporary shelters built by refugees after the incident. The issue of the aftermath of these shantytowns has been assigned by the Waterproofing Committee to find the Zhongshan Road Civilian Village, which is under the management of the former Social Affairs Bureau, as a temporary shelter. Detailed plans and estimates for compensation for the demolition of houses are being prepared and submitted to the authorities for approval.

### The Political Work Corps of the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch Goes to Various Districts to Work

In addition to the first sub-corps, which has already departed to work in the Nanhui, Fengxian, and Beiqiao districts, the second, third, and fourth sub-corps will also depart in the near future to work in the Chongming, Jiading, and Baoshan districts, which are the second phase Qingxiang areas. The fifth sub-corps is responsible for mobile theatrical propaganda work and is currently rehearsing. It will also be able to depart for propaganda around the 10th of this month.

### The Words of the Three Japanese Cultural Envoys

Taking advantage of the occasion of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to Nanjing, a national cultural representatives conference was held in Nanjing. Japan also sent three cultural envoys, Mr. Tokiyo Okushi (member of the National Spirit and Culture Research Institute), Mr. Hibiki Saito (professor at Nihon University), and Mr. Takeo Sato (professor at Waseda University), to participate in this grand event. The conference has now concluded. On the evening of the 5th, the group came to Shanghai from Nanjing and stayed at the Broadway Mansions. The envoys made the following statements:

Healthy Housing: Mr. Takeo Sato's Statement

This is my second time visiting Nanjing. The first time was in Showa 14 (Republic 28), and the impression I got this time is very different. After a short separation of three years, the progress is unexpected. The feeling it gave me is that Nanjing, in addition to its historical and political conditions, also possesses all the superior conditions. At a glance, it is the atmosphere of a capital city. The natural situation is not accidental. The Yangtze River, Purple Mountain, Xuanwu Lake, etc., are all natural dragon-coiling and tiger-squatting formations. It is the most appropriate to make it the capital of the new China. It is not as rigid as Shanghai. Some people also think that urban planning is boring, but I don't think so. China has its own tradition of composing China. We must recognize this tradition. The previous regimes also implemented urban planning, but there were too many places that were obsessed with Europeanization. To urbanize China's local cities, we must first distinguish China's unique traditions and then start anew. This is a point that is worth fully studying. Looking at the housing problem of Japanese residents, we also need to work hard to solve it. To demand the development of Japanese residents, we must have healthy housing. However, because resources cannot be obtained, it has been delayed. The housing difficulties will only tend to become more serious. The housing problem in mainland Japan has already been solved by the invention of housing corporations that produce homes for the war effort. We must also care about this point in China. It is heard that the parties involved are making every effort to promote the construction of healthy Japanese housing.

Cultural Utilization: Mr. Hibiki Saito's Statement

The new China is not active enough in culture. How to utilize culture is a problem. In practice, the work of cultural exchange can only reveal the principles through the creation of a new culture. We understand the current state of Chinese culture. After returning to mainland Japan, we are prepared to actively consult on Sino-Japanese exchange work. We will bring the most advanced cultural groups here and use high culture that stands on a global perspective to achieve real results in Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. Finally, there is one thing that makes me happy. It is that coming to China and having frank discussions with Chinese cultural figures has yielded many gains.

Completing a Member of the War: Mr. Tokiyo Okushi's Statement

This time we came to attend the National Cultural Representatives Conference hosted by the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association. It is of great significance that cultural figures from China and Japan can gather together. Japan also had more than a dozen representatives from the academic, artistic, educational, and teaching fields in attendance. All of these are epoch-making feats in Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. Although there have been cultural exchanges in the past, they only focused on the translation of publications and the dispatch of exchange students. Therefore, the cultural exchange was not fully close. However, with the outbreak of the China Incident, followed by the sudden outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, some people shouted for Sino-Japanese cultural work and carried it out in practice. We call this phenomenon "the discovery of cultural figures." At this time, we must unite the cultural circles of the two countries to promote cultural exchange.

Coming to China this time and having in-depth conversations with Chinese cultural figures, I will, after returning to my country, strive to work in the cultural field based on the teachings I have gained here, using the power of culture to become a member of completing the Greater East Asia War.

### Commander of the Japanese Dispatch Army in Shanghai, Lieutenant General Nomura, Gives a Speech

Central News Agency, Shanghai: Lieutenant General Nomura, Commander of the Japanese Dispatch Army in Shanghai, hosted a banquet at the Astor House Hotel on the evening of the 5th to entertain celebrities from this city. Takashima, President of the North China Development Company, and other leaders from this city also attended the event. At the banquet, His Excellency Nomura delivered a speech, stating that Japan is implementing a new policy towards China, with Shanghai as its center. Therefore, he urged leaders from all sectors of the city's civil administration and military to cooperate sincerely and solemnly declared that the unification of political and military aspects is helpful to the smooth completion of the Greater East Asia War. He also said that the Japanese Dispatch Army in Shanghai will henceforth only handle purely military affairs. Those related to politics, economy, and culture will gradually be separated. The establishment of the Shanghai Army Office, the creation of the East Asia Bureau, and Japan's new policy towards China are all precursors to this step. From now on, the Japanese army will only manage military affairs or everything directly related to military affairs. However, the political and economic situation in Shanghai is closely related to the war situation, so the Japanese military authorities must still care about every move in Shanghai. In the future, in terms of intelligence, it is planned to closely connect with the masses. The Japanese Army Press Department and the combat troops will be united as one to become the front and rear of the East Asia War.

### Reader's Forum: A Suggestion for Universal X-ray Examinations of Students in the Entire City

— Xu Shufan

Youth is the age when contracting lung disease is easiest. Many outstanding students die from this illness before completing their studies, which has a significant impact on the nation and its people. Therefore, prevention and treatment must be urgently addressed. Below are a few suggestions regarding "Universal X-ray Examinations of Students in the Entire City":

(1) This initiative should be rigorously implemented by the education and health authorities. The scope of the examination should be temporarily limited to high school and university students.

(2) All phthisiology (tuberculosis) doctors, hospitals, health organizations, and X-ray machines in the city should participate, providing their services on a voluntary or free basis. The responsible authorities should coordinate and allocate resources, and students from various schools should go to designated locations on specified dates for examinations. Those who pass the examination will be allowed to continue their studies at their original schools upon presenting their examination certificates. Otherwise, they should be suspended from school for treatment.

(3) Students found to have lung disease should immediately begin appropriate treatment (such as artificial pneumothorax, etc.) if the condition is severe. Those with mild conditions should first be hospitalized or rest at home for three to six months, and then treatment should be adjusted based on the situation. Patients must follow the doctor's instructions and should not make decisions on their own.

(4) Several enthusiastic doctors should be invited to guide the treatment and recuperation of patients, ensuring they are in the most favorable living conditions. This will accelerate their recovery and prevent patients from being tempted and deceived by improper medical practices, which could lead them astray.

(5) The treatment expenses for poor students should be borne by the government or subsidized by donations from all sectors of society. Students receiving scholarships or bursaries (such as the Shen Bao Reader's Bursary) who fall ill should have their medical expenses continued to be covered by the original funding organizations.

(6) Examinations should be conducted annually or every semester to prevent the constant threat of tuberculosis. Whenever possible, all faculty and staff in schools should also undergo the same examinations.

Before these recommendations are implemented, it is hoped that students from all schools (and people from all walks of life) will voluntarily go to the hospitals designated by the current Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign for free X-ray lung examinations. Those who feel they have symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, such as weight loss, fatigue, excessive coughing with phlegm, and neurasthenia, should especially avoid concealing their illness and delaying medical treatment to avoid procrastination and mistakes. It should be understood that treating tuberculosis is no longer a problem today, but early treatment is necessary. The earlier the treatment is sought, the shorter the treatment period required and the lower the treatment costs. Hiding and delaying treatment will inevitably lead to unfortunate consequences. Once we are infected with tubercle bacilli, the condition will inevitably worsen without proper rest. There is no chance of escape. Those who rely on their strong physique and resistance should take heed.

### Economic Circle

The printing factory of the Chung Hwa Book Company at 469 Macau Road, through the mediation of Wu Shutong, Yang Ziyou, and others with the Japanese side, has been released from military administration and directly returned to its owners. However, the formal transfer procedures will be determined after notification to the National Government.

The pharmaceutical industry in this city is rectifying its trade regulations, improving upon past undesirable practices and strictly eliminating practices like hoarding by non-industry entities.

### Commentary: Rice Prices and General Commodity Prices

Recently, rice prices in Shanghai have fallen sharply, and other agricultural products such as eggs and tea have also declined somewhat. As for industrial products, with the exception of soap and cigarettes, not only have they not fallen with rice prices, but they have continued to rise. As the saying goes, "Let them laugh or scold, I will be a good official in my own way." Currently, industrial daily necessities hoarders and dealers also have the "Let them laugh or scold, I will raise prices in my own way" or "Let rice prices fall sharply, industrial products will continue to rise" spirit.

"Food is the paramount necessity of the people." Therefore, in recent years, economists have advocated using rice prices as the standard for general commodity prices. They believe that "When rice prices rise, all prices rise; when rice prices fall, all prices fall." This theory was also embraced by most merchants when rice prices were rising, so they raised the prices of their goods accordingly. However, now that rice prices have fallen sharply, they have abandoned this theory like worn-out shoes and shifted to the new battleground of supply and demand, saying that there is a shortage of raw materials for industrial daily necessities, production is not strong, and demand is constant, so price increases based on the principle of demand exceeding supply are inevitable.

Merchants value profit over righteousness and are indifferent to parting, a common lament throughout history. To seek price increases, there is no shortage of excuses. Scholars' theories are merely used as a pretext for their profit-seeking and wealth accumulation. Reading history, this reporter has often wondered why ancient rulers so often adopted policies that favored agriculture over commerce. Now, I suddenly understand!

In all fairness, all the misfortunes of mankind originate from a single word: greed. Merchants value profit, which is merely an extreme form of greed. However, fortune lies in misfortune, and profit lies in harm. May merchants and general hoarders who read newspapers and commentaries be able to respect themselves, reflect on their actions, and stop taking advantage of the situation, harming others and harming themselves. The evolution of the world has no fixed rules. Today, goods are valuable and currency is light, but who knows if there will not be a day in the near future when currency is valuable and goods are light? Today's upstart may very well be tomorrow's bankrupt.

### The Ministry of Industry Established the Industry and Commerce Association Rectification Committee and Held a Meeting in Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss Organizational Issues

Shanghai Central News Agency: The Ministry of Industry's Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Associations have been promulgated, and the previous Industry and Commerce Association Law has been abolished at the same time. From now on, local industry and commerce associations will serve as wartime economic institutions with heavy responsibilities and sound organizations. To implement the Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Associations and strengthen the associations' own organizations, the Ministry of Industry has established an Industry and Commerce Association Rectification Committee. Yu Quan, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry, has been appointed as the Chairman, with Wang Jiajun, Director of the Industrial Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industry; Sun Zuji, Director of the Insurance Supervisory Bureau; Zhang Jun, Director of the Special Commodity Transportation and Marketing Administration; Chen Zhong, Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau; Xiang Xun, Director of the Commerce Bureau; Lin Wenzhong, Director of the Economic Bureau of Nanjing Special Municipality; Sun Mingqi, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau of Shanghai Special Municipality; Tu Zhigang, Director of the Economic Bureau of Shanghai Special Municipality; Shen Tong, Director of the Economic Bureau of Jiangsu Province; and Bu Yu, Director of the Economic Bureau of Zhejiang Province, as members. The first meeting was held yesterday (the 5th) at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry. In addition to all the committee members coming to Shanghai to attend, the Minister of Industry himself came to provide guidance. There was a detailed discussion on important issues such as how to classify major commodity industry associations and the organizational procedures for major commodity industry associations and federations. The meeting will last for three days and will continue today (the 7th). Detailed rectification methods will be announced after the meeting.

### Economic Inspection of North China: Advisor Ishiwatari Gives a Talk

Beijing, 6th (Central News Agency): Mr. Shotaro Ishiwatari, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, arrived here on the 4th to inspect economic matters in North and Central China under wartime conditions. This is his first trip to the north since taking office. When meeting with a group of reporters on the 5th, he specifically discussed the promotion of material exchange between North and Central China and other issues, stating:

Promoting Trade Between North and Central China

After China's entry into the war, the relationship between Allied Bank Notes and Central Reserve Bank Notes once experienced fluctuations. After the authorities' statement and explanation, the situation has stabilized, so the promotion of trade between North and Central China and the economic recovery can be rapidly advanced. Central China requires North China to transport large quantities of coal and revive industries in Shanghai and other regions, and then exchange these products for materials from the interior. The large quantities of wheat flour and other materials that North China should transport will also inevitably increase.

Material Exchange Mechanism

After China's entry into the war, the institutions for material exchange are being actively reorganized. The National Commercial Control General Association has already been established, so domestic trade can be controlled. The Economic Review Committee has also held its first meeting on the 1st of this month to determine basic policies. The financial giants in Central China have been cooperating enthusiastically, and the National Government has appointed virtuous and capable individuals as economic advisors, so the control methods can gradually become more smooth.

Price Issues

Regarding the price issue, it has become a serious problem in both North and Central China. Regarding this point, I believe that effective countermeasures must be implemented. In Central China, the price of rice once rose to over 1,700 yuan. Recently, due to measures such as the abolition of restrictions on the movement of materials, it has fallen to around 700 yuan. The price of eggs has also been halved, and the prices of other vegetables have also fallen. In the future, to achieve self-sufficiency in essential goods, it is necessary to revitalize industries in various regions, and so on.

### Registered Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Will Still Be Temporarily Suspended from Movement

Shanghai Central News Agency: The National Commercial Control General Association has received a letter from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry stating that, in accordance with the Minister's instruction, in order to thoroughly investigate speculation in cotton yarn and cotton cloth, all registered yarn and cloth will still be temporarily suspended from movement and should be inspected jointly by the Commercial Control General Association and the relevant industry associations. If unregistered stored yarn or cloth is found, the economic authorities or the Shanghai Municipal Council in the concession area should be immediately notified to detain it for investigation and handling. It is learned that after approval by the Commercial Control General Association, the registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has ended on the 3rd of this month. All cotton yarn and cotton cloth merchants are hereby notified that all registered cotton yarn and cotton cloth will still be temporarily suspended from movement.

### Determined to Eliminate Hoarding: The Authorities Will Strictly Enforce Account Audits

In order to strictly suppress prices, the Shanghai Municipal Government has decided to severely punish hoarding. At the same time, in order to prevent hoarding merchants from using bank and money shop loans in the form of mortgages to hoard goods, it has decided to audit the accounts of all banks and money shops in the city and urge the banks and money shops to collect outstanding loans from customers so that hoarders cannot circulate funds and harm the market. Therefore, even though today is the first day of trading after the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday for the banking and money shop industry, the market prices of gold and public bonds have all fallen.

### Insurance Broker Registration Extended by Two Months

Since the Insurance Supervisory Bureau implemented insurance broker registration on January 5th of this year, the deadline was originally set for today (April 5th). In the Shanghai area, more than two hundred insurance brokers have already registered. It is learned that the bureau authorities, in order to protect the interests of brokers and facilitate registration for brokers in Nanjing, Suzhou, and other inland areas, have decided to extend the registration period by two months from today until June 5th. Once registration is completed, the Insurance Broker Association can be officially established.

### Brief News

The first crop of spring cocoons is expected to appear at the end of April, so preparations for starting work are already underway. It is expected that the official start of work will be around the 20th of this month. It is estimated that this year's spring cocoons will amount to about 40,000 or 45,000 piculs (dried cocoons).

The New Asia Development Company has been increasingly successful in handling various businesses recently. In addition to investing in various production enterprises, it is also collecting funds for the capital increase of Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, New Asia Science Company, New Asia Village Company, and Jiufeng Enamel Steel Factory, paying dividends for Hong Kong New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, and repaying funds for New Asia Health Company. From April 1st, office hours will be extended to eight hours.

Renfeng Machinery Dyeing Factory is a well-known bleaching and finishing factory with complete domestic equipment. Its total assets are valued at 34,425,442 yuan. Recently, the shareholders' meeting resolved to increase capital. The 20 million yuan of new shares being increased are now being underwritten and fully subscribed by New Asia Development Company. The factory is currently actively producing various poplins, serges, straight satin, linen gauze crepe, etc., and is also acting as an agent for bleaching, dyeing, finishing, decoration, etc., working day and night to meet market demand.

### A Farm Implement Manufacturing Plant to Be Established in Jiaxing

Policies to enhance production have been initiated by relevant authorities and various civil groups. The Wuxi Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant, established last time, has been operating smoothly since its opening. It has contributed greatly to improving Chinese agricultural machinery and increasing agricultural efficiency. Therefore, all parties have paid attention to the plant. It is heard that the plant is currently designing to establish an agricultural machinery manufacturing plant in Jiaxing.

In the past, the loans granted by Huaxing Bank in that area were mainly for consumption (funds for moving materials in and out). However, since this spring, loans for the legitimate needs of purchasing seeds, fertilizers, draught cattle, or irrigation equipment have increased. Naturally, there is also a need to establish a farm implement manufacturing plant in Jiaxing. (Continental Daily News, April 6)

### Observations on the National Commercial Control General Association (I)

— Jian Yan

The National Commercial Control General Association was established on the 15th of this month. The material control led by friendly nations over the years will be officially handed over to the Commercial Control General Association from then on. This shows that the friendly nations authorities are truly determined to cooperate with our civil sector. It is especially gratifying that the persons in charge of this Commercial Control General Association are mostly well-known figures in finance and industry. Therefore, in the future, they will be able to achieve the goal of coordinating supply and demand and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Now, from a third-party standpoint, based on my daily experience with the industrial and commercial sectors, I would like to offer some opinions on the Commercial Control General Association:

(1) The Importance of Investigation Work: According to economic control, it is important to implement thoroughly. However, to implement thoroughly, a strict investigation organization is essential. If the investigation is not strict, the implementation cannot be thorough. If the implementation is not thorough, black markets, black black markets, etc., can occur at any time, and the original intention of the control will be completely lost. Now, let's take the customs as an example. In the past, the reason why customs revenue was higher than lijin tax and other various taxes was due to the advantages of its simple tax rate and appropriate methods. However, it was also due to the seriousness of its field work and anti-smuggling work. Therefore, although its tax rate has increased year by year (sometimes reaching more than 100% ad valorem), its tax revenue has still continued to increase, which proves the effectiveness of its investigation work. There are many reasons why past material control has not been very satisfactory. However, the failure to thoroughly investigate is one of the main reasons. The reason why the investigation work has not been thorough is due to the lack of a direct agency. Even in terms of the organization of economic police, there have only been signs of it recently, but it has not yet been able to fully exert its efficiency. Now that the National Commercial Control General Association has been established, it does not have a specialized organization for investigation work. Therefore, at present, it can only rely on the assistance of military and police agencies.

### Memorable Old Stories

— Liu Yusheng

Recently, many prominent figures from the Japanese cultural world have come to China from afar. Many of them are well known to us, especially several in the field of literature. This short article only discusses Mr. Saneatsu Mushanokoji and Mr. Tetsutaro Kawakami, simply because I have had the opportunity to meet them in the past and wish to express my humble sentiments. Others, such as Mr. Setsuzan (On) Shiotani, although a renowned scholar, I have only met his son-in-law, Professor Shinshima, and have not had the chance to meet him in person. I will not discuss them in detail here.

What I can write about is only a few things. Speaking of Mushanokoji, we cannot help but recall the famous Shirakaba-ha (White Birch Society) humanitarian writers of the Japanese literary world thirty years ago. The Shirakaba magazine was founded in Japan in Meiji 43 (1910). In addition to Mushanokoji, the mainstays of the magazine included Naoya Shiga, Zenro Nagayo, and Takeo Arishima, all of whom we are familiar with. They mostly came from the aristocracy and were deeply influenced by Rousseau, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Romain Rolland, aiming to love peace and pursue the realization of an ideal world. In particular, Mr. Mushanokoji's works have been greatly valued in China in the past. For example, Mr. Lu Xun translated "A Young Man's Dream" by a Russian author. Other important translations include "Selected Works of Saneatsu Mushanokoji" (Commercial Press, including "A Rose-Colored Girl" translated by Fan Zhongyun, "Ikyu the Little Monk in One Day" translated by Zhou Zuoren, and "A Certain Woman"). "Collected Plays of Saneatsu Mushanokoji" (Chung Hwa, co-translated by Cui Wanqiu and Yang Yunfei, including the plays "Father and Daughter," "Mr. Nojima's Dream," and "Mrs. in the Study"). Xu Zuzheng translated the two plays "Four People and Others" and "Foster Father," and Wang Guru translated the three plays "The End of Mr. Zhang," "A Small Incident in a Family's Infanticide," compiled into the book "Four People and Others." Other single editions include "Love and Desire" translated by Zhang Kebiao, "Younger Sister" translated by Zhou Baidi, "Mother and Son" and "The Lonely Soul" translated by Cui Wanqiu, "Study of Drama" translated by Shen Zai Bai, and "The Life of a Man" co-translated by Mao Yongshang and Li Zongwu. Scattered pieces or new works seen in various magazines are even more numerous. Judging from the large number of translations, we feel that Mr. Mushanokoji is truly someone who can sympathize with the Chinese people and receive sympathy from the Chinese people.

My meeting with Mr. Mushanokoji was due to the introduction of Mr. Qian Daosun. His honest appearance and humble attitude reminded me of the New Village Movement that he and his comrades had promoted in Hyuga, Japan, more than twenty years ago. Although the New Village construction movement has long since stopped, I imagine that his long-cherished wishes, his enthusiasm, and his spirit are advancing with the times, always striving towards the highest state of perfection for mankind! I hope that this time he personally sets foot in this arduous and chaotic Republic of China, he will see the spirit of the Chinese people, a spirit of enduring hardship, honesty, solidity, love of peace, flesh and blood, and backbone, which will surely lead him to develop a deeper understanding and sympathy for us. Mr. Mushanokoji has been to China before, so I don't need to say much here. Let me borrow the words of Mr. O in "A Young Man's Dream" and say it again: "Please forgive my powerlessness, forgive the powerlessness of my words. But I would like you to discern all the admiration I have in my heart for the beautiful country."

Mr. Tetsutaro Kawakami is a famous modern Japanese literary critic. There have been one or two telegrams in the newspaper in the past that mistakenly named him as Hajime Kawakami. In fact, they do have family connections. He is currently the editor-in-chief of the "Literary World" magazine, which is a sister publication similar to "Bungei Shunju." In terms of advocacy and literary stance, he is probably close to Kan Kikuchi, Takeo Kume, Yoshio Toyoshima, and Seiichi Funabashi. I have also talked to all of these people except Mr. Toyoshima several times. In my humble article "Shadows of the Heart in a Foreign Country" ("Ancient and Modern" Anniversary Issue), I said:

Mr. Kikuchi's reputation in the writing world has been as strong as ever from the Taisho era in Japan to today, decades later. I don't need to praise him much. I don't understand Japanese at all, and I used English entirely during the conversation. Even if it wasn't alienating, at least it wasn't particularly cordial. Mr. Kikuchi's attitude towards me... is something I will never forget in my memory. However, after reading Mr. Kikuchi's recent article, I suddenly thought of a short story of his with great artistic value, which is his "Beyond Grudges." The content of this story is moving enough to bring tears to one's eyes. The plot of this story can allow a strange Chinese to understand the lives of the Japanese people and their philosophy of life. Although the theme of this story is about the relationship of gratitude and resentment between people, I feel that the relationship between countries, whether it is a rational view or an emotional impulse, may also be able to glean a profound truth from this novel. The reason why I am writing this short article now is partly to thank Mr. Kikuchi... for the great kindness many of them have shown me, and partly because I feel that Mr. Kikuchi can write a masterpiece like "Beyond Grudges," then his expectations and enthusiasm for me can make a deep impression on me and evoke a major response.

When I left Japan, I stayed in Nara on the way. Mr. Tetsutaro Kawakami, the head of "Literary World," rushed to Nara from Tokyo to express his own and Mr. Kikuchi's intention, hoping that I would stay in Japan for a longer time. Our conversation lasted from 2:00 am to 3:30 am. We were wearing short sleeves and bare feet, wearing loose robes. Mr. Daishi Iwatani was also present. I understand their intentions, although I declined their kindness. However, I used a very sincere and enthusiastic sentence to answer my Japanese literary friends. In order to comfort you, I wrote this short article. Even in painful solitude, not a single word in it is not from the bottom of my heart.

Later, Mr. Kawakami sent me a letter asking me to write articles for his publication. His letter was also very emotional. I sincerely hope that this time he comes to China, he will do as I advised Mr. Fusao Hayashi: take a look at the actual lives of the Chinese people, observe the real situation of Chinese society, which is not only a responsibility that a literary writer should fulfill, but also for the long-term future of the two great countries of China and Japan.

"How's business lately?"

"Not so good, so I enjoy doing other things at home more."

"You've learned this craft, but like me, you won't learn anything."

"But you've learned this craft, but you can only earn some pocket money, there's no big advantage at all..."

They talked and talked, then stepped up a few more stone steps and entered the mountain gate. There were many people in the main hall, and the incense was so thick that it almost made them unable to open their eyes. They passed through the kitchen from the hall to a long veranda.

There were even more people here, sitting and drinking tea. It had become a temporary teahouse. A row of windows opened on the south side, and the view was even better than outside the mountain gate. Undoubtedly, this was a very good teahouse.

"Let's have two pots of tea," A-Wu invited.

Da Gen couldn't say no, because logically he should be the one to invite A-Wu first, to fulfill the duties of a host. However, he never had the habit of going to teahouses to drink tea, so he and A-Wu didn't even think of it when they got here. Now that A-Wu was inviting him, he had to awkwardly say: "Okay."

They chose the only two empty seats by the window and sat down. Most of the people drinking tea were peasants, taking advantage of this rare holiday to stroll around and have some fun. They were chattering loudly, all very happy. As soon as they sat down, the waiter brought the tea to them. They, especially A-Wu, like the others, let go of their voices and talked loudly.

"Damn it, I finally became a real person today!" A-Wu poured a full cup of tea for Da Gen, and then poured one for himself, showing a relaxed and contented expression. (25)

Xiao Wang: "Old Li, it's been so long! I heard you're doing very well!"

Old Li: "Not really! It's just talk... In reality, earning four or five thousand yuan a month isn't even enough to cover expenses! What about you, Xiao Wang?"

Xiao Wang: "Don't even mention it, living costs are so high, it's almost unbearable."

Old Li (interrupting Xiao Wang): "Isn't it the same for everyone! Xiao Wang, you're still… Sigh! If only you, Xiao Wang, would be willing to temporarily lend me a few thousand yuan to tide me over, otherwise…"

Xiao Wang: "………?"

Wife (showing an impatient expression): "There's no firewood for tomorrow, and the rent is overdue, and…"

Husband: "Stop nagging!"

Wife: "Who's nagging! If you were ambitious, like Mr. Zhang upstairs, every time he comes home, Mrs. Zhang never complains."

Husband: "I told you not to nag!"

Wife: "I'm not nagging, it's a fact. If you could just earn money…"

Husband (getting angry): "I can't earn money. It's not just me in this era; your parents' family can't compensate me for anything either. I can only blame you for not being lucky…"

Wife: "What are you saying about my parents?" (Then bursts into loud sobs).

Husband: "Just saying you didn't see clearly and married a poor husband."

Wife (attitude softening immediately): "I'm not saying I wanted to marry a rich husband; I'm just telling you the facts so you know how difficult times are."

Husband (smiling at her): "Then I understand. You go cook the rice first, no need to say more."

Wife (preparing the meal): "Then tomorrow you go try to find a way, if it doesn't work, I'll…"

Husband: "That's what you call a hardworking couple!"

### Our Newspaper's Children's Welfare Forum Launches Emergency Street Children Donation Campaign, Aiming for 100,000 Yuan, The More The Better

The social services department of this newspaper, in commemoration of this year's Children's Day, launched a children's welfare forum. Representatives from twenty-three organizations attended, jointly discussing the issue of aiding impoverished children. All agreed that with the current soaring prices, providing sustenance is even more difficult, and the number of children in care is increasing rather than decreasing. Reintegrating street children is easier said than done. A unanimous proposal was made to relocate and centrally educate them in rural areas during wartime, implementing scientific management, combining work and study, and engaging in production cooperation. A budget of 100,000 yuan is needed to allocate and recommend qualified care homes. We hope that kind people from all walks of life will, based on the principle of loving and caring for children, economize on unnecessary expenses and provide material assistance.
