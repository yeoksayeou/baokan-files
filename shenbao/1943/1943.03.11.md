### Further Discussion on Enhancing Wartime Production

Yesterday's discussion, "Stabilizing the Market and Increasing Production," briefly outlined that stabilizing currency value and enhancing production are the two major factors in improving the effectiveness of price controls, resolving commodity price issues, and realizing the guiding principles of wartime economic policy. If we do not actively strive from these two perspectives, all economic policies will inevitably fail, achieving at most "twice the effort for half the results." In particular, enhancing production is an even more crucial policy for the present and future. We believe it is necessary to further deliberate on specific methods.

First, state-owned enterprises, enterprises operated by the Japanese in China, and Sino-Japanese jointly operated enterprises must be adjusted. Their structures must be improved, and their efficiency enhanced to fully meet the actual needs of wartime and post-war, and to realize the ideal of the Greater East Asia Economic Co-prosperity Sphere. In particular, our country's state-owned enterprises, and the enemy assets to be taken over and managed in the future, should make full use of their production equipment and existing manpower. All specialized technical personnel should be guaranteed their positions, so they can make the most of their abilities. All idle personnel should be transferred to other positions. We must recognize that in the current situation, if several factories are nominally established, but in reality only serve to accommodate some personnel, it will not benefit the enhancement of production.

Second, all private enterprises, whether operated by Chinese or by people from friendly nations, should be treated equally. The government should provide as much assistance as possible to private enterprises operated by Chinese. Currently, the percentage of production volume accounted for by state-owned and Japanese-operated enterprises is still far less than that of private enterprises. Among private enterprises, daily necessities produced by modern industry are of particularly important value. If we fully develop small and medium-sized production enterprises in our country, then the production quantities of rice milling in food, cotton yarn and cloth in clothing materials, and matches and soap in daily necessities will certainly not be matched by the production capacity of state-owned enterprises in the future. In order to develop production, we must see this situation clearly and remove all artificial obstacles. Especially today, as we prepare and implement comprehensive control of materials, we must take care of and support private small and medium-sized production. Phenomena that hinder production, impede transportation, and even contribute to hoarding should be quickly liquidated.

Third, in future tax systems, there should be a distinction between industry and commerce. We should levy commercial taxes and give preferential treatment to production. If an excessive profits tax or income tax is implemented on industry, the object should be individual income and profits, not industrial organizations. Increases in indirect taxes should also be handled with caution. If there are numerous checkpoints and repeated taxation, it will only increase the burden of freight transport, which is extremely detrimental to stabilizing commodity prices.

Fourth, national financial institutions must conscientiously take responsibility for supplying short-term working capital for industry and mining, strengthen the handling of discounting, mortgage loans, and acting as agents for issuing corporate bonds, preferred stocks, and guaranteed interest stocks. When necessary, the government can provide long-term loans. At the same time, restrictions on commercial loans and the use of idle funds must also be further effectively addressed, creating favorable conditions for increasing production in finance.

Fifth, the relevant authorities must support industrial and mining production enterprises and solve the problems of a lack of certain technical personnel and raw materials and equipment. With a guiding and supportive attitude, they should encourage public and private enterprises to manufacture those scarce and urgently needed materials. Under the existing technical and material conditions, we firmly believe that the development of production in the peaceful areas has a promising future. As long as the government puts in a little more effort in guidance and support, the production industry will surely develop rapidly.

In addition, we cannot ignore that, on the one hand, we must improve the working conditions of workers, and at the same time strengthen work intensity, increase the number of shifts, and implement full-day production (i.e., abolishing the distinction between day and night). This is the main method used by various countries with advanced modern science to increase production. On the other hand, in view of the characteristics of China's economic structure and social organization, we should also strive to encourage handicrafts, rural sideline industries, and home industries, and develop production in towns and villages, which is also an important way to increase military and civilian supplies during wartime. These two measures can also improve the lives of workers, farmers, and ordinary people, and have extremely significant political and social implications.

Improving wartime production efficiency is also consolidating the foundation for the construction of a new China after the war. The main principles and specific methods we have proposed in the past two days are by no means rash statements, but rather the conclusions of careful research based on our country's national conditions and the sentiments of the people, for the independence of China and East Asian co-prosperity. We hope that relevant parties will pay attention to and refer to them, or even further research and implement them. This would truly be the fortune of China and the blessing of East Asia.

Translated Commentary

### A Farce in London

The farces staged by Britain and the United States one after another are endless. In the most recent highlight, the Casablanca talks, Anglo-American entanglements over North Africa occurred. The United States used fifty old destroyers to seize more than a dozen British bases in the Western Hemisphere in the form of a ninety-nine-year lease. If another fifty ships are supplied, they will become completely American territory, and the American side is very enthusiastic about this. This time, the dispute between the Soviet Union and Poland was also brought to the stage by Britain and the United States, and audiences around the world appreciated the rarest farce of the moment.

In the prelude to this World War, the Polish government-in-exile, which collapsed just a month later, demanded the recovery of lost territories from the Soviet Union from London, which the Soviet Union refused. Britain and the United States believed that the Soviet Union's behavior was simply challenging the Atlantic Charter, and a ghost drama came to a close. However, Czech government leaders such as Beneš, who were also exiled in London, sympathized with the Soviet Union and opposed Poland, so the program notes for this play are extremely complicated.

Which part of the Atlantic Charter did the Soviet Union challenge? It should be referring to the second item, in which the free will of the local residents should be given the greatest attention when modifying territories, and the third item, in which the sovereignty and autonomy of all peoples and residents should be respected. So, is the Soviet Union unwilling to be bound by the status quo-maintaining charter of Britain and the United States? In the eyes of Britain and the United States, if they acknowledge the Soviet Union's behavior, they will lose the trust of the ghost governments. So, if the Soviet Union insists on its current attitude, how will Britain and the United States deal with it? This is the central point of interest in this play.

The ghost government regards the Soviet Union as an opponent, which is a strange thing in the eyes of the Soviet Union. In fact, the independence of Poland and the Czech Republic has already perished, and they are not normal countries. Is it not an incredible thing to want to maintain contact with the real world in the ghost world and to continue to be active? Is it not another incredible thing that two countries that were already at odds in the real world continue to roar at each other after becoming ghosts? It is even more incredible that Britain and the United States hold these two ghosts tightly in their arms as allies. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Daily News, March 6)

### Chief of the Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, Major General Yagihagi, Gives a Speech, Acknowledging the Great Significance of the Russo-Japanese War

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency): Major General Yagihagi, Chief of the Press Department of the Army of the Japanese General Headquarters, gave a speech at the Kyouritsu Auditorium here today, stating that the Russo-Japanese War was the first step in building a new order in East Asia. The Manchurian Incident, the Sino-Japanese War, and the Greater East Asia War can be said to be the continuation and development of the Russo-Japanese War. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan leaped to become one of the world's great powers, and its great significance in world history lies in the fact that Japan, an East Asian nation, effectively struck at Western imperialism, which was invading East Asia. Reviewing the late 19th century, after Da Gama sailed around the Cape of Good Hope and raised the Portuguese flag in India, most of East Asia was effectively under the control of the two oceans. However, Japan, a small island nation in East Asia that was despised by them, defeated Russia, which they considered the strongest of the Western powers, and suddenly made the East Asian nations realize that the idea of Western superiority was wrong, and promoted the establishment of a constitutional system similar to Japan and the construction of independent and self-reliant new countries. The main reason why revolutionary movements to overthrow autocratic regimes occurred in countries such as China, India, Persia, and Turkey was also this. The Russo-Japanese War can be called the prelude to the holy war of East Asian nations against Western domination of the world and the liberation of East Asia, said Major General Yagihagi. Major General Yagihagi then recounted the course of the Russo-Japanese War, saying that the Japanese army fought with a small number of troops and in an inferior position. He then expressed his determination to defeat Britain and the United States in this war, stating that the Russo-Japanese War was caused by Russia's unprovoked act of aggression. The Russian army launched an expedition outside its borders, traveling thousands of miles. It was repeatedly defeated on land and sea. After the war began, a revolution broke out in Russia, and the people's hearts became increasingly shaken. Later, the President of the United States mediated a ceasefire. However, in this Greater East Asia War, Japan's national strength is stronger than before, and the scale of the war is even larger. The complexity of the current international situation and the significance of the war are no longer comparable to those of the past. As President Hitler said, the outcome of this war will not be as simple as in the past, with just a victor and a loser. Only the victor can survive in the world, and the loser will perish. We can only rely on the movement of the nation to strive for the final victory, he said. During the Russo-Japanese War, the United States came forward to mediate, and Britain concluded an alliance with Japan, which was of some help to Japan. However, this kind of assistance was not out of sincerity. Their purpose was to use Japan to thwart Russia's momentum and to sacrifice Japan to consolidate their rights and interests in East Asia. Therefore, they were not pleased that Japan won and established a solid position in East Asia. After the end of the Russo-Japanese War, Britain and the United States adopted a policy of preventing Japan from developing towards the continent. The outbreak of World War I caused them to temporarily adopt a passive attitude towards this kind of prevention policy. However, after defeating Germany, they exposed their ambition to invade East Asia, oppress Japan, and sow discord between China and Japan, in an attempt to reap the benefits. In order to realize the great ideal of Hakko Ichiu, Japan must eliminate the evil forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia, otherwise it will be difficult to build a new order in East Asia. If the ambition of Britain and the United States is not stopped, East Asia will never have a day of peace and happiness. On this 38th Army Memorial Day, our people vow to serve bravely, defeat Britain and the United States, and keep the Holy Emperor safe.

Since Chairman Wang advocated peace and I heard the Allied nation Japan clarify the true meaning of cooperation with China, I am now convinced that the only way to save the country is peace. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the Allied nation Japan has clearly shown its enthusiasm for protecting East Asia. Therefore, I led 5,000 troops to join the peace camp. Here, I swear to Chairman Wang that I am determined to support the national policy and cooperate in the Greater East Asia War.

### Moscow Military Newspaper Announces Soviet Army Withdraws from Seven Cities Intense Fighting Southwest of Kharkov German Threat to Donets Basin Eliminated

Angara, 10th (Haitong News Agency) - According to a military report published in Moscow today, Soviet forces have withdrawn from seven cities, including Krasnograd, Rossosh, Krasarmeysk, Kramatorsk, Pervomaisk, Slavyansk, and Lisichansk. Intense fighting is ongoing southwest of Kharkov. This is the first time the Soviet military authorities have released these place names. As such, the German army's 100-kilometer position in the Donets Basin is no longer in danger of being invaded by Soviet forces, and a large number of troops in the southern sector will not be cut off, it is said.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 10th (Havas News Agency) - Yesterday, German forces launched several counter-attacks west of Rostov. The offensive against Kharkov continues to make progress. Soviet troops are continuing to increase pressure in the central Vyazma area. The German army has occupied Valki and Lyubotin near Kharkov, and several railways leading to Kharkov have been cut off by German forces. Only the Kharkov-Akhtyrka railway line is still being resisted by the Red Army. However, according to Berlin reports, the Red Army there has also been defeated. In addition, recent German war reports state that although the central Red Army continues to attack, they are being strongly resisted and contained by German rearguard units. The main German forces are able to withdraw according to the planned schedule. Moscow sources say the central Red Army's offensive is mainly aimed at Vyazma, which is a barrier to Smolensk. The main Red Army forces are now attacking in two directions: one from Sychevka (less than 25 miles from Vyazma) along the railway line, and the other from Moscow along the railway line. According to the most recent Moscow reports, the Red Army has reached Serhiy Ivanovsky, 20 miles east of Vyazma.

German Army Withdraws from Baer City Romanian Army Repels Landing Soviet Forces

Berlin, 10th (Allied News Agency) - The German High Command announced today that the German army has successfully withdrawn from Bely (southwest of Rzhev and 75 miles northwest of Smolensk).

German Army Shortens Central Battle Lines According to Planned Schedule

Berlin, 10th (Allied News Agency) - Official circles here claimed last night that the German army launched a fierce counter-attack in the Kharkov area, the former capital of Ukraine, and after occupying Lyubotin and Valki, repelled the Soviet reinforcements on Monday and advanced about 25 kilometers. Valki is located about 50 miles southwest of Kharkov. German troops, working closely with German Air Force dive bombers, continued to press the Soviet positions west and southwest of Kharkov, and cut off several highways and railways, including the railway between Kharkov and Poltava. After fierce fighting, the German army annihilated a Soviet infantry division and destroyed 23 tanks. To the north, the Soviet army launched large-scale offensives northwest and southwest of Kursk and Orel, as well as south of Lake Ilmen near Staraya Russa. On Monday, the German army acted according to a pre-determined plan aimed at shortening its central front line south of Rzhev and west of Gzhatsk. In the Kursk-Orel area, the Soviet army deployed fresh troops and repeatedly attacked the German defense line. However, the slight advances made by the Soviet army in this area in the previous weeks did not compensate for the heavy losses in manpower and material resources. South of Lake Ilmen, the Soviet army also launched repeated attacks in the Staraya Russa area. The German army, after withdrawing from Demyansk, held its ground. The Red Army deployed fresh troops for combat on Monday, but made no progress. On the Mius River front north of Taganrog, and in the Kuban region of northwestern Caucasus, there were only minor engagements on Monday. The German army defeated several small Soviet units and held Novorossiysk on the Black Sea coast. North of Ilmen, on the Leningrad and Lake Ladoga front, there were no major incidents. However, German heavy artillery resumed shelling the factories and railway facilities of Leningrad and Schlisselburg.

### Japanese Air Power Cannot Be Ignored One Allied Transport Ship Sunk in Puna Sea

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a cable from San Francisco, a spokesman for General MacArthur, commander-in-chief of the anti-Axis forces in the Southwest Pacific, issued a statement on the 9th, warning Australians about the threat of Japanese air power. The statement said that the Japanese air force units in the northern waters of Australia still pose a formidable threat. Although the anti-Axis forces have inflicted damage on the Japanese air force in the past, the Japanese military is now actively strengthening its forces. Japanese air force pilots are highly skilled, and Japanese aircraft performance is also surprising. Therefore, we should not underestimate the threat of Japanese attacks on Australia, it said.

Buenos Aires, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a cable from Washington, the U.S. Navy Department announced on the 9th that an anti-Axis transport ship was sunk by the Japanese air force in the Puna Sea off New Guinea on the 8th.

At a time when Japan is implementing a new policy toward China, he is honored to be appointed as the head of the Central China Development Company and is determined to do his best to strengthen the economic ties between China and Japan. To achieve this goal, he intends to hold talks not only with Chinese government leaders, but also to contact ordinary people from all walks of life. He has only visited China once last year, so his knowledge of China is limited, but he has long been interested in China, he said.

### Air Service Resumed Between Hanoi and Saigon

### Stanley's Speech Not Authorized by U.S. Government Undersecretary of State Declares No Responsibility for This Willkie Deeply Concerned About Causing Doubt

Lisbon, 9th (Havas News Agency) - According to news from Washington, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Admiral Stanley, and U.S. Vice President Wallace, have recently made speeches on U.S.-Soviet relations, causing surprise across the United States. Ambassador Stanley declared at a press conference in Moscow that Soviet authorities are trying to create the impression, both domestically and abroad, that they are fighting alone, and deliberately conceal the assistance they receive from the Allied countries, especially the United States. When asked about these remarks to Undersecretary of State Welles, Welles stated that the government could not be held responsible. It is claimed that everything Ambassador Stanley said was not referred to the U.S. government beforehand, nor was it authorized by the government. He has cabled the ambassador asking for the contents of his speech, but has not yet received a reply. Republican leader Willkie believes that it is too radical and reckless for U.S. government officials to publicly make such remarks on U.S.-Soviet relations. He hopes that "everything Stanley said will not cause doubt in the existing understanding between the Allied countries." As for Vice President Wallace's remarks, Willkie criticized, "One representative of the government (referring to Wallace) implied that we might sell out the Soviet Union after the war, while another (referring to Stanley) claimed that the Soviet government is currently insincere to us. From my point of view, the United States has done its utmost to assist the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union should trust us more. As for the second front, the Soviet side wants us to fulfill our duties soon and immediately open a second front in Europe. Because of the difficulties of the Red Army on the Eastern Front, they believe that this is the best strategy for the Allied countries today, but our military authorities do not think so. History will reveal who is right or wrong in the future. Because news and propaganda are subject to censorship today, all countries want to convince their people of their actions, so there is no possibility of obtaining an accurate judgment." In addition, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bloom, believes that Stanley's remarks are a very unfortunate incident. He claims that he has read all the Soviet newspapers subscribed to by the State Department and found that these newspapers have published as much news as possible about the assistance given to the Soviet Union by the United States. In addition, the New York Times stated that some believe that Stanley's remarks are sufficient to promote the passage of the Lend-Lease Act amendment in order to control shipments to the Soviet Union. This is the private view of some members of Congress. If American envoys cannot gain trust in the country where they are stationed, especially in a country that receives significant American aid and becomes the biggest burden on American taxpayers, then such a statement will surely arouse the emotions of the American Congress. As for Wallace's remarks about Soviet betrayal, it is actually dangerous. It is not that there will be an armed conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, but that cooperation between the two sides will fail. Moreover, the border issues in Eastern Europe will cause all kinds of difficulties, so one must be careful.

### Firm Belief in Destroying Britain and America For Army Day

The Battle of Mukden, which established the foundation of the imperial country, was 38 years ago. March 10th marks the glorious and immortal Army Day, and during this time of decisive battle, hundreds of millions of citizens feel all the more invigorated. At the time, Japan, in view of Russia's deployment of troops and strengthening of its Far East military preparations, felt that if it relaxed in the slightest under such military pressure, it would be forced into a desperate situation, which could be described as an unprecedented national crisis since the founding of the country.

At that time, the Russian army, after defeating Napoleon's army that swept across Europe, boasted of its invincible strength in the world, exceeding us by more than ten times in terms of military strength, and possessing excellent and sharp weapons. Although Japan was blessed by heaven and divine assistance, it was not an enemy that could be easily defeated, and it was indeed a formidable foe.

When the cabinet meeting was convened on February 4 to decide on the opening of the Russo-Japanese War, Prime Minister Katsura issued a message to arouse the determination of the people, stating that: "Although we do not have the certainty of victory, we must also rely on the traditional spirit to fight to the death." Under the unanimous courage of the whole country, advancing one after another, the country finally exceeded the world's expectations, causing the strong Russia to yield and overcoming an unprecedented national crisis. The serious situation Japan is encountering today is not as serious as the Russo-Japanese War at that time. Since the beginning of the war, the irresistible imperial army has repeatedly achieved brilliant victories, and its majesty has spread throughout the world. From the snow-covered Aleutian Islands in the north to the malaria-ridden islands of the South Pacific in the south, all key points are in our grasp, and a solid and unshakeable strategic situation has been established. However, the enemy is still actively counterattacking.

Roosevelt once boasted: "In order to ensure Japan's final defeat, we will attack each of the islands scattered across the Pacific one by one, no matter how time-consuming and laborious it may be." Therefore, it is not possible to rashly conclude that the United States' counterattack against Japan is just talk on paper, or a farce to disrupt the occupied territories. In fact, the United States is currently focusing on expanding military production, while also specifically strengthening aid to Chongqing, increasing the air force in Chongqing, strengthening the defense of Australia and the bases on the islands of the South Pacific, and preparing step by step for a counterattack against Japan. Its ambition to achieve its goals should not be underestimated.

The future American counterattack will be a planned and organized counterattack, which is the stage of the final decisive battle between Japan and the United States. It is generally believed that this greatest decisive battle is imminent. The Japanese army has already consolidated the outer defenses of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, with sufficient military strength, and has the power to destroy the enemy's counterattack anytime, anywhere.

On the other hand, the Japanese army stationed in China occupies four-tenths of the entire Chinese territory, from Mongolia and Ordos in the north to Guangdong Province and Hainan Island in the south. Recently, in order to prevent the movements of the Chongqing army, it has advanced into Guangzhou Bay, the French leased territory on the Leizhou Peninsula. The battle line has been extended to 7,000 kilometers, and the highest pressure is constantly being exerted on Chongqing. After the National Government joined the war, 300,000 elite troops were deployed on the Chinese front, forming a solid as gold soup situation, making the Chongqing-U.S. cooperation plan for a counterattack impossible. The combat power of the Japanese army stationed in China is becoming more and more substantial, the morale is high, and it can launch positive offensives against various war zones in Chongqing anytime, anywhere.

The Japanese army's victory on the mainland is beyond doubt, and in various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, an absolutely invincible strategic situation has been established, and we are convinced that the final victory will belong to us. However, the world war situation is becoming more and more serious. In this year, it can be said that the fierce battles every day are decisive for success or failure, and are a serious stage for determining the rise and fall of the country. Therefore, in today's decisive battle, we hundreds of millions of citizens must exert all our strength, be determined to sacrifice private interests for the public good, and go to the national crisis together. We must carry on the glorious tradition of defeating the strong enemy Russia to today's war. At this time of decisive battle, we are pleased to celebrate this great Army Day, the significance of which is profound. (Yunpeng: Translated from the March 10th Dalian News)

### Water

On the front lines, after days and nights of continuous fighting, not a drop of water enters the mouth. At this time, the soldiers are all dreaming of water. In their dreams, they are drinking the gurgling, clear water flowing in the river. Waking up from the dream, if it were in their home country, they would never drink water from rivers like these.

The soldiers' thirst for water deeply moves us. Without a drop of water to moisten the throat, gritting their teeth, and fighting with all their heart, this spirit is truly the posture of a god.

### Steel Industry: Important Overview of Japan (4)

With the progression of the China Incident, the United States adopted various means of pressure against Japan, one of which was the comprehensive ban on the export of pig iron and steel materials to Japan in December of Showa 15 (1940). At that time, the Japanese steel industry relied heavily on overseas suppliers for scrap iron and steel materials. Therefore, the United States' intimidating export ban undeniably dealt a considerable blow to Japan. However, conversely, the Japanese steel industry was thus able to break away from its traditional dependence on overseas sources, providing Japan with an opportunity to move towards self-sufficiency in steel. Against the backdrop of this steel situation, the Iron and Steel Control Association was established with the promulgation of the Important Industries Association Order in April of Showa 16 (1941). Given the circumstances of its establishment, the Control Association aimed to establish an autonomous steel industry within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, with the primary objective of comprehensively managing the steel industry to complete the national defense system. Subsequently, it was reorganized in accordance with the implementation of the Important Industries Association Order to promote the grand goal of steel self-sufficiency. At the same time, it constantly held a leading position in the steel industry to cope with the changing circumstances before and after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War.

Looking at the members of the Iron and Steel Control Association, the current state of the Japanese steel industry includes a total of forty-nine companies, comprising thirty-eight production companies, four raw material and sales companies, and seven participants from Manchuria. Among the production companies, Nippon Steel Corporation (Nittetsu), Nippon Kokan, Nakayama Steel Works, Kokura Steel, and Amagasaki Iron & Steel are engaged in integrated steel operations. Other companies, such as Kobe Steel, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Amagasaki Steel, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Azuma Steel, Koa Steel, Daido Steel, Mitsubishi Steel, Japan Special Steel Tube, and Kotobuki Heavy Industries, do not have blast furnace facilities for producing pig iron from ore, but only use open-hearth furnaces to produce steel materials and specialty steel. Among the steel production companies, Nittetsu and Nippon Kokan hold extremely important positions and can be regarded as Japan's two major representative companies. Nittetsu, in particular, has a semi-national policy company nature, with equipment and scale of great magnitude, accounting for more than half of Japan's steel production volume. Nippon Kokan adopts the Thomas steelmaking process, making it Japan's only iron manufacturing company using this method, which is extremely advantageous for processing low-quality ore. Therefore, Nittetsu also adopted it last December.

Among the raw material and sales-related companies, the Iron and Steel Raw Material Control Company and the Iron and Steel Sales Control Company are wholly funded by the Iron and Steel Control Association, with Control Association staff concurrently serving as presidents, making them purely internal organizations. First, the Iron and Steel Control Association centrally purchases pig iron, semi-finished products, iron ore, scrap iron, and coal for ironmaking, etc. Then, the Iron and Steel Raw Material Control Company appropriately allocates them according to the production ratios of the various steel companies. The products produced by each steel company are centrally purchased by the Iron and Steel Sales Control Company and sold to consumers through various retailers in accordance with the instructions of the Iron and Steel Control Association. Therefore, the steel industry, from production to distribution and consumption, is implemented under a consistent plan.

The production companies participating from Manchuria include Showa Steel Works, Moye Coal & Iron Company, Anshan Steel, Manshu Ruhr, Manshu Sumitomo Metal Industries, and Nichiman Steel Pipe, a total of six companies. Among them, Showa Steel Works is engaged in integrated pig iron and steel operations, established in Showa 4 (1929), and was the first company to engage in operations in Manchuria. Currently, it has joined the Manchurian Heavy Industries Development Company, and its ironmaking equipment and production volume are second only to Nittetsu. It exports a large amount of pig iron and steel materials every year, which Japan relies on heavily. For the year Showa 17 (1942), the planned amount of pig iron that could be exported to Japan has already been transported, and it is said that the planned amount of steel materials has also been reliably exported.

Last December, the North China Iron & Steel Company, newly established in North China, held its inaugural general meeting. The company's factory is still under construction. When the company begins operations, it will be a further step towards establishing a self-sufficient system of Japan, China, and Manchuria. The expectations for Showa Steel Works and North China Iron & Steel will become increasingly important in the future.

Due to the progression of the war, steel production is clearly in an emergency state. If the scope of operations expands, the demand for iron to manufacture weaponry and materials will naturally increase. On the other hand, if the sea area of operations expands, the production of iron will face many difficulties due to transportation and various other factors. Currently, the mission of those involved in iron manufacturing is to overcome this contradiction and ensure production. Last December, the Iron and Steel Control Association, in its council meeting, specifically proposed various countermeasures such as dramatically increasing domestic iron ore production, improving ore quality, recovering and utilizing scrap iron, utilizing domestic powdered ore, regional self-sufficiency of raw material coal, overcoming the decline in the quality of inferior coal, increasing the efficiency of overland connection and transportation of raw materials and products, promptly establishing small-scale smelting furnaces in iron ore resource areas, and promoting the increase in steel imports from Manchuria, in order to achieve the planned production volume for the second half of last year.

However, after strengthening domestic ore self-sufficiency, the decline in ore quality may reduce steel production. To compensate for this deficiency, the blending ratio of scrap iron is increased. Therefore, the maximum recovery of scrap iron becomes necessary. Regarding the recovery of metals, the Metal Recovery Control Company was established in June of last year, absorbing the Japan Scrap Iron Control Company, the former Steel Control Company, and the Wartime Materials Utilization Association, merging them into a unified implementation organization to recover old metals from factories, businesses, and general households. Starting this year, in order to thoroughly improve peacetime industries, it is hoped that the public will voluntarily offer waste metal scraps. In this session of the Diet, the government also solemnly declared that it would organize a new recovery organization. Regarding transportation issues, consideration is being given to constructing ironmaking facilities such as blast furnaces and small-scale smelting furnaces in iron ore source areas. Small-scale smelting furnaces, in particular, require simple construction materials and do not take much time, so they have become an immediate issue and are already being planned by Nittetsu, Nippon Kokan, Kotobuki Heavy Industries, and other companies. The construction areas will extend beyond Japan to Manchuria, North China, Taiwan, and other places.

Due to this urgent situation in steel production, the control of steel has also made significant progress with the implementation of the Factory and Business Management Order and the revision of the Steel Control Order on January 27. The government is implementing management of major ironmaking factories throughout the country. The purpose is to overcome the many adverse conditions in steel production and ensure the required production quantity. The significance of factory management particularly emphasizes the following three points:

(1) After being managed by the state, the importance of designated factories will be deeply recognized, and cooperation will be given.

(2) Managing factories makes the conscription of labor possible, and at the same time, original labor management can be more thorough, solving the labor problems in ironmaking.

(3) To ensure the thoroughness of planned production, the product formats and sizes must meet the needs in the process of implementing concrete production plans according to the material mobilization plan. After the government manages the factories, the government's needs and production can be completely consistent in terms of type and time.

After the implementation of the management of ironmaking factories, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry dispatches supervisory officials to the managed factories. The relationship between the supervisory officials and the resident staff dispatched by the Control Association is that the resident staff are under the command of the supervisory officials and cooperate with the supervisory officials to guide them. The two become one to carry out the production plan. Last December, the first president of the Iron and Steel Wire Control Association, Mr. Shozaburo Hira-o, and the chairman of the board, Mr. Naoto Kobisawa, resigned. The president of Nittetsu, Mr. Teiji Toyota, was elected as the successor president, and the president of North China Iron & Steel, Mr. Yoshisuke Watanabe, was elected as the successor chairman. President Toyota concurrently holds the position of president of Nittetsu, breaking the original practice of the Control Association president being a full-time position. The Iron and Steel Control Association was established before the implementation of the Important Industries Association, at a time when the transition to steel self-sufficiency for Japan, China, and Manchuria was imminent. To achieve this great goal, the Iron and Steel Control Association must occupy a strong leading position in the steel industry. In the current steel situation in Japan, one ton of iron now is more valuable than ten tons of iron in the future. Therefore, those who are in charge of control must understand the actual situation of control and gradually implement the necessary countermeasures. This is the reason why the position of president of the Iron and Steel Control Association is held concurrently by the president of Nittetsu.

At the beginning of President Toyota's inauguration, regarding the operating policy of the Control Association, the original emphasis on planning was shifted to the principle of prioritizing the practice of production plans. The Planning Department was merged into the Production Department to unify production and planning. At the same time, the future development of the Control Association's function will concentrate its focus on this large Production Department, dedicating its full efforts to practical aspects.

### Tunisian Front: War Returns to Slumber; American Forces Appear for the First Time in the Northern District of Tunisia; Plans to Reinforce the British Forces Under Anderson

Berlin, 10th (Haito News Agency): There is no war in southern Tunisia. The German forces did not launch a large-scale offensive against the British Eighth Army last Sunday. The German forces attacked the Mareth Line, breaking into positions in the southwestern section of the line. The motive was to disrupt General Montgomery's preparations for the offensive and to test the enemy's deployment. If successful, the Axis forces encountered weak resistance from the enemy at the beginning of the advance. However, after advancing about twenty kilometers, they discovered a strong British position with many artillery pieces. The Axis vanguard reconnoitered the enemy's position and then automatically withdrew to their original defenses with minimal losses. The reports in the British and American newspapers about this contact are quite different from the truth. It is unknown where the claim that the Axis forces suffered heavy losses came from. General Zappalerni has not depleted his forces and still maintains his full strength to fight. The American forces in central Tunisia have entered the area vacated by the Axis forces according to the planned withdrawal. An attempt by the American vanguard to move east was thwarted by the Axis rearguard. The Axis forces in northern Tunisia remain in an active position and have advanced west and southwest of Cape Serrat. The British First Army has suffered considerable losses in recent weeks.

Berlin, 10th (Domei News Agency): The land battle in the Tunisian war zone returned to slumber on Monday. The German forces under General Rommel in southern Tunisia launched a surprise attack on the British Eighth Army on Saturday, inflicting heavy damage before withdrawing behind the Mareth Line. In the coastal area west of Cape Serrat in northern Tunisia, the German forces have again temporarily suspended their land operations. American forces have recently appeared for the first time in the northern district of Tunisia to reinforce the British forces under General Anderson. American forces have also entered the Ousselitia area in central Tunisia to reinforce the British forces. Although the land battle in the north has quieted down, the German air force attacked British targets in the Djebel Aboid area. On Monday, the Axis forces in central Tunisia withdrew from the area they had occupied in mid-February. The advancing American vanguard made contact near the Pichon area. These American units have been repelled. There have been no new developments since the German forces in southern Tunisia attacked the British Eighth Army on Saturday. It is only known that the Axis forces lost 38 tanks and armored vehicles, 42 artillery pieces, and 53 vehicles in the attack on the British forces. One hundred British soldiers were captured. After completing their mission, the Axis forces returned to their original positions.

### Anti-Axis Camp Discusses Post-War World Issues; Different Dreams, Divergent War Aims

Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Central News Agency): Since the Soviet Union launched its winter offensive, the countries of the anti-Axis camp have regarded the issue of post-war world management as an urgent task and have engaged in discussions. Although US Vice President Wallace did not explicitly express the issue of world management in his speech on the 8th, focusing on post-war discussions, in reality, as a result of the conflicting positions and war aims of the anti-Axis camp, they have had to raise this issue in order to continue the war. At the beginning of this World War, the anti-Axis camp only adopted a defensive posture and had no need to establish war aims. Subsequently, with the development of the war situation, they adopted the Atlantic Charter of August 1941 as their guiding principle, with the war aims of protecting exiled countries and restoring pre-war freedoms. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the US government, with its ambitions of new imperialism, attempted to inherit the legacy of Britain. At the same time, the Soviet government, having single-handedly shouldered the heavy responsibility of the war, declared its intention to dominate Eastern Europe in the future. This fully exposes the ugly face and the different dreams within the anti-Axis camp. The London correspondent of the Aftonbladet on the 8th commented on the Polish government-in-exile's request to restore lost territories, saying, "The Soviet government's strong attitude is sufficient to indicate its determination to pursue its own policies in the future. British political circles are very concerned about this. This issue has caused anxiety in both the government and the opposition in Britain." However, the disputes among the anti-Axis camp are not limited to this and are very numerous. The most important are: (1) The US government, citing the implementation of aid under the Lend-Lease Act as the main reason, openly used the excuse that Britain's policy of governing India and other colonies violated the Atlantic Charter to seize British territories in West Asia and Africa. At the same time, it attempted to seize British islands and military bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans under the pretext of transferring old destroyers. Regarding this US ambition, the British Ambassador to the US, Halifax, recently published an article in an American magazine, strongly arguing that Britain had made substantial counter-payments for US aid under the Lend-Lease Act. The British Colonial Secretary, Stanley, also strongly attacked the US government's aggressive policies in a speech at Oxford University. (2) The Soviet Union, based on its military and ethnic considerations, spied on Eastern European countries and expressed strong opposition to the demands of the Polish government-in-exile and other countries to return their original territories. Currently, the arguments between the Soviet Union and Poland regarding the Ukrainian region and other aspects are brewing intensely in secret. US Undersecretary of State Welles and the New Zealand Minister to the US, Nash, both advocate for an immediate review of post-war political and economic issues and the establishment of a supreme conference of anti-Axis countries to manage the post-war world. Although this is only a fantasy that ignores the current state of the war, it can be seen as their urgent request to carry out the entire war, given the reality of the anti-Axis camp. The London Economic Weekly magazine, published on the 5th, commented on the above issues, saying, "The British government has always taken the initiative in dealing with the political issues of the anti-Axis camp, but in the future, it will have a special mission. Regarding the dispute between the Soviet Union and Poland, it should warn them not to be taken advantage of by the Axis powers." It is undeniable that the Axis camp is a group of countries with different political systems, including the extremely left-leaning and the extremely right-leaning, as well as all other political colors. Because the war aims are also different, this is the reason why the anti-Axis camp is currently in a crisis of division. Even if they can hold a conference of anti-Axis countries as President Roosevelt recently mentioned, it is doubtful whether they can form a completely unified front. It is evident that the different dreams of the anti-Axis camp have been completely exposed.

### Eden Welcomes Economic Conference

Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Haito News Agency): British Foreign Secretary Eden, in response to a question from a member of the House of Commons regarding the convoy issue discussed between the US and the Soviet Union, said that this was a matter for Moscow and Washington. Regarding the holding of an economic conference by the Allied nations, Eden said that this was welcomed by Britain. In the past few months, Britain has discussed post-war economic issues with the various dominions and India and has also informally discussed this matter.

### Gandhi Has No Hope of Release

Geneva, 10th (German News Agency): According to the "Journal de Genève," which obtained information from Calcutta, there is no hope of releasing Gandhi and other parliamentary party members in the coming months. Some observers believe that the United Kingdom will re-attempt to resolve the conflict with India. There is only one thing that can restore Gandhi's freedom: he makes a guarantee that he will no longer encourage others to strike or launch a boycott movement, but Gandhi is unwilling to comply. Given the British authorities' policy, we should not overestimate the meeting of Indian politicians currently being held in Bombay.

### British Authorities Release Indian Women's Leader

### Citywide Distribution of Rationed Sugar Begins Today. Adjustment of Sugar Distribution Agencies in the City. Category A Retailers Must Open for Business Promptly Every Day.

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, with the approval of the military authorities, has prepared for the citywide distribution of rationed sugar. The sugar purchase permits for the two concessions have been issued by the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council respectively. The districts of Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, the city center, and Pudong have also been issued permits by the Municipal Grain Management Bureau when the sixth-term household rice was sold to each household. The style is similar to the rice purchase permit, and purchases are made at designated Category A sugar retail stores with the permit. The designated store numbers and addresses are printed on the back of the sugar purchase permit. The various methods, quantities, and prices have been announced by the Cooperative Business Office, and have also been published in various newspapers. Citizens must follow the procedures to purchase sugar from today until the end of this month. During this stipulated period, all Category A sugar retail stores must open for business every day and must not use the sugar purchase as an excuse to sell other goods. The amount must be absolutely accurate and there must be no adulteration. Violators will be severely punished.

City Center Adjustment: Supply Agencies

In order to alleviate the threat to the sugar supply in the city center, the Municipal Grain Management Bureau has prepared for the completion of the household sugar rationing. All household sugar rationing permits have been printed and stamped by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office. In recent days, the Bureau has distributed the permits to households in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and the city center, based on the current population of each district. In the Huxi district, sugar permits also began to be distributed yesterday. It is stipulated that each person will be rationed half a catty of sugar per month, priced at 2.35 yuan in Central Reserve Notes. The sale of sugar will be implemented simultaneously with the two concessions from today (the 11th) to the end of this month and will be widely distributed. From April onwards, the sugar supply agencies in the city center will be completely adjusted by the Grain Management Bureau.

Retail Profits: Equally Distributed

In order to strictly manage the Category A retailers who sell household rationed sugar, the Cooperative Business Office has completed the re-registration of all retailers. The breakdown is as follows: (1) 138 in the Public Concession, (2) 111 in the French Concession, (3) 61 in Nanshi, (4) 65 in Huxi, (5) 65 in Zhabei, (6) Pudong and the city center are entrusted to the Grain Management Bureau for distribution. After review and verification, all unqualified households have been canceled, and qualified ones have been merged. However, the legitimate profits that retailers should receive will be distributed equally among the merged stores, and the Cooperative Business Office will issue registration numbers for them to hang up for identification.

Business Needs: Application Dates

All retailers selling household rationed sugar must strictly abide by the various rules promulgated by the authorities: (1) Sugar must be sold based on the price announced by the Cooperative Business Office, and there must be no unauthorized price increases. (2) There must be no deduction of quantity or adulteration. If there is a violation of the above regulations, citizens are allowed to report to the Cooperative Business Office or the nearest police station for investigation. For the sugar needed for various business purposes after the implementation of household rationing, the Cooperative Business Office will provide special allocations, but only to those who have been approved for registration. The application period is from the 23rd to the 25th of each month. After review and approval, sugar permits will be issued for payment and pickup.

Main Food Retail Rules

In order to maintain the supply of major foodstuffs, the authorities of the two concessions have been rationing rice and flour since July 7th of last year. Miscellaneous grains, cooking oil, and sugar will also be sold on a rationed basis. The respective retail stores have been designated, and the required purchase permits have been issued by the permit-issuing offices. The sale of sugar has been scheduled to start today. However, the retail stores must comply with the regulations in buying and selling, and must not intentionally violate them, otherwise they will be severely punished according to regulations.

Sold in Stages According to Combined Tickets

A Shanghai News Agency reporter learned yesterday that all retail stores must comply with the regulations in buying and selling: (1) Miscellaneous grains, cooking oil, and sugar can only be sold to those who present a combined purchase ticket issued by the Public Concession or the French Concession, and the quantity is limited to what is stated on the combined ticket submitted by the purchaser. (2) Each retail store must only sell if the purchase permit has the store's registration number. (3) In the first phase, retailers can only sell to those with the first combined ticket, and so on for the rest.

Every Period of Sales Must Be Reported

(4) Each combined ticket can only be used in the period indicated by the number on the ticket. If a combined ticket is not used within the period, it will be considered invalid. (5) Each retailer must submit a report of the previous period's sales to the relevant parties on the last day of each period. This report must be submitted together with the returned combined tickets. The quantity sold in each period must match the quantity stated on the returned combined tickets, otherwise a fine will be imposed for exceeding the quantity.

Violations of Regulations Will Be Strictly Investigated

(6) The balance of each retail store's sales in each period will be treated as the retail store's inventory and will be subject to investigation by relevant parties. If there is a shortage, appropriate punishment will be imposed. (7) All retail stores must open for business within the stipulated time. Anyone can bring a purchase permit to purchase from the retail store with the designated number on the ticket during this period.

### East Asia Shipping Company Controls: Sailing Vessel Group Transportation: Responsible for Managing Coastal Sailing Vessel Operations

The relevant parties here are quite hopeful about using sailing vessels to navigate China's coastal routes and increase transportation capacity. It has now been decided that the East Asia Shipping Company will uniformly manage the operation of coastal sailing vessels. The use of sailing vessels has gradually increased in scale recently, and it is necessary to control coastal sailing vessel navigation. The designation of East Asia Shipping Company as the sailing vessel control agency is due to the company's repeated experiments with group transportation of sailing vessels in the past, with excellent results. It is expected that the transportation of materials along the Chinese coast will become smoother as a result.

### Japanese Embassy Secretary Mr. Manabe Talks

The Japanese Embassy Office in Shanghai held its routine meeting with the Shanghai Chinese Journalists' Association at the Hua Mao Building on the eighth floor at 3:00 pm yesterday (10th). More than ten reporters from various newspapers attended. Mr. Manabe, the secretary of the embassy, and Deputy Consul Fukuma attended on behalf of the embassy. Mr. Manabe explained the reasons for the strength of Germany's wartime power.

Long Stay in Germany

Mr. Manabe, the secretary of the Japanese Embassy, ​​served as a Japanese language professor at Leipzig University in Germany from 1933 to 1936 during the reign of German leader Hitler. He has a good understanding of the situation in Germany, especially the economic situation. Mr. Manabe translated German leader Hitler's book "Mein Kampf", which was admired by the Japanese government and the public. Yesterday, Mr. Manabe explained in detail the reasons for the strength of Germany's wartime power, stating that Germany had already prepared for the wartime economy before this European war. Since it broke out in May 1939, it has been victorious every year and invincible in every attack. Before the war, in 1933, it engaged in agricultural production, and the following year it controlled food and no longer relied on foreign supplies, but was able to supply itself. In 1935, it implemented price controls, and in 1936, it began a rationing system. By 1938, its foreign trade exports had reached the highest level. Then the Second European War broke out in 1939.

German Economy

When the European war first started, Britain's observation of Germany was completely wrong. It thought that it could cause Germany to collapse by economically blockading it. In the early days of the European war, it assumed the organization of companies and attempted to buy up food and various raw materials in Southeast Europe as a strategy to control the German economy, but it had no effect in reality. Germany's occupation of Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Greece, etc. is enough to use various huge and rich materials. The coal reserves are abundant, and there is the output of Ninglizia. As for the iron ore problem, at the beginning of the war, there were iron ore mines in France and Poland, and then iron ore mines in Ukraine, Sweden, etc. were captured, and the complete iron-making factories of Poland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France were occupied. As a result, Germany's iron and steel production is comparable to that of the United States. The production of aluminum and manganese itself is quite high, and copper is also self-sufficient. The supply has also been secured in healthy Norway and Yugoslavia. Germany also has abundant zinc reserves. As for Germany's petroleum problem, Romania can produce 7 million tons annually, Galicia produces 1 million tons annually, and Germany itself can produce 500,000 tons annually. There are also three countries, France, Italy and Estonia, which use scientific methods to extract oil from coal.

Total Mobilization Order

Germany has now announced a national mobilization order to vigorously produce military materials. Ordinary factories are ordered to stop production in order to concentrate all efforts on this item. Men from the age of sixteen to sixty-five and women from the age of seventeen to forty-five are all ordered to mobilize. The remaining unimportant shops and food sales are ordered to stop, and employees are transferred to military factories to serve. Finally, Secretary Manabe also said that after the implementation of the total mobilization order, employees of public utilities such as the Berlin subway, street cars, and buses have all been demobilized and entered military service or work in military factories, and women serve as substitutes. This method has already been implemented in Britain and the United States, but in Germany it is only starting with this total mobilization, and 7 million workers from the occupied areas have gone to Germany to work for the Germans, so there is no panic about Germany's manpower resources. People who destroy war materials and control are subject to severe punishment.

### Shanghai Hotel Association: Resolved to Reorganize Yesterday

It is learned that Director Huang Weizhi of the detention center is currently leading all the detainees in batches, under the guidance of technician Kimura, to learn the skills first. Once the technology is mature, they will officially start work and engage in production. The raw materials for manufacturing straw bags are currently being shipped to the detention center one after another. It is estimated that the monthly output is very large.

### Thoroughly Improve the Lives of Civil Servants

— Zhang Yongding

The four characters of "incorruptible politics" have been proposed by many knowledgeable people concerned about the country and its future since the Republic of China. However, until now, we still cannot achieve the elimination of malpractices and maintain a clean and honest government, nor can we achieve complete integrity. What is the reason for this? After my research, it is ultimately due to the following two main factors:

(1) The country has established laws, but they have not been thoroughly implemented.

(2) The lifestyle habits of the general public have not been reasonably adjusted and improved.

Regarding the first point, I believe that it is naturally easier to implement during peacetime, and there is no problem. However, in the current extraordinary period of war, there are still considerations to be made. Because of low salaries and high living costs, some civil servants take risks and do things they shouldn't, but it is truly out of necessity to survive, accounting for half of them. As recently reported, Pan Da, the director of the Shanghai West Police Bureau, encouraged the police to be honest and self-respecting, saying: "Recently, I heard that some police officers are secretly complaining, saying that we police officers receive a monthly salary of ninety-three yuan. If you are single, you can barely get by, but if you have a family, it is very difficult to maintain a living." Indeed, it is really impossible to expect a police officer who earns ninety-three yuan a month to remain incorruptible. No wonder a civil servant surnamed Sun in a certain Hangzhou agency hanged himself because he could not bear the pressure of life. (See the Xin Shen Bao Evening News of the 6th of this month for details.) Guanzi said it well: "Only when clothing and food are sufficient can people know honor and disgrace; only when the granary is full can people know etiquette." Although this is the case, the government is currently in a time of war, and all civil servants should share the difficulties together and use a spirit of hard work to overcome this difficulty.

However, I believe that suicide is the worst and most cowardly option. I sincerely implore everyone with twelve thousand points of sincerity that this kind of thinking should never exist. We must know that there is always a way out. Anyone with a clear mind and a strong physique will not starve to death. Zeng Wenzheng said, "In this chaotic world, even great wealth and high status cannot be relied upon. Only diligence and thrift can last. Although the body is weak, if it can be tempered by wind and frost, it will naturally strengthen bones and broaden knowledge." Therefore, we must be determined that the worse the environment and the more difficult the life, the more we should fight against this bad environment. Only in this way can we be worthy of being a person. Now, please remember the following two optimistic mountain songs, which are "Days are hard to get through, days are hard to get through, days are hard to get through, days pass by day by day. People are hard to be, people are hard to be, the harder people are to be, the more they should be."

In the editorial of the Shen Bao on the 3rd of this month, there is an article about improving the lives of civil servants, which can truly be called a good remedy that is practical and aims to save the country. The general idea is: "The salaries of all civil servants are insufficient to maintain their minimum living standards. The best can only make ends meet, and it is difficult to support a family. For those in the middle and lower ranks, even their own lives cannot be maintained, let alone supporting their families and educating their children. Material life is already difficult, and there is no spiritual comfort. Even if one is as virtuous as Yan Hui, one would probably have to change one's enjoyment. Therefore, most people hold the mentality of 'five-day magistrate of the capital' and no longer focus on government affairs. I hope that the government will immediately improve their treatment, re-determine the salary and allowance amounts for civil servants at all levels, and use the price index of various places as the standard, so that at least they can all support their families and educate their children. At the same time, in terms of spirit, enhance their self-esteem, make them feel the importance of the country's entrustment, and encourage everyone to work hard and dedicate themselves to public service." It also said: "As long as they are honest and dedicated to public service, they should be specially rewarded and publicly promoted as model civil servants. At the same time, in terms of material things, ensure that they have enough to live on. This is our principle of advocating improving and guaranteeing the lives of civil servants." The author believes that if our government can adopt the above-mentioned methods and gradually improve them in a comprehensive plan within the scope of the country's financial resources, I believe that in the near future, our country will definitely be able to achieve a clean and honest government and a vibrant phenomenon. Therefore, to thoroughly promote incorruptible politics, on the one hand, we must govern by law, and on the other hand, we must consider the circumstances, so that their treatment is improved, their lives are stable, and they know how to repay the country.

Speaking of the second point, it is easy to promote, because if a person's life is too wasteful and absurd, even earning a thousand gold a day is not enough to squander. Moreover, at a time when everything is expensive, if one does not strictly control various expenses, one will inevitably end up in a situation where income does not meet expenditure, and thus have to use one's power and dare to act illegally. This is also an inevitable trend. Especially now that our government is promoting the New Movement, we want to revitalize politics, military affairs, education, and everything else. It seems necessary to reasonably adjust and improve the lifestyle habits of the general public (civil servants are also the public). The ancients said: "Customs change people, even the virtuous cannot avoid it." However, there are many aspects of our people's lifestyle habits that are really unreasonable. Government civil servants are accustomed to following the old ways because of their insecure lives and are unwilling to be loyal to the country and serve the people. The people in society are accustomed to pleasure, deceiving each other. Young people are depraved and indulgent, and adults are corrupt and mediocre. The rich are extravagant and frivolous, while the poor are despicable and opportunistic, hoarding and speculating, hoping to make a fortune in times of crisis. As for the general vulgar farmers, because they have less knowledge, they only know how to be superstitious and wait for fate, which is even more unnecessary to talk about. I ask, if everyone in the country only knows how to seek comfort and good fortune, how can the country not be weak and how can society be stable? Therefore, to multiply the lives of our people, protect the stability of our society, and develop the livelihoods of our people, we must quickly sweep away all the above-mentioned bad habits and replace them with reasonable and normal lives. However, in our country's tradition, we either don't talk about integrity, or we must start with government officials, because officials can set an example and guide the people, then the people will naturally be convinced and follow suit. As I write this, I suddenly remembered something that made me feel the most heartbroken and ashamed, that is, several years ago, I remember that Mr. Ozawa Fumio, a professor at the East Asia Dobun Hospital, once published an article in a Japanese newspaper warning the Japanese people not to be seduced by the Chinese, saying: "The reason why the Chinese are prosperous is due to the corrupt politics of the Chinese dynasties. When Japanese people come to China, those who are not determined are mostly seduced by the Chinese and become accustomed to corruption." (The meaning of his article is roughly as I remember it.) Indeed, the corrupt state of Chinese politics in the past was an undeniable fact, which led to the loss of people's faith and the contempt of the international community. This led to a phenomenon of decline and stagnation. Therefore, to make a country prosperous, we must achieve political clarity and social order, so that people in the country will not think of chaos. Even people from foreign countries will have a sense of admiration. Mencius said: "People must insult themselves, then others will insult them; families must kill themselves, then others will destroy them; countries must attack themselves, then others will attack them." This also explains that a person, a family, or a country must work hard to prosper.

Mr. Chen Gongbo, a senior member of the party and state, is one of the most vigorous advocates of incorruptible politics. I remember that after the national government returned to Nanjing, he published an essay entitled: "Incorruptible Politics is the Basic Condition for Peaceful Nation-Building." The article said: "Since the incident, many people in Chongqing have made a lot of money from the national crisis in the name of unified control. People are heartbroken when they talk about these unfilial officials and unfilial merchants. But we can't bear to see the people in Chongqing making money from the national crisis, so how can we bear to stand idly by and watch the people under the rule of the National Government making money from peace? I can't help but loudly call on those who have a heart and ambition to pay attention." In addition, Mr. Zhao Zunyue, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, also published a very meaningful article in the Shanghai Bi-Monthly this year on New Year's Day. He said: "Most people in Shanghai, the strong often despise the law, and lightly talk about public morality. The second is to only seek personal enjoyment, without paying attention to the stability of the whole. The third is to only seek self-interest, but to make more money. The poison of utilitarianism is deeply rooted in people's hearts. All of this, in a small way, is not in line with the current trend and only leads to pain. In a large way, the harm to individuals is small, but the harm to the country is great." After reading the above two paragraphs from Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhao, I think any ambitious Chinese youth will have a great feeling!

Therefore, I believe that in order to make domestic politics clean and honest, and to put all economic, construction, military, and education affairs on track, it is essential to request the government to improve the treatment of civil servants at all levels as much as possible within the scope of the country's financial resources, and to reasonably adjust the lifestyle habits of civil servants. However, to improve the reasonable lives of civil servants, it is even more essential to quickly implement a thrift campaign, because "thrift" is the opposite of "corruption." Those who cannot value thrift cannot be asked to remain incorruptible. The ancients said: "Diligence can make up for clumsiness, and thrift can support integrity." For example, a person who is extremely stupid by nature does not want to find a way to make up for it with diligence. Or a poor person who is accustomed to luxury does not want to use thrift to correct it. In the end, they will definitely end up being more stupid and poorer. China's economic situation now is like a poor person who is accustomed to luxury. On the one hand, they are crying from hunger and cold, and they don't even have food to eat. On the other hand, the poor still desperately want to live their luxurious dreams. It can be said that on the one hand, they are living extravagantly, and on the other hand, they are suffering from hunger and cold. If we don't find a way to save this deformed phenomenon, I think our entire nation's inferior traits will develop to an unimaginable level. "Thrift" was originally our inherent Chinese virtue, but since the material enjoyment of the British and Americans and the lavish lifestyle of spending money like water were brought to China along with the forces of aggression, this morality has gradually disappeared and become non-existent. Now I pick up this excellent virtue of "thrift" that no one wants and has been abandoned by society for a long time and advocate it. Although some people will say that my thinking is outdated, some people will sympathize with my views. Not only sympathize, but also encourage and urge me with letters and telegrams, and ask me to quickly establish a permanent thrift organization. However, I have always tirelessly practiced and cherished it. Now, when the British and Americans have not yet been defeated and the Greater East Asia War has not yet been completed, even if we try our best to save, I am afraid it will be difficult to survive. If we don't save, the future life will be even more unimaginable. The urgency of the need for a thrift campaign in the current situation is indeed the same for everyone. However, the first thing in a thrift campaign is to emphasize practice. It is definitely not just empty talk. We should start with ourselves and then seek it from others. We should start with what is possible and does not take time or money, and then implement it in other aspects. Only in this way can we not lose the true meaning of advocating thrift. The Great Learning says: "Cultivate oneself and then regulate the family, regulate the family and then govern the country, govern the country and then pacify the world." This is the meaning.

### The City is Expediting the Date of Food Distribution to Prevent Interruption of Relief. The 29th Phase of Food Rations Will Be Sold Starting Today.

Zhang Xianzhi, Director of the Municipal Food Administration, in order to effectively rectify the public rice sales in the urban area and ensure timely food distribution, specially convened a meeting of persons in charge of the joint offices of public rice sales in various districts at 4:00 PM yesterday to give instructions on public rice sales. In order to ensure timely food distribution in the future, it has been decided to actively advance the delayed dates, advancing each phase by two days. It is expected that by mid-April, it can be on schedule. It is also hoped that all public rice sales offices will follow the regulations of the Food Administration, pay the funds in advance according to the schedule, and then release the rice to jointly promote the food policy in the urban area.

Sale of Grain Starting Today

According to reports from Datong News Agency reporters, rice shops in the two concessions will start selling food rations at 8:00 AM today. Each rice flour purchase ticket can purchase one and a half sheng of white rice or brown rice, or one sheng of broken rice, sold for 6 yuan and 3 jiao in reserve notes. Twelve liang of flour will be sold for 3 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen in reserve notes.

Flour Bundling

The difference between this phase of food rations and the previous phase is that there is more white rice than brown rice. Some rice shops in the French Concession have all white rice or all whole rice. As for flour, it is divided into two types, No. 2 and No. 3, with one jin and eight liang of No. 2 and four liang of No. 3 bundled together. Residents are advised to pay attention to avoid misunderstandings. The purchase period for this phase of food rations is until the 19th. It will be invalid after the deadline.

All taxpayers designated to receive certificates from this office should go to reissue them. As for the offices outside the racecourse, they are scheduled to reissue oil purchase certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates on the 12th. Therefore, all taxpayers designated to receive certificates from each office should go to reissue them.

### Moving Birthday Feast Expenses to Support Education is Commendable. Mr. Zhu Guangzhao Donates More Than 5,700 Yuan.

Our newspaper received a letter from Mr. Zhu Guangzhao yesterday, stating that he moved the expenses of his birthday feast to support education. He is generous and has demonstrated great enthusiasm. Poor students are deeply grateful. The letter stated that recently, on my birthday, friends planned to hold a banquet to celebrate, but I firmly refused. I believe that in these difficult times, with suffering everywhere, I asked to change the gifts to cash, so that they could be used as scholarships.

Sincerely, Zhu Guangzhao.

Scholarships Received Yesterday

Yesterday, the scholarship funds received included 5,750 yuan in birthday congratulations from friends of Zhu Guangzhao of Yulong Yarn Flower Company and reserve coupons totaling 5,770 yuan in memory of the late Miss Bei, aunt of Pu Qiting.

### Registration of Special Tax Goods Merchants is About to Close

The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance previously required merchants dealing in the six special tax goods of sugar, cosmetics, tung oil, tea, bristles, and poultry feathers to apply for registration in accordance with the regulations. They had set a deadline for collecting forms and applying for registration at No. 6 Bund, the office of the Taxation Department. Later, considering that there were still a few merchants who had not followed the procedure after the deadline, an extension was granted until the 15th of this month as a gesture of consideration. Now that the extension period is only a few days away, it is about to expire and will not be extended again. All merchants who have not yet completed the registration procedures should fill out the form and register within the deadline, otherwise, if the department finds out after the deadline, they will be severely investigated and punished.

### The Emerging Myanmar (4)

— Qinglian

(9) Cultural Life

The Burmese culture, symbolized by the "Seven-Story Pagoda," began to flourish in 1044 AD when King Anawrahta, the first great man among the Burmese emperors, established his capital in Pagan, introduced Buddhist civilization, and encouraged cultural and artistic achievements. The temples built at that time, as well as the textiles and lacquerware handicrafts in the Pagan area, are all famous relics that express Burmese culture. After the demise of the Pagan Dynasty, the history of the Tungu and Mandalay Dynasties underwent changes, but the spirit of maintaining the magnificent vitality of Pagan culture, who says it has not been passed down in the blood of every Burmese today?

As the forces of England and France gradually expanded eastward, Burma eventually became a colonial battlefield. In 1828, England declared war on Burma on a trivial pretext and occupied Yangon, Ma Tongban, Dat Phoi, Bigu, and other places. After the Second War in 1855 and the Third War in 1885, Burma was completely lost, and from then on, the dark age of Burma began. The Anglo-American spirit of the Burmese who had once shocked the East by conquering Assam, Manipur, and Siam was gradually diminished under the cunning appeasement policy of the British, and they indulged in an atmosphere of laziness and ease. However, this was only the case for some members of the Burmese upper class. As mentioned above, most Burmese people continuously carried out anti-British independence movements and national cultural movements, which sprouted and grew in the vast middle and lower classes, becoming a powerful mainstream in the national liberation movement! The unceasing flow of revolutionary blood is irrigating the free flower of Burmese national culture.

The fundamental policy of Japan towards Burmese culture is to first break the "lazy atmosphere" of the Burmese people, and to set an example for East Asian nations to be diligent, thrifty, loyal, and honest. They reject the British-style pragmatism that has been brewing for fifty years and revive the spirit of Oriental morality. For this purpose, they use all propaganda organs and introduce Japanese culture as the first priority. They establish Japanese language schools in all important cities, towns, and villages, striving to introduce the current situation of Japan, promote the Japanese spirit, and promote Japanese culture.

Religion has a great influence in Burma. For the vast majority of people, the monks and Buddhists, it is certainly not suitable to promote politics, but Japan will never give up its responsibility to guide them. As early as July last year, it called on Burmese monks to organize the "Burmese Buddhist Alliance" and instill in them political common sense about building the New East Asian Order and the tasks that Burmese people should shoulder.

The Japanese authorities also strive to absorb the cultural circles. In August last year, they recruited Burmese cultural figures and established the "Burmese Cultural Alliance" to strive for the import of Japanese culture and art. At the same time, they guide key government officials, newspaper and magazine employees, and organize the "Japanese Cultural Research Institute" to introduce the essence of Japanese culture into the lives of Burmese people.

Burma, famous for "no illiteracy," has been educating primary schools by monks, and there are also several thousand national primary schools. The military government worked hard to open all schools on the anniversary of the outbreak of the war on December 8 last year and selected textbooks to adapt to the new situation.

In order to promote education, in order to implement a training plan for elementary, middle and university education, a strong agency was organized. For the first time on October 25, about 1,000 teachers were gathered in Yangon and taught new educational policies to adapt to the Great East Asia War and the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Before the war, Burma had two major broadcasting stations, Yangon and Mandalay. After the Japanese army occupied them, they worked hard to repair them. The Yangon broadcasting station started broadcasting on July 15, making planned broadcasts to the country, especially to India.

In terms of newspapers and magazines, before the war, there were newspapers and magazines everywhere from the capital Yangon to Mandalay, all of which were full of liberal views. After the Great East Asia War developed to Burma, they were successively suspended. Now there are two Burmese newspapers, three Indian newspapers, and one Chinese newspaper in Yangon, all under the guidance of the Japanese military intelligence department, launching a public opinion front to build a new Burma. The two Burmese newspapers are preparing to merge recently in accordance with Japanese policies.

In Myanmar today, whether in politics, military affairs, or economy, it is at the forefront of the Great East Asia War. The movements of Myanmar and the national liberation struggle of the Burmese people will undoubtedly be the focus of attention around the world. Myanmar will not disappoint the expectations of the East Asian nations and the oppressed nations of the world. (The End)

### The District Security Committee Will Be Established on Schedule. It is Planned to Be Held on the Second Floor of the Municipal Government.

The Shanghai Special Municipal Government Security Committee, with a total of twelve members, with Lu Ying, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, as the Chairman of the Committee, has been ordered to start organizing. Since its preparation, it has been completed and the preparation situation has been reported to the Municipal Government. It is understood that the meeting decided to convene a general meeting of all members at 10:00 AM on the 15th of this month to formally establish the meeting. However, the address of the meeting has not yet been arranged, and it is planned to be held on the second floor of the Municipal Government. Yesterday, Mayor Chen was invited to come and speak.

### The Post Office Will Be Closed Tomorrow for Regular Holidays. Office Hours Will Be Scheduled as Usual on Sundays.

The Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice yesterday, stating that the 12th of this month is a regular holiday for the bureau. The office hours of the Japanese Administration and its branches will be scheduled as usual on Sundays. This is urgently announced for public knowledge.

### The Variable Measures for Issuing Licenses to Chinese and Western Doctors Will Be Abolished.

The Ministry of Interior stated that when Chinese and Western medical practitioners apply for ministry certificates, if the qualification documents were lost due to accidents and could not be submitted for certification, two variable certification methods were previously formulated to remedy the situation. Now, the ministry believes that since the return to the capital, it has been three years and all politics have entered the right track. The aforementioned variable measures are no longer applicable. It was ordered to be abolished on March 1 to prevent abuses. The municipal government has approved the consultation order and instructed the Health Bureau to comply.

### Yarn Industry Speculation: Authorities Advocate Severe Punishment, Appeal Against Commutation of Imprisonment to Fines – Even Imprisonment Would Be Just Deserved

The Shanghai Municipal Council, determined to crack down on speculative activities, had issued repeated orders and strict prohibitions. However, it was later discovered that Lianzhong Yarn Shop, Fengda Yarn Shop, Tianyuan Yarn Shop, Fengji Yarn Shop, Yuhua Yarn Shop, Hesheng Yarn Shop, Hu Heji Proof Shop, etc., did not comply with the council's orders and continued to engage in speculation. Therefore, the council, based on the crime of gambling, filed a lawsuit with the Special First Court against the responsible persons of each shop, including Wang Jiazhi, Hu Henian, Wang Xiwen, Chen Shanfen, Yuan Zongzhou, Zhang Yunkang, Zheng Zhongren, Luo Jingxian, Sun Zhenlin, Xia Wenda, and Yan Zhaotang.

Sentences of Imprisonment and Fines Imposed

After investigation and trial, Wang Jiazhi and Hu Henian were each sentenced to six months imprisonment and fined 1,500 yuan. Wang Xiwen and Chen Shanfen were each sentenced to five months imprisonment and fined 1,200 yuan. Yuan Zongzhou, Zhang Yunkang, Zheng Zhongren, and Luo Jingxian were each sentenced to four months imprisonment and fined 1,000 yuan. Sun Zhenlin, Xia Wenda, and Yan Zhaotang were each sentenced to two months imprisonment and fined 800 yuan. If the execution of the imprisonment proved difficult, it would be commuted to a fine at the rate of three yuan per day. After the judgment, except for Wang Jiazhi, Sun Zhenlin, Zheng Zhongren, and Luo Jingxian, who expressed dissatisfaction and filed an appeal, the remaining judgments were final and executed according to law.

Commutation Approved, Authorities Appeal

The defendants all submitted statements stating their difficulties, requesting that the imprisonment be commuted to fines. The court approved these requests. However, the legal department of the Shanghai Municipal Council argued that the defendants' involvement in speculative activities had a significant and profound impact on the people's livelihood. The council had repeatedly advised them to stabilize prices, but the defendants only sought profit and turned a deaf ear. If they were not punished with imprisonment, it would be insufficient to deter future offenders. Now, the defendants merely submitted statements claiming difficulties and were immediately granted commutation. It should be known that the defendants' profession is harmful to society, and they have already obtained huge profits. Even if they were imprisoned, their families would not be significantly affected. Therefore, their claims of various difficulties related to family and profession are insufficient to be accepted. The department appealed against the ruling to allow the commutation of imprisonment to fines.

Yarn Industry Leader Answers Inquiries

As for the appeal case of Wang Jiazhi and the other four, the criminal division chief of the Second High Court held a collegiate panel yesterday to hear the case. The court ordered the summoning of Tang Zhiliang, chairman of the Yarn Industry Association, as a witness to inquire about the sale and purchase of yarn and cloth by various yarn shops. Tang replied that according to the association's articles of association, transactions among fellow traders were limited to spot goods. He also answered the court's inquiry about the location of trading among fellow traders after the closure of the exchange, saying that because fellow traders lacked a place to meet after the exchange closed, the association had opened a space for meetings, but the settlement of transactions took place in the shops of each fellow trader. The court then briefly questioned the appellants, ordered the start of arguments, and the lawyer representing the Shanghai Municipal Council advocated for strict investigation. The court then announced the end of the arguments and scheduled a date for the pronouncement of the verdict.

### Postal Administration Actively Restoring Remittances to Various Places: Ningbo Can Remit 500 Yuan

Since the Shanghai Postal Administration has been making every effort to restore remittances to various places, remittances have been restored to Tunxi, Yixian, Hankou, Jiujiang, and other places. However, the maximum remittance amount is limited to 50 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the restoration of remittances in the commercial area of Zhejiang is still being planned, although efforts are being made to do so. It is understood that the only place in the Zhejiang postal area currently offering remittances is Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang, where each remittance order can be for 100 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, with a limit of five orders at a time. The neighboring counties of Yuyao, Zhenhai, Cixi, and Fenghua do not offer remittances.

### Food Production Increase Meeting: Director of the Grain Administration Attends

The Ministry of Food, in order to understand the past grain administration situation in various provinces and cities and to plan future promotion methods, is scheduled to hold a food production increase meeting at the ministry on March 15. The municipal government of this city has received this notice and has sent Zhang Xianzhi, director of the Grain Administration Bureau, to attend the meeting.

### Shanghai Electric Tramway Company: Additional Route Supervisors to Eliminate Delays and Stoppages

The Shanghai Electric Tramway Company in the Public Concession strives to improve its service to the community. The anti-pickpocketing campaign held last year, the restoration of through service on Tram Route 18 between the two concessions, and the ban on smoking inside the tramcars have all benefited the community. Recently, in order to facilitate the adjustment of tram routes and prevent delays and stoppages, so as to ensure smooth tram operation, the company has added "route supervisors," who are assigned from ticket inspectors and are responsible for route adjustments.

### Creation of the Chinese Education Morality Society's Orphanage

The Chinese Education Morality Society on Tongfu Road has established an orphanage to help orphans who have lost their parents. Due to the high cost of living in Shanghai, the society has surveyed a site of more than 50 mu at the old site of Zhiyuan in Dongyaowan, Wuxi, as the location for the orphanage. Construction and repairs are currently underway, and once completed, the orphanage will begin accepting orphans. The society has also purchased 100 mu of public land, the proceeds of which will be used as operating expenses. However, as it is just starting, funds are urgently needed, and the society appeals for donations from all sectors. The society also recognizes the suffering of the poor and has not yet alleviated it. Therefore, it continues to carry out spring relief work, distribute porridge, and operate mobile soup kitchens, providing relief to more than 1,000 poor people every day. Other charitable acts, such as providing Chinese and Western medical treatment, dispensing medicine, and providing small loans to the poor, are still being actively carried out.

### Caohejing to Establish a Beggar Reception Center to be Managed by the Red Swastika Society

In this city, the cost of living has been rising daily in recent years, leading many poor citizens to become beggars. As a result, beggars are visible everywhere in the city, which is not only related to the appearance of the city but is also truly pitiful.

Providing Simple Handicraft Industry

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the authorities of the two concessions, recognizing the seriousness of the beggar problem on the streets, are currently working on establishing a vagrant skills training center. The location is planned for Caohejing in the suburbs. The center plans to first provide simple handicrafts, such as straw rope weaving, so that beggars can start producing as soon as they enter the center.

Specifically Accepting Adult Beggars

It is heard that the preparatory work is being planned by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, and other relevant authorities, including the reception and management of beggars, which may be handled by the Red Swastika Society. The Shanghai Municipal Council already has a reception center located on Hardoon Road, but currently, it only accepts child beggars and lost children. There is a lack of reception facilities for older beggars. It is expected that after the establishment of the reception center, the number of beggars on the streets of this city will gradually decrease.

Opening of the YMCA Solicitation Campaign

The Shanghai YMCA is purely a social service organization that has a proven track record of undertaking social welfare projects. The association holds an annual solicitation campaign to raise funds to cover its annual operating expenses. Today, the 43rd solicitation campaign was launched at noon on the ninth floor of the YMCA building in the Eight Immortals Bridge. More than 300 guests were present. Sun Ruihuang served as chairman. After the meal, he reported on the opening of the meeting. Yan Huiqing and Lin Kanghou then gave speeches in succession, which were earnest and encouraging. Qu Yaokang gave a reply on behalf of the guests. The meeting adjourned at about 2 p.m. The total target of this solicitation campaign is 300,000 yuan, plus 100,000 yuan in donations, divided into 100 teams, with each team aiming for 3,000 yuan. The first announcement will be held on the 12th, and the closing ceremony will be held on April 2. With few days left, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate generously to help them succeed and benefit the youth of the community.

Yesterday's newspaper broadcasting time was 7:25.

### Establishing a Decisive Battle System and Strengthening Political Power: New Measures by the North China Political Affairs Commission

China's participation in the war is a historical transformation. Taking this opportunity, the relationship between the North China Political Affairs Commission and the National Government will be adjusted and strengthened. At the same time, the North China Political Affairs Commission itself will also work hard to strengthen itself. On this basis, it will promote all policies that adapt to the new Sino-Japanese relationship. Since the National Government's participation in the war, there have been many innovative events between Beijing and Nanjing: the organizational regulations of the North China Political Affairs Commission and various general departments and bureaus have been determined, North China has participated in planning the National Economic Commission and the New Movement Promotion Association, Chairman Wang has assumed the position of honorary chairman of the New People's Society, and the establishment of a unified national war system and the abolition of the five-color flag that replaced the national flag have also been gradually realized. The problem of the Suhuai area has some problems unresolved because it is necessary to adjust general laws. However, all political issues pending between Central China and North China have been resolved, further strengthening the connection between the National Government and the North China Political Affairs Commission.

At the same time, the North China Political Affairs Commission implemented a reorganization, with Zhu Shen succeeding as chairman, refreshing the lineup, reorganizing the wartime system, and strengthening the political power of the Political Affairs Commission. Japan, based on its established national policy, is lending full cooperation to create a China for the Chinese people and achieve the true goal of Sino-Japanese cooperation.

One month after the National Government's participation in the war, Japan implemented the lifting of military management relations for 59 factories on February 8. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood under the National Government's rule, the Japanese army in North China again lifted military management for 54 factories related to people's livelihood, such as cotton cloth, wheat flour, textiles, and electricity. In order to strengthen the National Government's war capabilities after participating in the war and to show the spirit of living and dying together, it implemented the third lifting of military management relations for all factories under military management, clearly expressing the principle of respecting the National Government's sovereignty. On February 9, 749 new enemy properties related to the Greater East Asia War were transferred to the Chinese side, and all the enormous rights and interests of enemy countries such as Britain and the United States in North China were also transferred to the Chinese side.

The special agencies established after the incident to handle general affairs between China and Japan transferred matters related to Japanese residents and the movement of materials to the Consulate General for handling from March 1. At the same time, it was decided that all matters involving Chinese administration would also be transferred to the Chinese side for management. In the future, the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the provinces and counties will be solely responsible for approval and progress by the Chinese side.

Another major change is that the maintenance of public order, which has always been the responsibility of the Japanese army, will also be handed over to the Chinese side. In this way, the Japanese army can concentrate on combat, and the police force can support the construction of the new China from the sidelines. This measure is closely related to strengthening the Chinese side's national defense system and is of great importance.

After the implementation of the new policy, the problem of the nature of the New People's Society has undergone an epoch-making transformation. The New People's Society was established after the China Incident and is a popular organization that practices Sino-Japanese cooperation. In addition to the Japanese vice chairman, there are many Japanese employees participating in the work. Since Chairman Ando Kisaburo resigned, the supreme advisor system has been adopted to promote work, spare no effort, and contribute greatly to the construction of North China. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, many people believed that in order to adapt to the new situation and accelerate the society's affairs, it was necessary to further clarify the nature of the New People's Society. However, some people disagreed with this proposal, arguing that the original nature should be maintained. Although there were different opinions within the society, in principle, they were all for the good of the overall development.

Later, the military department gave a clear definition, eliminating the outside world's doubts about the nature of the New People's Society, which has a great contribution to future work. In order to show that it is a New People's Society that is truly Chinese, about 2,000 Japanese employees have mostly withdrawn, leaving only a few in the position of advisors or technical guidance. The responsibility for the society's affairs has been very clearly demonstrated in fact.

After the policy shift in North China, various policies have been implemented successively. In addition, the most important part after the abolition of extraterritoriality is the economic adjustment, and the method is currently being studied. After Japan's shift in policy towards China, all matters concerning the construction of a new China will be entirely decided and carried out by the Chinese side, establishing the foundation of the political power of the North China Political Affairs Commission. How the Chinese side will concretely promote Sino-Japanese cooperation in various policies in the future is what must be done earnestly. The recent reorganization was also for this purpose.

Under this new situation, Chairman Zhu Shen, who resolutely took office with heavy responsibility, said in his inaugural declaration:

"The most important issue at present is the development of industry, and the food problem is even more urgent. We will take full responsibility for handling the price problem, the transportation problem, and various other problems, and hope that our ally Japan will provide more assistance." The above words show the premise of strengthening political power.

A certain person who is familiar with Japan criticized this policy shift as being very clever. He compared the current state of Sino-Japanese relations to a patient with severe chills and fever, saying:

"For example, with chills and fever of 39 degrees, this measure has only the effect of reducing the chills and fever by one degree. But holding the normal temperature of 38 degrees, in order to create a close Sino-Japanese friendly relationship like after the Russo-Japanese War, the first thing is to get rid of stable people's livelihood, that is, to implement the Mahayana policy using the Hinayana. It is most important." The above analogy is probably the general view of the Chinese side on the policy shift. Because the most important issue in North China now is to solve the price and food problems. The cost of living is rising, prices are soaring, and some speculative behavior is also one of the reasons for fueling the rising wind.

The reason why prices are rising so much is, of course, speculative psychology and hoarding. It not only stimulates the soaring of food prices, but also hinders the smooth flow of general materials. For this trend, China and Japan are working together from the aspects of materials and circulation of currency to properly prepare measures. For this reason, the North China Political Affairs Commission specially reorganized the Price Adjustment Committee and the Materials Processing Committee, and newly established the North China Materials and Price Processing Committee, attaching the Food Administration Bureau and the Materials Balance Fund Operation Committee here to seek unified processing of materials and prices.

In the current decisive battle period, in order to overcome difficulties, promote the construction of North China, and achieve the mission of meeting the needs of the public, it is necessary to see the results of the conversion policy. There are still many thorns ahead. The biggest mission of North China in the war period is to maintain public order and increase the production of important resources. Contributing to enhancing the combat power to destroy Britain and the United States in the position of a belligerent, Chairman Zhu said at the beginning of his inauguration that China and Japan should cooperate to exert comprehensive combat power, showing the determination to deal with the serious situation. In the future, it is necessary to make the Chinese people understand the national consciousness in wartime, use resolute determination and practical strength to overcome these difficulties, exert the highest political power of the North China Political Affairs Commission, promote all policies, and adhere to the meaning of Sino-Japanese living and dying together to the end.

### After the Severing of Ocean Trade, Argentina Will Regulate Economic Institutions

Argentina has been little affected by the war amidst global turmoil, but recently its agricultural and industrial sectors have inevitably been affected by the waves. Since the United States announced that it would no longer send ships to Argentina, there was no ship entering or leaving the port of Buenos Aires for a day and night, which is unprecedented in a century. It is understood that Argentina has always been a supplier of raw materials to various warring countries, so it has uniquely enjoyed wartime prosperity, especially the goods shipped to the United Kingdom. The goods shipped to the United Kingdom are mainly meat, wheat, and fur. Before the outbreak of the European War, Argentina's meat exports were about 450,000 tons, and no less than 6 million cattle were slaughtered each year, and the wheat shipped to the United Kingdom also reached 6 million pounds per year. There is no doubt that the United Kingdom wants to maintain trade relations with Argentina. However, Argentina's goods shipped to the United Kingdom are mostly bulky items, requiring large tonnage, and there are submarines lurking in the Atlantic Ocean from time to time, so British-Argentine trade is greatly affected. The economic relationship between the United States and Argentina is not as important as the relationship between the United Kingdom and Argentina. Although the goods that the United States ships to Argentina rank second in Argentina's imports, the United States purchases very limited goods from Argentina, far below those of various European countries. This is because the agricultural products of the United States are mostly the same as those of Argentina. The economic relationship between Argentina and the United States was not very important in the past, but in recent years, due to neutral relations, it has also gained some benefits until recently, after the severing of ocean trade, it had to adjust its domestic economic institutions to adapt to the new situation. The Argentine government, in view of the fact that American fuel oil cannot be imported, is trying its best to develop the oil fields in the Keringto Rolivaldavia region. Last year, the oil production in the region was 15 million barrels, but it is still not enough for domestic consumption, so it was decided to refine linseed oil to replace it. It happened that linseed has been unable to be exported in recent years, so refining it into oil can be regarded as waste utilization. In addition, an agreement has recently been established with Bolivia, stipulating that Argentina will exchange wheat for Bolivian oil, and it is currently conducting business negotiations with Brazil, hoping to import cotton from Brazil to replace American cotton. Not only that, after the Argentine government nationalized its merchant ships, it is actively engaged in shipbuilding to develop ocean transportation. President Castillio intends to expand industry to achieve self-sufficiency, but the machinery depends on the supply from the United Kingdom and Germany. Recently, due to the interruption of sources, its construction plan will inevitably be affected to some extent. In short, due to the impact of the war, Argentina's overseas trade has plummeted, so it has to conduct negotiations with South American countries, especially neighboring countries, in order to exchange what they have for what they need and promote economic development. (Havas Lisbon, 9th)

Economic Commentary

### Commentary on Speculative Capital

Yesterday, the China Intelligence Department published an article reviewing the outlet of speculative capital in Shanghai, which roughly stated, "It goes without saying that speculative capital is rampant in this city. Today, with the increasing strengthening of control, where will speculative capital seek an outlet, which is worth studying. Here are the main points: (1) Important daily necessities such as food and clothing are mostly materials with fixed public prices. Funds invested in this area will inevitably flow to the non-controlled sector in the future. (2) The prices of Chinese stocks are rising daily due to the rising prices of goods stored in various factories and the improvement of machinery and equipment evaluations. Currently, a large amount of capital is flowing into the stock market. (3) Land and buildings are the safest investment targets. Although rents are restricted, buying and selling is very free. After the removal of enemy nationality, real estate transactions will inevitably be more prosperous than before. Therefore, trust companies whose main business is buying and selling real estate have recently seen a significant increase. (4) Today, the investment targets in Shanghai are not as wide as before. In view of this situation, more funds will flow to the inland in the future."

This passage is indeed worthy of review and is a point worthy of attention by current entrepreneurs. First, controlled products have publicly determined prices, and the rationing system is gradually being implemented, so it is certainly impossible to operate in the future. Even if you want to operate the buying and selling of materials, you have to focus your sights on the non-controlled sector. Second, Chinese factories are increasing in value in a chain reaction with rising house, property, machinery, raw materials, and assets, and their asset value is increasing, which is an inevitable fact. Therefore, the value of Chinese stocks is increasing accordingly, which is also an internal fact of Qiao Li. If the factory is officially registered in accordance with laws and regulations and its operation is rationalized, then the increase in its price is also an appropriate result. It is hoped that each stock company will organize a formal market, operate normal transactions, and legal transactions, and all actions should be subject to the trade association, then society may not be able to use this transaction to help the progress of industry. As it is a legitimate business, it has legitimate protection. Third, real estate is the biggest outlet for investment. In the past, real estate operators were too adventurous, or could not be universal, and were manipulated by a few real estate developers. If legitimate business companies or trust companies come forward to preside over in the future, then land and its buildings were the safest investment target. It is indeed a major destination for speculative capital. Fourth, it is the operation of inland rural undertakings. All small-scale industries, handicrafts, and rural by-products can be invested in and managed, so that in addition to self-sufficiency, the rural areas can also export local products to other ports in exchange for daily necessities. If this is the case, then after the funds flow into the inland, they will still have to return to the city. These are all the best ways to use speculative capital and are worthy of our advocacy.

### The Fifth Anniversary of the Joint Reserve Bank: Minister Zhou Delivers a Speech and Expresses Gratitude to Allied Assistance

(Nanjing, 10th, Central News Agency) The Joint Reserve Bank of China in North China has reached its fifth anniversary. On this anniversary, Minister Zhou of the National Government's Ministry of Finance delivered a special speech, expressing gratitude and expectations regarding the government's re-signing of the Joint Reserve Bank loan agreement with allied banking groups. His speech is as follows: "Looking back, the Joint Reserve Bank of China has now been in operation for five years. Its business has grown daily, and its credit has become increasingly apparent. The banknotes it issues are trusted by the general public. This is due to the sound organization and dedicated service of the bank, and the various forms of assistance from allied nations have also been a major factor in its development. For the sake of economic recovery, our government especially hopes that the bank will serve as an important financial center in the North. During this period of the Greater East Asia War, the bank's position in the Northern financial sector is becoming increasingly important. The views held by the allied nations are exactly the same as those of our government. Therefore, the 100 million yuan loan originally contracted with allied banking groups at the time of the bank's establishment has now matured. Another 100 million yuan has been added, forming a loan of 200 million yuan. The government and allied banking groups have re-signed the agreement to provide for the development of the bank's business. With this huge amount of capital, the circulation of its banknotes and the credit of its finance will inevitably become more developed, and the foundation of its parity with the Japanese yen will also become increasingly firm. The mission that the government expects of the bank will surely be accomplished. Today, on the occasion of the bank's fifth anniversary, I am making the above speech and expressing my sincere gratitude to the allied nations for their assistance."

### Economic Advisor Ishiwatari Returns to Nanjing from Fukuoka

(Tokyo, 9th, Central News Agency) Economic advisor Ishiwatari of the National Government, after returning to his country from Fukuoka for previous discussions with the Japanese government, has now completed his official duties and took a plane from Fukuoka at 9:30 this morning to return to his post in Nanjing. In addition, the third director of the Japanese Information Bureau, Mr. Qu, will also accompany advisor Ishiwatari to China for an inspection.

### Banking and Financial Industries Determine Lending Principles Through Self-Governance

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) In order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the Ministry of Finance recently issued three articles of restrictive lending measures, ordering all banking and financial industries to comply, in order to completely eliminate the rampant lending business of banking and financial industries and prevent the trend of hoarding and speculation. Minister Zhou also made a statement to reporters regarding the restriction of lending by the banking and financial industries, stating that if the Banking and Financial Industries Association cannot effectively restrict its fellow traders through self-governance, the government will take necessary measures to order the Financial Affairs Inspection Office to conduct a review of various loans. It is understood that after receiving the order, the Banking and Financial Industries Association has issued a circular to all firms in the name of the Banking and Financial Industries Joint Committee to comply.

### Chinese Stock Firms Organize Association, Register and Obtain Licenses in Accordance with the Law

In order to crack down on securities speculation, the authorities have stipulated that anyone engaged in the securities business must obtain permission and a business license, and be allowed to operate under the supervision of the authorities. All stock companies that have not been authorized have been temporarily closed and their operations suspended. Recently, in order to comply with laws and regulations, companies and firms engaged in stock trading have united their fellow traders, organized sound institutions, and are preparing to organize a trade association, and register with the regulatory authorities in accordance with the law. The authorities will establish a Chinese Stock Review Committee to review the stocks listed on the market. In the future, all stock companies will operate their businesses in full compliance with the "Chinese Stock Trading Restriction Rules" promulgated by the government.

### Insurance Industry Organizes Joint Insurance Company

There are 81 insurance companies in the city, 24 of which were established before December 8th of the previous year, with a total capital of 16,065,000 yuan. The other 57 companies were established after December 8th, with a total capital of 52,362,500 yuan, totaling 68,427,500 yuan. The total number of companies is 81, but the total capital is only more than 60 million yuan, which is not healthy. Previously, because most insurance companies reinsured with British and American insurance companies, if a major compensation event occurred, the Chinese insurance industry would not be seriously affected. Now that British and American companies have closed down, applying for reinsurance is not as convenient as before. Therefore, if a huge compensation event occurs, small-scale insurance companies are in danger of collapsing. Powerful insurance companies in this city, in view of this, have specially jointly organized a Chinese Joint Insurance Company to take over reinsurance as its main business. This is a move by the Chinese insurance industry to seek independence, which is very noteworthy.

### China Economic Research Association Expands Organization; China Economic Research Institute Merges

The China Economic Research Institute was initiated by Lin Kanghou, secretary-general of the Banking Association of this city, and others in July of last year. Dr. Li Quanshi was hired as the director, and he devoted himself to economic research, achieving remarkable results. In addition, the China Economic Research Association was also established in the winter of last year. Zhou Zuomin, chairman of Jin Cheng Bank, and others enriched the research work and expanded the scope of research, making it necessary to merge the organizations. After several exchanges of opinions, and on the 9th, both parties held a meeting to discuss and decide to merge the organizations, calling it the China Economic Research Association. Zhou Zuomin was elected as the chairman of the board of directors, Li Shengbo and Wu Zhenxiu were elected as standing directors, and Yao Qingsan was elected as the director of the secretariat. Part of the China Economic Research Institute was transformed into the research department of the association, and Li Quanshi was still hired as the director. It started working on the same day. It is reported that it will actively expand economic research work.

### Establishment of New Banks Temporarily Postponed for Merger; Loans from Financial Institutions Have Been Restricted

Since the autumn of last year, a large number of new banks and financial institutions have been established in this city. The authorities, in view of this phenomenon, considered it to be a morbid development in the financial industry. Therefore, they once considered merging some of the newly established banks. All parties are extremely concerned about this matter. Recently, the authorities have formulated detailed measures for adjusting the finances of this city and cracking down on hoarding and speculation, and for restricting the lending of banks and financial institutions, so that merchants engaged in hoarding goods cannot use the funds of banks and financial institutions. Once this method is implemented, the trend of hoarding in this city can be eliminated. Therefore, the merger of newly established banks can be temporarily postponed.

### North China and Manchukuo Jointly Hold Economic Conference

Beijing, March 9th, Central News Agency - In order to promote transportation between North China and Manchukuo and to coordinate the economic policies of the two regions, the authorities of North China and Manchukuo have decided to jointly hold an economic conference starting on March 11th to discuss everything. The meeting is scheduled to last for three days. It is also learned that the authorities of North China and Central China also plan to convene a similar economic conference between them at the end of March.

### Authorities Crack Down on Trust Companies Concurrently Engaging in Lending

In order to suppress prices, the authorities have repeatedly ordered various banks and financial institutions to recall all loans that do not involve production, in order to tighten the money supply in the market, so that speculators cannot mobilize funds and no longer interfere with the market. The authorities, in view of the fact that several large trust companies in this port also have bank shares and are engaged in lending business to merchants in various industries, believe that this type of business clearly exceeds the normal scope of trust company business and that it is necessary to crack down on it. Therefore, in addition to strictly ordering the company to comply with the "Regulations on the Management of Financial Institutions" promulgated by the government, they also ordered each company to automatically revoke its banking department business from today and to recover the loans that have been issued as soon as possible.

### Yarn Industry Sets Deadline for Members to Re-register

Retailers who formally operate retail yarn shops can also collect a registration form from the association. Two copies of the form must be accompanied by supporting documents and submitted to the association for review by the 15th of this month. Those who fail to do so by the deadline will be deemed to have automatically waived their rights and will not be allowed to join.

### Hangzhou City Government Prevents Soaring Prices

In the past two months, prices in Hangzhou have been soaring, especially the price of daily necessities, which has risen dramatically, with some rising several times, which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. The reason for this? Although the source is scarce, the hoarding and speculation of unscrupulous merchants and holding goods at high prices is also a major reason. Because the foreign companies that distribute goods in this city only distribute to a few wholesale merchants, and the wholesale merchants arbitrarily raise prices and engage in the black market privately after obtaining the goods. Retailers have to purchase goods from the black market in order to maintain their business, and sell them on the black market. The sufferers are the general public. Therefore, to suppress prices, it is necessary to implement a universal distribution system, and it should be done immediately, without delay. It is now known that the Hangzhou City Government, in view of the rising prices in recent days and the anxiety of the public, believes that if it is not strictly controlled, the impact will be significant. It has specially dispatched price investigation teams to investigate. If there are any stores hoarding and speculating, the goods will be reported and dealt with. It has been working strictly in recent days and has already found several stores.

### The Importance of Income Tax in National Tax Revenue

— Chen Ze

Income tax is a good tax for the country, which has long been recognized by the world. Looking at the proposal to implement income tax in our country, it dates back to the end of the Qing Dynasty, but it has been more than 30 years since then, and it has not been implemented. Although it has been discussed and promulgated several times in the middle, it was not until July of the 24th year of the Republic of China that the Ministry of Finance decided to levy income tax to make up for the shortfall in tax revenue and the reduction in national treasury revenue. Therefore, in July and August of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the "Provisional Income Tax Regulations" and "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations" were promulgated successively. At this point, there was a small amount of income tax revenue in the financial tax revenue of our country. Soon after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the implementation of income tax was once again suspended invisibly. Therefore, in fact, the position of income tax in our country's tax revenue is very small.

Since the National Government returned to the capital, it has strived to reform finance, and the announcement of the method of levying income tax has been made. It is expected that soon, income tax will become the most important tax revenue in our country. However, the general public is afraid that there are still reasons for not understanding the income tax that should be promoted. Therefore, it is necessary to promote and explain the public opinion, so as to achieve universal understanding.

Income tax, in short, is a tax levied based on the income of individuals or companies. The reason why it is promoted as a good tax system is nothing more than the following reasons:

(1) Universal burden - Tax payment is the obligation of the people. Income tax is levied on the basis of the size of income. Anyone, except those whose income does not meet the tax standard, is subject to taxation. Therefore, income tax is not as limited to local areas as other direct taxes (such as land tax only applies to farmers), and cannot be universal.

Fair burden - Various indirect taxes, such as unified tax, stamp tax, and salt tax, are all proportional taxes. Therefore, from the perspective of the tax-paying ability of the rich and poor classes, the rich bear less burden, while the poor bear more burden, which is very unfair. As for income tax, it is different, because its tax rate is calculated progressively. The larger the income, the higher the tax rate. Therefore, each person's tax burden is increased or decreased in proportion to their tax-paying ability, so it is in line with the principle of tax fairness.

(3) Elasticity - The state determines its expenditure based on its income. Only when the revenue is elastic can the expenditure be increased or decreased at will. Modern international relations are complex, and changes in expenditure often undergo great changes due to wars or other reasons. Therefore, the revenue of taxes should be elastic. The income tax rate is the most convenient to adjust, and the elasticity of its tax revenue is also the strongest. Therefore, the state can increase or decrease its tax rate according to its financial needs.

(4) Sufficient tax source - Income tax is

a national tax levied universally. The source of its tax revenue comes from the income of all the people. Therefore, it goes without saying that the tax revenue is sufficient.

(5) Tax revenue is certain - In addition to a sufficient tax source, the purpose of national taxation is to ensure the certainty of tax revenue. If there is no certainty in the revenue, the budget is difficult to make. Income tax is a direct tax, which comes from the income of all the people. Therefore, even if there is an emergency, its revenue will not be as uncertain as other tax revenues.

(6) Suitable for financial tax revenue in extraordinary times - In extraordinary times, the government's expenditure will inevitably increase sharply. In addition to issuing public bonds and using inflation to raise war funds, increasing the tax rate is also an inevitable method. However, there are two types of tax increases: direct and indirect. Indirect taxes are levied at proportional tax rates. Increasing indirect taxes not only violates the principle of tax fairness, but also causes an uneven tax burden on the people due to the prolongation of the war. On the contrary, income tax is a direct tax, and its tax rate is a progressive rate system. In addition, it has very good elasticity, so it is of course very suitable for use in extraordinary times.

Taking into account the above points, there is no doubt that income tax is a good tax system. Looking at various countries, the income from income tax accounts for a large part of the national tax revenue. According to the survey, income tax accounts for 50.7% of the national tax revenue in the United States, 43.3% in the United Kingdom, 30.1% in France, 10.2% in Japan, 14.2% in Italy, and 23.6% in Germany. Looking back at our country, the main tax revenues in the past were indirect taxes such as customs duties, salt tax, and unified tax, while the levying of income tax is still a recent measure. All our people should work together, and we hope that the government authorities can pay the greatest attention to the investigation and supervision of income tax and find ways to promote a sound accounting system.

### Italy Relies on Germany for Steel in Wartime Economy

Berlin, March 9th, Haitong News Agency - Italy's wartime economic resistance is quite strong. The supply of food, clothing, and even coal and iron to the people has not been interrupted. In the industrial sector, there is a constant lack of raw materials. For example, Italy needs 14 million tons of coal every year, but now it can only supply 5 million tons by itself. For example, it needs 2.5 million tons of steel every year, but only two-thirds of this amount can be supplied by itself. But the shortage can be supplied by Germany.

### Self-Sacrifice for the Group

— Hong Ying

Throughout the history of China and foreign countries, there have been countless scientists, revolutionaries, politicians, doctors..., who sacrificed their lives in order to relieve the suffering of the masses and seek the eternal happiness of mankind.

Lincoln fought tirelessly for the freedom of black slaves, Edison buried himself in the laboratory all day long for the happiness of mankind; Wilson appealed and traveled everywhere for world peace. Their hearts are broad, their vision is far-sighted, and they do not take their own happiness as the purpose of life. They can think of millions of people, always remember the many people around them who are suffering; they have justice, blood, sympathy, and they have the spirit of self-sacrifice for the group!

There are fewer happy people and more suffering people in the world. Many people are living like beasts of burden due to various oppressions; they have lost their freedom and do not have the rights they should enjoy; their lives are forever lost in the abyss of darkness and pain. But, they want happiness! They want freedom! They yearn for the help and sympathy of righteous people.

Young friends, we should not have the selfish and self-interested concept of the individual self. Our lives belong to the masses; we should work hard for the masses, we should have the spirit of self-sacrifice for the group, and do our best to liberate the suffering people!

### Nietzsche's Gift to Wagner (Part 1)

— By Lincoln Schuster, Translated by Gu Xin

—One of the Letters of World-Renowned Artists

Foreword: When Friedrich Nietzsche was a young man, he became friends with Richard Wagner, who was thirty years his senior and a central figure in German culture. Nietzsche, the young and arrogant philosopher, was then composing music on the piano and deeply admired Wagner's achievements. He once said, "Without music, life is a mistake."

Wagner had a tremendous influence on Nietzsche's life. They first met when Wagner was living near Basel, and Nietzsche was teaching classical philosophy at the University of Basel. They spent Christmas together in 1869, with Wagner as the host and teacher, and Nietzsche as his disciple.

Encouraged by Wagner, Nietzsche began writing his first book, "The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music." He secluded himself in a house at the foot of the Alps, quietly contemplating, forming the core of his thought, which eventually developed into the theme of his entire philosophy: "For the first time, I felt that the most powerful and noble will in life is not manifested in struggling for survival, but in the will to war, the will to power, and the will to conquer."

Nietzsche praised Wagner as "another Aeschylus, restoring mythology and symbols, and uniting the joy of incense and drums in the Dionysian ecstasy… a Siegfried who never knew what fear meant…" He paid devout homage to the Bayreuth opera festival, regarding it as "a sign of vigor full of vigor for the expedition."

However, soon, this young hero worshiper became fond of criticism, delving into everything, which gradually changed his views. At that time, Wagner completed "The Ring of the Nibelungs," achieving "supreme victory," and kings and ministers from all over the world paid homage to him, while Nietzsche, with his apocalyptic vision, saw directly behind the stage: he was shaken and horrified by what he saw. He thought that a knight-errant like Siegfried had become a high priest like Parsifal; and since he was unwilling to be a novice anymore and had fully matured in philosophy, he refused to burn incense. But Wagner openly and arrogantly demanded that he burn incense. Thus, the famous dispute between Nietzsche and Wagner began, and their opinions grew deeper and deeper until the two old friends broke off relations.

Finally, Nietzsche quietly abandoned his gods and heroes, declaring that he "deeply loathed all feminine qualities and random actions, which exist in romanticism, ideal lies, and the softening of human conscience, which had succumbed to someone among the bravest people."

This scholarly discord was now irreconcilable. Now Wagner lived in Sorrento, working on an opera starring Parsifal, and Nietzsche lived next door to him; they did not even exchange a word. The young man who was once a vassal was now a discordant philosopher, without any sympathy for the once-popular musical master. He thought Wagner was a traveling charlatan, only praising "pity, sexless love, Jesus's foolishness." This statement was actually the cause of Nietzsche's extreme conflict with the new opera—in H.L. Mencken's words, this statement "has long been a theme, giving rise to various vague rumors and ambiguous whispers."

Shortly before Nietzsche wrote the following letter, Wagner had taken a newly published opera of Parsifal, inscribed his name, and sent it to Nietzsche as a token of reconciliation. At this time, Nietzsche was writing "Human, All Too Human," in which he wrote his recent art doctrines, directly opposing Wagner's doctrines. When the gift arrived, Nietzsche was greatly moved. According to his sister, he thought "what a great shock the Wagnerians would get when they read the book he wrote," so he decided to publish the book anonymously, and at the same time write this letter to Wagner, telling him alone who the author of the book was, "and he did not succumb in the slightest to his own intellectual independence." The letter was not dated, but was probably written between 1878 and 1880.

"I have the strangest feeling of loneliness and gregariousness…"

### Tenth Place in the January Essay Contest: My Life

— Zhou Mengyun

A proverb says, "Nine out of ten teachers are poor." This has always been the case. As one with a heavy burden, I am of course no exception. However, I do not dislike my fourteen years of teaching life, but on the contrary, I have considerable fondness for it. Therefore, the good intentions of my friends' recommendations to change careers to business, and the good plans of my family's advice, have finally been acknowledged with appreciation, and only expressed gratitude. As the saying goes, "People cannot bear its sorrow, but Hui does not change his joy." And I, insignificant as I am, can be considered to be enjoying it.

Tolstoy said, "Life is not about enjoyment, but about hard work." Zola recalled his past hardships in his later years: "At that time, if I had bread and potatoes, it would be enough to fill my stomach, and if I occasionally got a candle, I would have the joy of ascending to heaven if I could read at night." The more hard work and simple life, the stronger the will, and the more valuable survival. When the spirit has a place to rest, even if the enjoyment is less, there is no such thing as suffering. Confucius said, "Eating coarse rice and drinking water, and bending one's arm for a pillow, joy is also within it. Wealth and honor obtained unrighteously are to me like floating clouds." Although I dare not compare myself to sages and heroes, I am very willing to take this essay opportunity to write about my daily life, hoping to add more instruction.

(A) Continuing Education Issues: I always feel that my continuing education is not enough, and I am always worried, because education is constantly innovating and advancing with the times, and should be in line with social reality; therefore, the content of textbooks should be explored, and the research and improvement of teaching methods should be constantly and fully improved in order to be effective and to be able to face oneself without shame. Especially since I am not a teacher from the regular path, and my foundation is shallow, it is even more necessary. In other words, even if I am not a teacher, I should read more books and cultivate knowledge: because having morality and conscience alone without knowledge is still not enough. In recent years, due to various problems, the time for continuing education has been reduced by two-thirds compared to the past. I want to find a way to make up for it from today.

(B) Clothing Issues: I have always been casual about clothing; especially in the past three years of winter, I have always worn a padded gown and single pants. Habit becomes nature, and I don't feel anything. Only "leather shoes" are my benefactor; because they are comfortable to run in, they are indeed not as good as "cloth shoes." My "leather shoes" are all bought from old goods stalls everywhere. They are indeed cheap. The shoe head and heel are each nailed with iron nails, which is more economical and practical.

(C) Food Issues: Because part-time teaching is too scattered, it is inconvenient to return home for lunch; but it is difficult to go to restaurants. I know that I have a super-sized appetite, so I can only have vegetables and tofu for meals. The rest I just buy some dry snacks to fill my stomach. In terms of family, I have a set schedule: on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th days, "the family's rice is cooked into corn porridge." On the 2nd, 4th, and 6th days, "mix broken rice noodles with soybean sprouts." (or green vegetables and spinach) On the 7th, 8th, and 9th days, "vegetables (or spinach, strips of soybean sprouts, or small shepherd's purse.) noodles." On the 10th day, "the family's rice is cooked with red bean rice" (the side dishes are mainly prepared by my wife). This combination has been practiced for a long time. Regarding the food issue, it does not seem to be very serious; and each of the seven members of the family is healthy and agile.

(D) Housing Issues: I don't care about the quality of clothing and food, but I refuse to make do with housing. This is my consistent policy. The three-story wide unified building is considered comfortable after all. The front building faces south with plenty of sunshine. It is used as a study room, individual teaching room, and also as my personal bedroom; because I have always liked to sleep on "hard pine boards," which is refreshing. Recently, I have become even more radical, borrowing the "floor," which is even more free. The rear building is where my wife and children live, and because the furniture is simple, it is still tidy. The only drawback is that the second landlord asked me to take care of the electricity myself, and I have not yet installed a separate meter. At first, burning "foreign candles" was really unaffordable. Now I use bean oil, "lamp grass life," to barely support myself. I admire the four students in this class, the first being Mr. Li of the Department of Economics of a certain university, the second being Mr. Yuan of Xintaihao on Henan Road, and the third and fourth being Mr. Gu and Mr. Zhong of Oriental Chemical Industrial Company. Every night, under this ill-equipped "bean oil lamp, they concentrate on studying their subjects; and they also voluntarily subsidize the oil costs. This kind of studious attitude and mutual assistance spirit is admirable.

Although my life is simple, I can still enjoy it. In short, "When it comes to knowledge and ability, look at those who are better than me; when it comes to treatment and enjoyment, look at those who are not as good as me." Naturally, I feel at ease and justified. My eldest son is twenty years old this year. Last year, he was hired by the general management office of a large bookstore. Thanks to the manager's promotion, he was promoted to accountant and can slightly help with household expenses. However, in each of my letters, there is always such a set, like a routine official document.

### Not Necessarily

— Shi Xin

It's better not to be rich than to be rich! We can see that in this society, there are quite a few people who don't want to be rich but naturally become rich. There are also many people who can choose not to be rich. But there are more people who want to be rich but cannot be rich, and people who cannot help but want to be rich.

Great tolerance brings great blessings! Worrying about rice for the night in the morning, half-hungry and half-starved, toiling like a beast of burden all day long, risking their God-given life, not daring to violate the law for the sake of social tranquility, the numbers of these people cannot be greater.

Using the yard to grow vegetables can help the people's livelihood and economy. In a room the size of a monk's cell, parents, wife and eight people cannot even turn around. How many people in Shanghai are in this situation? More than eight out of ten? For those who have empty land in their residences, flowers and plants are more important than vegetables!

These words are all right. But changing the perspective, they are not necessarily all right!

### Root

— Xin Bo

When Yang Zijie finished speaking, he gave a barely visible smile, made a barely audible laugh, and stopped talking. It wasn't that he had nothing to say, nor was it that he was convinced by her words; seeing her solemn and confident attitude, he dared not recklessly comment on her.

"But Sanhua," Huang Chong'an said, handing the water pipe to Yang Zijie, "your mother won't be willing."

"If mother can't bear it, she shouldn't think that her younger brother will grow up well."

A Wu came in with a copper kettle.

"Why haven't you gone yet?" Yu Duzhou asked.

"I'll go right away, I'll go right away," he said, putting the copper kettle on the iron frame and running out in a hurry.

The water droplets on the outside of the copper kettle dripped into the charcoal basin, making a hissing sound. At the same time, a fine cloud of white ash shot straight up, forming a pillar, and then scattered down.

"Third Miss is right," Gen Ming said to You Mei, actually more boldly than in front of others, "Spare the rod and spoil the child, spare the rice and spoil the child."

"Has Uncle Wang just arrived?" she said, and then stood up and walked over, stopping in front of Gen Ming, "How is Aunt? Is everything well at home?"

"Everyone else is fine," his eyebrows suddenly furrowed, "but Da Gen is not well, he has been sick for more than a month!"

"Today you are—" As she said this, she suddenly turned to her father and said, "Father, you still remember the situation three months ago when we took refuge in his house! Father, you must socialize more."

"No, Third Miss," Gen Ming said quickly, "I'm not here to borrow money, I'm here to sell land."

"Sell land? Where will you have land to plant?" A look of surprise.

"Third Miss, you don't understand," Yu Du asked, explaining for him, "Even if you sell it, you can still plant it, but you have to pay rent."

"Can't you avoid selling it?" Her question was ostensibly directed at Gen Ming, but her bright eyes swept towards her father as she asked this question.

Her father didn't say anything. After waiting for a while, Gen Ming said in a pained voice, "Where will the money come from if I don't sell it!" (9) Social Services

### Thousands of Dollars for a Baby's One-Month Celebration Donated to This Newspaper's Small Loan Fund, Hoping for a Response from All Sectors

This newspaper, in response to the needs of the times, has established a small loan fund and medical aid for elementary school teachers, which has been enthusiastically supported by all sectors, contributing what they can, contributing money if they have it, strength if they have it. Strength is not divided into big or small, and money is not counted in large or small amounts, only that each does their best to help each other. Yesterday, Mr. Zhang Liangyu of Shende Qianzhuang donated 1,000 yuan of congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends for his son's one-month celebration, as well as savings from frugal meals, to this newspaper's small loan fund. His benevolent wind and virtuous conduct are truly admirable. Mr. Zhang's move not only helps the poor, but also sets an example for others. I sincerely hope that the general public in society can enthusiastically promote and continuously support, benefiting poor compatriots, with boundless virtue.

### Aurora Women's University Establishes a Simple Junior High School Class

Aurora Women's University recently established a simple junior high school class, giving more out-of-school female students an opportunity to study. The class time is from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every Monday to Friday. There are not a few female students who are out of school after graduating from Shanghai High School. Some are due to family circumstances, while others are due to economic problems. The school not only has short class hours every day, but also includes the main courses that should be learned in general ordinary junior high schools, such as Chinese, foreign language, mathematics, science, social sciences, and natural sciences, which are taught by specialized teachers, which is very suitable for the needs of part-time students. Because Aurora Women's University has a Department of Education, the teaching aspect of the simple junior high school class also adopts newer and more effective methods. At the same time, in order to alleviate the economic difficulties of poor students, the school has set up scholarship places. Those with excellent academic performance and poor family backgrounds can apply for free tuition. As for the tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, and book fees stipulated by the class, each semester is only 100 yuan. I think this is really a good opportunity for out-of-school women in general. Those who are ambitious to study are urged to go to Aurora Women's College of Arts and Sciences at 181 Rue Bourgeois, French Concession to register. I heard that there are still many places left.
