### Three Pieces of Advice to the Economic Mission of Friendly Nations

The economic mission of friendly nation Japan arrived in Shanghai on the fourth day and has been warmly welcomed by the textile and economic circles of Shanghai. At each welcoming banquet, both hosts and guests have delivered extremely sincere and genuine speeches. We seize this opportunity to fully express the opinions of the general public, while the economic mission can fully understand the true feelings of the Chinese people. Both sides can feel exceptionally pleased.

In the past few days, this newspaper has repeatedly contributed some sincere opinions, in order to live up to the great kindness of the mission's long journey. In our last piece, we proposed two specific suggestions: securing finance and resolving the people's livelihood. The reason we put these two points forward first is that they are preconditions. If they are not resolved, other issues cannot be discussed. Today, we want to continue to raise only one issue, but it is of extreme importance to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. The meaning of cooperation is that both sides have the power of economic autonomy, and then they can share what they have or lack and respond to emergencies. If one side cannot be economically independent, it can only rely on and burden the other, and there is no cooperation to speak of.

China has always been a country with backward production, whether in agriculture or industry. Wartime life has become even more depressed. To cooperate economically with Japan, we must first establish an economic foundation, and to establish an economic foundation, we must enrich our production capacity. Therefore, today we want to contribute some ideas on how to increase production.

Increasing production is the fundamental way to stabilize prices and secure the people's livelihood during wartime, and it is also a prerequisite for implementing material controls. If increasing production cannot be achieved, prices cannot be stabilized, controls cannot be implemented, and, further, the people's livelihood absolutely cannot be secured. Although the issue of increasing production has been clearly stipulated by the government in its wartime economic policy guidelines, there is still no sign of it in practice. Taking industry as an example, the center of Chinese industry is in Shanghai. Increasing industrial production must start from Shanghai. However, according to a comprehensive survey report, the operating rates of various important industries related to the people's livelihood in Shanghai have all decreased (textile industry 40%, oil extraction industry 50%, dyeing and weaving industry 30%). The reasons are no more than the following three points: (1) shortage of raw materials, (2) insufficient motive power, and (3) difficulty in workers' food supply. The shortage of raw materials, the reduction in production, is a common phenomenon in all countries during wartime, but in China, there are many man-made reasons, and these man-made reasons cannot escape considerable responsibility. First, the concept of regional economy has not been broken, and merchants often encounter unexpected troubles when purchasing raw materials in various places, which leads to suspicion and fear, and ultimately they hesitate to move forward. Second, the method of acquisition is inappropriate, and the price of acquisition is unreasonable, forcing farmers to adopt passive resistance methods. For example, the self-spinning of cotton into homespun cloth, and the self-extraction of oil from rapeseed, have become a common phenomenon in rural areas. Third, transportation is difficult. Although there are industrial raw materials in various places, they cannot be transferred to the processing site, or although they can be transferred, it takes a long time. The above three items are the main reasons for the shortage of industrial raw material sources, especially the method of acquisition, such as compulsory acquisition, such as acquisition prices are unwilling to cost, if not promptly study and improve, I am afraid that industrial raw materials, but also inevitably from the day-to-day reduction and eventually to the day of extinction. Since this spring, farmers have been using compulsory methods for cotton acquisition and the price of cotton is far below cost, and many have removed the cotton that has been planted and replanted other crops. Therefore, the estimated production this year will be 30% less than last year. If the previous method does not change, the cotton field area next year will be even smaller than this year. The problem of motive power is related to the source of coal. If the source of coal is short or even impossible to maintain, it is necessary to strictly limit electricity consumption. However, even in this case, special consideration should be given to industrial electricity consumption. Moreover, according to past facts, the production and transportation of coal have not yet occurred, that is, in Shanghai, Japanese and Chinese merchants have more than 500,000 tons of coal, and it seems that it is not yet time to restrict industrial electricity consumption. Taking a step back, even if restricting electricity consumption is a pre-emptive measure to save coal, it should first start with entertainment venues, hotels, shops, restaurants, and household electricity consumption, and should not rashly restrict the electricity consumption of producers. Look at the phenomenon in Shanghai today, on the one hand, entertainment venues are open all night, intoxicated with luxury, on the other hand, the various production agencies are strictly restricted by the power, and have to tighten production and partial start. From the perspective of increasing wartime production and prosperity in East Asia, both are unreasonable phenomena. As for the issue of workers' food powder, it seems to be not of great importance at first glance, but as we know, there are indeed many factories that have to tighten up and temporarily maintain the status quo because the workers' rice problem cannot be solved. When the Soviet Union implemented the Five-Year Plan, in order to increase production, the allocation of food for workers was more generous in quality than that of the general public. Workers are the main producers. In this period of vigorously promoting increased production, special allocation of food for workers should be given universal consideration.

Let's talk about increasing agricultural production. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, although the prices of agricultural products have gradually increased in the past six years, the economic situation of farmers has only worsened. Because although the income of farmers has increased, it is far less than the increase in expenditure. Therefore, the general phenomenon in rural areas is that there is insufficient plowing cattle, incomplete farm implements, and no attention to water conservancy. Under this phenomenon, it is absolutely impossible to increase agricultural production. To cure the disease, the first is to improve politics and the integrity of officials, so that farmers will not have any additional burden other than the normal tax. If the government wants to change the land tax to in-kind (the Su-Huai administrative region has been implemented for two years), the amount of conversion should also take into account the burden of farmers and the production cost of agricultural products, and it must not be changed to in-kind in name, but secretly increased in fact. Second, the economic situation of rural areas in our country has always been extremely bad. In the past, farmers' production costs mostly relied on usury for turnover. Since the incident, most of the asset class in rural areas has moved to cities, due to the temptation of speculative hoarding and profiteering, and due to the instability of rural order, there is no guarantee for farmers' loans. Therefore, farmers cannot even get the high-interest loans they used to get. Therefore, the most important thing to do at present is to restore the local farmers' financial institutions, and to organize long-term, medium-term, short-term, and low-interest loans, so that farmers can organize arable land, build water conservancy, supplement plowing cattle and farm implements, or make wage expenses during cultivation and harvest. Third, the method of stimulating agricultural production is to enable farmers to obtain considerable profits in addition to production costs. In the past, the prices of agricultural products purchased did not take into account the production costs of farmers at all. There is a saying in China: "High grain prices hurt the people, and low grain prices hurt the farmers." It is not good to hurt the people, but it is even more dangerous to hurt the farmers. What's more, 80% of the Chinese people are engaged in agriculture. If it is made to the point where 80% of agricultural producers are unable to continue production, how can the other 20% be spared? The truth is very clear and does not need to be discussed in depth. Recently, there is a prominent example. Farmers in Pudong have changed to planting rice because the price of cotton is too low and does not cover production costs. Moreover, the benefit of planting rice is not as good as planting soybeans. Therefore, those who have not planted rice have flocked to planting soybeans. This is indeed because farmers have simple knowledge and do not know the economic principles and control trends. They only see the high price of rice and soybeans in front of them, but they have not thought that the price of rice and soybeans will fall due to the relationship between supply and demand, and that rice and soybeans will be subject to the control and price control. However, prices are enough to affect production, which has become a solid proof. We are not necessarily demanding to increase the price of agricultural products, but we must not fail to take into account the production costs and considerable profits of farmers. If we must force farmers to sell their agricultural products, which are the only benefits of their hard work throughout the year, at prices lower than their production costs, and exchange them for their daily necessities at several times the price, in other words, the pricing of industrial products cannot be matched with the pricing of agricultural products. The result is that farmers will absolutely no longer produce more than what is necessary for themselves and their families. This is simply a way to perish together.

### Fierce Fighting on the Southeastern Coast of Sicily: Italian Bombing of Anti-Axis Transport Fleets

London, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) Recent news received here last night stated that anti-Axis paratroopers had landed in southeastern Sicily and had been dealt with by Axis forces. Fierce fighting is taking place between Marsala and Cape Feto in the west of the island, and between Catania and Syracuse on the east coast. Marsala is the westernmost part of the island, while Cape Feto is located about twenty miles to the southeast. Syracuse is located about forty miles south of Catania. According to initial reports, anti-Axis forces landed on the southeastern coast, but Berlin quoted London as saying that anti-Axis forces had also landed on the four coasts, between Marsala and Cape Feto, where German and Italian air forces had intercepted with powerful forces. Berlin military circles also claimed that Axis coastal artillery and bombers sank several transport ships and landing craft carrying troops and military supplies.

Rome, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) Guetta commented in the Italian Voice newspaper this morning that the initial actions of the anti-Axis landing in Sicily had failed due to the rapid resistance of the Axis forces. Guetta said that in some places, enemy troops had been surrounded and annihilated, and the first team of enemy troops attempting to land had also been annihilated by the Italian naval and air forces. He also said that the war in Sicily is the origin of European culture and the most critical point in its history. Italy is well aware that this war is of great importance to the future world and the development of the war situation. The anti-Axis forces call the Sicilian campaign the second front, but in fact it does not affect the operations of the first front. Stalin's large-scale war on the eastern front, his final and radical demands, finally led England and the United States to take action.

Rome, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) The anti-Axis forces' attack on Sicily has prompted the Axis air force to intensify its bombing of the anti-Axis transport fleet on the south side of the island. Rome Radio announced last night that an enemy transport ship fully loaded with military supplies was heading northeast and was later hit by a torpedo from an Italian torpedo plane near the coast of Tunisia. Another Italian torpedo plane also hit an enemy transport ship northwest of Cape Guard, and two enemy ships were hit in the Strait of Flate.

Rome, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) According to today's announcement, in one week last week, the anti-Axis air force lost 253 aircraft in the Mediterranean. In addition, five transport ships were sunk, and another one can also be listed as lost. In the three days from July 3rd to 5th, 150 enemy aircraft were shot down over Sicily.

German and Italian troops on the island number about 400,000

London, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) Algiers Radio broadcasted last night the North African anti-Axis forces' general statement that the anti-Axis forces landed on Sicily in bad weather before dawn yesterday. The beaches and landing sites used in the first attack were about 100 miles long. The participating combat troops included the navies of the United States, Britain, India, the Netherlands, Poland, and Greece. The British Navy is responsible for transporting troops to Sicily and protecting the supply line to the African base. According to news from Eisenhower Headquarters, the anti-Axis forces are making a major attack on the western part of the island, and pointed out that the Axis forces on the island have received reinforcements in the past few days. It is reported that the island is defended by the Italian Sixth Army under the command of General Guzzoni, with about 300,000 people, in addition to 100,000 German troops. News received in Washington last night acknowledged the fierce counterattack of the Axis forces and speculated that the anti-Axis forces would deny trying to land on Sardinia and Corsica, in order to launch air raids on western and central Italy from the military base. Reuters also told the anti-Axis forces that the troops attacking Sicily must prepare for a long and arduous struggle, because all food and ammunition must be transported from the navy to the land on unprotected beaches. The island is mostly mountainous, which is also a major obstacle for the attacking forces.

### Italian Stefani Agency Criticizes British and American Propaganda

Rome, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) Stefani Agency published an article last night exposing the British and American propaganda strategy against Italy, stating that the anti-Axis propaganda about the Sicilian landing event deserves our special criticism. The first telegram stated: "British and American troops have landed 290 miles from Rome." The purpose of this telegram is undoubtedly to arouse the enthusiasm of the British and American people. The British and American side believes that such propaganda that its troops have landed in Europe, 290 miles from Rome, will confuse those in England and the United States who are not very familiar with geography. In fact, the landing site of the Axis forces is in the southeastern region of Sicily, in other words, on the island, not on the mainland. As for the claim that the landing site is 290 miles from Rome, it is nothing more than to stimulate the people to believe that Rome will hear the guns of the British and Americans in a few days. Another propaganda attempt is the telegram issued by Reuters yesterday afternoon, which stated that the place of origin was "somewhere in the interior of Sicily." The British side's adoption of this method is nothing more than to boost the people's optimism at the beginning of the military operation, that the Axis forces' attempt to establish a bridgehead to strengthen its offensive against Sicily has experienced many difficulties, and the anti-Axis resistance and counterattack are now in full swing, and the anti-Axis forces' difficult situation will continue to increase with time.

### North China Food Policy: The Japanese Side Decides to Cooperate: Remarks by Japanese Minister Sawa in Ping

Peiping, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) Wang Kemin, the newly appointed chairman of the North China Materials and Prices Committee, said on the 10th that he would make efforts to find a solution to the North China food problem. Japanese Minister to Peiping, Sawa, also issued a statement on the same day, saying that the Japanese side is willing to strengthen its cooperation in North China's price and food countermeasures. The general idea is that Chairman Wang of the North China Political Affairs Committee has stated on the origin of his assumption of office that North China bears the important mission of the rear of the Greater East Asia War, and on the two points of strengthening the control of materials and prices and actively promoting the food policy, he has revealed his determination and clarified his determination to strive to promote under a solid determination. I deeply agree with this. Recently, food prices in North China have suddenly fallen, and general prices have also tended to fall gradually, which is due to the proper measures taken by the Chinese side, which is very satisfactory. The Japanese side has always tried its best to assist the North China Political Affairs Committee's price countermeasures, etc. Now, the chairman has made this statement and made it clear that the Japanese side will strengthen its cooperation in various aspects. Therefore, I deeply hope that Chinese and Japanese merchants can understand Chairman Wang's enthusiasm, and in the future, they will work harder to cooperate.

### The Turkish-Syrian Border is Closed Again

Istanbul, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) According to reliable sources, the Turkish-Syrian border was closed again on the 8th by the Syrian side, and it is expected that the reason is for troop movements.

### Overview of the Terrain of Sicily

Rome, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) The area of ​​Sicily is 25,461 square kilometers, and the total coastline is 1,115 kilometers. The coast is mostly concave in the north. The coast has deep sea bays, peninsulas, and good natural harbors. However, as long as the Tyrrhenian Sea and Sardinia are in the hands of the Axis forces, the anti-Axis forces cannot use this coast as a landing site. The water in the bay is very shallow, and most of the coast is sandy and rocky. Under the above circumstances, only the east coast of Sicily can be used for military landings, and especially a part of the south of Catania is more convenient. The coastal section south of Catania is the only area that can be called a plain on the island. The position of this Catania plain is located between Mount Etna and the Iblean Mountains. Apart from this plain, all coasts of the island are rugged and uneven. Only 15% of the island's land is below 100 meters above sea level, and the average elevation is above 400 meters. On the other hand, the island's land exceeding 1,000 meters above sea level is only 6%. The most important mountain range on the island is in the northeast, between Punta del Faro and the Imara River. The undulating mountains divide Sicily into the Salso River, also known as South Imara, with a total length of 112 kilometers. In addition, the difficulties encountered by invaders on the island, where the rivers on the island exceed 100 kilometers in length, are self-evident. The only area that can be used is the east coast, because the Axis forces stationed on the island usually take the Strait of Messina for supplies, and land on the east coast, so there are various facilities for landing that can be used. Moreover, there are the two ports of Augusta and Syracuse on this part of the coast, which will be of great help to the anti-Axis forces if they can obtain them. As for the invasion between Trapani and Marsala in the western part of the island, it is also possible, but to do so, the entire Egadi Islands must be taken first to avoid threats to the rear. According to this part, there are three ports in total, namely Trapani, Marsala, and Machera.

### Chongqing's Recent Moves Towards the CCP

Nanking, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) Since the dissolution of the Third International, Chongqing has been paying close attention to the movements of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chongqing National Defense Supreme Committee recently sent Zhang Chong and Zhou Enlai to Yan'an to explain to senior CCP cadres such as Zhu De, Derzhi Donglin, and Han Han that since the Soviet Union has dissolved the Third International, the CCP must concentrate on uniting the motherland. At the same time, it also made the following requests to the CCP Central Committee: (1) All CCP political organizations in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and other provinces and regions must be dissolved and handed over to Chongqing. (2) The CCP Revolutionary Military Commission will be revoked. The Eighteenth Army Group and its subordinate troops will be commanded by the Chongqing National Defense Supreme Committee and ordered to move to other areas, and the Chongqing direct line army will be stationed in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. As for Chongqing, it has decided to add that if the CCP accepts this request, it can give appropriate political positions to senior CCP cadres in the Chongqing National Defense Supreme Committee and other Chongqing departments, and appoint three key CCP members as government members in the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, and allow them to participate in measures for the jurisdiction and in the northwest development issue, and guarantee that the Eighteenth Army Group and its subordinate troops will be 云，But this kind of request from Chongqing is tantamount to彻底共, and it is expected that the CCP will never accept it easily, so how this matter will develop is quite noteworthy.

### Soong Mei-ling's Remarks

Buenos Aires, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) According to a United Press International dispatch from Chongqing, after Soong Mei-ling returned to Chongqing on the 4th, she met with the British and American press corps on the 10th and issued a statement. When she took the American plane, it almost landed in Burma under Japanese occupation. The general idea is that the plane we were on lost its way to Calcutta due to bad weather. At that time, the American pilot wanted to land there because he was感 from the radio indicator from the ground, but for some reason, the pilot suddenly changed his landing plan and flew back. After the fact, it was found that the place we wanted to land at that time was a Japanese airfield, so we were all in a cold sweat. If we had really landed at that time, we might have become prisoners of the Japanese army. Also, the plane we were on had almost no gasoline left when it landed in India.

Fierce Fighting in the Kursk Salient Area
German Tank Groups Attack
Stockholm, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the fighting in the Kursk salient area is now intensifying. After German troops used tank groups to penetrate the Soviet positions from several locations, they further expanded from all directions, causing the organized resistance of the Soviet troops defending the outer defensive positions to be unsustainable, gradually leading to a disadvantageous situation. The vanguard units of the German army advanced towards the target day and night, seemingly wanting to advance from Belgorod northeastwards to the central area within Kursk, in order to cut off the retreat route of the main Soviet forces in the Kursk salient. The Soviet troops are currently engaged in large-scale tank battles with the German vanguard units, continuing a seesaw-like fierce battle. Furthermore, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Moscow, Soviet troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat with German troops in the Kursk salient area over the past four hours. A powerful German force even deployed new troops to strengthen the attack, forcing the Soviet troops to retreat to new positions. Another report stated that the Soviet High Command announced on the 10th that fresh troops consisting of ten divisions had been deployed to that area, bringing the total German strength there to forty divisions. At the same time, the Soviet High Command instructed the Soviet soldiers that they must resist the fierce German attacks, and continue to fight to the very last soldier.

Analysis of the Second Front of the British and Americans

The Soviet Union, which has been fighting hard for two years, has once again called on the British and Americans to open a second front in Die before the new German offensive, but US Secretary of the Navy Knox only responded with perfunctory words. The British and Americans heavily advertised that large German forces were stationed in Italy, but Germany remained silent and the newspapers treated it as a matter of indifference. According to usual practice, it seems that Germany is secretly preparing for a major operation, and now is the calm before the storm.

Goebbels' Views

However, the Der Steermer magazine published a lengthy article by Propaganda Minister Goebbels on the 27th, in which he said:

"The European war situation is now on the eve of a major development. It is foolish to criticize this and that on the stage before the curtain rises. The world's opinion does not know what the British and Americans are going to do, nor does it know what Germany is thinking or doing, and is therefore disturbed. We do not need to talk nonsense in this issue."

He told the people not to fall for the enemy's tricks, but to keep talking and moving towards their goals. He also said:

"If the enemy takes out everything they can think of, the Axis powers will not be able to figure out their movements, because from our point of view, it is not impossible for the enemy to open a second front. We know very well that it is about to be implemented, so we are surprised that the enemy has not opened a second front."

He sharply ridiculed the anti-Axis countries for failing to open a second front, and finally said:

"The question is when and where the enemy will attack the Axis forces. The Axis forces have made full preparations for this and there is nothing to worry about."

Here we can clearly understand that the second front is a reality that is already in front of our eyes, so we have also determined our policy on this. As for its implementation, it is still kept secret. In other words, once the content of the so-called second front is explained, we believe that it will not be a factor in creating unrest in Europe, but rather a concrete plan to defeat the British and Americans.

British and American Troops Will Be Reorganized

It seems very important to examine the recent trends of the British and Americans in the Mediterranean in the context of the second front that is entering a new stage. Since the British and Americans landed in North Africa six months ago, they have been trying to drive the Axis powers out of North Africa. The enemy's organization is also aimed at this. However, observing their actions since occupying Tunisia, it is expected that the British and American forces will be reorganized before landing in Europe in the future. That is, they will first gather strong naval forces in the western Mediterranean under favorable sea control. Judging from the organization of several battleships and aircraft carriers, it is easy to infer that there are many cruisers, destroyers, submarines and aircraft behind them that are responsible for protection. As for the naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean, although there are French-style battleships in Alexandria, their actual combat power is all small warships.

With this superior naval power as the background, a large number of landing craft, weapons, ammunition, and food are transported incessantly, and efforts are being made to increase aircraft in order to reduce landing losses after fierce air raids. It is now claimed that there are several first-line aircraft or more, and the bases on Malta and Pantelleria Island have long been built as bases for protecting fighter jets. As for its replenishment methods, the British and Americans first gather east and west in Gibraltar. From this place, several to dozens of convoys are dispersed to the North African coast day and night. In order to conceal the contents of the freighters, they sometimes sail empty ships and sometimes sail in the opposite direction. According to propaganda by British naval experts, Germany gathered many small boats for landing in England in 1940, and Britain today is preparing boats with even better performance. There are twelve types of these small boats, called flat-bottomed boats, which are equipped with special defensive iron plates to protect the landing. There are also small destroyer-type boats that try to get close to the coast as much as possible and fire mortars or release smoke screens. In addition, the landing craft also have machine gun mounts and group flat boats for transporting tanks. The enemy gathers these small boats from west to east in the Mediterranean, and the corresponding land forces are also working hard to disperse the corps attacking Tunisia in various coastal bases. Judging from the appearance of their preparations, landing in Europe is possible anywhere.

Axis Countries Stand Ready

The call for landing in Europe is becoming more and more loud recently. Even the "Economist" magazine (May 22 issue), which is relatively calm in propaganda, said:

"The Allied Air Force is now carrying out its second front duty, opening a third front based on Tunisia. A landing will definitely take place somewhere in Europe this summer."

In terms of political strategy, George VI is also to be brought to Africa to boost the morale of the Allied forces, and the Battle of Pantelleria Island is being promoted, claiming that taking islands with air power is an unprecedented example in world history. They dream of conquering Sardinia, Sicily, and Corsica Island by the same means. The Axis powers are calmly grasping the reality of the situation, fully aware of the enemy's actions, and establishing their own strategies.

Regarding the joint defense of the Mediterranean, according to a Berlin Trade Newspaper reporter's local inspection report, the defense of Crete Island, which blocks the Aegean Sea, is progressing step by step. The Adriatic Sea is now equal to the Axis countries' inland sea. The problem is the west and south coasts of Italy and the islands. Special performance listening devices called "Uteo Wind" are everywhere along the coast. This is particularly effective for the keen senses of blind soldiers. Train guns are also everywhere, and special countermeasures have been studied against the enemy's parachute troops.

According to other reports, concrete reports show how the joint German-Italian defense of Naples has perfect results. Germany and Italy are now united to defend against the common enemy. According to enemy intelligence, there are three to five divisions of German troops stubbornly resisting on islands such as Sardinia, and seven to ten divisions on Sicily. One division of German troops is responsible for defense, so the enemy themselves say that it is not optimistic. The Axis forces are countering the above-mentioned enemy attack posture with serious military facilities. At the same time, they are judging the enemy's movements and adopting a joint defense posture that adapts to the situation. They are fully aware of the weakness of the enemy's logistical difficulties, so the Axis forces are not taken in by the enemy's empty propaganda. They are calmly judging whether the enemy has sufficient supplies for a counterattack at any time, and when the time is right, they will annihilate them in one fell swoop with a strong spirit of hatred for the enemy.

The Eastern Front Is Still the Center of Gravity

The above is the German view of the second front. Conversely, from the German perspective, their main front is still the Eastern Front, and the principle of defeating the Bolsheviks has never changed. However, due to changes in the internal and external situation, the methods of war in the east have naturally changed somewhat compared to the past two years. Professor Brugmann of the German engineering team was recently awarded a medal by the Führer to reward his military equipment construction efforts in the east. From this point of view, on the one hand, they are building defensive military equipment, and on the other hand, they are strengthening mobile units to wait for an opportunity to annihilate the enemy.

Those who expect the superficial achievements of the Battle of Moscow and the Battle of the Caucasus will be disappointed by the situation on the Eastern Front. The reality is extremely profound. On the one hand, they are preparing a defensive offensive posture, and on the other hand, they are developing the occupied territories to enhance their strength. These two difficult tasks must be carried out simultaneously. From the east and west, this is precisely the character of the new stage of the common world war. In this new stage, the attitude that the Axis forces should take is to regard all enemy propaganda as wind passing by the ear. The only prerequisite is to increase weapons production. The figures released by Munitions Minister Xubeier last time showed that the current stage of the war is proceeding fiercely not only on the battlefield, but also in the domestic production sector.

Fifth Phase of Sugar Rationing
Can Begin in Late July
It was learned from the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Camp Office yesterday by a reporter from the Guofeng News Agency that the fourth phase of sugar rationing in the city has ended, and the fifth phase of sugar rationing will most likely begin in late July. The total amount of sugar rationed by the office in each phase varies slightly due to population changes, but each phase is roughly around 26,400 to 26,500 dan. Sometimes, the population in the concession increases while the population in the city decreases, or even if both increase at the same time, the allocated surplus is supplemented (due to uncollected certificates or expired sugar certificates becoming invalid). It is now heard that the fifth phase of sugar rationing for July should be sold in mid-July according to the previous schedule, but due to the incomplete conclusion of the previous phase and the active preparation for the fifth phase, the official date for the start of sugar sales is expected to be fully available in late July. As for the total amount of sugar sold and the amount allocated per person, there is no change.

Forty-first Phase of Flour
Sales Start Today
The rice shops in the two concessions will start purchasing the forty-first phase of household flour today. One catty of No. 2 flour will be issued with the 41st flour purchase certificate, and the purchase certificate will be sold for six yuan and two jiao. As for the rice purchase certificate used to purchase the 40th phase of household rice, it will only be allowed to be used until 5:00 p.m. on the 14th, and will be invalid after the deadline.

Hospitals Apply for Rationing
Medicines and Supplies
In view of the sharp rise in prices of various medicines, supplies, and patient food in the city, and the difficulty in purchasing them, which greatly hinders the lives of patients, the city's hospitals will study a unified allocation organization through the city's Medical Association in order to ensure the normal supply of medicine and supplies. They are currently applying to the authorities.

### Matsui Iwane-style Speech

Shonan, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese army General Iwane Matsui recently inspected various places. Since arriving in Shonan, he has met with Japanese military unit commanders and local authorities to discuss the situation in the South. On the 11th, he met with the Shonan press corps and spoke about his impressions of the inspection. He said, "I once came to Shonan on the way to attend the military disarmament conference in Taisho year 8. At that time, I was received by the Governor-General and attended a dinner party at his official residence. Now, as I recall the arrogant attitude of that Governor-General at the time, I cannot help but feel deeply moved. My impression of this inspection is that the unity of the East Asian nations is the current priority. The Japanese in the area are working hard to connect with the local people and complete the great construction project of Greater East Asia."
