### How Citizens Should Cooperatively Maintain Public Order

The military police of our friendly nation, Japan, are known to be more rigorous and attentive to detail in all aspects, including troop organization, structure, knowledge, and training, than those of ordinary countries. This is generally acknowledged by those familiar with the Japanese army. Therefore, the characteristics of the Japanese military police can be described as "impartial" and "solemn." Currently, the Japanese military police in the various areas of the occupied zone are particularly focused on the principle of "impartiality." We understand that the Japanese military police force in Shanghai, in addition to their duties as military police, also shoulder important responsibilities in all areas of politics, economy, and defense, such as guarding the peace, investigating traitors, suppressing terror, and eliminating reactionaries, while always maintaining a "just" demeanor.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai's public order has gradually been established, leading to stability, and terrorist cases have gradually decreased, even to the point of disappearing. Of course, most of the credit should be attributed to the efforts of the friendly nation's military police force and other security agencies. However, in the process of the military police carrying out their duties, some cases may involve minor misunderstandings due to language barriers and differences in customs. At the same time, it is also unavoidable that this causes fear among the people. We believe that both sides should frankly acknowledge this fact, because only with frank acknowledgment can we have the courage to improve and correct the situation, and completely eliminate misunderstandings.

In our editorial on May 25th, titled "A Request to the Local Authorities of a Friendly Nation," we briefly offered our humble opinions. On May 2nd and May 24th, the authorities of the friendly nation's military police issued statements saying: "In this city, there are often unscrupulous individuals who impersonate members of the Japanese military police force and collude to coerce innocent citizens, extorting money. In the four months from the beginning of this year to the end of April, a total of twenty-seven cases of impersonation and fraud were solved, involving thirty-six criminals, of whom twenty-three were Chinese and thirteen were Japanese and other nationals, all of whom have been severely punished. In the future, if citizens feel that someone is fabricating the name of a military policeman or a military police informant and engaging in illegal activities, they should immediately report it to the nearest military police station for arrest. We hope that the Chinese and Japanese people will warn each other and cooperate in cracking down on these activities, in order to achieve the goal of building a bright and prosperous Shanghai." Based on the main points of the statement, we suggest that if citizens encounter inquiries from the military police, they should not panic, but respond honestly, and the truth will be easily clarified. If they believe that the person is suspicious, they should not be afraid of getting involved and report the facts to the nearest military police station. It is essential to understand that this is a necessary action to cooperate with the military police authorities in cracking down on unscrupulous elements. We believe that many citizens do not have enough knowledge of the military police force, remain ignorant of the situation, and, under the "fear of getting involved" mentality, are willing to remain silent. As a result, this will only encourage the rise of unscrupulous elements, thus obstructing the thorough crackdowns by the military police authorities.

Five months have passed since then. Although we have not seen any formal announcement from the military police authorities regarding whether cases of impersonation and extortion have been eliminated, there are still rumors in society about such incidents. Therefore, in addition to upholding our previous suggestions, we would like to further emphasize and supplement our observations as follows:

First, if a citizen is summoned by the military police for questioning due to an incident or implication, it is because the military police are acting on some intelligence or report, and will not randomly disturb people. Therefore, it is necessary to have a very accurate understanding of this. And pay attention to the following:

If there are inquiries, absolutely tell the truth, without any falsehood or pretense.

Do not panic or be afraid, accept the treatment, and after a considerable period of inquiry and investigation, if it is found that you are innocent, you will be released. Do not be deceived by a few unscrupulous elements and use bribes. Those who offer bribes must feel guilty, which will make things worse. The more urgently they offer bribes, the more difficult it will be to be released.

If you are innocent, but have been falsely accused; or have been unjustly framed by a small number of Chinese staff for extortion, you can report the facts to the military police at any time. Although we have not seen the military police announce any cases of false accusations resulting in the accuser being punished, we believe that the military police, in their sincerity to request citizens' cooperation in cracking down on impersonation and extortion, will definitely severely punish such cases once they are reported.

Second, although terrorist cases have decreased, almost to the point of disappearing, we must not be negligent because of this, but be vigilant at all times. This is the responsibility of every citizen. Because if an unintentional case occurs, all the areas around it will suffer. Therefore, in order to protect the safety of your own residence, you must help to eliminate the activities of the unwilling elements.

Third, to prevent the infiltration of unscrupulous elements, we suggest that the military police authorities should strengthen contact with the Baojia chiefs in various areas to obtain their full cooperation. Because the Baojia chiefs are more familiar with the movements of the residents in their Baojia area. Those who come to Shanghai from other places should apply for registration with the Baojia office, and after the Baojia office forwards the report to the military police, they should closely investigate the actions of the new residents to prevent the infiltration of unscrupulous elements.

In conclusion, maintaining the tranquility of social order is a common requirement and a common responsibility of the authorities and the citizens, and it must be promoted through joint cooperation.

### Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Clarify the Fundamental Goals of the Liberation War in Response to Questions in the House of Representatives Budget Committee

Tokyo, October 27th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Nakajima, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives, raised the following questions at the general meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on October 27th: Now that the United Kingdom and the United States have been driven out of Greater East Asia, in order to ensure the autonomy of the southern ethnic groups based on the spirit of "Hakkō ichiu" (eight corners of the world under one roof), the following six principles should be followed to ensure the autonomous state of Greater East Asia:
　Eliminate racial discrimination.
　Ethnic equality and mutual concession.
　Implement economic cooperation based on reciprocity.
　Develop and communicate culture.
　Liberate resources.
　Jointly defend Greater East Asia.
In response, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu replied as follows: The construction of Greater East Asia is based on the voluntary cooperation of the ethnic groups, so the spirit of mutual understanding must be the guideline. This is not only limited to Greater East Asia, but should also be applied to the world. Following this, Mr. Nakajima further questioned: After thoroughly making the countries of the world recognize the significance of Greater East Asia and Japan's war objectives, the United Kingdom and the United States will immediately lose their war objectives and abandon their weapons... The National Government...

East Asians Must Protect Their Homeland and Gain Liberation. Regarding the establishment of a freely elected government, the United Kingdom may also issue empty promises. However, the liberation of India must still be achieved through the struggle of the Indians themselves. East Asia is the homeland of the East Asians, and the fundamental place for the East Asians to live. Therefore, we cannot but defend this homeland. In this war, the United Kingdom and the United States are attempting to overwhelm Japan with economic and military force. If Japan cannot complete its mission, Greater East Asia will inevitably be subjected to the oppression of the United Kingdom and the United States again. Therefore, liberating East Asia from the invading iron hooves of the enemy is also the objective of this war. The coexistence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia is the coexistence and co-prosperity of the world. East Asia is willing to contribute to all countries in the world by broadly communicating culture, eliminating racial discrimination, and promoting the spirit of mutual understanding and reciprocity. Because we have such a noble spirit, we also have an unwavering belief in victory. In ancient times, few imperialists who violated justice succeeded, except for the Opium War. The American War of Independence was a war launched by the Americans to defend their homeland, and the ultimate victor was because of its spirit rather than its weapons. What the Greater East Asian nations are asking for is only coexistence and co-prosperity, mutual benefit and mutual concession. Those who fight with this spirit are the true appearance of today's Greater East Asia.

Tokyo, October 27th (Central News Agency) - The main content of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives on the 27th and the answers are as follows: Prime Minister Tojo answered questions regarding administrative operations, saying that the plan to transfer the affairs of central government officials to local government offices is to transfer all affairs of central departments to local governments, except for special cases, and the central office only undertakes planning and guidance. Also, the decisions of the local council chairmen must be approved by the minister in charge of the local administration before direct instructions can be given. Prime Minister Tojo answered questions regarding the establishment of the Ministry of Military Supplies, saying that increasing national power and strengthening production, especially increasing the production rate of aircraft, is important. The establishment of the Ministry of Military Supplies will make the relationship between the command headquarters and the state production more compact, and will actively promote it under the form of private ownership and private operation. Minister of Agriculture Yamasaki answered questions regarding food self-sufficiency, saying that the plan for food self-sufficiency for next year is under careful consideration. It is roughly planned to improve nearly one million mu of land in Japan, and it is expected to increase by five million koku by the 20th year of Showa (1945). In addition, increased production will also be carried out in Korea and Taiwan, and Manchuria has also established an active production increase plan. The Prime Minister answered questions regarding the conscription of women, saying that it is not planned to conscript women today, but it is possible in the future. The work of conscripting women is very important, and simply imitating foreign countries will destroy the family system. For the sake of national victory, it is necessary to do everything possible, but it is currently not planned to conscript women.

### Manchurian Government Expresses Its Views

Xinjing, October 27th (Central News Agency) - The government of Manchukuo expressed the following views regarding Prime Minister Tojo's speech at the Extraordinary Diet session: Prime Minister Tojo once again taught the unwavering belief in defeating the United Kingdom and the United States at this Diet session. He also stated that Japan will never internationally interfere with the progress of Greater East Asia's joint construction. It will strive to realize all agreements made with the various groups. Recently, Burma and the Philippines have successively gained independence, and the Provisional Government of India has also been established. All of these are realizations of the Prime Minister's promises. Therefore, the total power of Greater East Asia is becoming stronger. The Prime Minister specifically mentioned Manchukuo's material and spiritual cooperation in completing the war and expressed his gratitude. Manchukuo's contribution to the Greater East Asia War is in recognizing that only by winning the final victory in the Greater East Asia War can Greater East Asia be liberated, and Manchukuo can thus realize its permanent development. In the future, Manchukuo will strive to fulfill the two major missions of defending the north and strengthening its combat power.

### Major Decisive Battle Unfolds on the Krivoy Rog Front, Soviet Troops Cross the River and Meet Resistance as They Advance Westward

Berlin, October 27th (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitong News Agency, a German military spokesman said yesterday that the large-scale offensive by the Soviet troops between the Sea of Azov and Krivoy Rog shows that the enemy's headquarters is determined to achieve a decisive result as much as possible. The battles from the Dnieper River bend to the Sea of Azov are expected to last for quite some time. The spokesman declined to predict when the war would end and said that the current battles on the Eastern Front are far more important than those on other fronts.

Berlin, October 27th (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitong News Agency, Soviet troops in the southern part of the Eastern Front are attacking southward and westward, and the German forces continue to resist stubbornly. The Soviet pressure on the Nogai Steppe and Krivoy Rog is very strong. The Soviet troops southwest of Melitopol are fiercely attacking the Genichesk Isthmus in an attempt to break through the German defenses, but after fierce fighting the day before, the Soviet troops were repelled. Fierce fighting occurred on October 21st in the Dnieper River estuary. The German troops who withdrew from Dnepropetrovsk have strengthened the eastern flank of the defenses protecting Krivoy Rog, and fierce fighting continued throughout the day.

Berlin, October 27th (Central News Agency) - The German High Command announced at noon on the 26th: The fighting in the Melitopol area and southeast of Chaplinka in the southern part of the Eastern Front was the most intense on the 25th. The enemy forces attacked repeatedly, but were resisted after fierce fighting, and the German forces have repelled the enemy forces that broke into the defensive positions. There is still fierce fighting on the side of the Dnieper River bend. After destroying all important military facilities, the German troops have withdrawn from Dnepropetrovsk. The Soviet troops attacking Krivoy Rog have redeployed new elite troops and have engaged in continuous fierce fighting north of the city several times, but have not yet broken through the German defenses. According to the military, a tank force launched a counterattack on the flank of the Soviet troops from the northwest and broke into the enemy positions in order to relieve the German troops fighting in Krivoy Rog. Also, Soviet troops launched an offensive from the bridgehead northwest of Crimea with strong forces. The German troops immediately counterattacked and repelled them. In several locations southeast of Kiev, north of Kiev, and north of Chernigov, local skirmishes broke out. The German troops repelled the enemy forces in all locations. West of Krichev, Soviet troops launched an offensive along a wide front with several infantry divisions. However, after the German forces launched a fierce counterattack, they repelled the enemy units that had broken through in several locations to the points before the offensive began. There were only small-scale skirmishes west of Smolensk and south of Velikiye Luki.

The Strategic Importance of Krivoy Rog

Berlin, October 27th (Central News Agency) - The German High Command announced its battle report on the 26th. The German troops have withdrawn from Dnepropetrovsk, which proves that the Soviet troops have significantly increased pressure in that area, and also shows the importance of the battle situation. Chaplinka and Dnepropetrovsk are located at the north and south ends of the Dnieper River bend, and are two major strategic strongholds. Therefore, the German troops had previously built strong defensive positions in these two locations. The Soviet troops concentrated their elite forces to attack these locations. They occupied Chaplinka on the left bank of the river on the 14th of this month, and now they have occupied Dnepropetrovsk, and are bound to advance past the Dnieper River bend towards the Ingulets River, which will lead to a major situation for the German troops that has not been seen since the beginning of the war. Also, the Soviet troops attacking Krivoy Rog from Crimea are threatening the German flank, so in order to avoid unnecessary damage, the German troops must concentrate on forming a firm defensive posture towards the mouths of the Dnieper and Ingulets Rivers. Krivoy Rog is the center of the Ukrainian iron and steel industry, and is also a transportation hub and an extremely important strategic stronghold for the German troops in the Ukrainian area, so the German troops are currently working hard to defend the area. The German and Soviet troops in the Krivoy Rog area are bound to engage in fierce offensive and defensive battles. Also, the Soviet troops in Krichev, south of Smolensk, have also dispatched elite reserve troops to launch an operation threatening the north of Gomel. In this area, the salient of the Soviet battle line is almost a straight line from north to south. If one place is breached, it will affect the entire line, so the German troops are currently making every effort to defend it. At the same time, the German's excellent mechanized units are launching a flanking attack on the Soviet troops in the Krivoy Rog area to prevent the Soviet advance. Therefore, the trends in the battle situation in the past few days will have a major impact on the battle situation at the end of this year, and are worthy of attention.

### Fierce Battles on the Nujiang River: Japanese Troops Reach the West Bank, Japanese Aircraft Bomb Burmese Roads

Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – Elite Japanese troops launched a blitzkrieg against the defending Chinese forces on the west bank of the Nujiang River, forcing them to retreat to the east bank, completely seizing their crossing points. The Chongqing Military Council's announcement on the 22nd also acknowledged this, stating that the Yunnan troops' fierce resistance against the Japanese for a week had resulted in a retreat. Currently, Japanese troops have reached the west bank of the Nujiang River, poised to cross and advance eastward.

A certain Japanese military base (Central News Agency telegram) – On the 25th, Japanese army air units, in large formations, launched a surprise attack on Xiaguan, a key point on the Yunnan-Burma Road in the southern part of Yunnan. They heavily bombed military installations south of the city, causing major fires, after which the entire air unit safely returned to base.

Buenos Aires, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – The war on the Nujiang front has attracted considerable attention in the United States. Correspondents from the American news agency reported on the success of the Japanese operations and the precarious situation of the Chongqing forces, causing great shock to Americans. When a special correspondent from the Sino-American News Agency attempted to cross to the opposite bank of the crossing point at Liuku, they first subjected the Chongqing forces to heavy artillery fire, then launched a surprise attack from Xishan Road, seizing the area. This location is situated 80 miles directly north of the Huitong Bridge on the Yunnan-Burma Road and is a strategically important point. The Japanese operation's goal is to encircle and thoroughly annihilate the Chongqing forces on the west bank of the Nujiang River. Furthermore, a correspondent from the United Press reported that the Chongqing forces' positions on all four banks of the Nujiang River had been completely surrounded by Japanese forces. The fighting is now progressing within rifle range of the Chongqing forces on the east bank of the Nujiang River, and recently Japanese artillery has been positioned on the high ground on all four banks of the Nujiang River, bombarding the Chongqing forces' positions from above. The Nujiang River has a very rapid current, with steep cliffs on both sides reaching an altitude of 3,000 feet. It takes a full day for Chongqing aircraft to cross the Nujiang River from the Yunnan-Burma Road. After the Japanese occupied Yunliang and Sibu, the Zhuan Tong Bridge and the Shuanghong Bridge, 40 miles north of it, on the Yunnan-Burma Road were destroyed by Chongqing forces. Afterwards, Chongqing forces only utilized small crossing points to gradually move to the west bank. The current Japanese operation aims to eliminate these Chongqing ferry positions and further advance to the Lushui area, several hundred miles west of Longling, to control the 90-mile stretch of land along the west bank of the Nujiang River.

A certain Japanese military base on the Burmese Front, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – At 2:00 PM on the 26th, 25 enemy B-24 type bombers attacked Yangon. The Japanese army's elite fighter squadron scrambled to intercept them, shooting down three and severely damaging five others, inflicting a fatal blow on the enemy. Two of these were rammed by Japanese aircraft, but the Japanese pilots safely parachuted down. Furthermore, the Japanese side suffered no damage.

### Comprehensive War Results of Japanese Forces in North China

Furthermore, in the suppression operations west of Yuansa, 94 enemy soldiers were killed. Also, on the 10th, the Saito unit engaged the enemy east of Laicheng, killing 40 enemy soldiers, seizing 40 rifles, 150 bullets, 1 automatic rifle, and 12,000 bullets.

### Japanese Minister Nakajima Discusses the Greater East Asia War Situation: Enemy Propaganda Completely Defeated

Shonan, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army Information Minister Nakajima gave a speech on the 27th regarding the Greater East Asia War situation: The announcement by the Okamura unit regarding the recent war situation in the South Pacific and Burmese border areas has completely refuted the lies propagated by the enemy in recent months about the decline in Japanese combat power and defensive tactics. It also clarified that Japanese tactics are constantly in an offensive position both in local battles and in overall operational guidance. Regarding the truth of the fighting in the South Pacific, in short, the enemy is recklessly sacrificing one ton of bombs per square yard, wandering aimlessly along worthless battle lines. In the battles near Lae and Salamaua, according to later reports, the enemy has indeed lost more than 20,000 troops, and the enemy further believes that continuing this difficult jungle exploration will lead to Tokyo, which is a truly ridiculous idea. The Axis forces' attempt to seize Burma was broken by Japan's preemptive offensive.

### National Government Attaches Great Importance to Prime Minister Tojo's Speech

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – Japanese Prime Minister Tojo's policy speech in the Diet has caused a reaction on the Chinese side. There is great admiration for Prime Minister Tojo's determination to strengthen the domestic system while strengthening unity with the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. In particular, great importance is attached to the following two matters expressed by Prime Minister Tojo in this speech: 1. The fundamental revision of the Japan-China Basic Treaty will soon be realized. 2. He expresses great sympathy for the people still under Chongqing rule who are unable to participate in the sacred cause of liberating East Asia. The fundamental revision of the Japan-China Basic Treaty has long been anticipated by people from all walks of life in China, so now that they have learned that it will soon be realized, everyone is excited.

### American Pilots' Arrogant Attitude Causes Resentment Among Chongqing Residents

Central News Agency, Shanghai dispatch – The people in the inland areas of Chongqing are expressing deep indignation at the American air force personnel stationed in Chongqing for their tyranny and arrogance. According to recent reports, the depth of popular resentment can be seen from the following: A certain aviation technician in Chongqing, surnamed Yang, recently returned to the peace zone out of strong resentment towards the American air force and dissatisfaction with Chongqing's incompetence. According to what he told a friend surnamed Chen, at the sentry post of the Chongqing army at the Guilin airfield, there was a sign that read: "Foreigners are forbidden from entering the airfield, and violators will be severely punished." He also talked about the arrogance of American pilots when they flew back in their planes, which was unbearable to witness. It is said that as soon as they got off the plane, they lay down on the ground next to the plane to rest, while a Chongqing officer led a team of servants, each holding a fan, to surround the American pilot and fan him. The reclining pilot seemed very comfortable, turning from side to side while singing loudly, exposing the arrogance of Americans without reservation. The Southeast Daily of August 13 criticized the absurd attitude of the Americans, reporting that Lieutenant Colonel Ferrais, an instructor at the Chongqing Artillery School, actually made the outrageous statement: "We intend to create a small-scale America in China." According to a letter recently sent from Kunming by a certain An, "Life in Kunming has become tiring, and I am eager to avoid Kunming. The American's tyrannical behavior, if China and the United States ever have an incident in the future, I will immediately be the vanguard of the action team. This is my way of retaliating against the current leadership of the United States in China, and I have no other way of retaliating against the United States."

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) – James Reston, a famous reporter for the New York Times, reported from a certain American air force base in Chongqing that the pilots of the American air force stationed in Chongqing feel that there is little progress in the war against Japan and that the future is bleak, and they do not know when they will be able to return home. Therefore, they all want to stipulate a certain period of service in Chongqing. Japanese aircraft in China are numerous, and the fuel supply is very sufficient, so the American pilots consider Japan to be an enemy that can last for a long time, and they believe that the engines of Japanese aircraft are extremely good. In the past few months, among the thousands of Japanese aircraft that have flown into the Chongqing territory, none have been forced to land due to engine damage.

### Newly Appointed Japanese Consul in Hankou Delivers Speech

Hankou, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – The newly appointed Japanese Consul-General to Hankou, Uchimoto Genbei, arrived in Hankou by plane.

### Moscow Conference Unlikely to Achieve Satisfactory Results: Observations of a Japanese Military Commentator

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – Rear Admiral Zasa Tanji, a retired officer of the Japanese Navy, is a well-known military commentator. He recently commented on the "Relations between the Three Countries of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union." After repeated negotiations, the tripartite talks between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are being held in Moscow, with Molotov, Hull, Eden, and the military leaders of the three countries participating. The reason for holding this meeting is that the Soviet Union did not send a representative to the Ottawa Conference, which prevented things from being resolved thoroughly. Therefore, Britain and the United States advocated convening this meeting, and the Soviet Union was able to seize the leading role in this meeting. The Soviet Union's Pravda newspaper stated its firm position of absolutely refusing to discuss issues such as the Soviet Union's border wars, and then the Soviet News newspaper demanded that the opening of a second European front be the central topic of the meeting. Britain and the United States originally hoped to win over the Soviet Union by offering issues of national borders, so that the Soviet Union would ease its demand to form a second European front. Looking at the trend of Soviet public opinion, Britain and the United States' attempts were met with a head-on blow. According to Britain and the America, the purpose of convening this tripartite conference is to use Italy's unconditional surrender and the resulting changes in the South European war situation to ease the Soviet Union's tough attitude towards Britain and America; the issue of the Mediterranean Committee; the issue of the anti-Axis food conference; and the political and economic issues such as the future borders of the Soviet Union, in order to adjust the long-standing differences of opinion among the three countries. But this is still Britain and America's old and cunning strategy to avoid their own sacrifices, and the Soviet Union sees through this point, and will not easily relax its own claims. Currently, with the war against Germany in full swing, both sides must take consistent steps, so the Soviet Union seems to still have to agree to Britain and America's requests first, and then insist on its own claims even more. In particular, because the Soviet Union's military strength has been greatly depleted, it is now urgent to demand the formation of a second front. Furthermore, Italy's surrender to Britain and the United States has not yielded great gains. Germany's troop strength on the Eastern Front has not been affected by this, and its reserve strength is sufficient to be allocated, and the defense of continental Europe is as solid as a rock. Therefore, the main topic of the tripartite conference held under such circumstances is naturally the decision on the second front. From the Soviet Union's point of view, considering its own interests, it must not be swayed by British and American rhetoric. Especially given the urgency of the current war situation, the Soviet Union will undoubtedly insist on its position, so the result of this meeting will certainly not be satisfactory.

### Battles in Southern Italy in Stalemate: German Troops Consolidate Mountain Positions

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to the German News Agency: There was only contact between outposts on the Southern Italian front yesterday, and the truce of recent days continues.

### New Italian Government Announces Capital Moved to Venice: Parliament to Convene Next Month

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a telegram from Rome: The Italian Fascist Republic government announced on the 25th that it had decided to make Venice the capital.

Rome, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – Havas reports, according to political sources yesterday, Italy will convene a National Conference in November and declare Italy a republic. Hundreds of representatives from both houses and trade unions will participate. The areas represented include some occupied areas. The location of the meeting is still secret, probably a small city in northern Italy. Political figures are in charge of selecting a large city with historic northern Italy as its meeting place, and the government is flattening the area republic, but the 14th-century Sforza Palace destroyed lighter as the capital of the Republic of Venice. Venice has a history of more than a thousand years and is also an ideal country for the first century. Both have been anti-Habsburg centers, so there are anti-German components. Therefore, it is suggested that Bologna is the place where the city has never been controlled by Austria. It has no anti-German history. Therefore, it is suitable for holding this National Conference.

### Japan Strengthens Production Capacity

On the Establishment of the Ministry of Munitions

It is a well-known fact that in the current stage of the war, the decisive air battle is becoming increasingly fierce. In the integrated three-dimensional warfare of land, sea, and air, the proportion of aircraft is increasing day by day. Without mastering air supremacy, the supply of sea and land becomes extremely difficult. Moreover, the outcome of ground combat can also be determined by the strength of air power. Therefore, strengthening air power, especially ensuring the quantity of aircraft, is the primary requirement for victory.

Under this situation, there is no need to say that the entire nation should move towards accelerating the production of aircraft with all its strength. Therefore, aircraft production must be the biggest goal of decisive battle production, and ensuring its planned output must be the basic principle of all emergency measures. Expanding and preparing various related industries to plan for the production of tens of thousands of aircraft, in order to achieve this goal, the production scale and capacity of assembly plants, engine plants, propeller plants, and parts plants should be expanded to what extent; the amount of general materials such as special steel, ordinary steel, non-ferrous metals, and chemical products needed; the number of equipment such as various machine tools needed; the amount of labor, electricity, gas, and other power needed, and how to supply them, etc., must be comprehensively planned, and then meticulously considered to establish a pyramid-shaped comprehensive plan. A super-focus production centered on aircraft production must be done in this way. To accomplish this step, there must be a strong comprehensive organization or a single production administrative organization to draft and implement production plans. Therefore, the theory of establishing a Ministry of Munitions (or Ministry of Production) is once again loudly advocated. At the fourth Central Cooperation Conference in the past, Kawamura Kyosuke, Suzuki Shigemitsu, and others also earnestly demanded the unification of the command system and the location of responsibility.

To Complete the Planned Economy, a Single Agency with Absolute Authority Should be Responsible for its Promotion

Japan Strengthens Production Capacity

It is needless to say that production administration and production guidance should be implemented. Based on this reason, Germany established a Central Planning Committee within the Four-Year Plan Bureau, and at the same time, the Ministry of Munitions was enriched with military supplies to realize the powerful one-yuan administration of expanding production. Immediately after the outbreak of the war, the United States destroyed and placed a Wartime Production Board with strong enforcement powers, as well as a planning agency for comprehensive planning of military and civilian production, purchase, and allocation matters; the United Kingdom also maintained direct connection between the Wartime Production Department and the military production agency, measured the production capacity of each factory, and implemented a typical proportional distribution of production. From this, it can be seen that in the major belligerent countries, the unification of wartime production administration is becoming increasingly complete.

However, the adjustment of military and civilian needs is fundamentally a matter of adjusting command and administration, and operations and industry. Since the independence of the command authority is an unshakable principle, we have to admit that the military needs provincial case has its inevitable limitations. Furthermore, if the "ideology of the officials" is not changed, then simply reforming the organization may be difficult to achieve the desired results, and this point must also be considered. Therefore, the plan to reorganize and expand the Planning Yuan to give it the character and function of a substantial economic general staff headquarters is more realistic than the plan to establish a Ministry of Munitions. Although today's Planning Yuan is responsible for drafting plans for material mobilization and other national mobilization, and establishing comprehensive national policies, and there is a close relationship between the two, the latter's function is always relatively weak, and the contact between the planning officials and the implementing officials is difficult to achieve perfectly. To improve this point, it is appropriate to reorganize and expand the Planning Yuan, and to form the "General Affairs Office" with the most outstanding members of the various implementing officials (including the Army and Navy military affairs, equipment, and other relevant agencies) in order to stimulate the complete operation of the economy. At the same time, the Planning Yuan should be responsible for ordering the implementing officials to quickly implement the plans decided by the cabinet meeting. If the reorganized Planning Yuan can be further made a planning agency directly under the headquarters liaison meeting, its effect will be even greater.

Order Control

As mentioned above, although there are various difficulties in realizing the ideal plan for reforming production administration, the transitional production administration stagnation (according to convention, it takes at least half a year for an administrative agency to truly exert its effectiveness) and friction caused by organizational reform pose a danger of unexpected obstacles to the decisive battle production, and this point should also be considered.

As for the realistic aspect of carrying out the planned production, the unification of order issuance and receipt, which has been criticized as the narrow path of production administration, as well as reasonable adjustment and government control, are the minimum requirements that must be realized. Therefore, the more active application of the Special Wartime Administrative Law and the Special Wartime Administrative Power is what we are waiting to see.

Currently, because the orders are issued individually and arbitrarily, the factories that have always been famous have piles of orders, while on the other hand, the factories that are known to be empty are inevitably idle, resulting in the phenomenon that all the equipment owned by the enterprise cannot be fully and rationally utilized. Secondly, the lack of control over orders can hinder the realization of improving the quality and quantity of production by dividing the production fields. Furthermore, the lack of organic connection between the ordering officials and other industrial officials can make the distribution of major and minor materials impossible. Often in the same company's factories, and even in the same factory, there are examples of materials, technicians, and equipment that cannot be used interchangeably.

In this decisive battle stage where production conditions are constantly changing, production administration also needs to be organically responsive to the needs of reality, and it is necessary to quickly implement the allocation and exchange of production factors or mutual accommodation in order to increase the overall production volume. Such elastic economic guidance can only be expected on the basis of order control. Furthermore, in order to standardize and proportionally distribute production on a large scale, it is bound to be restrained and hinder its rapid realization when the issuance of orders is without control.

Regarding the necessity of controlling orders, the opinions of the military, government, and civilians have already been unified. In the shipbuilding industry, the unification of issuing orders has already been realized, and great success has been achieved in implementing shipbuilding plans.

Regarding rolling mills, a rolling mill committee with the Minister of Commerce and Industry as the chairman has also been established; as for machine tools for aircraft, a committee composed of the Army, Navy, and Ministry of Commerce and Industry has also been established to closely contact the control association and prepare to promote order control and plan this production. Furthermore, special steel, which is closely related to the production of aircraft and other weapons, recently established a special steel production increase liaison council jointly organized by the Army, Navy, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Steel Control Association in the central government, and a continuous liaison council composed of steel plants, steel control association branch supervisors, and public works officials at the local level, giving comprehensive and production administration to the operation.

Order control must overcome its difficulties and advance step by step in accordance with the current requirements of decisive battle production, so this time the "domestic potential enhancement policy" also "aims to unify the military and official voices on the procurement of important production."

The Ministry of Industry has already made clear statements on this matter. However, police officers, due to a lack of understanding of the situation, often obstruct the transfer. Therefore, the National Commercial Control Association specially sent a letter to the General Police Bureau of this city yesterday, instructing all subordinate police stations to allow free transfer in the future and not to interfere, in order to ease the difficulties of merchants.

After the government officially ordered the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, the relevant industries have applied for capital for the existing yarn and cloth as scheduled. According to reporters from the Shanghai News Agency, the authorities will soon stipulate and implement regulations for the distribution and management of cotton yarn. The relevant industry associations, such as the yarn and cloth industry, must base their opinions on the application for distribution and management on the categorized statistical table of the sales volume applied for by the members of each relevant industry association. A special application form will be distributed to each member, requiring them to fill in the correct quantity of cotton yarn to be sold in the form within a limited time and submit it to the association for reference. The form issued by the yarn and cloth industry is named "Application Form for Sales Quantity of Cotton Yarn." The items to be filled in are the number of pieces of yarn to be sold, the receipt number of the application to be purchased, the number of packages to be reserved, and remarks.

In order to ensure the health of citizens, the Municipal Health Bureau has set up a quarantine station in the Shanghai Livestock Market to conduct inspections of fresh pork, beef, mutton, and other meats sold in the market, in order to maintain the hygiene of the meat. However, chickens, ducks, wild game, and other items are often sold directly on the market without going through the market, which allows diseased or dead chickens, ducks, and rancid wild game to be mixed into the market for sale. If citizens purchase and consume them without knowing it, it will seriously affect their health.

The measurement and inspection of small launches under 20 tons, as well as registration and license issuance, have always been carried out by the Navigation Administration Bureau, which submits the applications of various shipping companies to the ministry for the issuance of small launch registration licenses. After the incident, due to special circumstances, it was temporarily impossible for the bureau to handle it uniformly, which caused disputes in authority from time to time, and the shipping companies also had difficulties in knowing where to turn. Subsequently, after repeated negotiations with the relevant authorities on the issue of the authority, the bureau began to handle all measurement, inspection, registration, and license issuance matters uniformly from the beginning of this year, so as to unify the authority. At the same time, the shipping companies were notified of the transportation licenses. Recently, some of these shipping companies have been able to abide by the law and apply for measurement and inspection and license issuance, while others have been waiting to see and attempting to evade and take advantage of the situation. In order to exercise its authority and protect merchants and travelers, the bureau has decided to uniformly ban the business of small launches that have not applied for measurement and inspection registration licenses, and prevent their navigation, and has informed the Jianghai Customs not to issue customs clearance.

### Ministry of Justice Rectifies Lawyer Qualifications

In order to effectively rectify the qualifications of lawyers in various places after the war, the Ministry of Justice Administration has not only strictly organized lawyer registration, but has also recently formulated regulations to ban law firms, stipulating that non-lawyers and unregistered lawyers, or members who have not joined the bar association, shall not handle or introduce litigation cases or non-litigation matters for others for remuneration. Violators shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than six months and fined not more than 2,000 yuan. At the same time, it is stipulated that the name of a lawyer, law firm, or similar name shall not be misused. If a law firm is named after a lawyer's name, and the lawyer loses his lawyer qualification or his registration is revoked, the name shall not be continued to be used, otherwise a fine of not more than 2,000 yuan shall be imposed.

### High Food Prices in New Areas of the First District; Price Control Policy Should be Adopted

The Times reported: According to most economic observers yesterday, after the Western District and a part of Zhabei were merged into the First District, the implementation of price controls and other economic strategies should follow the same economic policies implemented in the former International Settlement area as stipulated by the former Municipal Council and the First District Public Office after August 1. However, it has been found that this is not the case as expected. The unification of the Shanghai administrative system should first be implemented in the economic aspect, and it is especially necessary to implement the same economic policies in the Western District and a part of Zhabei as in the former International Settlement area. The measures that should be implemented in the newly incorporated areas are as follows: shops should clearly mark the prices of goods in the windows, and fresh milk and other canned foods and daily necessities should be sold at official prices. Hoarding and refusal to sell goods by shops should be punished, and other important official announcements should also be implemented. Food prices, especially in the Western District, are particularly high. It is generally hoped that controls should be implemented immediately to stabilize people's livelihoods. Authoritative observers have called on the authorities to take firm steps to expand the scope of economic control policies to the entire city.

### Hotels Publicly Sell Opium; It is Hoped That the Authorities Will Effectively Ban It

Central News Agency: After the restoration of the concessions, the municipal government was determined to rigorously ban gambling in the urban area in order to establish a new Shanghai. Last month, it ordered the closure of all opium dens in the First District. The Central Hotel and Shennan Hotel in the district, which were originally places where opium was publicly sold and people were allowed to smoke, were also ordered to prohibit the sale and smoking of opium last month. However, it has been found that the above mentioned sites of the Central Hotel and Shennan Hotel have revived and openly defied the municipal government's orders, selling opium and allowing people to smoke. At a time when the rigorous anti-opium and anti-gambling movement is in full swing, the general public hopes that the relevant authorities will effectively ban it in order to achieve the effectiveness of completely banning opium and gambling.

The Paradise of Wandering

### The Happy Life of Children at the Shanghai Fu You Orphanage

The children in this paradise for wandering children—the Shanghai Fu You Orphanage—can truly be said to be fortunate. They have completely broken away from the miserable lives of being abandoned, bullied, and insulted in the past and have embarked on a path of brightness and self-reliance. Under the guidance of their teachers, the children will now determine their own destiny.

Mr. Dong Bin said that since the orphanage was established in January of the 31st year of the Republic of China until now (October of the 32nd year), it has taken in a total of 375 wandering refugees and orphaned children. Among them, those who had previously studied and had relatively good grades and character were adopted by respectable people in society or taken back by their own families. Currently, there are 228 children remaining in the orphanage, 161 boys and 67 girls. About 40% of them are street children sent by various public organizations, newspapers, and kind people, and about 40% are orphans. The rest are children of hard-working laborers who have relatives but are actually unable to raise and educate their children, as well as apprentices who have escaped from abuse, etc. However, Mr. Dong Bin said correctly: "There are still countless wandering children and suffering children in society who urgently need to be rescued and educated."

After the children enter the Shanghai Fu You Orphanage, they naturally no longer have to worry about going hungry. When it was first established, it was stipulated that there would be one meal and two congees per day. The average daily consumption of rice was about 150 jin, and miscellaneous grains (including red beans, corn flour, wheat grits, sweet potatoes, and flour) were about 50 jin. In terms of vegetables, 4 jin of oil and about 120 jin of vegetables were used daily. Purchasing, cooking, and distribution were all handled by the teachers and the children themselves. The kitchen was so lively, with some washing, some sweeping, some lighting the fire, and some weighing. The allocation of food was based on the age and physique of the children, and they were divided into more than ten groups, each with different portions of food to suit their individual nutritional needs without wasting a single bit. However, the actual daily food supply was still somewhat insufficient for children who were developing, strictly speaking. With no other choice, they could only temporarily add an extra meal once a week and try their best to add an extra serving of vegetables once.

In addition to providing food, special attention was paid to the children's health and hygiene. All children sent to the orphanage for admission had to first go to Dr. Hu Qipeng at the hospital for examination. For the sake of the health of all the children in the orphanage, children with infectious diseases were not admitted. The health status of the children at the time of admission, as well as their special nutritional needs, were recorded in detail as a basis for future grouping, classification, and food allocation. Most of them were malnourished before admission, so they had to be given richer food when they first entered the orphanage. After a certain period of time, they would share the same food as the general students. If students in the orphanage were found to be ill, they would be treated by the orphanage. There was a medical room and ward in the orphanage, and a nurse was specially hired to be responsible for all medical affairs in the orphanage. Dr. Zhang Xiqi, an ophthalmologist, and Dr. Chen Zhanyuan, a dentist, were specially invited to visit the orphanage for examinations on a regular basis. If there were serious illnesses, they would be sent to the Zhenxin Infectious Disease Hospital and the Shandeshe for treatment. Special attention was paid to hygiene and cleanliness, and all teachers and staff worked closely together to supervise and assist in the children's bathing, changing clothes, washing, mending, haircuts, nail trimming, cold and heat care, and comforting of illnesses. Therefore, the orphanage students were able to prevent diseases before they occurred and maintain a healthy state. Not only had there been no deaths since its establishment, but also no serious illnesses or infectious disease emergencies had occurred.

Although the residences were old-fashioned houses, the antique architecture had adopted more modern construction methods, so the air and light were very good. The second floor served as a dormitory, with separate rooms for boys and girls, each accommodating more than ten to twenty people, each with a tutor in charge of supervision. Because they were all on the ground floor, special attention was paid to tidiness and cleanliness, and the floors were as smooth as desk surfaces.

Military-style management and family-style care—we envy the lives of these lucky ones among the suffering children.

Teaching, Learning, and Doing

The Shanghai Fu You Orphanage implements a system that combines teaching, learning, and doing in the education of the wandering and suffering children it takes in. In addition to imparting the knowledge necessary for life to these children, they also pay attention to their character and habits. They are required to master one skill every six months, laying the foundation for their future self-reliance and livelihood.

Elementary School System. According to actual needs, courses are formulated. Vice President Dong said that although it has not been established for long, the general academic performance at the end of the semester actually exceeds the level of ordinary elementary schools of the same grade. In learning, boys and girls study together without separate classrooms. Currently, the number of students in the first and second grades is the largest, exceeding more than half of the students in the entire orphanage. Therefore, there is a particularly great need for assistance from others in terms of education.

Starting from the third grade, in order to cultivate their collective activities and life skills, a work-study program is implemented. They still attend classes as usual every morning, and time is set aside for work in the afternoon. The work is temporarily divided into four parts: carpentry (carving), now limited to carving plaques and couplets due to various practical restrictions. Some school furniture, such as student desks and chairs, are also made by the students themselves. Minor repairs to school furniture are not entrusted to outsiders. Painting, including the preparation of various colored paints and the implementation of painting work, etc., is also mainly for learning and has not yet reached the stage of productive practical work. Shoe making, teaching the techniques of sewing cloth and leather shoes, so that they can support themselves after leaving the orphanage in the future. The shoes used by the orphanage students are also mostly sewn by themselves. Gardening, in addition to learning techniques such as planting, irrigation, cultivation, and harvesting, it is also planned to supplement the orphanage students' food with part of the harvest in the future. The campus is currently being developed, and vegetable seedlings have been planted in several places. There are also two piglets being raised in the corner of the garden.

In order to carry out basic life skills education, they specially hire technicians such as carpenters, shoemakers, and tailors to work closely with the teachers and staff to promote a scientific and rational education plan. In addition to formal academic subjects and work subjects, the orphanage students' extracurricular activities are also closely and cordially attended to. From the class teachers of each grade, the work instructors of each subject, to the supervising teachers of each dormitory, everyone cooperates with each other to create a good learning environment, so that these more than two hundred children from all over the world, who have experienced wandering and suffering, naturally lose their bad habits and gradually embark on a bright and correct path in collective life.

Self-Sufficiency, Self-Help, and Self-Governance

After class, the children are lively breathing fresh air on campus, each full of energy and high spirits. Who would have thought that not long ago, they were street children with dirty faces crying for help?

The children's current life, clothing, food, housing, and education are all provided by the orphanage. Look, they are all wearing brand-new blue cloth uniforms and clean shoes and socks. It is said that these are all sewn by themselves. Originally, the organizers of the orphanage, in order to cultivate the children's habits of hard work and endurance, only hired two workers in the orphanage, and all other daily life activities were led by the teachers and staff to carry out children's work, implementing self-sufficiency and self-help. They also organized a "Children's Self-Governance Guidance Committee" to cultivate the children's spirit of self-governance.

The children get up at 6:00 a.m. every day. In addition to washing themselves, they must also clean the dormitory and the entire orphanage. Morning exercises and morning meetings start at 7:00 a.m., and classes start at 9:00 a.m. Middle and high school students start work classes in the afternoon. When learning refined techniques, everyone listens attentively and carefully observes every movement of the technicians, while imitating and practicing. After becoming proficient, and during various simpler tasks, the children are just like formal laborers and soldiers, singing and doing, full of fun. The teachers and technicians also work together, teaching, learning, and doing, completely integrated into one.

The children's automatically organized Fu You Life Mutual Aid Association is divided into four sections: Inspection Section, which organizes patrol groups and tribunals. Any disputes between students, or problems related to learning and work, are resolved by the students themselves. The order of learning and work is also maintained by the students themselves. Academic Section: There is a publishing house, which compiles a bulletin board "Fu You News," as well as a lecture group and a library. Entertainment Section, divided into arts group, singing group, table tennis team, and sports group. Hygiene Section, divided into cleaning, care, and cooking groups. All affairs are solved by the children themselves.

Commentary

### The Economy of the Entire Society in the Economic World

Modern advanced countries take the economy of the entire society as the premise for all their legislation. What is meant by the "economy of the entire society?" It is to seek the welfare of the entire society, especially when a few people become rich during the war, while the majority of the people have fallen into poverty and hardship. Anything that affects the welfare of the entire people and the lives of the masses must be dealt with in both passive and active ways to find solutions. Everything from the fixing of food prices during wartime, the rationing of daily necessities, the reduction of the people's living burden, the planning of the people's residential safety, to the government's obligation to provide grain to its people in the event of famine, is related to the welfare of the entire society, which is the so-called "economy of the entire society" problem. Therefore, the economic laws and regulations of wartime countries are so strict because they are aimed at winning the country's victory abroad and maintaining social security at home.

We are aware that the welfare of the entire society is the economy of the entire society, so we believe that social welfare issues are the premise of wartime economic issues. Recently, the Municipal Citizens' Welfare Association and the Social Welfare Bureau have both focused their discussions on the hunger and cold of the general destitute people, the elderly, weak, disabled, and orphaned children wandering the streets of the city, and have formulated implementation steps and fundraising methods. The former seems to be no more than providing clothing, porridge, and setting up shelters, etc., while the latter seems to be no more than charity performances and ticket sales. We recognize that street vagrants are indeed one of the morbidities of the social economy, and are indeed a prominent example of the failure to solve the lives of the masses, so the remedy seems to depend on a more planned facility program and a larger-scale fundraising method, which should be undertaken jointly by the government and people from the private economic sector participating in the social welfare movement. Because in wartime, those who speak of the economy of the entire society cannot allow the continuation of famine. The reduction of famine is a guarantee of final victory.

### Cotton and Other Purchase Policies to Be Determined by the End of This Month, to Be Announced and Implemented After Approval by the Executive Yuan

Regarding the centralized purchase plan for cotton, oil grains, tobacco, and other items, as well as the purchase prices and other issues, at this time when new cotton, oil grains, tobacco, and other crops are being harvested one after another, a formal decision has not yet been made, which is of great concern to all parties. It is learned that this issue is generally decided by the Materials Control Review Committee and then formally announced and implemented after approval by the Executive Yuan. The Materials Control Review Committee will hold a meeting in Nanjing around the 30th of this month, at which time the above-mentioned centralized purchase plans for three important materials can be submitted for discussion. The content of the plans has been finalized by the liaison meeting of the Materials Control Review Committee's Shanghai office, so it is expected that it can be announced by the Executive Yuan in early next month.

Cotton Department to Prepare Inspection Committee

Since the Cotton Department of the Business Control Council has been fully responsible for this year's cotton collection work, the department has launched various preparations. It has recently been learned from that side that the funds required for the cotton collection have been allocated, and the price issue has also been initially agreed upon by the parties concerned. It can be implemented once approved by the authorities. The council also intends to establish a Cotton Inspection Committee to ensure that the quality of the collected cotton meets standards, and to hire experts to serve as members, specializing in the inspection of cotton quality and technical work.

### Non-Industry People May Not Participate in Association Directors and Supervisors

Since the government ordered the reorganization of trade associations in various industries and the large-scale adjustment of the organizational structure, the main commodity trade associations have completed their reorganization one after another, actively expanding their association affairs. The trade associations of secondary commodities have also been largely completed. It is learned that the competent authorities believe that although the organizational structure of the associations has tended to be strengthened, the responsible personnel may not be perfect, which greatly affects the development of association affairs and the welfare of the industry. Therefore, non-industry people are strictly prohibited from participating in or serving as directors and supervisors. At the same time, those with one of the following circumstances may not be representatives: Non-industry people, those deprived of public rights, those with words or deeds that violate national policies, or who have been sentenced by a court for criminal offenses, those who have been declared bankrupt and have not yet been restored, those who have been expelled from the association, those without the capacity to act. When appointing representatives, a letter of authorization must be given in advance, and the association must be notified and examined before it can be approved. The same applies to replacements. If a new member intends to join the association, they should find two member companies in the same industry to act as guarantors.

As for the Tasks of the Association

They are the following seven points: Joint purchase, storage, transportation, and sale of materials required by members, allocation of raw materials needed by members, adjustment of member business funds and guarantee of debts, proof of member material movement, execution of matters designated or entrusted by the competent authority, adjustment of labor-management disputes, mediation of disputes between members and members or non-members at the request of members, etc.

### Situation of the Textile Industry in the Chinese Side in August

In Central China, the textile industry has not been able to make satisfactory progress due to the lack of raw materials and materials. Now that cotton has been purchased, there should be a more concrete determination of the Sheng Long organization.

### Trends in Chinese Stocks

Re-emerging, especially in the afternoon, stimulated by a certain rumor, selling. Ordinary, department stores, textiles, and the precious metals sectors all tended to decline. Large households were skittish, and short-term investors were eager to sell, so prices fluctuated. Only financial and real estate stocks were favored by investors, with some even experiencing an increase due to short covering. The dynamics of various sectors throughout the day are recorded below. Department Stores: Yong'an Company fluctuated greatly in the morning but retreated by half a grade in the afternoon.

China Xing Coal Mine was also slightly higher.

Summary of Market Conditions

Public Bonds: Yesterday, the market continued to rise sharply after changing to futures trading. The volume of goods sold was very large, and the rising trend was also not weak, but the distance was getting farther and farther, and this abnormal situation was not optimistic. Type C was initially stable, once falling back slightly. After hovering for a long time, it rushed out of the pass. The result was more than seven feet higher than the previous day. Other types A and E had more transactions and also rose by one foot five or six. The volume of transactions for types B and D was extremely low and also increased by half a foot.

Overnight Interest Rate: The interest rate of the Qianye Association was 1.2%, unchanged.

Grain Market Prices: continued to rise yesterday. Rice prices rose sharply for the first time after the establishment of the Rice Association due to increased difficulty in transportation and strong sales by holders. Oil prices also rose.

Tea: Transactions remained scarce. The asking price for green tea continued to rise, resulting in very few transactions on the market. According to industry insiders, the future selling price is still expected to be good. Only black tea had slight sales in the city, with Zhifeng Yuxing Tea Shop and other tea shops purchasing about 16 boxes, sold by Gongchang Chunji Tea Shop. The market was brisk.

Medicinal Materials: Transactions remained sluggish, with sporadic supply and demand. Actual sales were also sluggish, and the market showed little improvement.

Rayon: The market remained weak and continued to lack activity. With weak actual sales, dealers also felt tired, and prices fell slightly again.

Daily Necessities: Regarding the allocation of soap and matches in the one-eight districts, the stores in the same industry designated as retail outlets by the municipal authorities have paid all the deposits, but the date of delivery and sale has not yet been officially notified by the authorities. It is learned that the date of sale of the allocated goods is expected to be in early next month. However, the public's need for soap and matches is quite urgent, so during the suspension of transactions in the daily necessities industry, due to the public's continuous purchases, holders felt that the goods were scarce and could be sold at a premium, resulting in continuous price increases.

### Coal Supply Gradually Smoothes, Fears Will Dissipate

The coal supply in this city has recently shown a sudden panic. In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited a person responsible for the allocation yesterday. According to him, the allocation of coal has been implemented for a year and a half since adhering to the purpose of the Coal Association, and the past results have been quite good. The lack of phenomenon this time is due to the delay in transportation and a slight decrease in arrivals. This month, the temporary delay in the allocation of domestic coal is due to the rectification of small retailers. At the same time, the high price of firewood has led to an increase in users, resulting in a situation where supply does not meet demand. At present, the source of coal has been smoothed as planned, and it is expected to return to its original state by the middle of next month.

### Silver and Banking Industries Plan to Form the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Banking Consortium

The banking consortium is scheduled to be established in Shanghai, with branch offices established in various locations throughout the three provinces. In accordance with the "General Principles for Financial Institutions Handling Rural Loans" promulgated by the government, rural loan work will be implemented to assist in promoting agricultural production increase plans. Furthermore, this rural loan method will target cooperatives, and efforts will be made to reduce interest rates.

### ### Confrontation and Awareness of the Japanese People: Dialogue Between Tokutomi Sohō and Honda Kumatarō on Confrontation and the Awakening of the Japanese People

The state of the war is becoming increasingly fierce, and the battle situation has now entered a decisive phase. At this critical juncture, the government should concentrate all manpower and material resources on the execution of the war, and actively reorganize the political and economic systems. However, it is regrettable that there are still shortcomings in the unification and integration strategy of the national spirit, which is the driving force. If the war is prolonged and the battle situation becomes more complicated, then differences of opinion will naturally arise in the judgment of the situation, and the guiding principles of the war will be confused. This is true in any country. What Japan needs now to carry out the war is to concentrate the spiritual power of the people on destroying England and the United States, so that the enemy's propaganda tactics have no way to be used. At this decisive stage, to remind the nation of its awakening, we specially invite our company's Mr. Tokutomi Sohō and former Ambassador to China Honda Kumatarō to publish their dialogue in the newspaper, hoping that everyone will remember their ardent and patriotic feelings. The following is a summary of their shorthand record:

### Tokutomi Sohō

From my point of view, among the current government officials, the most enthusiastic worker must be Mr. Tōjō. However, the general public is not following in Mr. Tōjō's footsteps, taking it easy and letting Mr. Tōjō be busy alone. To be honest, everything is flowing into a general formality. Let's put these aside for the time being and talk about the war issue. No one has thoroughly thought about what the meaning of this war is. People like Mr. Honda, who are in a diplomatic guiding position, and those who have had a conversation with him, I think it would be beneficial to Japan's diplomacy! He is very clear about the situation in China. I went there once in Meiji 39 (1906) and met Mr. Honda in Beijing, just when he and Mr. Abe Moritarō were in China. Moreover, Mr. Honda has attended all the major conferences in the world and appeared on all the major stages, so he knows everything very clearly.

What Mr. Tōjō says is not actually implemented, which is really regrettable. These are the most important tasks today, and the people who are really implementing them are the lower-level people. Especially the students, who are sharing the difficulties because of the country's crisis. I have a grandson in military school, and although he is sick this year, he is still in the military, regardless of his physical condition. Speaking of my young relatives, some of them also want to serve in the air force. I have another grandson who has decided to join the air force. This is just in my immediate circle. Other young people are probably also working very enthusiastically. Today, teachers are not as good as students; it is the students who are dragging the teachers along. This shows that Japan's spirit is very hot in some places, very cold in others, very real in some places, and very superficial in others.

What I resonate with most about Mr. Honda's views is that the Japanese do not know the misery of defeat if they are unfortunately defeated. That must be known by those who know the situation in Japan, those who participated in the Boshin War, the people of Aizu. Only the people of Aizu have experienced the misery of a defeated army quite deeply. But most of those predecessors have already died, and the people now are their children or grandchildren, so Japan only knows victory this time and knows nothing else. Therefore, they have no idea what the misery of defeat is like. The Japanese have no feeling for this at all, so they treat the war as a commonplace thing. After the war starts, it can be stopped, just like two people wrestling. After three rounds of fighting, regardless of the outcome, it can be ended. However, today's war is different because the reasons for the war are different, so...

Mr. Honda Kumatarō

That's right, the reasons for the war are different. Today, it is not Japan who drives out England and the United States as the leader of East Asia, but England and the United States who become the leaders of East Asia and drive out Japan. It is either they kill us, or we kill them. There is no other way, no room for a compromise. If there was such room, it could have been compromised before the decisive battle. So, in any case, this war is either success or failure. So I think this war cannot but be thoroughly investigated. The attitude of the other side. Today is a trivial issue. What Japan is better than England and the United States this time is that Japan's flag is clear. If this becomes an immovable fact, then the other side will weep, which is different from before. This is because they realize that they were wrong, and they don't know what to do in the future, so they can only cry. If we do not fundamentally concentrate our efforts on destroying England and the United States, Japan has no place to stand. The other side also has considerable weaknesses. They certainly have strengths, but they have more weaknesses. We have studied the United States for a long time, and we are generally clear about where their weaknesses are and how certain points are. Whether viewed from a social point of view or from the point of view of economic organization, there are countless flaws. However, they think that Japan is in distress, so they maintain their flaws. Once they know that Japan is not in distress, the other side is different from Japan. They do not have an emperor of ten thousand years, and the so-called president of the other side is like a manager of a company.

Honda

What you said just now

There are various weaknesses. Let me say a few professional words. During the war here, Churchill said personally, I heard it with my own ears, that Germany is preparing, which shows that we are completely caught off guard, and are being sucker punched - this is a lie. He said that as long as we act in time, with the vast resources of the UK and the greatness of the national character, we can go anywhere, but now he is also talking about a long-term plan of a hundred years. Japan won in the early stages of the war, but with the industrial production capacity of the United States, plus the strength of the UK, they can use a long-term war to scare Japan. But now this intimidation is no longer effective. What I feel is that the intimidation with a long-term war has been very anxious since this spring.

Even the American side is very anxious. What Roosevelt said about the war, even the professional soldiers don't know what it is all about. What the United States is particularly anxious about is that the US economic life, or the wartime systemization of the domestic economy, is at least three years behind Japan. Since the Pearl Harbor attack, they have been trying to catch up. The cars they use to get around can't run, and meat is also rationed. The people's tolerance for this rapid wartime systematized life, that is, their endurance, is no match for us Japanese. That immediately becomes a social problem, creating a social phenomenon, so money is used lavishly. No matter what kind of regulatory measures the government uses, if it wants to gradually flow money, it will turn into inflation. However, in Japan, in a country like you said, we have a heart of death, because it is a time of life and death, so everyone clenches their teeth, regardless of everything, and happily endures the heavy burden, while the other side, from Roosevelt's point of view, everything starts from the perspective of next year's presidential election. In next year's election battle, we must use all means to hope to be re-elected. Roosevelt has already broken the tradition of the founding of the country three times, and this time he is preparing for a fourth term, so in any case, we must establish a very unreasonable war plan, so the war is very blind, and we cannot but pay unnecessary sacrifices in terms of people and things. That country, which is originally good at propaganda, says very little about its own losses, and its victories are particularly exaggerated. But these must have battle results that can suppress the people. This is the reason for the intensification of the battles in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea since last August. In short, on the one hand, we hope to force the people to hold next year's election, and on the other hand, we hope to end the war as soon as possible. For Roosevelt, the war itself is a political strategy. From the beginning of the war to the surrender of Germany, he lived in London for four years and one month. Recently, because there is no new inspiration, I revisited the books I read during the last war and got a lot of inspiration. From the beginning of August 1914, through 1915 and 1916, that is, the third year of the war, after two years of war, although the war poems were the victorious Germany, or the UK and France, which were in a passive position and fighting a long-term war, they both felt extremely troubled because they had no way to end the war. Among them, Russia collapsed in 1917 due to a revolution that occurred halfway, and then an unexpected result occurred due to the entry of the United States. Even if the United States did not participate, the result is still uncertain. In short, in the case of the UK, why was the Asquith cabinet dissolved? After the Asquith cabinet was dissolved, a coalition cabinet was formed with the Conservative Party. That coalition cabinet was internally bombed by Lloyd George in December 1916 and finally dissolved. At that time, the Lloyd George cabinet was actually a domestic country based on the Conservative Party. At that time, in order to induce Austria to negotiate peace alone, the Briand cabinet of France and the Asquith cabinet of the UK were often in a state of anxiety. The difficulty of ending the war with military force, because they wanted to use political work to end the war, so Germany, needless to say, England and France were often in distress. Two years later, Germany, which had the upper hand on the battlefield, and England and France, which were at a disadvantage, both hoped to end the war. In the last war, the UK used all the capital interest and dividends to pay for the war expenses. If the interest and dividends were not enough, even the capital was used. However, after the war, even though only ten years had passed, the UK thought that there would be no more wars in the world. In fact, because the UK was confident that it could complete its hegemony over the world without war, it reduced its army and even its navy, so there was a plan to reduce armaments.

National Forum

### ### Launching a Literacy Campaign Zhang Qiyang

In order to clarify the importance of the literacy movement, and in order to make everyone widely recognize the importance of the position occupied by the literacy movement in the nation-building process, we particularly emphasize that the rise and fall of the nation depends on the level of national culture, and the level of national culture depends entirely on whether the national literacy movement can be popularized.

We should first recognize clearly that the literacy movement is by no means compulsory education, let alone primary school education. It is a people's conscious movement under the guidance of government agencies and with the assistance of formal education. On the one hand, it is the organic advocacy of the government; on the other hand, it is the enthusiastic promotion of social progressives and educators; and on the other hand, it contains the conscious awareness of the people. This is the characteristic of the literacy movement. If this point is ignored, then the literacy movement cannot be discussed, cannot be carried out, and the result will inevitably be failure.

It cannot be denied that there are indeed too many illiterates today, which is shocking. People are displaced and wander around, let alone literacy education. Society is unstable and insecure, and the government has no time to take care of it. However, the literacy movement is so important to the future of the nation that we dare not remain silent. Based on the characteristics of the literacy movement and examining the current environment, a draft outline of a literacy movement plan (the detailed measures will be carefully and precisely determined by education experts and administrative authorities) is provided for everyone to discuss:

The education administration authorities should gather educators with practical experience in the country to organize a literacy movement promotion committee to carefully formulate the implementation methods of the literacy movement, and instruct schools at all levels and relevant social organizations to implement it.

Compile literacy textbooks for the people: The principles should be simple, easy to understand, and in line with the actual life of the people. They should be distributed to illiterates free of charge, and the printing costs should be requested from the national government by the Ministry of Education.

Before launching this movement, the Pao-Chia system should be used to investigate the exact number of illiterates by the Pao-Chia Office in conjunction with other local self-government agencies.

All illiterates should be evenly distributed according to the Pao-Chia area. Then, local schools, social groups, and various public places should be used to implement teaching.

Teachers can use the extracurricular time of primary school teachers, normal school students, middle school students, and university students to teach voluntarily, and they must not shirk their responsibilities. Those with excellent results will be rewarded and commended by the government, and those with poor results will be given appropriate punishment.

Use little teachers, that is, teach as soon as you know, to seek rapid results. During the Incident of the Same Day (1925), Mr. Tao Xingzhi advocated it first, and local people's education groups and normal schools responded to it later. The trial results were remarkably successful. Unfortunately, the authorities at that time did not provide vigorous assistance, excellent textbooks were not compiled, and the people's awareness was not improved. As a result, the lively little teacher literacy movement at one time faded into insignificance. The author was then in a certain normal school, personally involved in the affair, and deeply felt that this method was a shortcut to promote the literacy movement. The reason why it later faded into insignificance and folded its flags was not because the method was not good, but because of the lack of effort of all circles and regions to promote it. Because using little teachers to promote the literacy movement not only saves a lot of manpower and material resources, but also is a truly penetrating movement. The people can avoid the interference with work and the loss of time, and of course they will sincerely accept the literacy. This kind of conscious acceptance and request of the people is the true success of people's education. Therefore, the author does not repeat the old tune and proposes this well-deserved shortcut to the people's literacy movement - the little teacher system. The above is just a rough outline, or an old theory, or a previous pattern. Because our society and country are too bad, the author does not want to be innovative and establish new things, but only hopes that the above-mentioned issues can be achieved, which is already the dawn of the nation's future.

### ### Children's Library: Fundraising for Library Buildings

Since its establishment, the Children's Library has been in operation for three years. 150,000 children in this city have enjoyed free reading of books. Mobile circulation stations have been set up in various districts, group book borrowing is organized in various schools, and mobile libraries are held in various neighborhoods, so that general children have the opportunity to borrow and read books for free. Now, because the library business is gradually expanding, the original library building is not enough. The building is valued at 55,000 yuan, but the library has no funds and cannot afford it, so it is planned to organize a charity football match between the Portuguese and Tonghua football teams.

The proceeds from the sale of tickets will be used to purchase library buildings. It is scheduled to be held at the Yiquan Greyhound Racing Track at 10:00 a.m. on the 31st of this month. Ticket prices are divided into three types: 100 yuan, 50 yuan, and 20 yuan. The ticket sales points are the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, Sichuan Road Four Bank Savings Association Ying Yongyu, Sanma Road Xinfu Industrial Company, Sima Road World Bookstore, the Dahua Shopping Mall Children's Library, and Yiquan. Ma Shan'er Ke Lasha Kao Situo, who is as famous as Li Huitang, will play a righteousness game. At that time, it is expected to be a grand occasion.

### ### Recruiting Female National Doctors to Provide Diagnosis and Free Medicine

Zhao Zhuping (formerly Zhao Shuping), a female national doctor specializing in typhoid fever, gynecology, and pediatrics, has served in the medical field for many years. She is praised by those who know her for her loyalty and prudence. Recently, because of the sight of the suffering, she can't help but promote the noble love of mankind with the same compassion. She has also received enthusiastic and generous sponsorship from relatives and friends. Starting from the 27th of this month, she will set up a new clinic to provide diagnosis and free medicine, so that the poor and sick will have a new way of life. The location is at the Tianjitang National Medical Clinic at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road. The time is from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. every day. All the very poor who come to the clinic will be diagnosed and given medicine according to the number.

### ### Road Name Identification

Daxi Road has now been changed to "Chang'an Road," Ou Jia Road has been changed to "Kulun Road," and Gongguan Road has been changed to "Jinling Road." The writer now lives in Zhabei and knows that there is already a Chang'an Road at the north end of the Xin Zha Bridge, a Kulun Road at the north end of the Wuzhen Road Bridge (the bridge has been removed), and a Jinling Road near Datong Road and Gonghe Road. I hope that all sectors will pay attention to avoid misunderstandings. (Xu Yiping)
