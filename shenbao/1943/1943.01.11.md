### Establishing Wartime Economic Policies

We discussed the general principles of a wartime political system yesterday. We believe that only with enlightened politics and a reformed atmosphere, only when public opinion can be adopted by the government, can national policies be thoroughly implemented. However, we must not neglect the economy at the same time. Because the economy is the foundation of politics, if economic policies are unsound, then "there has never been a case of a nation being rich while its people are poor." Therefore, the determination of wartime economic policies is of paramount importance.

However, the economic policy of a country, whether in wartime or peacetime, especially in wartime, must thoroughly understand the economic characteristics of the country and formulate a "prescriptive" strategy; otherwise, it will only cause suffering to the people and become an empty formality. What are the characteristics of the current Chinese economy?

Since the start of the China Incident, an economic panic has emerged across China's vast territory. Rural areas have gone bankrupt, and urban industries have withered or stagnated. The national economy has suffered unprecedented destruction. Labor, raw materials, transportation, and the purchasing power of the general public are all far from what they used to be.

The development of production has also been severely hampered. Therefore, current wartime economic policies must not simply copy those of other countries. China's wartime economic policies are built on the foundation of the dire state of people's livelihoods in the five or six years after the war. Therefore, its characteristics should not be merely the implementation of control and allocation systems, but should also have the positive meaning of encouraging and supporting production.

However, relying solely on this principle of economic policy is not enough. On the one hand, we need to have a more thorough understanding of the Chinese economy, and on the other hand, we need to consider the greater future of the nation and carefully establish economic policies. Although these are wartime policies, they must also consider the recovery and development of the economy after the war.

Under this premise, we must first recognize that the biggest reason why China's economy could not develop in the past was the invisible constraints imposed by British and American forces. Although British and American forces have now been eliminated, the spirit and system of British and American economics in China still exist. Secondly, we must know that the economic policies of the past, especially the economic policies of the Chongqing regime, were very chaotic. They did not consider the interests of the entire nation, nor did they consider the long-term plans of the nation, but simply followed the capitalist system of Britain and the United States, serving British and American capitalists, and neglecting the development of the entire national economy. In many ways, they even hindered the development of the national economy. Thirdly, the economic structure of China is dominated by small and medium-sized producers, with small-scale commodity production accounting for a very large proportion. This is true of rural production and handicraft production, and how much different is it for modern industry? If we do not correct these characteristics of the Chinese economy and copy the economic policies of other countries, the result will only increase the suffering of the people and the national economy. Fourthly, we must not shy away from saying that in the process of this Greater East Asia War, in order for China and Japan to truly cooperate and strive for victory, our country's economic policies must maintain close ties with Japan, especially in terms of materials and labor. China must fulfill its due obligations; otherwise, what is the point of participating in the war? However, at the same time, we should remind the Chinese and Japanese authorities and economic circles that the co-existence and co-prosperity of China and Japan that we advocate and aspire to are not only for today's wartime cooperation, but also have a greater future, which is the eternal cooperation in the long years after the war. Therefore, today's economic policies must not only meet the temporary needs of the Greater East Asia War, but also be planned on a larger scale, planned for peaceful cooperation between the two countries after the war. Only by putting the Chinese economy on the right track of rational development, and enabling the balanced and rational development of agriculture and industry in China, will it benefit the Chinese nation and may even provide greater assistance to the Japanese wartime economy.

After the basic premise and tasks are determined, we feel that the following more specific points should be noted regarding the content of the economy:

First, in terms of enterprises, in addition to actively building state-owned enterprises, we must protect and support the development of private capital. China's industry is very pitiful. Under these circumstances, we should increase production, not passively restrict it. The role of developing state-owned enterprises is to solve the needs of some materials and promote the development of private enterprises. It should never monopolize and compete with the people for profit. For private enterprises, we must subsidize large-scale enterprises, but at the same time, we must not neglect small and medium-sized production. Here, cooperative enterprises must be earnestly promoted.

Second, in terms of production relations, in industry, we must improve labor-management relations and improve the treatment of workers. In agriculture, we must also solve the tenancy relationship fairly and reasonably. Whether for industry or agriculture, for operators and industrial and agricultural workers, we must try our best to avoid causing resentment, reduce their burden and inconvenience as much as possible, actively protect their legitimate interests, and try to help them develop production.

Third, in finance and taxation, we must strictly prohibit banks and money shops from speculating on commodities, guide idle funds into productive enterprises, and use all reasonable methods to reduce the degree of currency inflation. We must also strive to innovate and improve in terms of tax system and public debt.

In addition, we should improve transportation, increase transportation tools, resolutely eradicate hoarding and speculation, and support the business of small and medium-sized merchants; especially in the peaceful areas, improve the inspection system, carefully select, train and assess inspection personnel, pay special attention to the punishment of major offenders, and do not make excessive difficulties for ordinary small merchants and civilians.

The most important points we have seen and thought about are the above. However, when it comes to the wartime economy, it still depends on the improvement of politics. Only good politics, especially good and honest political cadres at all levels, can guarantee the healthy development of the wartime economy. We sincerely hope that all parties will pay attention to this, so as to comfort the expectations of our people.

It is expected that the National Government will further strengthen security and increase production in the future, in order to enhance the national foundation and cooperate in the war. It will also take a heroic stance in defending East Asia and restoring China, and will not hesitate to wage a difficult struggle against Britain and the United States.

### Japanese Army in China, General Commander Hata's Speech: China and Japan Should Trust and Help Each Other to Strive to Complete the Greater East Asia War

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) Japanese Army in China, General Commander Hata, upon learning of the National Government's declaration of war, recently issued the following statement:

Japan had previously resolved to eliminate the evil forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia and to ensure the permanent stability of Greater East Asia, which ultimately led to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. It has now been a year, and thanks to the strategic planning and bravery of the Japanese soldiers and the full mobilization of the rear by the people, unprecedented major victories have been achieved, key areas in the South have been occupied, and an invincible situation has been established. During this period, the National Government has been sharing weal and woe and fully cooperating with Japan's operations. This time, it has further resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, which is not only for the construction of a New China, but also for the construction of a New East Asia, and is truly commendable. Now that China and Japan have issued a joint declaration and are conducting a joint war under full cooperation, the military cooperation between the two countries has been further strengthened due to China's participation in the war. That is, the troops of the two countries will develop the friendship of comrades-in-arms under strong unity, undergo full training, and wage a just war against the common enemy with the belief in certain victory, and will inevitably achieve final victory. At this time, it is regrettable that the Chongqing faction still does not distinguish between obedience and defiance, does not observe the world's general trends, and is willing to be a pawn of the public enemies of the East Asian nations, Britain and the United States, and is still engaged in resistance. If the Chongqing faction bears the stigma of being a rebel against East Asia and hinders the sacred cause, the Japanese Army in China will never tolerate it and will only annihilate it. Today, let us calmly consider the situation in East Asia. It has been five and a half years since the outbreak of the China Incident. During this period, there have been twists and turns, but it has made the relationship between China and Japan return to its original state. Moreover, due to this participation in the war, the rise and fall of China and Japan are shared. The one-year history of the Greater East Asia War has eliminated the anti-force in the vast area of East Asia, and all construction is gradually progressing and will reap the fruits of co-prosperity. East Asia is now approaching the dawn of a new era. Generally speaking, in the second year, the enemy is still attempting to resist desperately, and there are still many difficulties ahead of us. However, China and Japan should trust each other, help each other, work hard, and strive to complete the Greater East Asia War.

### The Liberation of East Asia Can Be Declared Successful

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) General Hayashi Senjuro, President of the Japan Asian Co-operation Society, was extremely pleased upon learning that the Chinese government had announced its participation in the war. He specially stated, "China's declaration of participation in the war is not only deeply gratifying to the people of both countries, but also to the 1 billion people of East Asia. The phrase 'sharing life and death' put forward by Chairman Wang has been realized, and the liberation and prosperity of East Asia will inevitably be declared successful as a result."

### Jing New Movement Branch Level Practice Group

### Suhuai Counties Decide to Implement Military National Education, People's Representatives Hold a Conference in Xuzhou

### Talks by the Chief and Deputy Chief of the Suqing Township Party Affairs Office

Suzhou, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) After the National Government's declaration of war on Britain and the United States reached the provincial capital, Director Li and Deputy Director Yuan of the Qingxiang District Party Affairs Office made special remarks, which are recorded separately below.

Director Li said, "The history of China in the past century has been almost entirely a history of lingering under the iron heels of British and American imperialism. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the warlords have fought each other within the country, and politics has been unable to develop. In fact, this is all due to the instigation of Britain and the United States. Therefore, the main condition of the Chinese revolution under the leadership of the founding father was to eradicate the forces of Britain and the United States. We still remember that in 1922, when the founding father extracted Guangzhou customs duties, Britain and the United States directly loaded their seventeen warships into Guangzhou. This is enough to prove the collusion with domestic corrupt forces. Today, in order to implement the unfinished will of the Chinese revolution, we must further recognize the causes and effects of the East Asian Incident in recent years and vow to use the solidarity of the yellow race to create an iron wall to protect East Asia. In the past, when the Chinese declared war on Europeans and Americans, it was isolated, so it was not victorious, but this time the situation is completely different. There are not only strong allies fighting side by side, but also foreign groups that oppose Britain and the United States fighting together. I dare to guarantee that victory belongs to us." Deputy Director Yuan said, "History tells us that responding to each other is the primitive philosophy of mutual survival for mankind. The world of East Asia is the world of East Asians. If we want to maintain the inherent base of East Asia, China and Japan must strive for future survival through mutual understanding. The Chongqing faction does not hesitate to fight among themselves and is anesthetized by the distorted approach of close attack and distant diplomacy, which not only violates the duties given by history, but also deviates from the great nature inherent in mankind. From the perspective of the development of international forms, the snipe and the clam fighting each other will eventually lead to the destruction of the snipe and the clam themselves. Today, our opposition to Britain and the United States is entirely based on the world of the entire East Asian people. All Chinese people should, under the leadership of the highest leader, understand the times and the situation in East Asia, and use this determination to welcome the miracle of human rationality. China's declaration of war on Britain and the United States this time relies on the guidance of wise leaders and the cooperation of the entire nation. We dare to guarantee that victory belongs to us."

### All Qingxiang Personnel Support the National Government's Participation in the War

Central News Agency report: People in East Asia have long been resentful of the aggression of the white race. During the Greater East Asia War, they have slightly relieved their resentment, but the evil forces have not been completely eliminated, and it is difficult for us to rest easy. Now, in order to eliminate the remaining evil and rebuild, our National Government resolutely issued a clear order to participate in the war, to eliminate those ugly kinds and lay the foundation for our country. We will share the same hatred and jointly launch a righteous crusade. Therefore, when the National Government's telegram on participation in the war arrived in Zhejiang, all the people in Zhejiang were enthusiastically excited. Every civilian had great hopes. The Qingxiang Office and agencies at all levels intensified their work. Chief Chuan sent a telegram to the Chairman in the morning of the 10th to pay his respects and sincerely support him. The original telegram read: "To Chairman Wang of the Nanjing National Government: I read the Qing telegram and admire your spirit of sharing the same hatred and fighting the enemy, winning glory for China and building a bastion for East Asia. Everyone with blood and energy follows. In recent days, the people in the Qingxiang area have been listening and are extremely excited. Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered without prior arrangement. They all vowed to share the spirit of weal and woe and fight for life and death, to eliminate the Allies and strengthen our axis. Shishuo respectfully leads 1.5 million people in the Qingxiang area to intensify their work, sleep with spears as pillows, wait for orders, and serve as vanguards. Respectfully telegraphing our respects, I respectfully request your consideration. Chuan Shishuo, Chief of the Zhejiang Office of the Qingxiang Committee, leads all Qingxiang staff in bowing."

### The People Increase Their Work and Prepare to Hold Large Meetings

Since Jiaxing has been handling Qingxiang affairs, important military, political, and party affairs figures have been frequent visitors, and talents have gathered. After the National Government announced its declaration of war on Britain and the United States on the 9th, all sectors of society from Qingxiang to He were extremely excited. A warm people's congress was held that afternoon. Yesterday was the second day after the National Government's declaration of war, and the emotions among the people were even more tense. The industrial and commercial sectors raised the national flag high, and slogans with clear and eye-catching characters were everywhere in the streets and alleys, supporting the National Government's participation in the war, wishing the Greater East Asia War victory, and so on, were vividly written on paper. The people were even more confident in victory, and a sense of shared hatred and determination to fight the enemy was fully revealed in their words. All military and political agencies increased their work after the National Government officially announced its declaration of war on Britain and the United States, gradually showing the state of the country's declaration of war on foreign countries. As for the various special zones, except for Liangjia in He and Haining near Jiaxing, all sectors in Haiyan, Pinghu, and Songnan only received the news of the declaration of war on the morning of the 10th. In an instant, thanks to the power of newspapers, many people in the remote areas of the special zones were able to see the news of the participation in the war. At present, all localities are launching people's congresses to take the same steps as the government to express their anti-British and anti-American sentiments.

### Yu's Supreme National Defense Council Convenes an Emergency Meeting, Feeling Deeply Uneasy About Future Developments, Britain Pays Close Attention to the Future of the East Asian War Situation

Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) According to reliable sources, after the news of the National Government's participation in the war reached Chongqing, all parts of the Yu area were greatly agitated. The Yu Supreme National Defense Council immediately convened an emergency meeting of its leaders at 2 p.m. on the 9th to discuss countermeasures. It then held a meeting with the British and American ambassadors and military representatives stationed in Yu to negotiate, and the situation was quite anxious. Intellectuals in general were even more worried and uneasy, and there was a possibility of major turmoil as a result.

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) The news of the National Government's declaration of war on Britain and the United States was broadcast throughout Europe via China and Japan that day. Political circles in various countries were extremely agitated by this. According to a telegram from London, the British side seemed quite calm on the surface regarding the National Government's participation in the war, but it seemed to be paying more attention to the future and impact of the Greater East Asia War situation. Well-informed sources in London predicted that the British side could only make shameless propaganda again, such as saying that the National Government's participation in the war would not bring about major changes in the Japanese military, etc., and believed that the National Government's participation in the war this time could actually express its determination to annihilate the Yu faction, and was quite worried that the pressure on the Yu faction would increase. In addition, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and American governments, although most of their concessions in China had been lost, still issued a statement to Yu last autumn, abolishing extraterritoriality to show their favor to the Yu faction. However, the specific methods are still under negotiation. On the other hand, in the China-Japan agreement issued by the National Government at the time of its participation in the war, the Japanese government stated that it would return most of the Japanese-controlled concessions in China, making the empty gestures of Britain and the United States completely ineffective. It is reported that the British authorities are quite embarrassed and uneasy about the status of British and American residents in the concessions in the peaceful areas of China, believing that changes will occur. According to news from Chongqing, the Yu faction is feigning calmness on the surface regarding the National Government's participation in the war, but is deeply suspicious and uneasy about how the Japanese army and the National Government will fully cooperate and launch new operations against the Yu faction in the future.

### The Propaganda Department Holds Two Lecture Meetings Separately

### After the National Government Declared War, East Asia Has Become United, Britain and the United States Suffer Severe Blows, Germany and Italy Express Warm Welcome

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – The German Foreign Ministry authorities, on the 9th, expressed their views on the National Government's declaration of war and Japan's abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of exclusive concessions in China, stating that the resolute declaration of war against Britain and the United States by the Chinese National Government demonstrates its firm belief in the victory of the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy in this war. More importantly, China has a population unparalleled in the world. The participation of the National Government, with its hundreds of millions of people, in the Axis war front to fight against Britain and the United States is a considerable force. As a result, China and Japan can form a common front. Furthermore, Japan's abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of exclusive concessions in the territory of the National Government are particularly important. Britain and the United States have been negotiating with Chongqing for years to abolish extraterritoriality. Japan's voluntary abandonment of extraterritoriality in China proves Japan's sincere and friendly attitude toward the National Government. The equality of rights between China and Japan is also established here. At the same time, the propaganda made by Britain and the United States that Japan is oppressing China is completely shattered. We sincerely welcome the Chinese people under the National Government rising up to participate in the Axis countries' war against Britain and the United States.

Berlin, 10th (Domei News Agency) – According to political figures here, after the Chinese National Government declared war, the 250 million Chinese people also stand on the front line against Britain and the United States. The significance of this is self-evident. German newspapers are competing to publish this news and the statements made by China and Japan on this development. People in Berlin continue to say that this move is particularly fortunate because it has caused Roosevelt to suffer another misfortune. The backlash caused by the white paper he issued was weak and he was criticized by Congress, exposing his embarrassment. Now he has suffered another major blow.

Berlin, 10th (Domei News Agency) – Public opinion in Berlin believes that the Chinese National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States is sufficient to demonstrate its confidence in the final victory of the Tripartite Pact countries. German newspapers have published the communiqués issued by Nanjing and Tokyo on the front page, unanimously praising them. The "German General Review" commented: "From now on, the entire East Asia is now united to jointly deal with the financial groups of Britain and the United States, giving a major blow to the exploitation schemes of Britain and the United States, and restoring China's complete sovereignty." "Strong War" commented: "China's declaration of war is a major blow to Roosevelt and Churchill. From now on, Britain and the United States will add another heavy burden, and it also proves that the construction of the new order in East Asia has now entered the stage of implementation. Britain and the United States have completely lost the opportunity to recover their lost territories." The "Berlin Local Daily" commented: "The Chinese National Government's adoption of this step is the success of the new world order."

Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – The Asahi Shimbun published an editorial stating that China's participation in the war is a further step in implementing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. China and Japan have now formed a unified entity in military, political, and economic aspects. The relationship between Nanjing and Germany, Italy, Thailand, and other countries has become even closer. Now that Japan has abandoned its concessions and consular jurisdiction in China, Chongqing has no excuse.

Rome, 10th (Central News Agency) – Italian public opinion is expressing warm welcome to the National Government's resolute declaration of war against Britain and the United States. According to Stefani News Agency on the 9th, the National Government's participation in the war has further increased the strength of the Greater East Asia War to liberate East Asia, and its influence on the Axis camp is extremely important and great. This is the common feeling of all Italian people. Furthermore, Japan's voluntary abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions are not to be compared with the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards Chongqing. The Italian people firmly believe that with the sincere cooperation of the two major nations of China and Japan, the final victory of the Greater East Asia War will be achieved, and the great cause of building the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be completed.

Madrid, 10th (Domei News Agency) – Spanish newspapers attach great importance to China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, recognizing it as an indication of actively fighting alongside Japan. When publishing the news, the newspapers placed the Chairman's photograph in a prominent position on the front page.

### Talk by Commander Yoshida of the Japanese Fleet Stationed in China: China and Japan Have Already Cooperated as One, Hoping to Devote All Efforts to Completing the War

Central News Agency, Shanghai – Commander Yoshida Zengo of the Japanese fleet stationed in China recently issued a statement regarding our country's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, stating that with the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese joint declaration on cooperating to complete the war, China and Japan have now become one in name and in fact, cooperating as one to bravely advance towards the goal of completing the holy war. The rise and fall of Greater East Asia can be expected, and I am sincerely overjoyed. Recalling that since the return to the capital, China and Japan have shared weal and woe in the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, and have consistently and strongly assisted the Empire in promoting national policy. Therefore, this participation in the war has further established the wartime system in the country, mobilizing the total strength of materials and minds, and demonstrating the enthusiasm of Chinese officials and people. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, relying on Japan's strategic planning and brave fighting, unprecedented great war results have been achieved, and we continue to advance towards the final victory with unwavering determination. At this moment, Sino-Japanese relations have suddenly revealed new developments, which can be said to further enhance the war strength of our camp, and make the political and military strategies of certain victory and invincibility that have already been established even stronger. This goes without saying for Britain and the United States. Especially for Chongqing, due to the clear attitude of China and Japan, it has already lost the name of resisting Japan and the hope of war victories. I deeply believe that its influence is very great. The Imperial government has taken various measures on this occasion to strengthen the political power of the National Government and increase the welfare of the Chinese people, which has been announced in detail the other day. This is nothing more than to expect the development of our friendly ally China and the enthusiasm of their sincere cooperation. The Navy stationed in China is determined to strive for its realization, and hopes that Chinese officials and people should also consistently implement the true meaning of this participation in the war. China and Japan should cooperate, jointly devote all their efforts, and complete the war. At the same time, Japanese residents in China should also adapt to this new situation, fully understand the Empire's measures, and sincerely strive to promote national policy.

### Konoe's Statement

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Former Prime Minister Prince Konoe gave a statement at his private residence in Ogikubo on the morning of the 10th regarding the National Government's participation in the war and Japan's return of concessions and abolition of extraterritoriality. The main points are as follows: There is no other way to complete the construction of China except to drive Britain and the United States out of East Asia and seek the victory of the Greater East Asia War. This is the natural outcome of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. Therefore, the National Government's participation in the war this time is nothing more than the realization of this doctrine. I have heard that some people within Chongqing are also deeply reflecting on the future of the entire East Asia situation after Japan's failure. Some people believe that China's position at this time is by no means favorable. In fact, apart from Chiang Kai-shek and the Song family, who are heavily intoxicated by the United States, the rest of the thoughtful people will gradually tend towards this intention. Moreover, some quite influential people in Chongqing are also quite indignant at the United States arbitrarily showing off its planes and weapons in Chinese territory. This is also a matter of course, because China's autonomy and independence can only be obtained in Dr. Sun's doctrine. This point should also be well known to the Chinese people. In short, China's participation in the war and the Empire's return of concessions and abolition of extraterritoriality, from China's perspective, is the development of Pan-Asianism, and from our country's perspective, it can be said to originate from the spirit of the declaration of war.

### Minister Kofu's Statement

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – Minister Kofu of the Japanese Embassy's Information Department recently issued a statement as follows: After the conclusion of this Sino-Japanese agreement, China has restored the sovereignty it lost before the Opium War and achieved complete independence. Any government in China in the past could not have achieved this, but now it has been achieved by the National Government. This is truly a landmark great contribution in Chinese history and a great success for the National Government. According to foreign dispatches, the National Government's declaration of war this time has given the United States and Britain a great shock. The United States and Britain are currently considering countermeasures. However, in my imagination, due to the establishment of this new Sino-Japanese agreement, the public concessions in Shanghai and Xiamen, and the Beijing legation area, which China has restored, Britain and the United States once declared that they would return them to Chongqing. Originally, Britain and the United States always carried out the so-called justice and humanity in the name of concessions and extraterritorial rights that did not harm themselves, and exaggerated their propaganda as their consistent deceptive means. In fact, the public concessions in Shanghai and Xiamen and the Beijing legation area are all under Japanese influence, so Britain and the United States do not feel any pain even if they declare that they will return them to Chongqing. They are entirely implementing their traditional policy of deceiving the Chinese people. This only deepens the Chinese people's contempt for Britain and the United States and reduces their confidence in relying on Chongqing.

### A Letter from Gandhi: The United States Cannot Shirk Responsibility for Britain's Actions in India (Relayed from Macau on January 6)

The monthly magazine "India Today," founded by the American India Alliance, recently revealed a letter from Gandhi to the United States, stating: Since the United States is an ally of Britain, it cannot shirk its responsibility for Britain's actions in India. If I did not recognize that Britain, as an allied nation, has the necessary courage to shoulder the responsibility of liberating India from its shackles, then I would demand that the United States come forward and ask Britain to withdraw its rule in India. If Britain can fulfill this highest act of justice, then Britain can eliminate all the causes of Indian dissatisfaction. I acknowledge that the value of this move is even greater than all the battleships and aircraft that the great resources of the United States can produce. Since the United States holds the same principles as Britain, the United States cannot shirk its responsibility for what British representatives do in India. Shouldn't we also demand unconditional recognition of Indian independence? Some say that today is not the time, but we deeply feel that today is the most appropriate time in terms of psychology. I hope that the United States understands that immediately recognizing India is the most important and greatest war measure.

### Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Are Extremely Inspired, Resolving to Cooperate in Liberating East Asia

Thailand

Bangkok, 10th (Central News Agency) – After the news of the National Government's announcement of cooperation with Japan to jointly fight against Britain and the United States spread, the 2.5 million overseas Chinese in Thailand were extremely inspired. Chen Shouming, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement expressing his determination to support the National Government's position, stating that after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the overseas Chinese deeply understood the significance of this operation. After reading the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, the common enemies of East Asia, we feel deeply grateful and deeply feel the importance of our responsibilities in the future. We vow to cooperate with all our strength under the leadership of the National Government to complete this East Asia liberation war.

Vietnam

Saigon, 10th (Central News Agency) – More than 300,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam were extremely excited after learning that the National Government had declared war against Britain and the United States. Each household hung the national flag. The local Chinese newspaper "New East Asia" also published the declaration of war. A general assembly of overseas Chinese was held in the afternoon in the city of Saigon, where the declaration of war was read and it was unanimously resolved to support the National Government and thoroughly defeat enemy countries such as Britain and the United States. A telegram was also sent to Chairman Wang to pay respects.

Malaysia

Johor Bahru, 10th (Central News Agency) – Lin Wenxi, president of the Malayan Peninsula Chinese Association, yesterday issued a statement on behalf of the 1.5 million overseas Chinese in Malaya on the matter of the motherland's participation in the war, stating that our country's declaration of war this time is a necessary measure. Under the leadership of the National Government and the protection of the Japanese army, we can clearly see the path we should take after the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States. Therefore, we deeply feel that the responsibility of being loyal to the motherland is extremely important. In the future, we should support the motherland in all aspects with financial, material, and human resources, cooperate in carrying out the war, and achieve the ultimate goal of revitalizing China and protecting East Asia.

Philippines

Manila, 10th (Central News Agency) – After the National Government resolutely declared war against Britain and the United States in the spirit of living and dying together with Japan, more than 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines firmly believe that the revitalization of China and the liberation of East Asia can be realized as a result. Wang Tianshen, director of the All-Philippines Chinese Association, told reporters yesterday that the National Government's move was what we had been hoping for. Japan is fighting for East Asia for East Asians, and the motherland is cooperating with all its strength in the spirit of living and dying together. The overseas Chinese in the Philippines are filled with excitement and vow to support the national policy of the motherland and contribute all their strength to this great war.

### Rumor That the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Will Again Go to Washington to Consult with the US President to Revise the North African War Plan

Bern, Switzerland, 9th (Havas) – According to news from London and Washington, people in Britain and the United States are expressing dissatisfaction with the North African war, which is becoming more and more blatant. A British semi-official source confirmed yesterday that Prime Minister Churchill will travel to the United States in the shortest possible time to discuss the current situation with President Roosevelt. Foreign Secretary Eden may accompany him at that time. Military figures in Britain believe that the war plans agreed upon by the British and American staff last year must be completely revised due to the failure of the North African war. Therefore, the nature of the upcoming Washington conference is very important. Moreover, the Soviet Union is now openly expressing dissatisfaction. The landing of the British and American allied forces in North Africa failed to force the German side to transfer a single soldier from the Eastern Front. Even the German air force was not transferred, which is completely contrary to what the Soviet Union expected. As for the North African war situation, what can be said is as follows: (1) The British and American authorities have no connection in politics, and lack cooperation in military affairs. (2) The military development is extremely slow. The British and American allied forces have landed in North Africa for two months, but their elite troops have not yet been transferred to the African front line, which is difficult to understand. Although London newspapers reveal the situation of American military equipment production, based on the situation of the war in Tunisia and the fact that the United States only has 100 aircraft there, it can be seen that the various claims of the United States have not been confirmed. (3) The Allied powers rely on French secessionists in politics, but there are differences of opinion within the faction, so their support for the Allied powers is of no practical benefit. (4) The US government supports the Giraud faction in North Africa, which only results in North Africa maintaining an "anti-democratic political system."

### US Admiral Stark Issues a Statement Saying That the War Will Be Difficult to End for the Time Being

Lisbon, 9th (Havas) – According to news from Washington, US European Fleet Commander Admiral Stark, after returning to Washington today, told the press, "The current European war is bound to be protracted. To say that it will end soon is either a deliberate lie or wishful thinking." The reason for his return home is not convenient to explain. The main task of the US European Fleet is to protect the safety of transportation between Britain and the United States.

### South African Colonel Reitz Goes to Britain to Take Office

Lisbon, 10th (Allied News Agency) – According to reports from London, Colonel Reitz of the South African Union government has arrived in London to take up the post of member of the South African Supreme Committee.

### Contradictions Between Chongqing and the US: Xiong Shihui Suffers Cold Shoulders, Lin Yutang Scoffs and Ridicules

(Domei News Agency, Lisbon, 1st) A dispatch from New York stated that Lin Yutang, a Chinese critic famous for his propaganda for Chongqing's war of attrition, issued a statement in New York on the 1st, expressing indignation at the United States' cold treatment of the delegation sent to the United States by the Jiang regime led by Xiong Shihui, which ultimately resulted in them returning home empty-handed. He criticized the cold attitude of the US government, as follows:

The US government's extremely cold treatment of the Chongqing military delegation led by Xiong Shihui has greatly affected the friendly feelings existing between the people of Chongqing and the US. My opinion is that the US government has been influenced by Britain and has changed its policy, and is now focusing its main force on defeating Germany. In East Asia, the state of the US military is only being used to restore the British Empire's colonies. I feel extremely regretful about Xiong Shihui's unavoidable return home, and I do not want to say it explicitly, so I would like to ask a question before the American people. If the leader of the anti-Axis countries does not now show any intention of jointly fighting Japan with Chongqing, then what value does Xiong Shihui have in staying in Washington? He is a person who is not accustomed to wasting time, and recently he has been forced to waste time, and as a result, he has been driven to irritability. In order to ask the American people to understand his mood, I think it is okay to set up the following metaphor. Suppose you visit a friend's house and are left in a corner of the guest room. Not to mention seven months, but only seven minutes, you seek to be looked after. Then, wouldn't you be afraid of being impolite and try to maintain a smile on your face? If you smile for seven minutes without being entertained, will you feel ridiculous and indignant? At that time, what will you do? I think you will politely bid farewell to the host and leave. After returning home, if you understand humor, you will definitely regard everything as ridiculous and laugh. Now, he who is about to leave the United States and return to Chongqing is in a similar situation. The US government must be satisfied with the friendly feelings existing between Chongqing and the US, and hope that they will continue indefinitely. The Chongqing side likes Americans without any special reason, but simply likes Americans for no reason. Therefore, if the friendly feelings are once destroyed, there will be nothing to connect Chongqing and the US. Xiong Shihui's visit to the US was not solely to obtain aid. Obtaining aid was only part of his mission. He was actually visiting the US to lend a helping hand to establishing a common front, but the US did not want his help, so his return to Chongqing was also unavoidable. When the anti-Axis countries complete their preparations for a common operation against Japan in the future, the US military commander can go to Chongqing and be commanded by Xiong Shihui. The American people should not forget this fact, that is, this military delegation to the US was carefully selected and appointed, and one of the best experts on Japanese military affairs was its leader. The American people must be asking whether Chongqing feels angry? However, what Chongqing feels is not anger. Xiong Shihui is a follower of Lao Tzu, so he is afraid that he will feel that it is useless to make the heads of the US military understand that Chongqing is also an ally of the US. Those who believe in Taoism have no way but to laugh at such foolishness.

### Indian Political Figures Pay Attention to the US Representative's Visit to India: Phillips Strives to Meet with Gandhi, But It Is Difficult to Have Any Concrete Results

Bangkok, 10th (Domei News Agency) – A dispatch from New Delhi states that Indian political figures are paying attention to whether President Roosevelt's representative, Phillips, will be able to meet with Gandhi after arriving in India. After arriving in India, Rowe claimed that he would meet with representatives of various Indian parties, which conflicted with London's previous claims that Phillips would not interfere in India's internal affairs. Many believe that even if Phillips can meet with Gandhi, it is difficult to have any concrete results, because Gandhi is the person who is most strongly opposed to US interference.

### 100,000 US Doctors Serve in the Military

Lisbon, 10th (Domei News Agency) – A dispatch from Washington states that the United States recently recruited 10,000 doctors into the ranks. In total, there are 100,000 US doctors currently serving in the military. It is said that the number of doctors serving the people in the United States in the future may be less than 80,000.

### Active Air Forces on Both Sides on the North African Front: British Troops Reinforce Libya from Egypt, Spatz Serves as Allied Air Force Commander

Bern, Switzerland, 9th (Havas) – According to news from both the British and American sides and the Axis countries, the war on the Tunisian front was not very active yesterday. Only encounter battles between scout troops on both sides occurred on land, but air force activity was as usual. On the Libyan front, the war was most intense in the southeast of Misrata. A large number of reinforcements from General Montgomery's troops have been transferred from Egypt. The British army dispatched troops all day, apparently attempting to probe the weaknesses of the Axis army's position.

Berlin, 10th (Domei News Agency) – According to news received last night, only air force activity occurred on the North African front. Eighteen British planes were shot down on the Libyan front. German and Italian aircraft scattered tank convoys and destroyed more than 150 vehicles. According to reconnaissance aircraft reports, the main force of the British army is concentrated south of the Axis army, where a fierce battle is about to take place.

Berlin, 10th (Havas) – According to an official announcement, Axis aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery shot down 23 Allied aircraft yesterday. On the 8th of this month, the German Air Force bombed the Allied airfield south of the Atlas Mountains, causing fuel injectors to catch fire and burn, and destroying two enemy aircraft on the ground. In this battle, two enemy twin-engine aircraft and one Spitfire fighter were also shot down in the air. In addition, it was learned that the German aircraft had bombed the port facilities of Bona last time, resulting in heavy material losses.

Lisbon, 10th (Allied News Agency) – Allied Commander General Eisenhower appointed Major General Spatz as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Air Force in North Africa on Saturday.

### Fierce Battles on the Southern Route of the Eastern Front: German Blitz Counterattack in the Central Route, Occupying 75 Strongholds

Headquarters of the German Head of State, 10th (Domei News Agency) – According to the war report of the German High Command today, fierce battles continued on the southern route of the Eastern Front yesterday. German troops once again repelled the Soviet offensive. In this battle, another Soviet brigade was repelled at a certain stronghold. Only positional warfare occurred near Leningrad. Twelve Soviet aircraft were shot down. In the central route, German infantry occupied 75 strongholds in a lightning offensive, destroying its defensive lines. After a fierce battle, the Soviet army lost 17 tanks on the shores of Lake Ilmen. On the Arctic Front, the German Air Force continued to destroy the railway to Murmansk. Soviet border, 9th (Havas) – There was no change on the Eastern Front yesterday. The war continued in the original areas, but the German army launched several fierce counterattacks in the central route, occupying several positions of the Red Army and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The Red Army's repeated counterattacks in the Velikiye Luki area were all repelled. From the Red Army's war report, it is no longer mentioned that the city of Velikiye Luki is only mentioned around the area, which can be seen. According to German military sources, all the tanks used by the Red Army for combat are manufactured in the country, proving that the scope of British military aid to the Soviet Union is extremely small. The quality of the Red Army's tanks seems to be inferior to last year.

### Supporting the Policy of Joining the War, Various Sectors Hold Mass Rallies, Vowing to Dedicate Manpower and Resources to the Nation, Hoping that all Merchants and Residents of the City Thoroughly Understand the Significance of Joining the War

After the National Government announced a formal declaration of war against Britain and the United States on the previous (9th) day, in cooperation with the friendly nation of Japan to complete the Great East Asia Liberation War, all sectors of the military, civilians, government officials, and merchants here were inspired and unanimously supported the decision. Various organizations and groups responded enthusiastically. In addition to producing and distributing various slogans and propaganda materials for widespread dissemination, the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office and the City Social Movement Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations held a "Shanghai All Sectors Rally in Support of the Government's Entry into the War" at the Daguangming Theater on Jing'an Temple Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. The various organizations and groups participating in the rally included the Municipal Government, the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, the City Social Movement Association, the City Party Headquarters, the City Chamber of Commerce, and representatives from the press, cultural circles, and agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors, totaling over 100,000 people. After formal greetings, Yuan Fudeng, nominated by the presidium of the rally, served as the chairman of the rally and announced the purpose of the meeting. Subsequently, heads of various agencies gave speeches, elucidating the significance of the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States. After speeches by Zhou Hualan from the cultural sector and Li Guohua, representative of the Anti-British and Anti-American Association, Chen Yaofu read out the Shanghai All Sectors Rally in Support of the Government's Entry into the War circular telegram. Xi Peiwen, Secretary-General of the Shanghai New People's Movement Promotion Association, led the crowd in shouting slogans, followed by the screening of a film on the Great East Asia War of Liberation, which continued until around 6:00 PM when the meeting adjourned.

Presidium: The presidium of the Shanghai All Sectors Rally in Support of the Government's Entry into the War included Yuan Fudeng, Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce; Mayor Chen (represented by Zhao Zunyu); Zhou Hualan from the cultural sector; Li Guohua, Chen Yaofu from the Anti-British and Anti-American Association; Feng Jie, Director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office; Xu Liquiu, President of the Zhonghua Daily; Xi Peiwen, Secretary-General of the New People's Movement Promotion Association; Zhang Kun from the film industry; Chen Binhe and Huang Tianshi from the press, and others.

Purpose of the Meeting: Chairman of the rally, Yuan Fudeng, first reported the purpose of the meeting. The rally stated: "Today's Shanghai All Sectors Rally in Support of the Government's Entry into the War is the most glorious day in our nation's history. For the past few centuries, China has suffered from the oppression and humiliation of Europeans and Americans, who have insulted China as a sleeping lion. However, even a sleeping lion has its majesty and will awaken. They further mocked China as the 'sick man of East Asia,' insulting our nation's decline and lack of revival. In the past, our people endured all kinds of suffering, and enlightened individuals successively strived for strength. However, the power of a few did not have the opportunity to be fully realized. Since the 'December 8th' outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the spirit of our Great East Asian nation has been fully demonstrated. Chairman Wang resolutely joined the war to show thorough cooperation with friendly nations. Today, all of you represent the citizens of the city, supporting the government's national policy. We hope that all sectors in Shanghai will henceforth invigorate their spirits and fully assist the government in joining the war. At the same time, all sectors must thoroughly understand the significance of joining the war. We must consider the future of the nation and the people, strengthen our resolve, and work diligently to fulfill our responsibilities and create the glorious history of our nation for the past five thousand years."

Speeches by Officials: Next, Mayor Chen, representing Secretary-General Zhao Zunyu, gave a speech, stating, "The National Government's entry into the war is based on the will of the Chinese people. For a hundred years, China has suffered from imperialist economic, military, and cultural aggression. Now, we have reached the ideal of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, and the entire nation will be liberated." Then, Director Feng of the Propaganda Department gave a speech, strongly advocating that China must join hands with Japan to complete the Great East Asia War, stating, "Yesterday, under the leadership of the supreme leader Chairman Wang, the National Government resolutely declared war against Britain and the United States. Everyone who has seen the full text of the agreement with Japan knows that this time, China, from a position of independence and for the sake of liberating the motherland, has risen up to declare war against Britain and the United States. All the so-called rumors of conscription are their last clumsy tricks to express their fear. We will never believe them. We unanimously support the government, complete the war, and strive for liberation."

Circular Telegram Supporting Entry into the War: The original text of the Shanghai All Sectors Rally in Support of the Government's Entry into the War circular telegram read: "To Chairman of the National Government, Presidents of Various Academies, Ministers, Chairmen of Various Committees, Chairmen of Provincial and Municipal Governments, All Domestic and Foreign Organizations, All Newspapers: Our compatriots have long suffered from the oppression of British and American aggressive forces. The Great East Asia War is sweeping away all enemies, providing a heaven-sent opportunity to liberate China and revive East Asia. Our supreme leader Chairman Wang inspires the masses and rises up to join the war. All those with blood and spirit are grateful and indignant, willing to dedicate manpower and resources to the nation to strive for final victory, restore our independence and freedom, and complete the Three People's Principles of the founding father. Today, at 3:00 PM, we convened a mass rally at the Daguangming Theater in Shanghai, and it was resolved to unanimously support the government, obey the leader, and vow to complete the war with a spirit of shared life and death. We hope that compatriots in the peace zones and in the areas coerced by the Chongqing Communists, as well as all ethnic groups in the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, will quickly catch up and provide support. The telegram is filled with extreme urgency. From the 100,000 participants of the Shanghai All Sectors Rally in Support of the Government's Entry into the War, respectfully, steam."

Various Groups Respond with Respectful Telegrams: Since the National Government announced the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, various groups have unanimously responded with respectful telegrams. Extracts are listed below: (1) To Chairman Wang of the National Government: Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have been on the verge of collapse, but they still have remnants and are trying to struggle. We should strive to eliminate them. Your Excellency, with the spirit of sharing weal and woe, and with no retreat, has resolved to declare war. Upon hearing the news, our associations wholeheartedly support it. We respectfully send this telegram, hoping for your consideration. Jointly from the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of Shanghai Special Municipality and the Citizens' Federation of the Second Special District, leading all district branches, respectfully, steam. (2) To Chairman of the National Government: The cooperative relationship between China and Japan has been further strengthened since your visit to Japan.

Upon hearing the news, our associations are extremely excited and wholeheartedly support it. Jointly from the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai International Settlement and the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession, respectfully, true.

### Soap Rationing: Retail Purchase Limited to One Bar

Wuzhou Gu Ben Soap Factory, China Soap Company, and China Chemical Industrial Society jointly announced the implementation of fixed prices for Gu Ben, Huang Xiangmao, Jian Dao, and other laundry soaps allocated to retailers, stating: "Our companies have been ordered to notify all retailers of allocated soaps that the retail price of these brands of soap must not exceed the following fixed prices: (1) Gu Ben soap, 80 military yen per bar; (2) Jian Dao soap, 77 military yen per bar; (3) Huang Xiangmao soap, 73 military yen per bar. Each person is limited to purchasing at most one bar of each of the above brands of soap (i.e., two cakes)."

### Approved by Military Allocation Authorities: Broad Beans Allocated to Various Industries, Registration to be Applied for Immediately

The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains Group Office of the Rice, Wheat, Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes Trade Association has received a large allocation of broad beans from the military allocation authorities, which has already arrived in Shanghai. From today, the allocation will be made to miscellaneous grains retailers, sauce gardens, distilleries, tofu shops, fried goods shops, tofu stall operators, and bean sprout producers. The fixed price of broad beans is 46.5 military yen per picul (equivalent to 100 market catties). A notice has been issued, instructing them to apply for registration at the office immediately for allocation.

### Another Cooking Oil Sale Within the Year: Soybeans and Sesame Seeds Shipped to Shanghai Have Been Allocated and Received

Since the category B oil shops in the two concessions started selling oil on the 7th, they unanimously announced that they had sold out by the afternoon of the 9th. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, there will be another cooking oil sale by the category A oil shops in the two concessions before the end of the lunar year, but the date has not yet been determined.

After the conclusion of the agreement on the exchange of goods between Shanghai and North China, the authorities decided to ship 8,333 tons of Manchurian soybeans and 6,666 tons of sesame seeds to Shanghai. Of these, 4,600 tons of soybeans and all of the sesame seeds have already been shipped and allocated.

Special Ration Oil Must Be Purchased from Designated Oil Shops: The Cooking Oil Trade Wholesale Office issues special allocations to civil servants, ranging from half a catty to one catty per person per month or period. However, each office issues special purchase certificates for this special allocation of oil, which must be used to purchase oil. As each pao is currently trying out the system of distributing oil by household, each retail oil shop has a fixed number of households that can purchase, with the quantity determined by their numbers. Therefore, it is inconvenient to sell the special allocation, which often leads to misunderstandings. The pao-chia authorities have now stipulated that each pao designate one oil shop exclusively for special allocations. Civil servants must purchase oil from the designated oil shop with their special allocation certificates, and other shops are absolutely forbidden to sell to them. According to senior officials of the pao-chia authorities in the two concessions, speaking to reporters from the Central News Agency, the pao-chia authorities are very willing to assist and cooperate with the authorities' plan to implement oil distribution by population, as it can indirectly help with household registration surveys.

### Shanghai Rural District Party Office Holds Party Affairs Meeting: The Central Government and Concurrent Director Chen Issue Telegrams of Instruction and Encouragement

The Shanghai Rural District Party Affairs Office of the Chinese Nationalist Party, in order to review the implementation of Party affairs work in the rural areas of the city, held a Party affairs meeting at its office in Zhoupu Town at 10:00 AM on the 10th, lasting for two days. A preparatory meeting was held in the afternoon. The Central Government and Chen, the concurrent director of the Shanghai branch of the Rural Affairs Commission, both sent telegrams with instructions, hoping for the completion of the rural affairs mission.

### City Chamber of Commerce Establishes an Office in Western Shanghai to Encourage Local Businesses to Join Trade Associations

The Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce, recognizing that the area of western Shanghai is vast and commercially prosperous, had a suggestion from a business committee member to establish a western Shanghai office to assist existing trade associations and encourage local businesses to join them to strengthen connections. The joint meeting of the directors and supervisors of the association decided to approve the establishment and appointed Zheng Jianbo as the preparatory officer for the western Shanghai office to actively begin preparations. It is reported that the office has been prepared and, in accordance with the organizational charter of the office, recommended Le Fenglin from local businessmen as deputy director, dividing the office into three sections: administration, finance, and investigation, each performing its duties. The position of director is being requested by the preparatory officer from the head office for immediate appointment, so that the office can be established and begin the investigation work within days.

### Yesterday Morning at 7:00 AM: Emergency Alert Drill

An air raid emergency alert was heard in the city at 7:00 AM yesterday (the 10th). Because it was at a time when residents were fast asleep, there was little movement. However, the security corps and the civil police corps, being on duty at their posts, were reported by the reporting team members in each pao, who rang bells and awoke residents by informing them of windows with light leaking out, and ordered them to extinguish the lights. The emergency alert was lifted at 8:00 AM. It was heard that the nature of the alert was a drill. Furthermore, it was reported that police stations of the city district and the two settlements all sent letters to the pao-chia districts under their jurisdiction, instructing the residents to turn off the electric lights or add curtains to the windows to absolutely prevent light from leaking out of the windows during the long-term exercises.

### Noodle and Bakery Industries Request Changes to the Exchange System

Since the announcement of the changes to the method of flour allocation to various noodle shops, the local noodle industry has appealed to the authorities for changes. The Bakery Trade Association has also dispatched representatives to submit a report to the Municipal Council, with the main points of the report being: (1) The flour and rice allocated to civilians are insufficient, which greatly affects the business. (2) These industries are all small businesses that purchase flour, produce, and sell immediately. If customers do not come to exchange, and the products are left unsold, the capital cannot be circulated. (3) The personnel in these industries are mostly illiterate, and it is difficult for them to understand the expiration dates on the flour certificates and where to collect them. Moreover, there are often unnecessary disputes with customers who do not understand the exchange rates. (4) If there is preparation for exchange of finished pastries, but no one exchanges, the products will mold, resulting in a gradual reduction of the flour stock and easy losses.

### Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association Sponsors a Japanese Painting and Sculpture Exhibition

The Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association, in order to integrate the art of the two countries, has scheduled a Japanese landscape and customs painting exhibition from January 25th to 31st at the painting hall on the fourth floor of the New World Department Store on Nanjing Road. A sculpture exhibition will also be held at the same time, hosted by the Chinese artist Zhang Yuanren. It is reported that exhibitions of these two types are rarely held in Shanghai.

### Cultural Association Held a Symposium Yesterday

The preparations for the establishment of the "Chinese Cultural Association," a nationwide cultural organization initiated and organized by many in the Shanghai cultural sector, have been extremely enthusiastic. Yesterday (the 10th) afternoon, a symposium for initiators was held on the ninth floor of the Jinmen Hotel, attended by dozens of people. The association has now received support from well-known cultural figures from Beijing, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other places. Mayor Chen is willing to do his best to assist, and Director Feng of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office also has high expectations. It is reported that the association will be formally established at the end of the month and is currently expanding its recruitment of members.

### French Consul-General Announces Praise for Pao-Chia Chinese Staff

French Consul-General Magre announced: The French Consul-General issued Consul-General Order No. 4 on January 6, 1943, to organize the Standing Committee of the Pao-Chia in the French Concession, and expressed his deep gratitude to the Provisional Preparatory Committee of the Pao-Chia for completing the work of weaving the Pao-Chia system. This is because the efforts of the committee members, especially the Chinese members, in organizing this good system, have led to honest cooperation between the residents and the authorities, resulting in very satisfactory results, such as household registration for food distribution and air defense facilities, which would be difficult to complete without the Pao-Chia, and various current difficulties would be difficult to improve. The organization of the Pao-Chia is particularly helpful to the work of the police department, as illegal elements cannot find a place to stay in the concession, and criminal acts have been almost completely eliminated. The French Consul-General hopes that the members of the Standing Committee of the Pao-Chia, as well as the members of the former Preparatory Committee of the Pao-Chia, will continue to work hard and cooperate closely, as in the past, in order to solve various problems that may arise in the future.

### China Education Construction Association Establishes a Western Shanghai Branch

The Shanghai Branch of the China Education Construction Association convened its inaugural meeting yesterday after preparations to establish a branch in the Western Shanghai district. The meeting adopted the branch charter and elected twenty-one directors and supervisors.

### Financial Leaders Discuss: Restriction of Deposit Withdrawals is Untrue. Shanghai Officials Telegraph the Capital to Inquire. Reply Telegram States the Rumor is False

Following the announcement of the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, rumors suddenly spread in the city that the government was restricting the withdrawal of deposits, causing unrest among the people. According to financial leaders in the city, in order to stabilize the financial market in view of the rumors of restricting deposit withdrawals, a telegram was sent to the Nanjing authorities to inquire about the matter. A reply telegram has been received stating that there is absolutely no such thing. It is hoped that the public will not lightly believe in or spread rumors and disturb themselves.

Macau Correspondence

### The Lin Shiliang and Others Embezzlement and Malfeasance Case (Continued)

The defendant Lin Shiliang was then brought in for questioning. Lin was wearing a dark blue woolen robe and silver-rimmed glasses. He looked disheveled, with his hair a mess. He was pale and walked into the courtroom with a slumped posture, after which the judge questioned him one by one. According to his account: Lin Shiliang, 37 years old, former director of the Transportation Department of the Central Trust Bureau. He said that he had only known Zhang Dewu for a few months in Yangon, and there was no discord between them. In January of this year, when Yangon was at its most critical, he knew that Zhang had a large number of goods that could not be shipped out and asked him to find a way. He then signed a contract with Zhang, which he later reported to Xu Xingchu and received a reply from him approving it. Although the Trust Bureau did not have regulations regarding this matter and whether it was beneficial or harmful to the Bureau, and because there was not enough time to ask for instructions, he proceeded without notifying the Kunming branch after obtaining Xu Xingchu's permission to handle it at his discretion. He was asked whether he had gone to the inspection station to negotiate and identify the goods after they were seized. Lin stated: Yes. He was also asked: Did you agree with Zhang Dewu in advance to supply the goods to various government agencies at a flat price? Lin replied: In Yangon, I had mentioned that the goods must be sold to various agencies at the original price after being transported inland. He was also asked about the contents of the contract and the owners of the 35 trucks. Lin stated: The contract stipulated that the 35 trucks were not within the scope of the contract, and it was stated that the goods were priced at 30 million yuan and transported to Kunming in the name of the Trust Bureau. All expenses and accidental losses along the way were to be borne by the Dacheng Company. After the goods arrived in Kunming, the Trust Bureau would purchase them all. If the Bureau did not want to accept them, it would still have to pay transportation commissions. Finally, he was asked why, if the value of the goods was only 30 million yuan, there was no great profit for the Trust Bureau. Lin replied: Because prices rose after January, the price could reach 40 million yuan, so I thought it would be beneficial to the Trust Bureau.

Finally, Xu Xingchu was summoned. He stated: 32 years old, currently serving as Secretary-Director of the Board of Directors of the Trust Bureau, and concurrently as Manager of the Bureau's Purchasing Department. He said that he had recently resigned from his concurrent post on September 18 due to internal organizational reasons. The Bureau's Purchasing Department is entrusted by relevant authorities to purchase materials, and the Trust Bureau has no right to buy or sell. As for whether a large amount of funds needs to be approved by the Board of Directors, it is a matter of procedure. The contract in this case was established and signed in Chongqing after the review of the relevant documents. The handling fees and reserve funds can be paid later. If there is no insurance policy, it must be submitted first. Regarding the seizure of the goods in Kunming, he only learned about it after the transportation procedures were completed, so the contract was signed on March 10. When asked about Lin's statement that he had obtained Xu's approval in advance, Xu said: I replied in my letter that I would handle it in principle at my discretion. The letter was issued on January 20. Because the letter was a private letter, it was not registered or filed. The official letter to the Central Bureau of Statistics on March 13 was signed by me. The ownership of the trucks was not clear at the time. As for Lin Shiliang's claim that I had instructed him to pay attention to a large number of national defense materials to supply to the Purchasing Department when he left for Yangon, it is true. The judge then announced the end of the trial and that the sentence would be pronounced according to law at a later date.

(Another report) It is reported that after the "Chief Military Law Supervisor" interrogated Lin Shiliang in the embezzlement and malfeasance case on the 17th, in addition to the defendant Lin Shiliang, who was returned to the prison of the department in accordance with the law, the defendant Xu Xingchu, who had previously been unable to leave his post as Secretary-Director of the "Board of Directors of the Trust Bureau," was approved by the authorities to be released on bail. After this interrogation, it was determined that he was suspected of being related to the case, and he was also detained on the spot by the department to await the verdict and legal action.

"According to the main criminal in this case, Lin Shiliang, has already been sentenced to death, and Xu Xingchu has been sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Detailed circumstances will be sent later." (Sent on December 10, 31st year).

### After Various Groups Register: Prices Will Be Carefully Adjusted. The Goods Control Office Will Exercise its Authority.

The Municipal Council authorities will regulate prices based on the various trade and manufacturing joint groups within the International Settlement, instructing them on various methods. Therefore, the registration of these groups is almost complete. Afterwards, the Municipal Council will order them to submit price lists, which the authorities will carefully deliberate and amend. It is reported that the Municipal Council will implement per capita distribution of various major foods to ensure fair distribution to consumers. The first step in its implementation is to implement per capita distribution of food and cooking oil, followed by extending it to major foods. Due to this relationship, the importance of expanding the organizational scope of the Municipal Council Goods Control Office is evident. At the same time, it is also known that preparations have been made to actually increase the effectiveness of the new organization.

### Tram Fares Will be Readjusted: Five-Cent Fractions Will Be Abolished, and Station Distances Will be Lengthened Appropriately

According to senior officials of the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company, the fare prices of the trams and trolleybuses on various routes in the settlements will be readjusted. This adjustment is different from previous price increases, and the decided methods are two: (1) Because the five-cent auxiliary coins are gradually becoming scarce on the market, and the fare prices often have five-cent fractions, refunds are inconvenient. The authorities will appropriately increase or decrease the fares by five cents, depending on the length of the journey, to make them whole numbers. (2) Station distances will be lengthened. In the past, fares were calculated based on station distances, and the station distances were often inconsistent, resulting in unreasonable fares. In the future, there will be a thorough adjustment. For example, the distance of the 17th trolleybus route from Sichuan Road Bridge to Jiangxi Road is one station. Now, it is decided to extend it to Nanjing Road as one station. Therefore, after the adjustment, the fares for some sections will be slightly increased, and the fares for some sections will be reduced. The fare price list for each route is being printed and will be implemented from the 20th of this month.

### Notices for Insurance Brokers to Obtain Licenses

Registration of insurance brokers and notaries began on the 5th of this month and has been enthusiastically and diligently carried out. Any insurance broker or notary applying for registration must possess the qualifications specified in Articles 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Insurance Broker and Notary Registration Rules, prepare all the necessary supporting documents and photos, pay the certificate fee of 500 yuan and stamp duty of 4 yuan, and submit them to the Bureau for onward transmission to the relevant ministry for approval and issuance of the certificate. It must have the signatures and seals of the directors of the Insurance Trade Association and the Broker Association to be valid. It is estimated that there are over a thousand insurance brokers and notaries in Shanghai. After registration, the illegal insurance abuses can be thoroughly eliminated.

### Increased Sales Volume of Sugar to be Implemented from Yesterday. January Allocation Amount Will be Issued in Advance to the Market

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has submitted a request to the authorities for an increased sugar allocation. The third phase of purchasing sugar with housing tax receipts has been implemented from yesterday. Each housing tax receipt can purchase 50 yuan of sugar. However, for the autumn housing tax receipts in the International Settlement, the September and October receipts in the French Concession, and those without housing tax receipts in southwestern Shanghai and Zhabei, each household registration certificate can be used to purchase 5 yuan of sugar. Those who purchase sugar with housing tax receipts must bring their own citizen's card with the same address to be allowed to purchase, in order to prevent abuses, and it must be distributed equally according to the number of households. Those who violate this rule will be allowed to report and be held accountable. The allocation amount for January has been approved and the allocation procedures are being rushed. The allocation date for category A retailers will be advanced. On the 15th, a notice will be issued to all retailers, limiting the time to pay the sugar fees and receive the sugar certificates to pick up the goods from the designated sugar warehouses for sale to the market. The application registration date for sugar needed by category B users in various industries is approved until the day of the deadline. Once the review is completed, a special allocation will be made. However, applications submitted after the deadline will not be accepted.

### Two Charitable Organizations Co-operate to Run a Winter Relief Programme in Western Shanghai and Build a Shelter in Jinha Lane

The West Shanghai Zhu Shi Relief Association, which was founded by Zhang Deqin and others, has been actively appealing to provide relief for the poor in Western Shanghai for nearly two months. The association has built a shelter in Jinjia Lane to accommodate the poor people sleeping on the streets, and so far it has reached more than 400 people. The World Red Swastika Society requested the association to cooperate with them on the congee distribution, and to proceed together in order to achieve great efficiency. The association has agreed to cooperate, and the two sides have held several meetings to discuss the implementation policy, and consider the results to be satisfactory. As for the site of the congee distribution center, Jinjia Lane was previously crowded with poor people, and has recently suffered a fire, so the emotions are extremely miserable. It has been decided to set up the center there. It is reported that application forms will be distributed within days to receive the congee distribution tickets.

### The China Central Tobacco Rationing Association: Allocation Methods Undecided

Yesterday, we received a letter from the China Central Tobacco Rationing Association stating that the previous report regarding the China Central Cigarette Rationing Association, specifically concerning the determination of methods for dispatching personnel, established qualifications for related businesses, registration restrictions, and the need to pay guarantee deposits, as well as the allocation of goods to other locations being handled by the Jiuda Company, is incorrect. The association clarifies that it is still in the preparatory stage, and the regulations for local related businesses are currently under discussion. As for other locations, apart from the stipulation in the articles of association to establish branches in important locations, no specific plans have been made yet. This letter serves to clarify the situation and prevent misinformation.

### The Economic Foundation and Resource Development of Greater East Asia —Translated from "Economist," December 1942—

Basic Principles of Development

In the materials mobilization plan for the year 1942 (Showa 17, corresponding to the 31st year of the Republic of China—Translator), it is stated that a portion of essential materials is expected to be sourced from and secured in occupied territories in the South. There are reports that the supply and demand of kerosene is planned to be met by acquiring it from the Southern occupied areas, and special consideration and planning are underway. Additionally, the 1942 plan for the Second Productivity Expansion Plan includes the provision that adjustments may be made to the established production expansion plan in response to the supply and demand of materials and the acquisition of resources from the South. Therefore, it is evident that Southern resources will play a significant role in securing future productivity.

However, the development of Southern resources, particularly the utilization of essential materials, is subject to limitations related to shipping. Thus, the contribution of Southern resources to Japan's productivity is restricted. And, specifically regarding vital national defense resources, the resources already developed in the Southern regions, including those within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, are not as abundant as commonly believed.

Nevertheless, the importance of Southern resources to Japan is undeniable. As exploration progresses, the discovery of previously unknown minerals and the confirmation of larger deposits will gradually become a reality.

Regarding the development of the South, Prime Minister Tojo announced four principles in the plenary session of the House of Representatives on January 23 of this year as permanent policies for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The following six points, clarified by Director-General Suzuki of the Planning Board, provided a concrete explanation:

(1) Among Southern resources, some require urgent development, while others can be developed later. The order of development should be determined according to the urgency of the resource's need and the condition of transportation, as the war situation progresses. The draft guidelines, considering these factors, will be decided centrally.

(2) For resources deemed necessary for urgent development, such as kerosene, minerals, and agricultural and forestry products, the development should avoid the form of consolidated companies or joint ventures. Instead, those with experience and ability should be given the opportunity to fully demonstrate their enthusiasm and creativity, ensuring efficient production. Therefore, Japanese enterprises that have been diligently operating in the region for many years, or even non-Japanese enterprises that have shown sincerity in cooperating with Japan, should be utilized.

(3) Regarding currency, military scrip denominated in local currency will be used temporarily, circulating at the same value as the local currency. As the situation allows, the functions of the local currency and military scrip will be gradually adjusted and unified.

(4) The temporary transfer of funds to and from the local area, and the funds required for resource development, will be facilitated smoothly by the Southern Development Bank in the local area.

(5) All transactions with the local area, whether import or export, will be conducted by the government. The procurement and distribution will, of course, utilize existing Japanese merchants, as well as organizations and credit of locals and overseas Chinese who cooperate with Japan.

(6) With regard to enemy countries, every effort should be made to implement policies to acquire and supply local specialty resources produced in the Southern regions, such as rubber, tin, and Manila hemp.

The ongoing development of the South, based on the aforementioned fundamental principles, is indicated in the "Basic Policies for Mining, Forestry, and Electricity Construction" by the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council: "The South is currently focusing on promoting the mining and kerosene industries. At the same time, industries for processing various special products are also being promoted. Furthermore, with the gradual development of hydroelectric power generation, the expansion of the aluminum industry is planned. Light industries, in addition to consolidating existing ones, will be developed sequentially according to the available resources."

The following provides a separate description of the main development projects.

Vast Power Generation Plan

The Dutch government began constructing a large power generation plan a year ago, utilizing the flow of the Asahan River, which runs through central Sumatra, flowing out of Lake Toba in the Bukit Barisan mountain range. Due to the current war, the project has been halted, and the local army maintains the construction site. Upon completion, the project is expected to supply 00 kilowatts of power. This large-scale power plant design will provide significant inspiration for Japanese electrical development in Sumatra and Malaya in the future. Therefore, it is receiving considerable attention. According to the survey results of Mr. Masunaga, a former advisor to the Malayan Military Administration:

"The location of the power plant is 16 kilometers from the source of the Asahan River, which drains water from Lake Toba into the Strait of Malacca. The Wilhelmina I power plant is built there. A few kilometers away is the planned site of the First Power Plant. Because the water flows rapidly from Toba-Balan, a mountain peak 900 meters high, the hydropower potential is extremely rich. The head of the First Power Plant is 000 meters, and the head of the Second Power Plant is 000 meters. The Pilieton Company, which undertook the project, began construction three years ago with the support of the Dutch government. The First Power Plant, part of the first phase, has already installed 00000 kilowatt generators (including 0 spare kilowatts), and the dam and other projects have progressed to an average of 20%. The Second Power Plant is only in the planning stage and has not yet started construction. It is said that the equipment was ordered from the United States, America, and Switzerland shortly before the war.

If the project proceeds urgently, it is expected to be completed within a year. However, the Dutch side seems to plan to build an alumina factory 60 kilometers downstream from the first power plant in order to implement large-scale alumina production. The site still retains the factory foundations and construction site. The mechanical equipment of the power plant has been destroyed by the enemy, and the construction equipment is being transported by mountain residents. However, the basic engineering remains in its original condition. If the Dutch authorities initially planned to complete the project, 00 kilowatt electricity could be obtained. Because the electricity of ○○ million kilowatts, even the largest power plant in Japan, has only a power of about ○○ kilowatts or less, its richness is truly surprising. Moreover, the water volume is abundant and the terrain is extremely favorable, so it can supply inexpensive electricity. According to my estimate, the electricity cost per kilowatt hour is only about 2.5 sen, while in mainland Japan, the electricity cost per kilowatt hour is generally 1.5 sen. Therefore, its cost is incomparably low."

Regarding the Sumatra power source development, Nippon Nitrogen Fertilizer Co. has obtained the understanding of the Sumatra military government in order to realize the development plan. Prior to that, it has begun investigating land conditions, and it is said that the survey has been completed. Recently, it will be actively started. It is also said that Nippon Electric will supply 00 million kilowatts. (Translator's note)

Mining Policy

Previously, the East Indian government, with the aim of supplying fuel for trains, mined a good vein near Kin, but it was only a small-scale test mining. The extracted coal was transported by a temporary light railway built from Kin to Arashum, and then transported by the official South Sumatra Railway to the port, where it was transshipped to ships. The maximum daily output is about 00 tons. Now that the power generation capacity has been increased to four times, the planned output of ○○ tons this year will of course be guaranteed. From the next year onwards, it is certain that the production volume will be higher than the annual output before the war.

The Bara Alam coal mine, which has been developed by the Malayan Coal Mine Company operated by Englishman Ral since 1925, has already produced about 10 million tons. It is said that there are still 100 million tons of reserves. Earlier, in 1923, early Japanese pioneers gathered funds from local Japanese to try to develop the mine with Japanese capital and Japanese miners. However, due to various reasons, the project failed. This is the history of Japanese people managing the mine for many years.

In Vietnam, the Banh and Na Na mines, which were previously closed by the Vietnamese government, are now being developed by a Japanese-French joint venture. The Tu Yiban mining area is also being operated by a Japanese-French joint venture, and the Luo De Qin mining area is also under development.

Regarding petroleum, as explained by Minister of Commerce and Industry Kishi in the Diet, the policy is to rapidly and extensively promote the development of oilfields obtained in the Southern regions. In particular, the restoration of the Balikpapan oil refinery in Borneo and the Sanga-Sanga oil field deserves attention. Before the war, Balikpapan had a population of 99,000, possessed the Samboja and Sanga-Sanga oil fields, and had an oil refinery of the Batavia Petroleum Company. The plant's annual production was 0000 tons, boasting the highest output in the Dutch East Indies, with a capital of 100 million guilders. Since the Japanese army occupied this place on January 24 of this year, the Japanese authorities have been working hard to restore the oil field and the oil refinery.

The Future of Rubber Resources

Currently, all rubber development and management in Malaya and Sumatra is entrusted to the Shonan Rubber Association. The Shonan Rubber Association is formed by approximately 0000 rubber operators. The companies joining the association include 0 production companies and 0 sales companies, totaling 00 companies. Almost all Japanese trading companies dealing with rubber in the southern region before the war are included.

In the past, rubber has been considered a representative of surplus production. However, the current Malayan military administration does not consider overproduction a problem. Therefore, they have not considered how to adjust production. Instead, they believe that resource development should not only focus on the phenomena of two or three years ago. Therefore, if Malaya and Sumatra produced 1 million tons of rubber before the war, the policy is to aim for the certain production of more than this amount after the war.

Current Status of Fiber Resources

Among fiber resources, the most important is cotton. Japanese cotton farmers had already entered the Philippines for cotton cultivation.

Currently, there are eight cotton growing areas in the Philippines: the first area, Cabite Province, a part of Batangas Province, with an area of 1.500; the second area, Laguna Province, a part of Batangas Province, a part of Mindanao Island, with an area of 1.500; the third area, Banbangge Province, a part of Ba An Province, with an area of 1.500; the fourth area, La Union Province, Tel Lake Province, Ban Jia Xi Nan Province, with an area of 1.500; the fifth area, Western Negros Province, Mana Bulaba Ge Gelo Province, with an area of 1.500; the sixth area, Western Negros Province, Victoria Dali Yi area, Mindanao Island, with an area of 1.500; the seventh area, Western Negros Province, La Carlo Trott area, with an area of 1.500; the eighth area, Western Negros Province, Binalbacan area, with an area of 1.500. (Unit: Machibu - Translator's note. One Machibu is approximately equal to 99.12 ares.)

It is planned to produce 5 million dan of cotton annually in five years.

In Myanmar, the military administration has also designated 0 companies as agencies for cotton cultivation and procurement in Myanmar, and established a five-year plan for increasing cotton production.

In addition, the Philippine Military Administration has also announced a five-year plan for increasing ramie and jute production.

Ramie is cultivated in Mindanao Island with 2,000 Machibu. From 1942 (Showa 17, corresponding to the 31st year of the Republic of China), it is planned to increase it by 500 Machibu in the first year, totaling 2,500 Machibu, to achieve a harvest of 960,000 catties. In subsequent years, through the use of idle land, the conversion of Manila hemp cultivation area, forest and other reclamation, it is planned to expand by 3,000 Machibu in the second year, 4,000 Machibu in the third year, and 5,000 Machibu in the fourth year. By the fifth year, a total of 15,000 Machibu or more of ramie cultivation area will be completed, aiming to achieve a harvest of 4 million Japanese catties (approximately 2.4 million kilograms).

Secondly, jute has never been cultivated in the Philippines. Now it is considered that the land conditions there are suitable, so cultivation has been started in Davao Province and Agusan Province in Mindanao Island. In the first year (1942), a small-scale trial planting of a total of 20 Machibu will be carried out. Therefore, it is currently engaged in the selection and transplantation of suitable seeds. It is planned to expand by 100 Machibu in the second year, 1,000 Machibu in the third year, and 2,000 Machibu in the fourth year. By the fifth year, a total of 4,000 Machibu of jute cultivation area will be completed. It is expected that there will be a harvest of 6,000 catties per Machibu each year.

Regarding the guiding and controlling agencies for hemp such as Manila hemp, ramie, and jute, the Philippine Hemp Cultivation Association has recently been established under the Military Administration Department.

Jute has also been cultivated in Vietnam. Jute is being cultivated as a specialty in the Red River Basin, Tonkin Plains, especially in the suburbs of Hanoi in northern Vietnam. Hanoi suburbs are suitable for cultivating jute, and experts have proved it.

The Vietnamese authorities had long banned the export of jute and encouraged cultivation. In 1940, the original area of 464 hectares was expanded, 900 hectares in 1941, and a cultivation plan of 1,800 hectares, twice the previous year, was established this year. Moreover, it was decided to import excellent seeds from Taiwan and hire instructors to engage in large-scale planting.

The Departure of Sugar Industry Management

Regarding sugar, sugarcane cultivation in the Philippines has been converted to cotton cultivation. Regarding the local sugar industry, as a result of discussions between the local authorities and the Japanese government, on August 1 of last year, six companies were officially designated as the responsible operators for the Javanese sugar industry.

More than 80 sugar factories and sugar industry areas in Java, which previously belonged to the British system, will be re-determined by the local authorities on how to allocate responsibilities. In addition, the administrative and sugar industry conditions in the Philippines are different from those in Java, so plans are being made to proceed in individual ways.

In Myanmar, the military administration has designated ○○ and entrusted it to manage the Jaya Waki factories in the Tone Gun and Yamechin areas.

Development Arrangement of the Oil and Fat Industry

Finally, regarding the oil and fat industry, the handling of southern coconut oil and even dried coconut kernels is considered to be less preferable than importing the surplus materials and processing them in mainland Japan according to the current situation of the oil and fat industry in mainland Japan. However, due to shipping constraints, it is not possible to import a large amount of coconut oil for processing. Also, there are several American and British enemy-owned oil and fat factories in the local area. Managing and operating these factories to achieve self-sufficiency in oil and fat products is essential. Therefore, a company has been designated to be responsible for operating these enemy-owned factories.

The above is a general description of the development situation of major resources in the South. If this development proceeds step by step, a rapid advance in the Japanese economy can be expected. At that time, the Japanese economy must have completed a landmark transformation.

However, considering only the mineral resources that are already being developed, even in the entire Greater East Asia Sphere, they are not as rich and vast as commonly thought. This is especially true for the national defense resources that Japan currently needs most.

The country must never be arrogant in victory and relax its spirit," these are the words of Prime Minister Tojo and government officials, which must be carefully considered. (Translator's note)

### Records of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference (10) Translated from the bi-monthly "Domei" in late November 1942

Summary of Speeches by Each Headquarters Chief

Leng Jiaji—Acting Chief of North China Headquarters

On what economic foundation should the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere be based? First, in view of the historical transformation of the solution of the world economy and the division of connected economies, Greater East Asia should become a self-sufficient economic sphere; second, a highly national defense economic sphere centered on Japan, or rather with Japan as its leader; third, an economic sphere based on the principles of liberalism and capitalism, and a total integrative planned economy. The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must be these three types of economic sphere. However, in order to establish the East Asian broad-area economic sphere and its self-sufficiency, each country must first establish its own national land plan. These national land plans of various countries are not separate plans that are irrelevant to each other, but rather integrated national land plans that are tailored to the specificities of each nation and country. In the eyes of the average person, my North China is only considered to have some value in primary industries and miscellaneous light industries. At present, we must break out of such a narrow perspective and try to redefine the industrial fields. Furthermore, regarding the resource issue of North China as a supply base, it is necessary to re-examine the industrial regulations of exporting only iron, bauxite, salt and other resources to Japan and Manchuria. In the future, we hope to utilize these underground resources and comprehensively plan the decentralized deployment of heavy industry and chemical industry to North China.

Munakata Hisataka—Chief of Mengjiang Headquarters

Under the ideals of the rise of the East Asian nations and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the people of Mengjiang are currently suffering in any way, but are very happy to cooperate with Japan to advance in order to realize this great ideal. In July of this year, in addition to implementing a low-price policy, Mengjiang also officially set commodity prices. Through the Mengjiang Kinrin Association, the donation campaign for copper was also held, and in February and March, the people's donations were very enthusiastic. In the spring of this year, the Agricultural and Commercial Association launched a savings campaign, which reached a huge number of more than 7 million yuan in less than a month. The Mengjiang economy has close relations with Japan, North China, Manchuria, Korea, etc. If these relations become more profound in the future, Mengjiang's production will surely continue to expand. Whether it is coal or other mineral resources, it should not only be provided to Mengjiang itself, but also to the entire Greater East Asia economy, which is considered to be an expanded production.

However, there are two dangers that weaken and isolate the Mengjiang economy: one is the obstruction of the inflow of materials from other regions, and the other is excessive exchange rate restrictions. We hope to understand these and help Mengjiang stabilize its exchange rate, increase production, and stabilize people's livelihoods.

Chen Shao-i—Chief of Central China Headquarters

The new economic path of Greater East Asia is to make the exchange of materials between regions smooth and unhindered, so that the inner circle can become self-sufficient. Now, because transportation is very scarce, ships must be given priority for military needs, and the general public must think of building sailing ships to replace them. We can form a team of fifty ships, with surveillance and escort ships set up next to the fleet, and the mother ship can be equipped with wireless telegraphs and weapons. In this way, the enemy will have no way to take advantage of the gap. I think that the widespread construction of these sailing ships is a wonderful way to remedy the stagnation of transportation. If this matter can be actively promoted, it will definitely be of great benefit to the exchange of materials in Greater East Asia.

Closing of the Roundtable Conference

The afternoon session of the third day of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference was held from 1:50 p.m. After unanimously passing the following statement, Chairman Ogura delivered a closing speech, and then the official announcement was adjourned. The three-day conference ended here.

Passed Statement

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War a year ago, thanks to the brave battles of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy, the tyrannical American and British forces that had long been conspiring to invade and exploit East Asia have been thoroughly eliminated. Today, the foundation for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been established and consolidated. However, the United States and Britain still rely on their strong productivity and repeatedly attempt their futile counterattacks. Therefore, in order to uphold the Greater East Asia War and establish the great cause of constructing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, we must integrate the Greater East Asia economy into one, highly leverage the comprehensive economic strength of Greater East Asia, and make further efforts to enhance wartime productivity. All of this is the inescapable responsibility of us, the economic people of Greater East Asia. The East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference, which is composed of economic people from various regions of Greater East Asia as members and aims to promote the construction of the Greater East Asia economy, has now opened its fourth conference. On the one hand, it explains the fundamental ideals of the construction of the Greater East Asia economy to the economic people of East Asia. At the same time, it analyzes in detail the situation of the Greater East Asia War and the situation in the world. Under these studies and analyses, it has made sincere and constructive discussions on the progress and operation of the economy of each region in Greater East Asia.

### Tung Wah Wins Right to History Cup Final

In another scene of the History Tok Cup football semi-final this year, Tung Wah faced the Jewish Association at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon at 3:30. Because the previous day's United Friends team was miserably eliminated, everyone's hopes were pinned on Tung Wah. No fewer than 5,000 people watched from the stands. Yesterday, Tung Wah's old partner Wu Binghao returned to Shanghai due to some matter. The team's morale was greatly boosted by the addition of this student soldier, who was very important to the team. Wen Kui's condition has improved day by day, and his passing is easy and beautiful, already looking like his old self. Ah Dai and You Liang maintained their normal state, and were even more active when the game was tough. The center-back line seemed to be dominated by Long Hai alone, and neither Fan Xiao, who usually suffered, nor Ding Boji dared to enter. Zhao Peng's merits and demerits offset each other, while Xi Sheng ran and kicked wildly. The defenders Li Ning and You Ren coordinated extremely well and were impeccable. Li's feet were sharp and crisp, restoring his former prowess. Bang Lun was stable and healthy, which was visible. Therefore, except for Xi Sheng, who was relatively weak, the ten generals all performed excellently. It is appropriate for the Jewish athletes to be defeated by the wind. The whole army was wiped out by one) to three. With this mighty army, it is not difficult to make St. Francis let us hold the cup. Less than five minutes after the start of the game, Ah Dai recorded the first goal. At the end of the first half, Tung Wah took the lead with one to zero. When the battle started again, Tung Wah's arrogance rose and controlled the overall situation. Kuntian shot through the net, clear and beautiful. Three minutes later, Xi Sheng lost the ball in the front. You Liang grabbed it and passed it to Ah Dai. Dai swept and scored. As a result, Tung Wah defeated the Jewish Association by three to zero, and will compete with St. Francis for the championship.

### Advice to Citizens to Economize Consumption

— Sheng Yudu

Limit to Needs, Vigorously Avoid Hoarding

Furthermore, speaking of the current situation in Shanghai, it is very clear that the supply and demand of various materials are unbalanced. This is inherently a possible phenomenon during extraordinary times, a natural trend. However, in Shanghai, in addition to natural trends, various artificial factors have accelerated the divergence between supply and demand and deepened the imbalance. For example, concerning food, the supply routes are inherently not smooth, and the supply is limited. However, the general public easily believes rumors and fails to deeply understand the maximum efforts made by the authorities regarding food. Instead, they often complain about heaven and blame others. Usually, in addition to purchasing daily necessities, they also try their best to hoard. This further raises the current needs infinitely, exacerbating the imbalance in supply. As a result, ordinary people suffer, and society is uneasy. Where do we even begin to address this?

Currently, to alleviate the imbalance in supply, we can only passively and relatively reduce demand. On the one hand, we must quickly abandon the overly sensitive and selfish hoarding behavior to avoid many unnecessary争奪; on the other hand, we must gradually reduce our standard of living and try our best to use substitutes. For example, using coarse grains, corn, or wheat flour to replace part of the rice indirectly increases the supply. Furthermore, regarding rice, it is normal to prepare a little for emergencies, but we must not compete to hoard large quantities, as the result will harm others and not benefit ourselves. In addition, utilizing gardens and open spaces to plant coarse grains can also increase production.

The Unemployed Should Voluntarily Evacuate

Moreover, Shanghai has such a large population. Except for those with necessary job-related reasons, many residents do not need to reside in Shanghai. Then, why not voluntarily evacuate to the countryside or their hometowns? On the one hand, it can reduce the burden of private life; on the other hand, it can also reduce the burden on the entire Shanghai society. Therefore, evacuating the population is also an effective measure to help solve the imbalance in the supply of materials in Shanghai. However, this matter requires the awareness and assistance of the people themselves to achieve practical results. Shanghai is a city with huge consumption. The external supply is so unreliable and difficult to obtain that it will inevitably increase. Even if the war ends, it will not be possible to balance the supply of materials immediately. Therefore, living in a drunken stupor and hoping for extravagance is asking for trouble. Only enduring hardship and reducing consumption is the proper way to cope with the current difficulties.

### Starting from the Shareholders' Meeting

— Rong Guan

A friend of mine, because his income couldn't meet his expenses, sought ways to increase his income. He listened to the advice of a colleague and bought several thousand yuan worth of stocks with all his savings.

Less than a month later, a certain company called a shareholders' meeting. My friend had never been a shareholder in his life, so he was naturally excited to attend.

The shareholders' meeting was held at 2 PM and ended at 4 PM.

That night, my friend came to see me and kept shouting, "Bad luck! Bad luck! I was a guest for two hours."

"A shareholders' meeting is when shareholders show off, how can you say you were a guest?"

"You're making fun of an old friend! If you had gone, you would definitely shout 'bad luck' too!"

"I formally apologize to you, please tell me about the meeting."

"The election of the chairman was pre-arranged, so let's not talk about that. All the proposals were also pre-arranged; and the discussion, approval, opposition, and voting were all like a performance, all rehearsed. Although there were two or three hundred shareholders present, there were less than ten speakers. Their one-liner routines were unbearable. Finally, I couldn't help but stand up and ask the company to announce its recent business policies. Before I finished speaking, those guys who monopolized the meeting unanimously blocked me. I stood up again to clarify; the chairman interrupted me, saying it was late. Then they served some snacks and adjourned the meeting."

"That's outrageous!" I comforted my old friend.

"At the time, the shareholders sitting next to me said: This meeting was run by a few large shareholders; they really don't care about the opinions of one or two small shareholders!"

"That's right, Lao Li! A small shareholder's speech is originally ineffective. Even if your proposal is luckily passed, if it is unfavorable to the large shareholders, the vote will inevitably fail." "That's right, they have more votes and we small shareholders don't know each other, there is no contact, we stare with our eyes watching them manipulate, monopolize, do anything!"

Lao Li, don't be angry anymore! Isn't the parliamentary meeting in the ostensibly democratic politics of England and America similar to the shareholders' meeting? In the parliaments of England and America, isn't the opportunity to speak monopolized by a few representatives of large capitalists? If you don't know your place and insist on speaking, the speaker will turn a deaf ear and not answer! Today you spoke at the shareholders' meeting, and the chairman flattered you a few words, that's considered a great honor!"

"Alas! Hypocritical democratic politics!" My friend and I sighed the same way.

### The Tibetan-Indian Border (Part 1)

— Jiayuan

Transmitted from Macau on January 5th

Although not a shortcut from India to Tibet, it is more convenient than taking the route through Xikang via Lhasa. After I came to India, I prepared to enter Tibet from India. However, entering Tibet from India is not as simple as imagined. Many friends advised me to give up this idea and told me about the difficulties along the way and the difficulty of passing through customs. However, these could not shake my determination to go to Tibet. Before leaving, I visited Tan Yunshan, who had been to Tibet. According to him, the situation when he entered Tibet was the same as what I am preparing for now. Not only did he have to disguise himself as a Tibetan, but he couldn't even say a word, otherwise he would be recognized. I will record my impressions of this trip as follows:

A Night in Northern India

The train from Calcutta to Kalimpong is a mainline heading due north. There is only one direct train every night, and it is crowded with passengers. It happened to be the British army's holiday, and they were traveling to Darjeeling in groups, completely filling all the carriages. According to the usual practice of Indian railways, as long as you give the stationmaster a small tip, you can find a comfortable berth. However, even if you give the stationmaster money at this time, there is still no way. Fortunately, I met a local friend who was going to Darjeeling, who allowed me to sit on his berth. Not long after settling down, I encountered a household registration police inspection. According to Indian household registration regulations, anyone leaving their place of residence should register with the police station. In order to reduce trouble, I did not report it. I had to say that I was going to Kalimpong for sightseeing. He saw that my registration form said I was a war correspondent, so he didn't make things difficult.

The train departed at 8:30. There were five berths in our carriage, but now there were seven passengers: two British airmen, two Chinese merchants, and Mr. Cheng, who had been in Tibet for a long time, plus the reporter, making four Chinese people. Everyone met in a foreign land and were very friendly. Because Mr. Cheng was familiar with the situation in Tibet, everyone asked him for advice, especially the two Shanghai merchants, whose purpose was to transport goods from Tibet to the mainland. This plan is practically impossible. That night, the moon was as round as a mirror, and moonlight shone in through the train window. Looking out the window, the scenery of India was as clear as day.

Impressions of Siliguri

The next morning at 7 AM, the train entered Siliguri Station. This place is close to the Himalayas. The train from Calcutta is already at its terminal. From here, there are two small railway branch lines, one heading north to Kalimpong, and one west to Darjeeling. However, the branch line to Kalimpong cannot go directly, it only runs halfway, to Kiligula. After getting off the military, the reporter and Mr. Cheng hired a car directly to Kalimpong. The 30-mile journey usually costs 10 or 20 rupees, but now it has increased to 35 rupees.

At about 8 AM, we set off from Siliguri and gradually entered the mountain road after about three miles. The higher we went, the more similar the road was to the ups and downs of the Yunnan-Burma Highway. There was a small train track on the side of the road that wound upwards. The forests were dense, and the scenery was excellent. Every few miles, there was a small village. Continuing forward, there were also iron cable bridges like those on the Yunnan-Burma Road, but they were too narrow for heavy trucks to pass through. At Kiligula, I saw people who looked very much like our Chinese people, gathered on the road, repairing the road surface. Half of them were women, carrying heavy loads of soil like men.

Going north and south, the mountains became higher and higher. The car drove on the asphalt road, winding straight up, before entering a flat valley and descending the mountain. We passed a newly built cement bridge. Here, there was a highway going east that had recently been completed, reaching Assam directly. This road has military value.

The car climbed up the mountain. Halfway up the mountain, there was an overhead iron cable used to transport goods to the top of Kalimpong Mountain. Generators were placed on the top and bottom of the mountain to drive the iron cable. The goods were then lifted to the mountain on iron plates on the iron cable, which was extremely convenient. Along the way up, there were height markers. When we reached 3,500 meters, buildings stood tall and houses were densely packed. This is Kalimpong, the main road to Tibet.

Merchants on the Tibetan-Indian Border

When the car arrived at the market entrance, I said goodbye to Mr. Cheng, promising to meet again. The reporter continued to drive straight up through the city's main street. After traveling two miles and reaching an altitude of 4,000 feet, I arrived at the Kalimpong office of the India Daily. This place is located on the road to Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim. High mountains surround it, and newly built residences are visible everywhere. After getting out of the car, I accompanied Li Yiwo, the manager of the newspaper, to visit Ma Jia Kui, who manages the western trade. Ma's residence is also near the main road, and the building is very large. Because it is built on the mountain, it has five floors in total. The interior layout is Shanghai style, mostly consisting of collapsed mats. There are also many Tibetans coming and going, wearing long-筒乌靴, wearing robes, keeping long braids, and dressing like ancient costumes of the Qing Dynasty, which are partners of the Ma family. It is said that there are only four or five families operating Tibetan trade like the Ma family, the most famous being Bang Dachang, Hong Sheng, 汇记, 铸记 and other companies operated by Tibetans themselves. In addition, other foreign merchants cannot directly trade in Tibet.

The Ma family is from Shengdi County in Yunnan. It was initially managed by his father, Ma Zhujun. Now, because Mr. Ma has returned to his hometown, it is managed by his son, Ma Jiakui. The goods transported are said to be transported from Lhasa via Xikang to Lijiang, and each shipment takes about three months to arrive.

Ma Jiakui is a young man in his thirties. When we met, he showed some embarrassment, but because of his relationship with President Zhai, he only said that he would wait for a while and notify me when there was a suitable opportunity and a proper companion. He also said that this matter was extremely difficult. If the companion was not the right person, something could happen. If something happened, the reporter would suffer little harm, but his involvement would be great, and he might not be able to trade in Tibet.

The Outline of Kalimpong

Leaving Ma's house and walking into the market, there were many Tibetans coming and going, and the customs and habits were mostly Tibetanized. Each house has several flagpoles in front of it, with a long banner hanging from top to bottom. It is said that the flags are printed with Buddhist scriptures, and when the wind blows, the sutra flags flutter, just like people reciting them every day. Therefore, wherever Tibetans live, that's where they are.

There are not many Indians here, only a few large merchants are managed by Indians. Kalimpong originally belonged to Sikkim, a tributary state of Tibet. There are many Nepalese and Bhutanese natives in the city. The people are similar to our Chinese people, but their clothes are strange. Women all wear long skirts, and men mostly wear nondescript suits, but the small hats they wear on their heads are similar to Chinese melon-skin hats, and the tops of the hats are also red, with flower patterns embroidered around the edges of the hats.

### A Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

Sometimes he would pick up Virgil and Xenophon's works to read for a few minutes, but soon he would return to Dr. Thorndike or Prosecutor French's works. Although he had been teaching diligently for many years, he was not a learned classical scholar: indeed, he thought that Latin and Greek were more important than what Lloyd George said. Although they were dead languages, an English gentleman should know some of their idioms. He liked the short comments in "The Times" (Thems) newspaper. They would often use some sentences he knew well. The number of people who understood these things was gradually decreasing, and he was still able to occupy a place among these people, which in his view was a secret and valuable bond: he felt that this was one of the main benefits that classical education contributed.

He lived in Mrs. Wickett's house in this way, quietly enjoying reading, talking, and reminiscing about these joys; he was old, his hair was white, and he was somewhat bald, but regardless of his age, he was still very active, drinking tea, receiving guests, and busy revising "Brookfield Enquires" for the next publication, writing rare letters in fine, spider-like, and very clear handwriting. He invited new teachers and students to tea. There were two new teachers this autumn semester, and after they visited him, when they came out, one of them criticized him, saying: "This old boy can be considered a character, right? If there are indeed bachelors, his fussy way of making tea is a true bachelor."

This criticism was in fact completely wrong; because Chips was not a bachelor at all, he had been married, although it had been so long that none of the Brookfield faculty could remember his wife.

(4)

The fire was so warm and the tea was so fragrant that he was stimulated, and past events appeared vividly in his mind. Spring—one day in the spring of 1896. He was forty-eight years old—this was the age when permanent habits began to show. He had just been appointed as housemaster; while holding this position, he taught classical subjects, creating a warm and busy life for himself. During the summer vacation, he and his colleague Rowden went to the Lake District; they walked, climbed mountains, and played for a week, and Rowden left for family affairs. Chips lived alone in Wasdale Head, boarding in a small farmhouse. (8)

Social Service

### Thoughts on Social Service

— Zhao Ximing, A Seventy-Five-Year-Old

Social service is a righteous undertaking of mankind, and it is the obligation of the entire nation. Ximing expresses great sympathy and is willing to be a pioneer. Although I am not an experienced old horse, I am preparing to purchase horses in Yantai. Although old, I am unwilling to lag behind. Social service helps everyone, and everyone helps Ximing. I am the founder of the Failed Elderly Association and the initiator of the new Elderly Association. Now, with the elderly as the head, illness, loneliness, and poverty are subordinate to the three major departments governed by the elderly, managed and developed by the elderly, bringing great benefits. Such as: eliminating religious opinions, uniting mankind for mutual cooperation, dividing the grading system, and establishing educational mentors.

Confucius said that the old should be at peace and the young should be cared for; Buddha said birth, old age, sickness, and death; Jesus loves children and treats the elderly as parents. It can be seen that the eyes of religious figures are equal to the old and the young, and suitable for both old and young. People only pay attention to young children, often neglecting the aspirations of old age. People like Ma Xiangbo, like With Dengbu, become richer in old age. Now we eliminate religious factions, promote the unity of our people, unite mankind into a group, and seek social equality.

People have different endowments and different temperaments. The desire for goodness and survival is mostly the same, especially among the elderly. It is a pity to squeeze them out of society. Leaving aside the wealth and learning of the elderly, even their experience and knowledge still have some special strengths that can assist the community. How can we judge qualifications based on wealth and position and select talents based on success or failure? If people like Jiang Shang and Liang Hao died in ditches at their age, how sad would that be? It is especially regrettable that the elderly are willing to abandon themselves, live in seclusion, and proclaim their nobility.

The pain of life is divided into four parts. According to the words of Confucius and the Buddha, old age comes first, leading the three vulnerable parts of illness, loneliness, and poverty to the road of prosperity. The sick, orphans, and the poor all need mutual assistance. If we talk about old gentlemen, there is no lack of people with the heart and ability to help others. If Chen died at eighty-seven, Shen Enfu at eighty, Gao Huangchi at eighty, Xu Qianlao, Ding Fubao, Wen Lantting, etc., have a heart to save the world and take on the responsibility of helping the weak. If they can form a "Senior Citizens Association," imitating the norms of the YMCA, to serve the community, then the elderly in the community will have a Senior Citizens Association fellowship, and the adults will have a YMCA group. Both parties will advance together, old and young will return to the same place. Just like a two-wheeled car and two-winged birds, soaring straight up, what difficulty is there in a promising future? I am willing to do my best!

There are people, land, and wealth, the training of reproduction, food gathering, and the source of wealth. We are not afraid of scarcity, but of inequality. In our society, there are many who争利, and few who create利. It is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. Now, if we want to save society and bless the people, we must teach and cultivate together, and have both food and strength. This is the fundamental way to save. Using work as relief and救荒是善政; using education as a method is the best policy to relieve poverty. Teaching honesty, teaching thrift, teaching skills, if you want to fill your stomach, first work hard with your hands and feet. If your hands and feet are diligent, production will be abundant. It is not sitting and eating mountains empty, nor is it unearned income. The mentors who save production rely on old farmers, old gardeners, and old Confucian scholars. The elderly are not abandoned talents. We can use the elderly! Good! Good! I am waiting for an auction to sell, standing out!

The above words are the first step to 感動应声. I am more willing to dedicate my remaining years to Wang Cheng, the great cause of social service. Request for relief: poverty and disease, health, occupation, reading and lectures, old age and peace, and the care of young children, eight numbers.

### Tianguang Primary School Enrolls Free Students

Opposite the Lujiabang Police Station in Nanshi, Tianguang Free Primary School has strict teaching management, spacious school buildings, excellent teachers, tuition-free herding, and full-day classes. Now, in order to popularize education, we are setting up one first-grade class and one fifth-grade class, enrolling new students and transfer students from all grades.

### China Benevolent Children's Association Distributes Winter Clothing to Poor Children

The China Benevolent Children's Association has received over 80,000 yuan in donations for winter clothing for poor children, demonstrating the enthusiasm of all sectors of society for protecting children. The first batch of winter clothing has been completed, each set worth 30 yuan. Now, because the weather has been very cold for several days, poor children are asking for winter clothing. After approval, parents are successively going to the association to receive them, which is very active. In order to widely distribute winter clothing, in addition to entrusting members of the Pentecostal Holiness Church to go to the impoverished areas of Hongkou, Taopeng Road, Nanshi Xiaonanmen Qiaojia Road, Binbei Wenjianshi Road, the French Concession Xujia Lane, and Hed Road to investigate impoverished children and distribute them on a regular basis, the association has also sent letters to churches throughout the city to assist in investigating impoverished children in need of winter clothing, create name lists, and have the association coordinate the distribution.

Claim Lost A string of keys was found on the 20th trolleybus station on Tongfu Road. The owner can claim them at No. 5 Furun Lane, Julida Road, Xu Le Gong.
