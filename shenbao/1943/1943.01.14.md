### Enhancing Agricultural Production in Wartime

Abundant agricultural production is one of the material conditions supporting the war. If we hope to sustain the current long-term Second World War and strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, in addition to political unity and enlightenment, we cannot ignore economic conditions, especially the replenishment of abundant agricultural products.

China is the largest agricultural country in East Asia, and the agricultural economy is the main form of the Chinese national economy. However, when it comes to agricultural production, we cannot be "carefree." On the contrary, the dynamics of Chinese rural areas deserve our greatest attention. Due to the exploitation of long-standing feudal relationships and the invasion of Britain and the United States over the past century, China's rural economy has been exhausted. Long-term poverty has eroded farmers' ability to improve production. Everyone is struggling and relying on the weather. In recent years, due to Chongqing's protracted war, "abandoned fields" have become the most common phenomenon. Within the peace zones, after more than two years, it seems that cultivation is still possible. However, due to the impact of rising prices of grain and other crops, the differentiation of rural areas has intensified, and there is no talk of improving the general productivity of farmers. Jiangpu was originally a rice-producing area, but the seriousness of the food problem is still unexpectedly severe. Although the most important reason is not production, insufficient production is clearly a major factor. Now that the National Government has declared war, due to the wartime needs of both China and Japan, increasing agricultural production should be an important task at present.

In order to increase agricultural production, we should expand crops immediately. To ensure the regular harvest of agricultural products, we should also mobilize refugees to reclaim wasteland. At the same time, we should work hard on water conservancy and afforestation, and strive to guide farmers to improve seeds and soil. However, if socio-economic relations are not improved, all scientific and technological means cannot be applied to actual production. Because reclaiming wasteland is not something that farmers can do with their bare hands, water conservancy and afforestation are not within the power of a few farmers, and improving seeds and soil is not something that impoverished farmers can undertake.

Therefore, in order to truly increase agricultural production, we must provide economic assistance to the vast agricultural sector. The first thing is to promote agricultural loans. However, we should avoid the reasons for the failure of agricultural loans by the Chongqing government. In recent years, agricultural loans have been popular in Chongqing, but the true farmers who need funds cannot obtain loans. Some farmers who obtain loans do not use the funds for production but for paying rent, taxes, and debts. On the other hand, local bullies and evil gentry use their special status to borrow large amounts of funds and use them to lend at high interest rates. In the rural areas of various provinces under the Chongqing regime, aren't 80 percent of the credit cooperatives actually disguised usury institutions? This is not increasing agricultural production, but exploiting farmers and destroying the rural economy. How can we talk about increasing agricultural production? Today, to implement agricultural loans in the peace zones, we must establish reasonable credit cooperatives, relax guarantee conditions so that farmers can borrow funds, and reduce past interest rates to alleviate the burden on farmers.

However, it is not enough to simply implement agricultural loans and solve the funding problem for agricultural production. The accumulated burdens are heavily pressing on farmers, and they cannot work hard to increase agricultural production with peace of mind. Therefore, secondly, we must reduce the various unreasonable and unfair burdens on farmers. The first is to implement rent reduction for individual farmers. At the same time, reduce or eliminate unreasonable donations and taxes for tenant farmers and small landowners to relieve the strength of small and medium-sized farmers. Otherwise, while implementing agricultural loans, if we still retain the harsh taxes on farmers, and even increase new-style and seasonal donations and taxes for war reasons, we are not actually increasing national income, but preventing agricultural production, which violates the meaning of participating in the war.

In recent years, some of the floating capital in Shanghai and other major cities has flowed into rural areas. Some people say that this is a good sign for the development of rural areas. This is a one-sided view. Originally, investment of floating capital in rural production should be encouraged. However, in reality, when we investigate the situation of floating capital flowing into rural areas, we find that it is greatly mistaken. Because the main manifestation is not the excitement of rural production gaining funds, but the transfer of land ownership. In particular, it shows the centralization of land ownership. The number of owner-farmers and small landlords is drastically reduced, while a small number of floating capital owners become the new masters and new landlords of vast rural areas. When landlords move, tenant farmers follow suit. If they do not want to lose their cultivated land, they have to endure the pain of increased rent. In response to this phenomenon, we should find ways to protect tenant farmers' tenancy rights, prohibit unreasonable rent increases so that farmers can produce with peace of mind, and prohibit the large-scale abandonment of land and non-production, so that those who inject floating capital into rural areas are not engaged in land speculation, but truly support production.

In addition, we should also reasonably improve the burden of land taxes and wartime donations and taxes on tenant farmers and small and medium-sized farmers, and prohibit landlords from passing on their burdens to tenant farmers, owner-farmers, and small landlords. After these malpractices are eliminated, we should strive to promote rural transportation and marketing cooperative businesses to avoid the exploitation of commercial capital.

For the actual needs of participating in the war, we must earnestly implement the above measures to increase agricultural production. This is not only a technical issue, but requires efforts to improve land policy, food policy, financial policy, and other aspects. Otherwise, all fine-sounding slogans and good-looking policies will not have any practical effect.

### Supreme National Defense Council Held Its First Meeting Yesterday, Approved the General Budget of National Revenue and Expenditure, and Resolved to Reorganize Administrative Institutions

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Supreme National Defense Council held its first meeting yesterday (the 13th). (A) Reporting matters: (1) Reading the minutes of the temporary meeting of the Central Political Committee on January 9, 1943; (2) Chairman's report: According to the outline of the organization of the Supreme National Defense Council, Chen Gongbo, a standing member of the Military Affairs Commission, has been designated as a member of the Council. (B) Matters for discussion: (1) The chairman submitted a draft of the organizational regulations of the Supreme National Defense Council for public decision (attached regulations). Resolved to pass and send to the National Government. (2) The chairman submitted a draft of the organizational regulations of the secretariat of the Supreme National Defense Council for public decision. Resolved to pass. (3) The chairman submitted a report from the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance on the preparation of the general budget of national revenue and expenditure for the first half of the 32nd year for approval. Resolved to pass and send to the National Government for compliance and to the Legislative Yuan for record. (4) The chairman submitted a report from the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance on the proposal to change the consolidated tobacco tax and temporary special tax to ad valorem taxation, with an attached revised tax rate schedule for approval. Resolved to pass and to instruct the Ministry of Finance through the Executive Yuan to draft a revised draft of the relevant provisions of the Tobacco Consolidation Tax Regulations for approval and to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for record. The date of implementation shall be determined by order of the Ministry of Finance. (5) The chairman submitted a proposal on reforming administrative institutions, with the original proposal attached. Resolved to pass and send to the National Government and the Legislative Yuan for record. (6) The chairman submitted a proposal to elect Cen Degong and Chen Jicheng as members of the National Government, Chen Junhui as Minister of Construction, Gu Baoheng as Minister of Food, and Ding Mocun as Minister of Social Welfare for public decision. Resolved to pass and send to the National Government.

Measures for Reforming Administrative Institutions

(A) Principles of reorganization: (1) The organs of the Executive Yuan shall adopt a single system in principle to clarify responsibilities and achieve agility. (2) The number of members in each ministry shall vary according to their duties and need not be uniform. For those changed from committees to ministries, the number of members used shall not exceed the number at the time of the committee. This does not apply if the duties are increased compared to the past. (3) In the executive organs, vigorously correct the malpractice of overstaffing, reduce the current number, and set up consultation organs to attract talents. (B) Institutional adjustments: (1) It is proposed to change the National Economic Commission currently under the Executive Yuan to be under the National Government to achieve the practical effect of promoting national economic construction and improving the lives of the people. (2) The New People's Movement is the foundation for the revival of China and the preservation of East Asia. In order to ensure that all the people of the country adhere to it, it is proposed to change the New People's Movement Promotion Committee, which is currently under the Executive Yuan, to be under the National Government. (3) Personnel administration is closely related. It is more reasonable for the Ministry of Personnel Affairs to belong to the Executive Yuan than to the Examination Yuan, because examination and personnel affairs are actually two separate matters. For the Ministry of Personnel Affairs belonging to the Examination Yuan, the Examination Yuan has not seen its connection, while the Executive Yuan has many barriers. It is proposed to change the Ministry of Personnel Affairs currently under the Examination Yuan to be under the Executive Yuan. (4) Since the Central Political Committee re-established the principles for guiding people's organizations, the duties of the Social Movement Guidance Committee have changed. It is proposed to merge the committee with the Relief Commission into a Department of Social Welfare to manage social welfare planning and charitable affairs. The original political guidance for social movements shall also be under its management. The original administrative systems of the two committees in various provinces and cities shall be changed to Social Welfare Bureaus to handle all social welfare matters under the command of the Minister of Social Welfare. In the future, matters related to social welfare shall be transferred by the provincial and municipal governments to the responsible departments for handling by the bureau to unify the authority. (5) It is proposed to change the Food Management Committee into a Department of Food to comprehensively manage national food production, allocation, and management. The existing food institutions in various provinces and cities shall remain as before, handling food affairs in their respective provinces and cities under the command of the Minister of Food, striving for no waste of funds and real benefits for the people. (6) The situation in the border areas is special. All administrative affairs cannot be compared with the provinces in the interior. Therefore, there is a Border Affairs Committee. However, in these times of trouble, the committee has been extremely idle. It is proposed to abolish the Border Affairs Committee currently under the Executive Yuan and establish a Border Affairs Bureau directly under the Ministry of Interior to supervise border affairs and improve border politics under the command of the Minister of Interior. The existing liaison office in Nanjing shall continue to be set up to communicate information. (7) The emigration and protection of overseas Chinese originally belonged to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. However, these matters are closely related to diplomacy. It is proposed to abolish the commission and establish an Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau directly under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The bureau shall have a director, changed to a simple appointment, to handle all matters related to overseas Chinese under the command of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The original offices stationed in various places shall be instructed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to draft adjustment measures for approval and compliance. (8) Water conservancy and transportation are both major parts of construction. It is proposed to merge the Water Conservancy Commission into the Ministry of Transportation and change it to a Department of Construction to manage water conservancy, transportation, and urban construction affairs to unify authority. (9) In order to improve administrative efficiency, the internal organization of the Executive Yuan should be simplified. The three organs of the Secretariat, the Office of Counselors, and the Legal Bureau shall be merged into one with a Secretary-General to comprehensively manage affairs, assisted by two Deputy Secretaries-General. (10) Each existing ministry has a Political Vice Minister and an Administrative Vice Minister. The authority is hampered and causes trouble. It is proposed to abolish the Political Vice Minister and the Administrative Vice Minister of each ministry and establish one Vice Minister in each ministry to assist the minister in handling ministry affairs to increase efficiency. (C) Personnel arrangements: (1) Each ministry may establish a committee as an advisory and recommendation body, with three to five members, simply appointed, without setting up an office or secretaries. (2) The remaining personnel below the recommendation level shall be organized into an inquiry committee, with the Vice Ministers of each ministry as members and the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan as the chairman, to seriously inquire about the talents, character, and qualifications of the remaining personnel. If they are still competent, they shall be assigned to various departments and bureaus at the original level. Those who are old and frail or have been ineffective in their work shall be dismissed uniformly. Dismissal measures shall be determined separately. (3) The civil servants of the existing organs shall undergo a temporary performance appraisal by their respective supervisors within one month after the approval and implementation of these measures and submit them for approval. (4) The number of personnel below the section chief of each existing department shall be clearly stipulated and submitted for approval and compliance. Unnecessary and ineffective personnel shall be dismissed immediately. (5) The number of personnel in newly established organs shall be reduced as much as possible and the number shall be submitted for approval and compliance in advance. (D) Revision of laws and regulations and others: (1) For each Yuan and department whose organization has been changed, the responsible supervisor shall revise the relevant laws and regulations and submit them for approval and handling. (2) For each newly established organ approved, the responsible supervisor shall draft them quickly and submit them for approval and handling. (3) For the organizational law and other relevant laws and regulations of each abolished organ, which have been announced by the National Government, the Secretariat of the Central Political Committee shall be requested to list them and submit them to the National Government for explicit abolition. (4) The budgets of newly established, merged, or reorganized organs shall be drafted by the responsible supervisor as soon as possible according to the following standards: (1) For two organs merged into one, the budget of the new organ shall not exceed 80% of the total budget of the original two organs. (2) For a committee reduced to a bureau, the budget shall not exceed 70% of the original committee's budget. (3) For a committee changed to a department, the budget shall not exceed the original committee's budget. (4) If the original organs need to increase funding to accommodate dismissed personnel, it shall be paid from the funds saved by the merged or reorganized organs, but the total amount shall not exceed 80% of the total savings. For merged or reorganized organs, funding shall be issued according to the original budget for January and according to the new budget from February. (5) For each abolished organ, the responsible supervisor shall send the inventory of assets to the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan for inventory and safekeeping and submit it for reallocation to emphasize public property. (6) For each abolished organ, all surplus funds from previous years shall be submitted by the responsible supervisor to the national treasury for a receipt and reported to the Executive Yuan for record. No requests shall be made for use without reason to emphasize public funds. (7) For organs merged, the staff shall be limited to those from the original two organs. No new personnel shall be hired in addition to the original personnel. However, transferred personnel are not subject to this restriction.

Organizational Regulations of the National Defense Council

Organizational Regulations of the Supreme National Defense Council: (1) The Central Political Committee shall establish the Supreme National Defense Council in wartime to decide on important matters concerning national defense. (2) In wartime, the Central Political Committee shall make emergency decisions when the situation requires it. It may suspend the effect of existing laws, and for legal bills, it may omit legal procedures when necessary and send them directly to the National Government for promulgation and to the Legislative Yuan for record. (3) The Central Political Committee shall meet once a month in wartime. During the recess, its powers shall be exercised by the Supreme National Defense Council. (4) The Supreme National Defense Council shall meet once a week and may hold temporary meetings when necessary. Matters decided by the Supreme National Defense Council shall be reported when the Central Political Committee meets.

Main Points of the Leader's Instructions

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The first meeting of the New People's Movement Promotion Association was held in Nanjing on the 13th of this month, presided over by Chairman Wang, who gave earnest instructions. The main points are as follows: (1) Last year was the preparation period for the theory and holding of the New People's Movement, and this year is the implementation period of the New People's Movement. (2) After China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, the New People's Movement has its practical focus. The leader specifically clarified the true motives and great significance of the total participation in the war, and pointed out the erroneous thinking of the general public on the issue of participation in the war, pointing out that in the era of national groups and the era of war, there is absolutely no possibility of isolating oneself from the war to recuperate and develop. China's participation in the war is a necessary step to achieve the revival of China and defend East Asia, and explained that China's participation in the war is purely in a spirit of initiative, based on a determination of life and death. The leader further stated that the war from now on will be a long-term war and a total war. The most important thing in this is the unity of the 1 billion people of East Asia, sharing weal and woe, and living and dying together, which will be enough to defeat the evil forces of the new order. Our total participation in the war is based on the determination made since the peace movement in the subjective sense, and in the objective sense, it is based on the expectation of sincere unity of the East Asian nations by friendly Japan, and it is an act of solemnity. (3) The comrades of the New People's Movement work, standing in the position of leaders of the people of the whole country, should pay attention to arousing the spirit of sacrifice, the spirit of unity, and the spirit of training among the people in their future work, and make them organized and disciplined actions. (4) The practice of the New People's Movement lies in making the awareness of participation in the war universal and profound, and with regard to increasing production and ensuring public security, one must also lead by example and take the spirit of hard work as the first. For the general youth and the general national organization training, each should work hard in their own positions. (5) In the implementation of the New People's Movement, attention must be paid to breaking down individualism, eliminating the bad habits of factionalism, breaking down bureaucracy, and eliminating the bad habits of superficiality, so as to create a new social atmosphere. (6) In conclusion, the leader encouraged all to bear the responsibility of the Greater East Asia War with the spirit of the New People's Movement, and to achieve China's freedom and equality and the co-existence and co-prosperity of East Asia with the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Japanese Information Bureau Spokesman Receives Foreign Journalists to Analyze British and American Attitudes Toward Chongqing

Tokyo, 13th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Mr. Hori, spokesman for the Information Bureau, stated today while receiving foreign journalists that the United States and Britain were quite apprehensive about Japan's swift decision to abolish extraterritorial rights and concessions in China. Therefore, on January 11th, they concluded an agreement with Chongqing, promising to renounce the special privileges they enjoyed under the Boxer Protocol of 1901 (including the right to station troops in North China, extraterritorial rights, and privileges related to treaty ports, inland navigation, and coastal trade). They also promised to return the administrative rights to the Peking Legation Quarter and the Shanghai and Kulangsu International Settlements, as well as the British concessions. On the surface, this action appears to return a large number of rights to Chongqing, but in reality, it is all empty words. The return of administrative rights to the concessions only applies to five areas: the Shanghai and Kulangsu International Settlements, the Peking Legation Quarter, and the British concessions in Tianjin and Guangzhou. However, these areas are currently occupied by the Japanese army, and the British cannot discuss retaining or returning them. Regarding the British and American promise to renounce their privileges concerning treaty ports, inland navigation, and coastal trade, this is nothing more than an empty gesture. Before the war, when Britain and the United States still had trade relations and could send ships to navigate the coast and the Yangtze River, this move would have had some significance. However, today, British and American forces have been completely driven out of East Asia, and their trade and inland navigation no longer exist, so this move is meaningless. Now that the British and American troops stationed in North China have all become prisoners, renouncing the right to station troops in North China only adds a "laughingstock" to the entire agreement.

### Hangzhou New Life Movement Branch Officially Established

Hangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Hangzhou branch of the New Life Movement Promotion Committee is now fully prepared and was officially established today (the 13th). All personnel appointments have also been announced, and the work of promoting the New Life Movement in Hangzhou will soon be launched.

### Fu Bingchang Appointed Chongqing Envoy to the Soviet Union

Lisbon, 13th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - According to Chongqing news, Fu Bingchang, the former Chongqing Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and current spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been appointed as the new ambassador to Moscow. Mr. Fu succeeds Shao Lizi, who recently resigned and returned to Chongqing.

### Washington Dispatch: Regarding the American Election - The Democratic Party Barely Maintains Its Advantage, While the Republican Party Has Made Significant Gains - Transmitted from Macau on January 10th

The results of the American congressional and gubernatorial elections were announced on November 4th. The Democratic Party still maintains a controlling advantage, but the Republican Party, after its setbacks in the 1940 general election, has shown significant gains in this election, which is noteworthy. Although the election campaign this time did not arouse great enthusiasm, the American presidential election, held every four years, is about to take place in two years. It is difficult to predict whether the World War will be over by then, and everyone expects Roosevelt to step down after his third term. Therefore, this election, while proceeding calmly, still contains considerable future significance.

According to the American political system, the term of senators is six years, with one-third of the seats being re-elected every two years. The term of representatives in the House is two years, and all seats are re-elected at the end of the term. The term of governors varies depending on the laws of each state, with two-year and four-year terms. Their elections are held concurrently with the congressional elections. In the current election, thirty-two governors, thirty-five senators, and four hundred and thirty-two representatives are to be elected. Maine, according to precedent, already elected one Republican governor, one senator, and three representatives in September. According to the unconfirmed election results received so far, the Republican Party holds 38 seats in the Senate, the Democratic Party holds 58 seats, the Republican Party has won 208 seats in the House, and the Democratic Party has won 220 seats. No reports have been received on the gubernatorial elections. Let's look at the results of the previous two elections!

1938 Election (76th Congress)

Senate House

Democrats 69 262

Republicans 23 170

Other 4 3

1940 Election (77th Congress)

Democrats 65 258

Republicans 29 165

Other 2 12

We can clearly see that the Republican Party's gains in this election are a significant phenomenon. If this had occurred during peacetime, the opposition party could have hindered the government's measures at any time, which would have had an unfavorable impact. This phenomenon was very pronounced during the later period of President Hoover's administration.

If the current World War ends before the next American presidential election in November 1944, what possible impact will result based on the results of the current election? According to the past precedents of American party history, the Democratic Party has often been in power during periods of complexity and crisis. Wilson and Roosevelt successively shouldered the heavy responsibility of two world wars, while the Republican Party has often been in power during times of peace. This may be a coincidence and not a fixed rule, but observing the active nature of the American people, it is not impossible for the responsibility of post-war reconstruction to fall on the shoulders of the Republican Party. Currently, the platforms of the two major American parties do not have obvious differences. Their alternation of power in foreign policy does not give cause for major concern. What we are interested in is the question of who will be the officeholders.

### Fierce Battles Between Germany and Soviet Union in the Leningrad Area; German Troops Break Through Soviet Defenses at Luga; Soviet Offensive Fails Near the Suburbs of Staraya Russa

Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to an announcement from the Supreme Command at noon today, fierce battles have resumed again. The area involved is along Lake Ilmen, Lake Ladoga, and the Leningrad area. The entire eastern front is also in action.

Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - The Soviet offensive launched along the south bank of Lake Ladoga on the Leningrad front has completely failed.

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to Moscow sources, German troops on the Luga front have broken through the Soviet defense lines with heavy tanks. Soviet troops retreated several kilometers. Fierce fighting is still ongoing west and southwest of Luga.

Fuehrer's Headquarters, 13th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Today's German war report stated that after a period of stagnation, the enemy's offensive in the western Caucasus has resumed, attempting to break into the positions of the German-Romanian allied forces. However, they did not succeed and were repelled with heavy casualties by the defending forces. Our mountain troops also destroyed many enemy strongholds on the mountain front. Soviet troops attacked Hungarian positions, first with heavy artillery bombardment. German troops rushed to assist and repelled the enemy. German and Hungarian aircraft repeatedly bombed enemy bases and troop formations, with considerable success. On the central sector of the eastern front, the enemy lost several hundred prisoners and many artillery pieces. German troops are firmly defending the key point of Luga, which is still resisting the enemy's fierce attacks and launching counterattacks to relieve the pressure on the area.

Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Soviet troops continue to launch fierce attacks on the southern sector of the Don front, but all have been repelled. German troops are stepping up their offensive on the central sector with significant results. The enemy's offensive between the Caucasus and the Don River is more intense than in previous days. Occasionally, German defense lines are broken through, but they are immediately sealed off. Between the Volga and the Don River, German troops captured several villages. Soviet tanks attacked the city of Mineralnye Vody in the Caucasus but were forced to retreat after twelve tanks were destroyed. German tank units in the Toropets district launched a surprise attack on enemy forces and surrounded them.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Strong Soviet forces once again launched a fierce attack on German positions around the Staraya Russa area on the 12th. After successive fierce battles, they briefly penetrated several German positions. However, due to the resolute fighting of the German troops, they ultimately regained their positions and repelled all the Soviet troops, surrounding them. The Soviet troops suffered heavy losses, abandoning 54 tanks and retreating in disarray.

### Japanese Military Authorities Protect Prisoners of War, Providing Them with Air Raid Shelters to Avoid Bombing by Their Own Country

Rangoon, 17th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese military authorities are now providing air raid shelters to prisoners of war detained here to protect them from indiscriminate bombing by their own aircraft. This move is deeply appreciated by the British prisoners of war. The enemy, however, has not stopped its acts of violence against innocent people, such as the British aircraft bombing a Japanese medical ship in the port of Rangoon on January 5th, and indiscriminately bombing temples and civilian houses in Rangoon on December 12th last year, as well as bombing a hospital in Lashio, causing many civilian casualties in Burma and India.

Here, the report of the French occupation of the Brak oasis, as claimed by the British side, is neither confirmed nor denied. The Allied offensive launched south of Lake Chad is still encountering difficulties in supplying, as its supply line is too long and there are no railway facilities.

### U.S. Acknowledges Naval Losses, Intended to Pass Budget; Japanese Spokesman Explains U.S. President's Motives

Tokyo, 17th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Hori, a spokesman for the Information Bureau, stated today while receiving foreign journalists that the U.S. Navy finally admitted yesterday to losing the 19,900-ton aircraft carrier Wasp and ten other warships in the Solomon Islands because the Roosevelt administration needed some alarming news to urge Congress to pass a war budget of $100 billion. The losses admitted by the United States this time are greater than the losses it has admitted in the past, but the U.S. Navy authorities have still not disclosed the most important part of their losses, namely one battleship and two aircraft carriers. On December 16th last year, the Japanese General Headquarters announced that the total losses of the U.S. Navy in that naval battle in the South Pacific were one battleship, three aircraft carriers, another aircraft carrier of unknown type that was also sunk, and three other warships of unknown type that were also severely damaged.

### Grew Writes a Book Warning His Countrymen That Japanese Strength Should Not Be Underestimated

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, repeatedly warned his countrymen of their insufficient understanding of Japan after returning to the United States. He also wrote a book entitled "Report from Tokyo," which was published on December 7th last year. The main points are summarized as follows: On December 7, 1941, the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, many questions arose in our minds. I will address and answer two points. (1) Why did Japan go to war with Britain and the United States? The Japanese have always regarded the British and American people as inferior and weak, while regarding themselves as a strong and excellent nation. This view seems very reasonable and has a basis. Most Japanese believe that being able to endure a difficult life is culture, that they are tireless in diligence and war, and that Oriental culture is completely opposed to the luxurious enjoyment of Europe and America. Although I do not want to praise the enemy, I cannot help but point out the following: (A) Internal unity: In addition to respecting the sacredness of the Emperor, the Japanese people unanimously support the government. In Japan, no individual or group is dissatisfied with the government. (B) Training: Whether Japanese armaments are excellent or not is another matter. In short, they are very willing to abide by the rules, and training is very widespread throughout the country. They firmly believe that once Japanese men enlist in the army, they can fight against the armies of Britain and the United States. (C) Excellent quality: It is no exaggeration to say that the Japanese have built prosperity on poverty. (D) The Japanese firmly believe that in war, they should trust the government and all national policies. (2) Why are the Japanese so confident in victory? The Japanese believe that Britain and the United States underestimate Japan, and the internal divisions within Britain and the United States during wartime and before the war have further increased the Japanese people's belief in victory. The greatest reason for the Japanese army's victory is the strength of its morale. Many British and Americans believe that the Japanese army is useless due to the stalemate in the Sino-Japanese War, but they do not know that they are preparing resources for an even greater war.

### Compulsory Purchase of Rice Stockpiled Around Shanghai; Grain Administration to Be Implemented Within the Blockade Line; Rationed Rice for Households Will Be Increased

Since the implementation of the major commodity rationing system adopted by the authorities to stabilize people's livelihoods, whether it is rice, grains, cooking oil, sugar, soap, matches, or tobacco, regardless of the differences in the form of implementation, the principle is the same, because their highest governing bodies have the same origin. In order to rectify the efficiency of rationing, it is stipulated that all rationed goods must strictly abide by the following regulations when sold: (1) Not violate the official price; (2) Not mix in impurities; (3) Not have insufficient quantity; (4) Rationed goods must not be hoarded; (5) Must not exceed the sales limit; (6) Must not violate the public notices posted inside and outside the store. Anyone who violates the above regulations will have their rationing suspended in minor cases and their rationing qualifications permanently revoked in serious cases.

### Rice Prices Have Fallen in the Suburbs of Shanghai

Domei News Agency Shanghai Dispatch: After the Japanese authorities and the Municipal Government announced on Tuesday a ban on the private transport of important food grains from the "cleared areas" into the Shanghai area, rice prices in Songjiang, Qingpu, Jiaxing, and Pinghu around Shanghai fell sharply. The routes for the private transport of rice and other food grains between the "cleared areas" and Shanghai have now been completely cut off. The standard rice prices in the rural areas are now decoupled from the black market rice prices in Shanghai. Observers believe that grain prices will continue to fall in the coming days and cannot return to normal levels. The local authorities will now be able to purchase more food grains at lower prices for the citizens of Shanghai.

French Concession Suppressing Black Market

The French Concession authorities stated yesterday their determination to cooperate with the Japanese side and the Public Concession authorities to jointly suppress all speculation and black market activities in order to stabilize the livelihoods of civilians. They solemnly declared that they would take severe measures against all violators. The French authorities also expressed their willingness to unite with the residents of the French Concession and said that they would not stop taking punitive steps until they had achieved their goal of ensuring that residents obtained the main foods they needed. Finally, the French authorities also informed the public that they would continue to cooperate with the Japanese military authorities and fully adopt parallel measures regarding the notice published in the newspapers by the Japanese military authorities prohibiting the private sale of major food grains, including rice, corn, wheat, beans, and products made from the above food grains.

Compulsory Purchase of Stockpiled Rice

The reason why the authorities of all parties issued the order to prohibit the transportation of major food grains without permission this time is that although the rice harvest last autumn was said to be not bad, rice prices in the vicinity of Shanghai were still very high. This was probably due to hoarding, manipulation, and private smuggling abroad. Now that the authorities have issued an order prohibiting movement, the next step is to forcibly purchase stockpiled rice in Shanghai and the "cleared areas." As for the rice in the rice-producing areas, it will be purchased uniformly by the Grain Management Committee. The system of rationing rice according to population has been quite effective since it was implemented on July 6th last year. In order to fully supply the population with rationed grain, measures will be taken to increase the amount of rationed rice in Shanghai to meet the legitimate needs of poor households.

Rationed Rice for Households to Be Increased in the Next Period

It is reported that the contracted rice shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession have been notified by the Rice and Grain Office to collect the purchase orders for the twenty-fourth period at 10:00 a.m. today and pay and pick up the goods within the specified date. Sales will begin on the 21st of this month based on rice purchase certificates and flour purchase certificates. According to a reporter from Shanghai News Agency, who inquired with the rice industry yesterday, the amount of rationed rice for the twenty-fourth period will be increased to two sheng per person, and flour will be increased to two jin. It is also rumored that the rice is pure white rice, and there are plans to gradually increase it to four sheng per person per period. The exact amount will only be clear after the purchase orders are collected today.

Population Checks in the Blockade Area

After the implementation of grain rationing according to population in various districts within the blockade line of this city, whether the grain distribution in each district is accurate and fair is closely related to the population of each district. Therefore, the Municipal Grain Management Bureau has implemented random checks of household registration in various districts on specific days to prevent malfeasance and fraudulent claims of rations, and has revised the measures for checking household registration and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. The areas for random checks are temporarily limited to the districts within the blockade line. This work will be carried out continuously without a fixed deadline. The number of households randomly checked in each district each month must be at least 2% of the total number. Except for the Nanshi area, which is directly handled by the Bureau, other districts will be handled by personnel dispatched by the Bureau in consultation with the district offices. If necessary, the Grain Bureau may directly dispatch personnel to conduct random checks to facilitate the increasingly thorough promotion of the Municipal Government's established grain policy. At the same time, in order to prevent malfeasance and extortion, all inspection personnel will be issued armbands by the Grain Bureau to show identification. When the inspection personnel are performing their duties, they should maintain close contact with the relevant Lianbao chiefs and local police officers. If it is found during the inspection that the household registration has changed for more than one month and has not yet been registered, the Lianbao chiefs concerned should be dealt with separately. If there is indeed malfeasance, once the responsible party is identified, they will be punished in the following ways: (1) Households: In minor cases, their right to purchase rice will be suspended for one or two times; in serious cases, their right to purchase rice will be suspended for one month. (2) Public granaries: In minor cases, a fine will be imposed; in serious cases, their qualifications to sell public rationed rice will be revoked. (3) The Lianbao chief will report to the Municipal Government for investigation and punishment in accordance with the law.

Charitable Organizations' Purchase Has Been Agreed To

Regarding the problem of the rice and grain needed by charitable organizations such as soup kitchens and shelters, Ling Xianwen, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters from the Central News Agency yesterday that the Municipal Government is doing its best to find ways to consult with friendly agencies to dredge the situation. In general, friendly agencies have agreed to allow monthly purchases.

### With the Full Cooperation of Various Authorities, Rationing of Cooking Oil According to Population Will Be Implemented Immediately, With the Same Implementation Method as Rationing Grain According to Population

The Shanghai Cooking Oil Industry Wholesale Office, in order to universally supply cooking oil, adapt to the environment, eliminate the illegal activities of oil pressing gangs, and benefit the needs of citizens, with the approval of the military distribution authorities, implemented a new method of rationing oil according to population. Letters were sent to all registered retailers to solicit their opinions on undertaking the rationing of oil, but those who undertake the rationing of oil must have the ability to advance oil payments and guarantee money. The users of various retailers have registered to handle the rationing of oil according to population, and registration was closed on the 12th of this month. A reporter from this newspaper interviewed a person in charge yesterday, who said that preparations for rationing oil according to population have been actively underway and are inevitable. It has now been decided that with the full cooperation of the military distribution authorities, the Japanese Embassy Office, the Municipal Government, the Public Concession Works Department, the French Concession Directorate, and the Cooking Oil Industry Wholesale Office, it will be implemented in the near future. All implementation details have been submitted to the relevant authorities for thorough research and will be officially implemented by the authorities. As for the implementation method, it is roughly the same as the method of rationing grain according to population, which is based on the Baodjia household registration books, and oil purchase certificates are issued to households according to the population, and oil is purchased from designated oil retail stores. At present, the issuance of oil purchase certificates by each Lianbao district to households is only a temporary expedient measure. Regarding the rationing of oil according to population, the Wholesale Office has obtained the consent of the Municipal Police Bureau to assist, and it has been decided to conduct a pilot project in Nanshi. The Fangbaojia chiefs are responsible for filling in the household registration lists and reporting them within a time limit. The pre-determined method is to adopt grain rationing according to population, three periods per month, half a jin per person per period, and one and a half jin of oil per month is enough to meet the needs of one person.

Category A Oil Stores to Sell Today

Since the authorities ordered the wholesale office to divide the oil stores that sell at the door into Categories A, B, and C to sell oil in rotation, the phenomenon of crowding has been slightly reduced. Category B oil stores have stopped selling for some time, but because the procedures have not been completed, they will continue to sell oil for four days from today until 4:00 p.m. on the 17th. The method is to assist the Baojia chiefs in each district to issue oil purchase certificates to households, and residents can purchase oil with the certificates, so it is hoped that there will be no crowding in the oil stores.

### Notification from the Japanese Military Police Commander: Urging Registration of Radios, Deadline on the 18th, Strict Penalties for Late Registration, Inquiries Can Be Made by Telephone to the Broadcasting Supervision Office

Regarding the prohibition of wireless radios, detailed measures were announced by both Chinese and Japanese authorities on December 18th of last year for the registration of prohibited radios, with a registration deadline set for the 18th of this month. It is now known that the commander of the Japanese military police in Shanghai issued a notification yesterday (the 13th) at 3:00 PM, stating: "Based on military necessity, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy has previously announced and the military authorities have issued statements regarding the prohibition of advanced wireless radios in Central and Southern China. Recently, relevant agencies have implemented prohibition measures in accordance with regulations, with a planned deadline of the 18th of this month. However, it is understood that there are still many who have not completed the required procedures. This officer will take strict measures against those who violate the regulations, regardless of their nationality. It is earnestly hoped that those who have not completed the procedures will do so promptly before the deadline." In addition, in order to make the registration procedures clearer to citizens who own radios, the relevant authorities have listed the following points again and hope that they will be noted:

Points to Note for Radio Owners:

(1) Many errors were made during last summer's registration. Therefore, radio owners are urged to take their radios to the nearest radio shop or designated modification location for inspection as soon as possible. (2) If, during registration, it was stated that the radio had six or fewer tubes or did not have shortwave capability, but it actually has seven or more tubes or has shortwave capability, the registration certificate should be exchanged at the Broadcasting Supervision Office (316 Hardoon Building, Nanjing Road) or a designated modification location, and the required procedures should be completed. (3) If, during registration, it was stated that the radio had seven or more tubes but it actually has six or fewer tubes, or it was stated that it had shortwave capability but it actually does not, the same procedures as in item 2 should be followed. (4) Advanced radios with seven or more tubes should be registered at the application office without being modified first. Japanese people register at the consulate and police station. Others register at the Broadcasting Supervision Office, Room 316, Hardoon Building, Nanjing Road, outside of the concessions, but those in the city should register at the Municipal Police Bureau. (5) Radios with six or fewer tubes that can receive shortwave should be modified immediately. It is more convenient to do this at a designated location, as a certificate of inspection must be issued after modification. Therefore, those who modify at a non-designated location will still need to take it to a designated modification location. All designated locations have a sign that reads "Designated Modification Location of the China Broadcasting Association." (6) The use, possession, manufacture, or transfer of prohibited radios is absolutely not permitted for individuals, except for those who are required to do so for their duties. Japanese people apply to the consulate, police station, and others to the Municipal Police Bureau, the Works Department, and the Public Works Bureau. (7) All prohibited radios owned by radio shops, second-hand shops, pawnshops, etc., must also be registered. They are not allowed to be sold without certification from the military authorities. (8) Companies or organizations other than radio shops that have 30 or more modified radios will have their radios inspected by personnel dispatched by the China Broadcasting Association. A separate inspection fee will be charged, and an inspection and verification certificate will be issued. (9) Applications submitted in the form of letters, postcards, or telephone calls without completing the required forms will not be accepted. (10) Anyone attempting to evade this registration, such as temporarily hiding a radio or using the name of another person, will be punished according to military law as a violator of the proclamation. (11) Those who voluntarily offer to donate their radios will have them accepted by the Army and Navy Information Department. (12) If there are any unclear points regarding the handling of prohibited radios, Japanese people can inquire at the Shanghai Radio Station (telephone 46294), and others can inquire at the Broadcasting Supervision Office (telephone 19871). Those who wish to donate or sell to the military authorities should notify the Army and Navy Information Department. (13) Regardless of whether they are Chinese, Japanese, or foreigners, anyone who fails to complete the above procedures before the 18th will be severely punished.

### New Restrictions on Imported Goods Starting Next Fiscal Year: Items That Can Be Self-Supplied Will Not Be Imported; Allowable Imports Will Be Limited to Needed Quantities

In order to adjust import trade, the relevant authorities previously commissioned the China Import Association to investigate various related information. This has now been completed satisfactorily. It has been decided that strict restrictions will be imposed on goods imported from Japan starting in the next fiscal year. The purpose of these import restrictions is to encourage and promote the development of industry in Central China. It is understood that according to the decision: (1) Goods that Chinese industry can self-supply will not be imported from Japan. (2) For goods that China absolutely needs from Japan, imports will be limited to the minimum amount. (3) For goods that have always been imported from Japan to China, if Japan cannot continue to produce them and prohibits exports, then these necessities must be produced in China. (4) If Japan has a surplus of certain goods and is allowed to ship them to China, the quantity will be limited to what China needs.

### On the Movement for Women's Liberation

— Ji Xin

Unless men are not prepared to marry, or there are no daughters in the family, separating men and women into two societies, who can say that the women's liberation movement is only a matter for women themselves?

China has reached its 32nd year [of the Republic], and the proposal for the women's liberation movement is no less than that number of years. The first woman to participate in her own liberation movement may already be an old lady, and the fate of the old lady is not much better than that of her mother, still "relying on her parents at home, and relying on her husband when she goes out."

The failure of the liberation movement, some people think, is due to the excessive pressure from men: it is true that there is no husband who does not hope that his wife can be a virtuous housewife, settling down with housework, rather having a warm family, not necessarily needing a wife who can earn money. The behavior arising from this psychology is certainly not conducive to the first step of the women's liberation movement - seeking employment, striving for equal economic status. This kind of psychology puts social environment into a reactionary public opinion, beginning to doubt, are the elder sisters who have received the same school education as the boys good wives? Those who consider themselves educators believe that women should still receive special education, and household chores are indispensable compulsory subjects. Even more, someone loudly calls for women to quickly return to the family, and not to seek any economic equality at all. On the surface, these are all men oppressing women, but thinking carefully, are these simply because of men's brutality and unreasonableness?

Some people also think that the reason why the women's movement has no results should be attributed to women themselves not being ambitious, marrying husbands, and like having a backer, locking themselves in the home and no longer thinking about any equality and liberation. But in fact, many wise women are truly wronged. Except for women without knowledge who have not been educated, perhaps willingly degenerate and do not seek to improve themselves, there is no knowledgeable woman who does not hope that she can engage in social work like her husband and all men. It is just that the trivial matters of the family do not allow them to leave home even a step. Many mistresses grumble: "Can we be a scholar in the cradle? Can we experiment with analytical chemistry on the stove? Should we mend our daughter's long gown first, or read Shakespeare's masterpieces first?" It is so difficult to study on your own at home, can you say that they voluntarily do not want to go to the crossroads?

These observations are all superficial mistakes. If you pursue it further, why do men want to lock women in the family? Why do women voluntarily give up fighting for equality? You can find a very obvious common point, which is because there is a family; for the trivial housework, men are forced, or women voluntarily stay in the family. The thing that makes housework so complicated are those children. A family with children cannot do without a housewife who pays attention at all times. Without children at home, everything is simple.

Therefore, if women want to obtain liberation, they must first seek equal economic status. If they want to seek equal economic status, they must first settle the little baby. Solving the problem of settling the little baby, and the nursery is a dedicated and specialized childcare institution, which can also reduce many small incidents in terms of the child, but small-scale, aristocratic, private nurseries are limited to manpower and material resources. The conditions for operation are definitely not enough to establish universally. This requires wise politicians to understand the importance of the childcare system and use the power of the government to set up universal nurseries for the people!

Please don't be happy for your personal success, wives who have found a job! You are on the wrong path, and instead of saying it is success, it is better to say it is a failure; although it cannot be determined that every one of you uses servants, maids, and big sisters for all the housework, there must be many who do, in this way, it is just enslaving others to make yourself happy, can it not make people feel chilled about the liberation movement?

### The Fourth Scholarship Fund: Donations From All Walks of Life Are Increasing Daily; Living Costs Have Increased Sharply, and Student Expenses Have Doubled; Hoping That All Sectors Will Understand the Difficulties of the Poor and Provide Strong Assistance

Since the launch of the newspaper's fourth scholarship fund, inquiries from all walks of life have been received by letter and telegram yesterday in an endless stream. The details are recorded as follows:

Donations Can Be Notified by Telephone

Yesterday, donations were received from all sectors, totaling one thousand five hundred yuan. Among them, Hua Ji generously donated one thousand yuan, considering that it is difficult for poor students to study during this difficult time. (Detailed amounts are listed in the newspaper's social service section.) Considering that those who generously donate to scholarships may be too busy with public or private matters to come to the office in person, the newspaper has decided that, starting today, please notify the newspaper's scholarship staff of the amount of the donation at any time by telephone, and they will bring the official receipt to collect the money, in order to save you the trouble of trekking through the cold.

Applicants Should Come to the Office in Person

Since the newspaper published the announcement that scholarship applications would begin on the 15th, dozens of poor students from various schools have sent letters requesting registration forms every day. However, upon reviewing the application procedures, it is required to attach the previous semester's transcript or certificate of study. Simply requesting by letter is not serious enough. Therefore, students applying for scholarships should come to the office in person to receive the registration form and complete the registration in accordance with all the required procedures. All registration requests by letter will not be issued. Please pay attention to this.

### Rebuttal of the U.S. White Paper by Information Minister Hirota

The Japanese Embassy in this city invites the Chinese press corps of this city every Wednesday. Yesterday (the 13th) afternoon, it was held, and more than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. Information Minister Hirota, accompanied by Consul Fukama, attended on time. During the meeting, the Minister strictly refuted the exaggerated content of the white paper recently released by U.S. President Roosevelt. According to him, the white paper released by U.S. President Roosevelt this time includes the entire diplomatic situation of the United States for ten years from 1931 to 1941, and the conclusions are completely deceiving to the domestic people. To know that the formation of the Axis powers by Japan, Germany, and Italy is to build a true new world order, so the culprit for the outbreak of this war should be the United States and Britain who provoked it from the middle. This is very obvious proof. According to the content of the white paper, it is completely a dictatorial policy of Roosevelt, that is, a new doctrine of difficulty. We can estimate its original text, which is to expose the current situation of the United States as scattered and dreaming of gathering popular support to support this war. Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, the United States has suffered heavy losses in the major naval battles in the South Pacific, so it has created the atmosphere and made these pointless propaganda.

### Japanese Military Authorities Return Factories: Shenxin No. 7 and Eight Others, Ceremony Scheduled for Today

Allied News Agency, Shanghai: In order to promote the economic recovery of China, the Japanese military authorities have scheduled a ceremony in Shanghai today (Thursday) to return eight factories in Shanghai and Ningbo, such as Shenxin No. 7 Factory, to Chinese factory owners. To date, out of the 140 Chinese-owned factories managed by the Japanese military authorities, 104 have been returned. The remaining 36 will also be returned soon.

### Meeting of Japanese Consuls in Three Provinces Postponed

The meeting of Japanese consuls in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, presided over by Minister Tianjiri of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, was originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai on the 11th of this month. It was planned to closely coordinate the consular offices under the jurisdiction of the embassy and instruct the future administrative policies of the consular offices in various places, and to consult on matters such as upgrading the consular offices. Due to various procedures and related matters not being completed in time, it has been postponed for about ten days, and will be convened again.

### Municipal Party Headquarters and Others Convene Meeting: Strengthening Belief in Participation in the War

In order to awaken the public's understanding of the significance of participating in the war and strengthen their belief, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters has scheduled a citywide party affairs meeting on the 18th of this month. It is heard that the central authorities will also send personnel to provide guidance.

Mr. Chen Shaokui, director of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference's Central China headquarters, sent a respectful telegram to the chairman yesterday (the 13th) to express his sincere support for the National Government's policy of participating in the war.

The Global Overseas Chinese Federation held a conference yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the International Hotel to support the National Government's participation in the war to liberate overseas Chinese. A respectful telegram to the chairman was immediately decided upon.

### Clearance Area in Shanghai: Baojia Compilation Completed

The Shanghai Clearance Committee regards the Baojia system as the foundation of local autonomy and the main undertaking of the Clearance work. Therefore, after the start of the Shanghai Clearance, it immediately focused all its efforts on the compilation of Baojia and the investigation of household registration. Now the Baojia compilation and household registration investigation in each district have been fully completed separately. The Shanghai Clearance Committee's First Division has also strictly supervised and handled the registration of population changes and the management of new households. Therefore, petty thieves have disappeared in the Clearance area, and security has been established.

### The Self-Police Youth Department of Baojia Restates Its Purpose

Since the establishment of the Self-Police Youth Department of Baojia in the Shanghai Public Concession, there have been many misunderstandings about the purpose of the department from the outside world, thinking that the department is an agency for the Concession to collect Ding money. In fact, the purpose has already been explained clearly, which is to gather outstanding youth from the city, give them moral, intellectual, physical, and group training, and then serve the society. It is purely an intelligent mass organization. This kind of organization is very common in countries around the world, but it is still the first time in this city, and it is a pilot project. During the department's previous selection, there were more than one thousand five hundred youths who took the exam, but only six hundred were admitted. The existing members of the department are not enough to share the work, so it is scheduled to conduct another selection in the middle of this month.

### Welcoming Director Shinoki

The Sino-Japanese Business and Industry Association believes that Director Shinoki of the Bank of Japan's visit to various parts of our country to inspect the economic situation will make many contributions to the improvement of our country's economy. In order to express their welcome, they have specifically scheduled a welcome meeting for all directors at the Jinmen Hotel on the afternoon of the 15th of this month, and invited leaders from all financial and industrial circles to participate in the grand event.

### Louis Smoll Auction House Taken Over by Da Jiangnan Nanyang Company

Louis Smoll Auction and Notary Company was originally operated by a British person. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all British and American industries in China have become enemy property and have been taken over separately by the Japanese military authorities. Now Louis Smoll was also designated by the Japanese military authorities to be taken over and operated by Da Jiangnan Nanyang Company the other day, and to reorganize the internal affairs.

### Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament: Tongren Surprisingly Defeats Monocle; Xingren Leads the Pack in Recent Performance

The Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament was held at 7:00 PM last night (the 12th) at the YMCA gymnasium on Baxianqiao. In the Class A games, Tongren surprisingly defeated Monocle with a score of 25 to 24. Xingren also easily defeated the Italian Navy with a score of 41 to 10. Lianxing lost to the Giants with a score of 57 to 50. Currently, Xingren leads the pack with six wins in six games. Hong Team is second with six wins and one loss. Monocle unfortunately lost to Tongren yesterday, falling to third place. Next are Lianxing and Huanan, both with four wins and three losses. The Italian Navy has consistently been at the bottom. At the start of the contest, Monocle's Qian Na opened the scoring. Bo Tuo added icing on the cake and returned with credit. Tongren was slow to respond. In the first half, Monocle occupied an absolute advantage with a score of 14 to 3. In the second half, the situation changed dramatically. Monocle was negligent for a while, wasting opportunities. Tongren's Jiang Shuliang and Xuan Tong took advantage of the opportunity to counterattack, and they were indeed successful. The score rose rapidly. In the last two minutes, they reversed the defeat with a score of 25 to 24, thus laying the foundation for victory.

Dong was quick in his strikes, heavy in his punches, and exceptionally calm, so Ginsberg could not adopt an offensive strategy.

### Public Utility Stocks Are the Strongest; Hua Securities Stocks Already Have Buyers

Yesterday's Hua stock market situation was stable and firm. However, new and old investors were not as active as the previous day. Although there is a possibility of rising in the future, it is feared that there will be a slight roundabout for the time being. Hua Electric of the public utility industry once rose from 40 yuan to 41 yuan and 25 cents. At noon, it was one yuan, father rose 5 cents. Zhabei Water and Electricity was stagnant at around 60 yuan and 06 cents. China Bookstore of the cultural industry was between 160 yuan and 65 yuan, up 2 yuan and a half. Business Bookstore had a buy at 445 yuan. World Bookstore was 106 yuan and 7 yuan and a half, the price of entry and exit, and rose one yuan. The National Goods Company of the department store industry rose from 75 yuan to 7 yuan. At noon, it was 6 yuan, up 1 yuan and a half. Yong'an was difficult to sell at 130 yuan. Xinxin rose to 140 yuan, then fell back to 38 yuan, both slightly lower. Yong'an Yarn Factory of the textile industry rose to 340 yuan. Dasheng No. 1 Factory had transactions at 380 yuan.

The company was strongly pulling up. Hua Securities at 127 yuan and a half already had sellers. The rise and fall of other stocks were also small. Today's table is published in the newspaper.

### Government Bonds Are Trending Upward, Slowly Rising

The government bond market is gradually becoming firmer. One reason is that the silver roots of each gang have been leveled, and the Joint Reserve Association of Banks and the Joint Reserve Association of Money Shops have cooperated in lending government securities to fellow villagers, allowing a 30% discount. People's hearts have therefore changed from the previous turbulence to stability. Therefore, the goods that have been sold out gradually had buybacks, and the price rose slowly. Class C rose from 49 yuan and 20 cents to 50 yuan and 08 cents, and finally there were still 056 cents. Class A was 50 yuan with change. Class B was 9 yuan and 50 cents. Class D was 8 yuan and 12 cents. Class E was 8 yuan 50 cents to 70 cents. The trend and people's hearts have changed, and there is still a possibility of continuing to improve, at least returning to above 50 yuan.

### Grain Transactions Are Quiet

Bean Industry Applies for More Soybeans

Yesterday's grain market situation, beans and other types of products lacked transactions due to movement restrictions. Only bean cakes rose slightly from 12 yuan and a half to 92 yuan and 7 corners. Three cars of Fei-character bean cakes were priced at 92 yuan and a half to 93 yuan and 7 corners. 500 pieces of Changji bean cake were priced at 91 yuan and 7 corners.

Also, yesterday, the Grain Group began to distribute broad beans, selling them at 46 yuan and a half per dan (unit of weight), distributing more than 1,500 bags to retail stores throughout the city throughout the day.

Recently, in order to adjust people's food, the authorities have implemented a ban on the movement of food, resulting in the disappearance of black markets for soybeans and other products. The tofu industry in this city, because the Grain Group's distribution of goods is nowhere in sight, and the black market is cut off, is about to be forced to close down completely. Emergency meetings have been held for days, but there has been no proper solution. Yesterday, they sent letters to the Works Department's Materials Control Council and the Military Distribution Authority, listing the difficulties and requesting relief. It is said that there are 320 companies in the industry throughout the city. Each company needs at least 24 bags of beans, requiring approximately 7,680 bags per month, equivalent to 153,600 city pounds. But since September, the number received by the industry has been far from enough, then in the future, thousands of workers will be at risk of unemployment, and at the same time, it will also have a significant impact on the lives of civilians.

### Every Liang (Unit of Weight) of Gold Can Not Exceed 3,000 Yuan

Central News Agency, Shanghai: The authorities have set the price limit for gold at 3,000 yuan per liang and will strictly enforce it without exceeding it, and will send personnel to gold shops and Dasing Bank to closely monitor and absolutely prohibit price increases. The rise and fall of gold has a significant impact on the entire financial industry, and even all industries and all goods. The goldsmith industry and Dasing Bank had previously (the 12th) posted a price of 3,050 yuan per liang. After being found out by the authorities, they were immediately ordered to post a small price to settle the situation at the 3,000 yuan mark.

### Joint Banknotes Are Down Slightly by 2 Cents

Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate of the Money Shops Association was still posted at 1 point and 7 cents.

The Japanese military ticket rose to 5 yuan 5 corners and 5 cents 4 li (unit of currency) among fellow traders, and soon fell back to 13 li. Small money houses and bank outlets were priced at 5 yuan 5 corners and 4 and a half cents and 5 and a half cents for entry and exit. Joint banknote dealers sold at 3 yuan 7 corners and a half and collected at 3 yuan 7 corners, down slightly by 2 cents.

### Fujian Lu Sun Dried Bamboo Shoots Arrive More, Market Loosens

Fujian Lu sun dried bamboo shoots, recently due to more arrivals, market prices have repeatedly weakened. Yesterday, there was a batch of goods, the identity and quality were commendable, but the extra costs were high and the cost was not low, but the traders' asking price was harsh. Soon, the deal was pulled off at 1,160 yuan, and all the money was opened up, totaling more than 300 pieces.

### Hardware Market Is Quite Quiet; Few Industrial Raw Materials Are Traded

The hardware market is quite quiet due to the impact of sluggish sales in all directions. The biggest reason is that the varieties of hardware products in Shanghai are incomplete, and buyers have a sigh of wanting but not being able to get them. In addition, the visiting traders' sales are sluggish, and factories in this street and other places have limited sales of their products, so it is difficult to see enthusiasm in the collection of raw materials. Therefore, the entire market atmosphere is extraordinarily quiet, but the hearts of those holding goods are high and low. Due to sluggish transactions and tight silver roots, some are willing to sell at low prices, but some are reluctant to let go easily due to the idea that their inventory is weak. Therefore, it is difficult for the market to have a fixed standard. However, most still call for the limited price. It is also a fact that the varieties of each goods are lacking and it is difficult to search for them.

Industrial raw materials, with very thin inventory, transactions are quiet, and there is no official market. Slightly traded ones are priced at any time. The market prices are listed on the left:

Moon Brand Small Baking Soda 50 Buckets 1,200 yuan

Kilogram Bag 1,200 yuan

East Goods Bleaching Powder Essence 3,600 yuan

Italy's Ideng You Club 4,000 yuan

American Bleaching Powder Pound 17 yuan

Tung Oil Dan (unit of weight) 2,500 yuan

Butter Dan 2,400 yuan

Belgian White Oil Pound 23 yuan

M Rosin Bucket Dan 950 yuan

This Bucket 880 yuan

Mobil Van Huang Pound 9 yuan and 5 corners

Shilin White Pound 24 yuan

Borax Bag 1,600 yuan

Callery Resin Ton 3,200 yuan

(Note) The club is equal to one hundred and twelve pounds

### Ri Xin Tai Did Not Purchase Red or Green Tea Stalks

We have received a letter from the Ri Xin Tai Tea Company stating: "We recently read in the thirteenth-day commercial news of your newspaper that Ri Xin Tai Tea Company purchased four loads of green tea stalks from Tong Feng Tea Firm at a price of two hundred yuan per load, and also purchased five boxes of black tea at a price of five hundred and seventy yuan per load. This is inconsistent with the facts. Our company has not purchased any recently. We believe this is a misunderstanding of information. We hope you will correct this."

### Strengthening the Transportation Capacity of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere: Java Builds Large Wooden Ships

The first Japanese wooden ship, bearing the important task of exchanging materials within the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere, has recently appeared as a New Year's gift, adding new power to the transportation fleet.

For the purpose of establishing a self-sufficiency policy in shipbuilding, the Japanese military administration has focused on the inexhaustible forest resources of the island and has long been carrying out plans to build large wooden ships. Recently, the hull of one of these ships has been completed. A grand launching ceremony was held at the 〇〇 shipyard, attended by Military Administrator Okazaki and other relevant officials. In the past, Java had only built small ships for coastal use, with a capacity of only twenty or thirty tons, and at most one hundred tons. The large ship built this time is truly the first of its kind in Java and is worthy of attention.

The entire hull is made of Malit wood, which is highly water-resistant, has strong durability, and excellent wave-piercing performance. Its performance is no less than that of ordinary steamers, and it is truly an absolutely excellent wooden ship unparalleled in the world.

The keel of the ship was laid on October 20th of last year, and it was launched in just seventy days. This was the result of the unyielding efforts of the Japanese guidance team under the command of factory director Zao Teng during construction, and the tireless cooperation of the Malay shipwrights who were aware of the great principles of co-prosperity. Such a shipbuilding speed can be said to be record-breaking, even compared to well-equipped shipyards in mainland Japan. The ship is currently being decorated and is scheduled to make its solemn maiden voyage in early February. In the future, the second and third ships will be built successively and will sail between the southern islands and the mainland as trade ships in the south, becoming the main artery connecting the island nations of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Moreover, it will travel far across the ocean to transport the special products of the South to mainland Japan, so its future activity is highly anticipated.

### Reminded of Su Qin

— Jia Xinsheng

Both the "Intrigues of the Warring States" and the "Records of the Grand Historian" contain accounts of Su Qin. Although the wording differs slightly, the content is similar.

When Su Qin presented his ten proposals to the King of Qin, but they were not adopted, and he returned home in disgrace, the "Intrigues of the Warring States" describes it this way:

"...worn-out shoes, carrying books and a bag, his appearance withered, his face dark, and his expression ashamed. When he returned home, his wife did not come down from her loom, his sister-in-law did not cook for him, and his parents did not speak to him. Su Qin sighed and said, 'My wife does not regard me as her husband, my sister-in-law does not regard me as her brother-in-law, and my parents do not regard me as their son. This is all the fault of Qin!'"

Later, Su Qin studied hard, persuaded the King of Zhao with his great merit, and received the seal of the prime minister, becoming greatly successful. The "Intrigues of the Warring States" describes it this way:

"...When he was about to persuade the King of Chu, he passed through Luoyang. His parents heard of it, cleared the palace, cleaned the road, set up music and drinks, and welcomed him thirty li outside the city. His wife glanced at him sideways and listened intently. His sister-in-law crawled on her hands and knees, kowtowed four times, and apologized on her knees. Su Qin said, 'Why were you so arrogant before and so respectful now?' His sister-in-law said, 'Because of your honorable position and great wealth.' Su Qin said, 'Alas! In poor families, parents do not regard their sons as sons, but in rich and noble families, relatives are afraid and respectful. In this world, can power, position, and wealth be ignored?'"

Su Qin's character has long been determined in history, and we need not overturn it. We find these two passages to be wonderfully contrasted: Sima Qian, seeing such wonderful writing in the "Intrigues of the Warring States," certainly would not let it go lightly, using it to vent his grievances and express his dissatisfaction. The author of the "Intrigues of the Warring States" can also be said to be using the subject to develop his own ideas, expressing his own feelings with vivid details. Furthermore, the reason why this passage can be recited to this day, and why everyone can "feel something in their hearts" and "applaud with admiration" after reading it, is because our society and human nature are not so different from Su Qin's time!

General people who are concerned about the world often lament, saying that "people's hearts are not as they used to be." Su Qin and his wife and sister-in-law can certainly be considered people of the past. However, these ancient hearts are not necessarily much wiser than those of today!

Su Qin and his wife and sister-in-law's bodies have long since decayed. However, people of this type continue to exist in every generation. Therefore, "who says that people of ancient and modern times are not related to each other?"

### Thoughts After Seeing "The Man of Lu"

— Mangci

Zeng Mengpu's "The Man of Lu" is a romance novel of joys and sorrows that was popular in the early years of the Republic of China, but reading it today, one cannot help but laugh at its childishness and staleness. The advertisement praises it as "comparable to 'Dream of the Red Chamber' and far superior to 'Romance of the West Chamber.'" This is why the advertisement is an advertisement. Many characters in "Dream of the Red Chamber" are still vivid in our minds, but who remembers "The Man of Lu" now? Mr. Luo Ming said in the preface: "The Man of Lu has made the deepest impression on me. Sometimes I feel like I am the Man of Lu." I am afraid that only Mr. Luo Ming would say such a thing now! Indeed, "The Man of Lu" once broke publishing records at the time. If we judge its merits based on the number of copies sold, we might as well say that it is a "masterpiece." But if "The Man of Lu" has the value of being adapted for performance, then "Guangling Tide," "Nineteen Turtle"... etc., could also be adapted for performance, right?

As mentioned above, "The Man of Lu" is a so-called "new novel" in the early years of the Republic of China, which was a "small-footed enlargement" of Western European new literature. Unexpectedly, Mr. Luo Ming is 100% "faithful" to the original, preserving the original dialogues, characters, and plots... intact. If this decision to perform it still has any value, it is to treat it as a cute photo of our childhood and laugh at it. The dialogues are completely in the style of "laughing on stage." Phrases like "My beloved brother!" and "My good sister!" are considered interesting when they are actually disgusting.

From the standpoint of strict modern drama, "The Man of Lu" lacks foreshadowing and climax in terms of drama. In the beginning, it focuses on the Man of Lu, but later the Man of Lu is not mentioned, and the focus shifts to the "secondary theme" of Sun Jinglu. That is to say, the "main theme" and the "secondary theme" do not develop in an intertwined manner, and the beginning and end cannot echo each other. The plot is plain and simple, completely in the style of narrating a story. Even the story is narrated clumsily. To illustrate this, in the second scene of the second act, the Man of Lu lies in a pavilion after being heartbroken and dreams. The lights go out, and it turns into a gloomy underworld. The judge asks him why he is so heartless. He cries out for justice. At the crucial moment, the lights go out again, and it returns to the original pavilion. The Man of Lu is still crying out for justice. There is no audience member who does not laugh at this point. What kind of play is this? In addition, the Man of Lu falls and bleeds from his face, Zhu Xiaoxiong is bitten by a poisonous snake while climbing a tree... The jokes are endless. In any art, the key is to "touch lightly and strike heavily," but after reading Mr. Luo Ming's work, it makes people feel that the playwright is exerting all his strength, but the audience is still "completely confused."

Speaking of the director, many scenes adopt the "two-two exchange system" (pardon my invention of this term). This means that two actors stand in the center of the stage, one on the left and one on the right. After standing for too long, the one on the right switches to the left, and the one on the left switches to the right. That's all.

As for acting, Sun Jinglu is still worth seeing, and the scene at the end of her life is the most moving. The cold mountain's Man of Lu is dull and stupid, with no handsome scholar's air. Wu Jingping is fairly competent. Li Li's recitation of lines is always her consistent mournful tone, with little variation. Ma Xiaonong, Shamo, and Fei Yin all have actions that are too modern and do not harmonize with the script. Wu Chunzhen's performances always give people something to laugh about. Her speech is already strange, and sometimes she adds twitches of her nose and distortions of her mouth, which does not seem very elegant.

### Starting from "With Eyes and Without Eyes"

— Shield

"With Eyes and Without Eyes." This is a so-called "fairy tale," that is, a small book written specifically for children to read. More than thirty years ago, Mr. Sun Yuxiu of Wuxi translated it into Chinese and published it in Shanghai. He introduced Western fairy tales not because he still had a childlike heart, but because he saw that this kind of work was really needed. He translated twenty-three kinds of fairy tales, among which there were about seven or eight kinds belonging to the "With Eyes and Without Eyes" category. It is said that the most popular and well-received ones were still fantasy fairy tales such as "Little Thumb" and "The Country Without Cats."

This matter does not seem strange, but it can also be exaggerated a bit, saying that it can "reveal a major significance," such as tracing its source to "the Chinese people's lack of scientific minds." Because the little book "With Eyes and Without Eyes" is a reading material with common sense of natural science as its content. I don't believe the saying that "the Chinese people lack scientific minds." Didn't many basic principles of science first come from China? However, "China lacks scientific education" is a fact.

Gentlemen who like to read "fairy tale literature" will not think highly of "With Eyes and Without Eyes." Because this is not a work by Andersen or the Brothers Grimm. But it seems that we should not have this prejudice. Although child psychologists explain the development of child psychology from a scientific standpoint, it must first go through the "barbaric stage" and the "primitive human stage." However, if we think that we must tell ghost stories because of this! It is necessary for the Nine Heavens Fairy to marry a winter melon in order to satisfy the curiosity and fantasy desires of the little savage children. That may not seem to be in line with science. There are indeed many bizarre and fantastic things in the oral literature of every nation, and they have always been used as the initial "spiritual food" for young children. However, it seems that they should also be regarded as "the remnants of barbarism" and given the epithet "not in line with educational principles."

These words may be shooting arrows at random, because at present we don't even seem to have "Little Thumb" and "The Country Without Cats." Children here start to ________ their parents as soon as their teeth grow, however, precisely because of this, a good garden has been left for people who care about children's reading to try their hand.

"With Eyes and Without Eyes" should also be classified into the outdated team today! Although the method of this small book is correct, and it was an early predecessor of this type of children's reading education, it is inevitable that the material will be a bit outdated. Because in the past eighty years, the progress of biology has already made some rather historical theories of botany and zoology have to be revised. In particular, the great contribution of the Curies has caused all departments of natural science to raise new questions and add new "hypotheses." Therefore, what was "with eyes" in the past may now be "without eyes." It may not be a pity that it does not remain in the book forest. Fortunately, there are new eyes; even bigger eyes, are already near us.

At this time of great difficulties, it can be said to be pedantic to talk about this "non-urgent matter," but we believe that scientific knowledge is the most basic of all knowledge, especially for children. (Remuneration transferred to poverty relief fund)

### The Model Teacher of All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin

She first liked him because he was so attentive and wanted to know everything, because he had a gentle and quiet demeanor, because his views came from so far away, far away from the absolutely impossible seventies, eighties, and even further - but all this did not count, he was so honest; and because - because his eyes were brown, and his face was moving when he smiled. "Of course, I'm also going to call you Chips," she said, knowing that this was his nickname at school.

Within a week, they had completely fallen in love; before Chips was able to walk without a cane, they thought they were engaged; a week before the fall term began, they were married in London.

(5)

Chips dreamed for hours and hours in Mrs. Wiggat's house, recalling those days, at which time he would always look down at his feet, not quite sure which foot had done him such an extraordinary service. This was the small cause of many major accidents, and he could not remember all the details. But he saw again the overlapping peaks of Great Gable (from which he had never visited the Lake District again), the mouse-grey depths of Wastwater beneath the Screes; he could smell again the washed-out air after the heavy rain, and follow the edge of the mountain path again to Sty Head. That dizzyingly happy time, the evening walks by the water, her clear voice and joyful laughter, were so clearly etched in his mind. She really was, often was, a very happy person.

They both planned their future life together so enthusiastically; but he could not help but take this matter somewhat seriously, even with some fear. Of course, it was very good for her to come to Brookfield; the other housemasters were already married. She had also told him that she liked children and would live a good life among them. "Oh, Chips, you are just the way you are, I am so glad. I was afraid you were a lawyer, or a stockbroker, or a dentist, or a businessman with a huge cotton business in Manchester. That's what I mean when I first decided to meet you. School teachers are very different, very important, don't you think, those children are growing up, and are related to the world, and now they have to be guided..." (11)

### Art Scene

— Lilai

After the Jin Cheng Grand Theater was converted to perform Peking Opera, the Jin Du Grand Theater will also be converted to perform spoken drama. The "Golden Voice" Zhou Xuan, who has been in retirement for a long time, will also meet us on stage.

Li Pingqian's new work "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring" is said to be an adaptation of Bette Davis's "The Old Maid" and will be staged during the lunar New Year.

Shangguan Yunzhu, Han Fei, He Bin and others from the Shanghai Film Artists Troupe have toured North China and Northeast China. According to He Bin's letter to friends in Shanghai, they may return to Shanghai in the spring.

Ding Zhilu and Shan once left "Shanghai Art" and there was news that Shan had joined China United Film Company. Now it is known that both of them have returned.

In Tong Zhiling's "Spinning Cotton," there is a spoken drama performance at the end. A cry of "Oh my god" sounds exactly like Tang Ruoqing's tone. I don't know who designed it.

Li Jianwu's "Clouds of Xia" has been adapted into a movie, starring Wang Xichun, and renamed "A Generation of Famous Actresses."

The knowledgeable young amateur actor Chen Da　 traveled from Shanghai to Peiping last month and was warmly received by celebrities and amateur actors in the old capital. Mr. Chen's conversation is elegant and he has the true nature of a scholar. Also, the famous Pingju critic Fan Shiren has also arrived in Peiping.

### Speedily Relief for Refugees

— Chun Gao

The weather has been so cold lately, and things are so expensive. The temperature has dropped below freezing point, and water freezes as soon as it drips. The poor people on the streets are suffering from hunger and cold, especially the poor children who have frozen to death. How pitiful this is! Now I am giving the five jiao from the scholarship I received from Gu Bo Primary School last semester, and I have asked my father to give me four yuan and five jiao, for a total of five yuan, and sending it to your newspaper's poverty relief fund. I hope everyone will donate generously with compassion and quickly relieve those compatriots who are hungry and waiting for food.
