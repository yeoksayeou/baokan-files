### "Second Pearl Harbor"! New Developments in the East Asian War Situation

Amidst the establishment of the new Sino-Japanese alliance and the enthusiastic progress of the Greater East Asia Conference, news of a major international victory has emerged from the South Pacific: the first and second great victories in the air and sea battles of Bougainville Island! The German side has dubbed it the "Second Pearl Harbor," indicating that its significant impact on the global war situation is no coincidence.

The victory in the air and sea battles of Bougainville Island is still unfolding, but based solely on the current reports of victory, the impact of these two battles on the overall war situation in East Asia is already very clear. In summary, its significance lies in the following three points:

First, the two major victories directly demonstrate the fragility and bleak future of the Anglo-American so-called "Great Pacific Counteroffensive." Since the Italian incident and the shift in the German-Soviet war, some people around the world have felt confused about the war situation. During this time, Anglo-American propaganda machines have become even more agitated, even shouting about the so-called "Great Pacific Counteroffensive." Their naval and air forces have also been eager to show off, launching a so-called "island-hopping" "counteroffensive" in the Solomon Islands area. Simultaneously, with the establishment of the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters as the center, they have actively promoted the so-called "recapture of Burma" war preparations. However, now, in the Bougainville Island air and sea battle, considering only the second battle results, the Japanese naval air force, in a short period of fourteen days, has already sunk and damaged 33 enemy ships, destroyed 22 to 23 ships, and caused approximately 2,000 casualties among the crew of enemy aircraft carriers, approximately 800 on heavy cruisers, and approximately 1,400 on cruisers, totaling over 7,900 casualties among destroyers and other personnel. This is the largest victory since the Pearl Harbor attack and deals a severe blow to the Anglo-American dream of a Pacific counteroffensive.

Secondly, it further proves the strength of the Japanese naval and air forces' fighting power and Japan's consistent dominance in the Greater East Asia War. As Admiral Minei of the Japanese Navy said, "The magnitude of this victory is almost unbelievable, and one can only marvel at the power of the Imperial Navy." Japanese air force warriors, disregarding their depleted fuel, are determined to reduce the enemy and do not expect to return alive. This "willingness to die" fighting spirit is truly a guarantee of victory in the Greater East Asia War.

Thirdly, the great victory on Bougainville Island cannot be observed separately from the war situation on the Burmese-Yunnan border. Before this battle, the Anglo-American side did their best to promote a counteroffensive in Burma and the use of Chinese bases to bomb Japan. However, in the Nu River battle in southern Yunnan, the battles on the Zhejiang-Anhui border, and so on, which one did not fully demonstrate the fighting spirit of the Japanese army? In which one could one see the Anglo-American forces giving substantial assistance to Chongqing? And in which one did one see the Anglo-American air force assisting the Chongqing army in resisting the Japanese army's attacks? Just like the Bougainville Island air and sea battle, the Anglo-Americans either skillfully avoid or retreat in the land and air battlefields!

The "Second Pearl Harbor" battle is still unfolding victoriously, but it has already established immortal achievements and determined the victorious future of the entire East Asian war situation. Its worthiness of universal admiration is beyond question. Today's question is how should the people in the rear of the Greater East Asia region repay the hard work of the soldiers on the front lines through their own efforts in their respective positions!

### Summoning the Chief of Naval General Staff: The Japanese Emperor Bestows an Imperial Rescript; Prime Minister Tojo Sends a Telegram Congratulating Commander Koga

Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 11:30 AM on the 11th: His Imperial Majesty the Emperor summoned the Chief of the Naval General Staff today and bestowed the following Imperial Rescript upon the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet: The Combined Fleet's carrier-based air force has fought bravely in the Solomon Sea battle, destroying the enemy fleet. I deeply commend them. However, the war situation in that area is still developing, and you should strive even harder to live up to My trust.

Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Tojo sent the following congratulatory telegram on the 10th to Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Koga and other related fleet commanders: Since the enemy troops landed on Mono Island, our army has won consecutive victories and achieved unprecedented great victories in the first and second air battles over Bougainville Island, which is truly commendable. Hereby, I sincerely express my gratitude to the naval forces for their good planning and brave fighting, and I pay my respects to the many heroic spirits who protect the country. Now, the entire nation is working together to enhance military strength, with the front and rear lines forming a united whole, and the determination to strive for final victory is becoming increasingly firm. Hereby, I wish you great success in this battle and pray for the continued good fortune of you and all the soldiers.

Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) – Neutral countries have not denied, and the enemy countries have acknowledged, the accuracy of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement of war results. The Asahi Shimbun here commented on this point, saying: Japanese soldiers are not merely lively by shouting military songs. Even students at the Naval Academy must undergo rigorous guidance in singing a military song to ensure accuracy. There is absolutely no concept of carelessness or falsehood in the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy. Regarding the word "accuracy," general naval academy students receive thorough training. A difference of half a second can be the dividing point between whether a torpedo hits an enemy ship. Therefore, one must cultivate the spirit of paying attention to accuracy at all times. There is a world of difference between merely subjective accuracy and true (objective) accuracy. The above is the main reason why the Japanese Navy is not careless even when singing. The fact that the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcements possess unparalleled accuracy in the world is also not without reason. The so-called sunken enemy ships are limited to eyewitness accounts. When Japanese soldiers return to base after a battle, drivers and others hold a consultation similar to a confirmation battle. They first begin by investigating how many rounds hit the enemy ship, and then a majority of eyewitnesses report the enemy ship's sinking situation. After the two match, it is determined to be a sinking. If two torpedoes hit the enemy ship, it will mostly sink. If they do not witness the enemy ship sinking, they announce that it is heavily damaged. If there are reports of seeing the enemy ship tilting and shaking, they consider it lightly damaged. In the past, there have been repeated supplementary announcements of naval war results. This is because, when pilots who have not returned take photos of the enemy ship sinking upon returning to base, they confirm that enemy ships that were heavily or lightly damaged have been sunk. All of the above are sufficient to indicate the praiseworthy accuracy of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcements.

### Japanese Aircraft Collides with Enemy Ships: Demonstrates the Spirit of Self-Sacrifice; Lieutenant General Sato Ichiro Issues a Statement

Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) – The lofty spirit of Japanese aircraft colliding with enemy ships is truly admirable. This spirit is not caused by philosophy or ethics but is the spirit of self-sacrifice to fight to the end and strike the enemy for the sake of His Majesty the Emperor. Following Lieutenants Kiyomiya and Notomi, three company commanders also self-sacrificed in the second air battle over Bougainville Island. Lieutenant General Sato Ichiro of the Japanese Navy recently issued a statement on the spirit of commanders taking the lead in colliding with enemy aircraft, the gist of which is: It would be completely wrong for our citizens to think that soldiers treat their lives as light as a feather, are not afraid of death, and sacrifice themselves arbitrarily. Soldiers pay the most attention to their lives. How can they easily sacrifice themselves to serve His Imperial Majesty? If it is to repay the country, they will always go forward bravely and never shrink back. Self-sacrifice is the same. To consistently complete the task, self-sacrifice is the best means. I have already witnessed the Pearl Harbor attack, and American newspaper reporters reported: I personally saw the unique self-sacrifice of Japanese naval aircraft. Their skillful maneuvering, with aircraft already surrounded by flames, colliding with their targets is by no means a haphazard rush. It is truly a manifestation of fighting spirit. During the South Pacific naval battle last year, one of our reconnaissance aircraft once guided a naval air squadron sortie to attack the enemy fleet. The reconnaissance aircraft once returned to base but then resolutely turned its nose around and took the lead before the attack force departed. Although it knew that there was insufficient fuel and could not return again, it disregarded its own life and death because it realized that it was most difficult to discover the enemy fleet at sea and that a slightly delayed opportunity to discover it would mean losing the chance to attack. At all times, the commander of the reconnaissance aircraft had already decided to self-sacrifice. A certain officer who came from a preparatory student background had long had the ambition to self-sacrifice, and now he paid his courage with battle through self-sacrifice and never returned. Also, a certain petty officer was hit by enemy bullets and flew around a formation of friendly troops for a week, saying goodbye, and then flew to an enemy ship and self-sacrificed. Some make sudden decisions, and some have decided to self-sacrifice long ago. There is no textbook on "self-sacrifice" or books explaining the method of self-sacrifice. There are only the records left by predecessors. The self-sacrifice of Lieutenants Kiyomiya and Notomi and the three company commanders is "living teaching material." If the commander's aircraft takes the lead in colliding with enemy ships, there is no reason for subordinates to retreat. This is not a battle method taught by school instructors but is the result of following predecessors and combat research.

### Japanese Aircraft Attacks Eastern India

Lisbon, November 11th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from New Delhi: Indian military authorities announced on the 10th that Japanese bombers bombed a British air force base near the eastern border of India on the 9th. The base suffered considerable damage, and there were casualties.

### US Navy Announces Loss of Three Destroyers

Berlin, November 11th (Central News Agency) – Washington: After a long period of time, the US Navy announced yesterday the loss of three returned loan destroyers. The USS Henley and USS Saufley are the newest types. The former has a displacement of 1,500 tons and a speed of 40 miles per hour. It is equipped with four 12.7 cm guns and other light armaments, as well as sixteen torpedo tubes. It was built in 1936-37. The USS Saufley was also built during the war and belongs to the large destroyer class. It has a displacement of 2,100 tons and is equipped with eight 12.7 cm guns. This destroyer has very complete water supply equipment, but the official communique did not reveal it. The above two ships both sank in the waters near the Solomon Islands, but the third ship, the USS Boris (1,190 tons), sank in the Atlantic Ocean. It was built in 1918. This ship is less important, so it only sailed in the Atlantic Ocean. According to the Ottawa Agreement, the British are responsible for protecting the North Atlantic convoys, so the USS Boris must have sunk in the South Atlantic. The official report claims that the sinking was not due to enemy attacks, which is difficult to believe. It further states that crew members and sailors were sacrificed, which is contradictory, so there may be other reasons for its sinking.

### Japanese Aircraft Launch Large-Scale Surprise Attack on Laohokou Airfield

Nanjing, November 11th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in Central China, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing Air Force have joined forces to reverse the declining trend and are working hard to strengthen bases near peaceful areas, attempting to launch a counteroffensive against the Japanese army in China. The Japanese Air Force, aware of their intentions, launched a large-scale surprise attack on the enemy base at Laohokou Airfield (170 kilometers north of Yichang) with a large formation on the morning of the 10th, destroying and setting fire to three places of the airfield's taxiway military facilities and completely destroying an oil storage depot.

Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army base in Central China, a unit of the Japanese army, in coordination with the Japanese army in the area of Hekou, Xin Wei Temple, and Xiangzi Creek, forced the Chongqing Provisional 6th Division north of Nuanshui Street, and has advanced to the west of Chixi River (27 kilometers northwest of Nuanshui Street). On the evening of the 9th, the Chongqing Provisional 6th Division attempted a counterattack, but the Japanese army repelled them head-on and completely cut off their retreat, destroying their counterattack attempt everywhere. Japanese army aircraft also strafed and bombed the Chongqing army in that area on the night of the 9th and the morning of the 10th.

Hankou, November 11th (Central News Agency) – A large formation of Japanese bombers attacked Changyang (20 kilometers southwest of Yidu), the base of the Chongqing 13th Division, at 1:40 AM on the 10th, destroying military facilities in the area and bombing and strafing the Chongqing army of the 13th and 30th Divisions nearby.

Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army in Central China, the Japanese army air force has been very active in the Sixth War Zone of the Chongqing army recently, achieving considerable battle results. The following is a brief account of its activities: A large formation of Japanese aircraft, in order to annihilate the Chongqing army of the 79th Army, 194th Army, 98th Division, and Provisional 6th Division, etc., under Sun Shuzhong, which was being pursued by the Japanese army into Bashan, discovered the main force of the Chongqing army fleeing along the river in a certain area and immediately bombed it, making low-altitude flights and using machine guns to strafe it. The Japanese army's dive bomber squadron discovered the 86th Army and 10th Army of Wu Qiwu's Jiangfang Army, which were attempting to prevent the Japanese army's advance, in a mountain gorge in a certain area and bombed and strafed them before all aircraft returned safely.

The British Empire must devote all its efforts to the war.

Guangzhou, November 11th (Central News Agency) – The Anti-Axis Forces' attempt to counterattack Burma has had its momentum thwarted due to the Japanese army first launching an attack in Yunnan. The enemy forces on the Indian-Burmese border are currently holding their ground. The commander of the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces, Lord Louis Mountbatten, has been in office for over a month, but the deployment and combat training of the new headquarters do not seem to be complete yet. According to a British news broadcast from Chongqing, the Anti-Axis Forces still have many problems to solve before they can begin their counterattack, and transportation difficulties are the biggest obstacle. The gist of the news is: The biggest difficulty in the plan to counterattack Burma is the smooth flow of the rear supply lines. These supply lines must cross overlapping mountains, treacherous rivers, and penetrate dense forests before they can be opened.

### National Father's Birthday Memorial Ceremony Held by Central Authorities; Mausoleum Opened for Public Viewing

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) – Today (the 12th) is the National Father's Birthday Memorial Day. On the occasion of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration, the unfulfilled aspirations of the National Father’s forty years of dedication to the National Revolution – the abolition of unequal treaties and the pursuit of China's freedom and equality – are now all realized. Its significance is undoubtedly great. To comfort the spirit of the National Father in heaven, the central authorities have specially decided to solemnly hold a grand ceremony in front of the National Father’s Mausoleum at 10:00 AM today to commemorate the realization of the National Father’s aspirations. Central political committee members and specialized committee members, civil and military officials above the rank of Jianren (appointed by the national government) from various ministries and departments under the National Government, central executive and supervisory committee members, and central party headquarters personnel above the rank of division chief will all reverently visit the National Father’s Mausoleum to pay their respects, to show their comfort, and to express their sincere respect.

Furthermore, when the central authorities hold the memorial ceremony in front of the National Father’s Mausoleum this morning, it will be broadcast nationwide by radio.

### German Troops on the Kiev Front Adopt Elastic Defense; Soviet Encirclement Plan Fails

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports: The fighting in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River is intensifying, with the Soviets expanding the gap in Kiev with heavy forces and launching continuous fierce attacks. The main principle of the German army's actions is still to preserve its strength and adopt an elastic strategy, and to prevent a breakthrough. Therefore, the German army withdrew from the Kiev-Korosten highway and the Mala Goroshki and other areas the day before yesterday in order to use useful mobile units to deal with the enemy forces advancing southwest of Kiev. When the enemy tank corps was making a wedge-shaped advance in the area the day before yesterday, it was counterattacked by the German army, which attacked its flanks, and cut off the connection between the enemy's vanguard and the villages that had been captured. A major tank battle is in progress.

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports: Both the German and Soviet command headquarters are reinforcing the Kiev area with troops. Fierce battles are in progress northwest, west, and southwest of the city. South of Kiev, the fighting is gradually moving further south. The Dnieper River bend south of Pereyaslav is now included in the Kiev battle zone. The Soviet army is attempting to weaken the German forces in the Kiev area, so it launched a new offensive westward and westward in the Dnieper River bend, but it was blocked by the German army. German military observers said that the fighting in the Kiev area will continue. In the opinion of the Germans, the Soviet army's plan to encircle the German army on a large scale cannot be realized. The original intention of the Soviet army was that one pincers of the Soviet army would move from Kiev, and another pincers would move from the northwest area of ​​Krivoy Rog further south. The German army realized the Soviet army's plot and withdrew its troops and counterattacked north of Krivoy Rog. This counterattack prevented the southern pincers from moving and caused its entire encirclement plan to fail. Since the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive on July 5, the Soviet army has never achieved the goal of encircling the German army in a pocket, while the German army has often been successful in previous operations. Regarding the future development of the war, the German army is able to prevent the Soviet army from sweeping through the front line, and the Soviet army's encirclement plan has completely failed.

### The White House Convenes Another Meeting of Military Leaders; A Prelude to the Roosevelt-Churchill Meeting

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) – According to Washington news, preparations for the meeting of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin seem to be progressing. President Roosevelt recently held consultations with his military advisor General Marshall, Admiral Nimitz, and Navy Secretary Knox, among others. It is said that this move is a prelude to the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting.

A Sketch of the Terrain of Crimea

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports: The northern end of the Crimean Peninsula is now the site of the most intense fighting. There are three connections between the peninsula and the mainland, the most important of which is the Perekop Isthmus. The other two are the Arabat Spit, located on the Sea of ​​Azov, about one hundred kilometers long, extending near Genichesk, connecting the Kerch Peninsula with the southern Russian plains. Not far to the west, near Salvo, there is another isthmus about one kilometer wide, through which the railway to Melitopol passes. The Soviet army launched fierce attacks on these two narrow connections but failed, and now only artillery bombardment is being carried out. Between the isthmus near Salvo and the Perekop Isthmus, there is the so-called Sivash, also known as the Rotten Sea (Rottensen), with a water depth of only one to two meters, turbid like a quagmire, almost fordable, hence the name. After the Soviet army failed to attack the German lines near Perekop on November 1, it planned to cross the Rotten Sea to outflank the German army, but it also failed. Therefore, the center of the war has now shifted to the Perekop Isthmus.

### America's Rejection of East Asians

— Ai Ming

A New Play in America

According to recent reports from Washington, the United States is staging another wonderful play to please Chongqing. That is to revise the famous immigration law that excludes Orientals, and exceptionally allow Chinese from Chongqing to enter the country. This is another means of Uncle Sam flattering Chiang Kai-shek. Among Americans, voices expressing dissatisfaction with the exclusion of Chinese have recently become louder. They seem to genuinely have this view. This immigration law, implemented in 1924, stipulates that all East Asian peoples are always treated as inferior races and do not receive the same treatment as European peoples. Do ordinary Americans clearly know this? Why should the Chinese and Japanese nations with long traditions and high cultures be regarded as inferior races and excluded? The United States refuses to treat the people of China, Japan, and other Asian countries the same as Europeans, Czechs, Slavs, Poles, Lithuanians, and other ethnic groups.

Racial Prejudice

Racial prejudice is a major cause of international discord and a direct motive for war. The United States, which touts humanitarianism, deliberately insults the East Asian peoples, who have a strong sense of self-respect, by treating them as inferior races. The United States openly declares in this war that it is fighting to save these East Asian peoples. Isn't that a contradiction? American-style morality may allow this hypocrisy, but from an Eastern perspective, that is an absolutely impermissible contradiction. So what is the real motivation for excluding East Asian races? There is no real reason for the immigration problem. Because even if this exclusion law is not applied, the number of immigrants entering the country from China and Japan each year does not exceed one hundred. The reason for excluding East Asians naturally lies elsewhere. We can assert that it is simply from the standpoint of racial prejudice that East Asians are excluded for the sake of exclusion.

Since the implementation of this bad law and the continuation of the exclusion law, in recent years, it has greatly hindered the national relations between Japan and the United States. Americans, who are very clear about the issue of rights and obligations, have closed the doors of their country to East Asians, so East Asians naturally also have the right to close Americans out of East Asia. This point cannot be refuted by anyone.

The Motive for War

The motive for the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can really be attributed to the exclusion of Orientals by the British and Americans. Because the United States and other countries in the New World refused to allow Orientals to enter, as a result, East Asians had no other way to survive except to maintain their survival and development in their own territories, that is, within the East Asian region.

Let's look at the declaration of the Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo on the 5th:

The Greater East Asian nations will jointly ensure the stability of Greater East Asia, build an order of coexistence and co-prosperity based on morality.

The Greater East Asian nations will mutually respect their autonomy and independence, strive for mutual assistance and friendship, and establish the harmony of Greater East Asia.

The Greater East Asian nations will mutually respect their traditions, develop the creativity of each nation, and promote the harmony of Greater East Asia.

The Greater East Asian nations will closely cooperate on the basis of reciprocity to promote their economic development and enhance the prosperity of Greater East Asia.

The Greater East Asian nations will enhance friendship with neighboring countries, abolish racial discrimination, universally communicate culture, further open up resources, and contribute to the development of the world.

This declaration does not want to exclude Americans from the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. We only want to preserve the East Asian region for East Asians. Although it is already too late, the United States has also realized the unfairness of its exclusion law and is now trying to revise it. We are very interested in its developments and are watching closely. However, according to detailed reports from Washington, the United States does not want to completely revise this exclusion law, but only set an exception for Chinese from Chongqing. That is to say, it does not want to make any changes to the fundamental spirit of excluding East Asians.

In other words, the United States only wants to please Chongqing and use this important issue. Its purpose is not justice but interests. If the United States truly feels that it is wrong and wants to correct its past mistakes, why only abolish this restriction for Chinese from Chongqing?

Amendment Fails

What about the Japanese? Needless to say, Japan and the United States are at war. But this state and that restriction are another matter. Temporary phenomena cannot be confused with the eternal race issue. If Americans want to revise it in this spirit, then the failure of their amendment is obvious. It is already fortunate if it does not cause greater emotional division. I am afraid that Chongqing will never be satisfied with this! Other Greater East Asian nations will probably feel even greater dissatisfaction as a result. Combining these points, the justice and humanity advocated by the United States in this war are only verbal and absolutely unwilling to put them into practice. The one who disrupts world peace and wets the justice and humanity is actually the United States.

### The General Association of Commerce and Trade Announces Various Work Guidelines; Cloth Rationing Pending Government Approval and Implementation; Cotton Industry Management Office to be Established to Specialize in This Matter

To ensure the outside world understands the General Association of Commerce and Trade's recent work, the association held a reception for reporters from Chinese and Japanese newspapers and news agencies in its conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Tang, on behalf of Secretary Yin, delivered a speech, hoping that people from all walks of life would support the association's work and answering the reporters' questions one by one.

Cloth Rationing Imminent

1.  (Question) When will the cloth rationing implementation method be put into practice? What are the general contents of the method? (Answer) The association has been ordered to purchase cotton yarn and cloth, which will continue until March. This matter is extremely complicated, but fortunately, with the support of all parties, the purchase work has now been completed. As for the rationing method, it can be implemented as soon as the government approves and announces it. The allocation to various factories and shops can be handled in advance to meet the needs of production and the public.

Cotton Control Committee Chairman to Be Appointed

2.  (Question) News reports indicate that Chairman Tang has been appointed as the chairman of the Cotton Control Committee. What is the nature of this committee? Has the plan for the centralized purchase of cotton been decided? When will the committee be established? (Answer) The association has long begun planning for the purchase of new cotton. However, this work is arduous and requires a sound organization to handle it. Therefore, after consultations with various parties, the Cotton Control Committee was formed to specialize in cotton purchase. Wen Lantinger and his partner Qing have been recommended by the industry as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, and have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. As for Chairman Tang being the chairman, there has been no formal government order. Even if there is an order, Chairman Tang may not have time to take care of it and will decline, and industry representatives will still be in charge of execution. The chairman of the association will play a supervisory and guiding role.

Cotton Industry Management Office to Be Established

3.  (Question) When will the Cotton Industry Management Office be established? What are the main functions of the office? (Answer) After the establishment of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing Office, the responsible personnel and all staff were able to fulfill their responsibilities and complete this complicated business. The association believes that the control of cotton yarn and cloth will be very important in the future, so it has been decided to change the office to the Cotton Industry Management Office to specialize in this matter. The director and deputy director have been decided, and all staff will be transferred from the office. The management office is expected to be established around the middle of the month.

Rational Allocation of Controlled Materials

4.  (Question) Are there any regulations regarding the future guidelines for materials control? Can you briefly inform us? (Answer) The association will implement the established policies for the control of various materials, striving to achieve a rational allocation of essential commodities related to people's livelihoods. This work is not easy, and we hope that all relevant parties will fully cooperate. We also hope that gentlemen of the press, people from all walks of life, and all merchants and civilians will provide guidance on our administration, so that we can follow it. The association's business is closely related to everyone's life, and we hope that we can all work together to overcome the difficulties of this great era. This is our sincere hope.

Main Resolutions of the Board of Directors and Supervisors Meeting

5.  (Question) What was the situation of the ninth joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors held yesterday? (Answer) In addition to reporting on association affairs, four important resolutions were discussed: 1. Seventeen hemp merchants, including Zhuo Qing, were designated as initiators of the Hemp Industry Association and ordered to organize it as soon as possible. 2. The association established a soap and candle industry professional department to be responsible for handling soap and candle control matters. 3. It was decided that four joint associations, such as the grocery industry in various regions, would recommend representatives to apply for membership. 4. The reorganization of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing Office into the Cotton Industry Management Office was retroactively approved to handle all matters related to the unified management of cotton product allocation, production, and sales.

### Soap and Matches Rationing Dates Announced; Economic Office of the First District Receives Reporters Yesterday

The Economic Office of the First District Public Office, in order to clarify the purpose and methods of the authorities' handling of rationing of soap and matches, yesterday specially invited reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers and news agencies to give a talk by Chen Riping, director of the Economic Office. He also mentioned the issue of suppressing commodity prices. The details are as follows:

Strict Investigation to Suppress Commodity Prices

Chen said that the authorities have already rationed daily necessities such as rice, flour, milk, and butter in the past, and are actively planning to ration soap and matches. Salt, coal briquettes, cooking oil, and industrial coal are also being considered for rationing soon. In addition to stepping up the rationing work, we will also begin to take further measures to suppress commodity prices. I believe that the most important method to suppress commodity prices is to strictly enforce the price limits set by the authorities. The Economic Office has re-evaluated the new price limits for manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. The "Investigation and Enforcement Section" of the office will send personnel to conduct thorough investigations to see if the manufacturers are selling goods in accordance with the price limits set by the authorities. When the office sends personnel to investigate manufacturers, they will be in groups of three, and they will also conduct random checks on business accounts to eliminate hoarding. When investigators are performing their duties, they must show the "Economic Office Staff ID Card" issued by the office, which has a photo of the investigator. Otherwise, they can be refused. Investigators must be kind in their attitude when investigating factories. In addition, if investigators are suspicious or dishonest, they can be sent to the nearby police or reported to the Economic Office to prevent such unfortunate events from happening.

Regular Rationing of Soap and Matches

Chen continued to mention the functions of the Economic Group Management Section, which is in charge of the registration, supervision, and guidance of various industry associations in the city. The section holds at least one or two meetings every week to convene the business of various industry associations to conform to the wartime system. Therefore, the mission of each industry association itself, on the member side, is to adjust production and sales, and to set price limits, to benefit the wartime system and not to violate economic rules. All industry associations in the city that have already registered with the General Association of Commerce and Trade must also register with the office. Subsequently, the Economic Office also released news about the rationing of soap. The procedures for rationing soap are different from other items due to the large number of manufacturers and different products, which makes it quite difficult to plan. For example, if one manufacturer's products are rationed to every resident of the city, it is five-star soap. The Economic Office solemnly stated that the quantity of this rationed soap is slightly different, but its quality is flawless. Sales will begin on the 18th of this month. Soap coupons have been issued to all Chinese people except foreigners. At that time, they can be purchased at designated retail stores, limited to one bar per person per month. Matches will also be sold from the 16th of this month. Coupons have also been issued to Chinese people in the district, limited to one pack per person per month. The product is Golden Tripod Matches, and the standard for each box of matches is ninety sticks. The rationing price will be announced by the office in the form of a notice one day before implementation. It is said that the price is quite cheap.

Measures for Coal Briquettes and Sugar

Chen also answered reporters' questions and announced that the authorities were dealing with the soaring market prices of coal briquettes and sugar. The reason is that the supply is not smooth, but the main reason is hoarding by good merchants. The Economic Office is stepping up its efforts. It is still difficult to announce a specific date for the implementation of coal briquette rationing, but its price will be suppressed as much as possible after it is rationed one day. Sugar: There has been sugar procurement from the outside world recently. Now it has been filled to three provinces and two cities, so there is no shortage of sugar, and it can be distributed according to the original rationing amount. The rationing of food is handled by the "Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office." The rationing dates for October and November have been delayed, mainly due to discussions on the price issue. It should be possible to ration according to the original method in the future.

### Commemoration Ceremony for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday Today; All Citizens to Hold a Moment of Silence

### Air Defense Propaganda Conference Successfully Concluded Yesterday

### Youth League of the Eighth District Held Inauguration Ceremony Yesterday

The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Youth League held an inauguration ceremony in Gujiazhai Park at 10:00 AM yesterday. Chen Gongbo, who also serves as the district governor, personally presided over the grand ceremony as the commander-in-chief of the branch. Nearly 10,000 people from 125 schools, including the French and Jinrong schools, participated in the youth league of the district. Director Wen, Deputy Director Su Chengde, Director of the Welfare Department Sun Ming, Director of the Education Department Lin , Director of the Finance Department Yuan Zhi, Fire Chief Guo , Deputy Governor Bao Ru, Deputy Commanders-in-Chief of the Congress Nong Ruhui and Yi Gang concurrently served as the site commanders Jiang Wusheng and Xu Songping, the director-general Lin Jun, and the chief greeter Ji Chang. The event was unprecedentedly grand and enthusiastic. After the ceremony was held in accordance with the regulations, Chen, the chairman and commander-in-chief, led everyone to pay tribute to the leader and pray for his health. Then, the chairman respectfully read the leader's instructions, and the deputy commander-in-chief led everyone to take the military oath. Chen, the chairman of the committee, gave a speech, clarifying the process of the establishment of the youth league branch in the eighth district and the tasks it will undertake in the future. His words were very earnest and encouraging. Finally, the ceremony ended with the singing of the Chinese Youth League song and the national anthem amidst loud military sounds.

### Special Rationing of Sugar Reduced

According to a reporter from the Shanghai Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office, the rationing amount of sugar for special consumers has been reduced by 20% to 50%, and the price has also increased from 9.6 yuan per catty to 14.65 yuan per catty. It is said that this move is to comply with the price of the Normal Bureau and to make up for the losses in rationing household sugar, so the price of household sugar can still be maintained.

### "Gone with the Wind" Performances Become More Exciting; Shen Min Plays Scarlett O'Hara; Yingzi Visits the Theater to Give a Report

The famous drama "Gone with the Wind," performed by the Kugan Troupe at the Paris Grand Theater, has been performed for nearly a month, and the box office has always been booming. The four major male and female roles in the play have been changed recently, with Shi Hui replacing Bai Ruide, Bai also replacing Wei Xili, and Yang Yingwu replacing Mi Daifu. The lineup is new, and the performance is even more spectacular. The role of Scarlett O'Hara, which is the most important role in the play, was originally played by Lan Lan. Unfortunately, Miss Lan sprained her foot during the performance the night before. Shen Min, who was originally scheduled to play Scarlett O'Hara, also took the stage early yesterday. Xiao Bi's acting skills are well-trained, and she is particularly moving in the first three scenes of "Gone with the Wind," which is highly appreciated by the audience.

Yingzi, a member of the Kugan Troupe, has been resting in the hospital due to illness. Recently, her health has improved slightly, and she has decided to go to the Paris Grand Theater today to report on the work of the Kugan Troupe to the audience. According to the report, Kugan held a long-term charity performance for the newspaper's scholarship fund. All members of the troupe worked extremely hard. This time, Xiao Bi Yingzi's report can also be regarded as doing her best for the scholarship movement.

"The Gentleman on the Beam," which will be staged after "Gone with the Wind," is directed by Zuo Lin and has been actively rehearsing recently. Most of it has become very skilled. The scheduled performance period for "Gone with the Wind" is not much longer. Please book your seats as soon as possible if you have not seen the play and want to see it!

### Fifth Report on the Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund

We hope to expand the number of applications when school starts in the next session. This is what the newspaper deeply expects.

Economic Circle Reviews

### Contribution to the Economic Office of the First District

The main purpose of the establishment of the Economic Office of the First District Public Office of Shanghai Special Municipality is undoubtedly how to prevent the occurrence of problems such as low productivity in terms of local food and necessities, uneven rationing, and unstable public sentiment. Therefore, we can't help but rejoice in the fact that the First District Qi Chu authorities have previously expressed how to strive for the universal rationing of daily necessities, the strict suppression of illegal transactions, and the thorough investigation of general business conditions, believing that it is an institution that benefits the city.

Now, the Economic Office of the First District has arranged the rationing of soap and matches, one of the daily necessities for the people's lives, and is about to sell it universally. Its hard work and careful arrangement to take care of the people's livelihoods in the area is self-evident. In addition to supporting the economic policies of the Economic Office of the First District, we would like to offer two sentences to the authorities of the Economic Office of the First District: "Prioritize the urgent and implement what is deemed necessary." The meaning of the first sentence is: For the most urgent sector of daily necessities—such as matches—prioritize the implementation of universal rationing. We believe that coal briquettes are essential fuel for residents, and the current serious situation is enough to make the general poor cut off cooking. This is what we consider to be a key point in the rationing problem. The meaning of the second sentence is: Whenever there are illegal price increases, especially when there is a perceived shortage of a certain material, it is advisable to act cheaply at any time and forcibly enforce the price limit. If it is found that there are those who deliberately violate this for their own private gain and profit, disregarding the future of the public's livelihood, then take decisive action. As the saying goes, "Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures."

### The General Association of Commerce and Trade Actively Promotes the Exchange of Materials Between the North and South; A Concrete Plan Will Be Implemented Soon

Now, the General Association of Commerce and Trade is implementing this. The main materials transported to the North are flour and rice, etc., in exchange for oil, grain, coal, etc. from the North.

### An Ideal Children's Paradise

— Baimen

A Visit to the Shanghai Ciyou Training Institute

On the picturesque Daxing Road, amidst the neat rows of street trees, the upper part of a four-story Western-style building is revealed, overflowing with captivating music. A moment later, the sound deepens, and the clamor of children playing ball is heard. Is it a wealthy person's villa or a noble school? Who would have thought that this place shelters a group of wild children who have been oppressed, abandoned, and hated!

Modern Ciyou Institute

The history of modern Chinese Ciyou (orphanage) undertakings is not very long, only a few decades in total. The first to organize relief and education for suffering children were religious groups from foreign countries who came to China. Only after they achieved success did Chinese people voluntarily start to organize such undertakings. Therefore, Ciyou undertakings in our country can be roughly divided into two main origins: 1. Ciyou undertakings organized by foreigners in China. These are the largest in scale, specialize in Ciyou work, and have achieved excellent results that have continued to this day, such as the Salesian Society, which is run by Italians. They now have institutions in Shanghai, Xuzhou, Hong Kong, Macau, Kunming, Qujiang, and other places. 2. Ciyou undertakings organized by Chinese people. The first of these is the China Ciyou Association. This association also runs various relief and education programs for suffering children throughout the country. The Shanghai Ciyou Training Institute is one of the most important.

Ms. Yao Shuwen, the director of the Shanghai Ciyou Training Institute, a kind and capable woman from northern China, said that the history of the institute also involved a period of arduous struggle. The association was originally founded in March of the 19th year of the Republic [1930] on Qiuhong Road in Shanghai. Soon after, the "January 28th Incident" [Shanghai Incident of 1932] broke out, and they moved to Yaozhu Road. After the situation stabilized, they moved again to Hongkou, first to Huishan Road and then to Tangshan Road, until the 25th year of the Republic [1936], when they finally settled at the current address - 1231 Daxing Road (formerly Rue Keyaude) in the Eighth District. In a way, it has the significance of Mencius's mother moving three times to find a good environment, because providing relief and education to suffering children requires careful selection of the environment!

The Shanghai Ciyou Training Institute is a child welfare undertaking organized by the China Ciyou Association. The highest responsible persons are the standing directors Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, and Wu Weide. All practical work in the institute, such as teaching, training, and care, is under the leadership of Director Yao Shuwen. Teachers and staff members like Miss Zhang Xinqia are all graduates of advanced normal schools and are rich in social education experience. Each person must take on teaching and general institute affairs. There are no laborers, no nannies, and no special staff. Everything depends on these seven or eight people. They hardly have any free time each day, and they must also occasionally take care of the children at night. They must also regularly discuss and study the theory and practical methods of child welfare work, and because of insufficient funding, their lives are even more difficult than those of ordinary elementary school teachers.

It has been thirteen years and six months! They have written many moving and brilliant epics. They have taken in 894 suffering boys and girls, among whom some have already graduated or found

New Little Angels

On a certain Sunday, two teams of students were gathering in the schoolyard for a decent soccer game. A boy of about ten years old, with a whistle in his mouth, was quite the commander. Director Yao said with a smile, "He seems like a very excellent child! That's right, he's one of our excellent children here, but he has a rather unusual story." It turned out that this child was a pitiful soul who had lost his parents and a fairly well-off family in the Shanghai war. He was taken in by the institute. He still had an aunt who was living reasonably well, so because the institute had limited funds, they asked her to take him back. However, not long after, Director Yao saw a very thin street urchin with very dark eyes near a tram stop on some road, his head bowed, swiftly brushing past her, his weak little body almost falling to the ground. Upon closer inspection, wasn't he none other than Neng Binghua, whom she had rescued and taught for many days? Director Yao's tears couldn't help but gush out! She quickly approached him and, after asking, learned that his aunt had abandoned him elsewhere, and he had no choice but to beg on the streets. However, he was a person who had already received education and suffered particularly in his begging because he refused to steal or rob. Later, after an examination, fortunately, he had not been contaminated by bad habits at all. He resumed his bright work-study life in the institute. Because of his intelligence and good character, he has now completed elementary school and been admitted to Benbu Youth Middle School, becoming a young man with unlimited prospects. He still returns to the institute to live every day, considers the institute his home, and a certain person who is enthusiastic about charitable work has generously taken on the responsibility for his education.

The director excitedly recounted stories of children like these. If they were all recorded, they could almost be compiled into a thick collection of "Success Stories from Suffering"! "Look, in here, this little room is the dormitory of two other successful children of ours." Two military-style beds, and next to them, a children's desk with neatly arranged books. On the wall hang pictures of great men of national liberation and their own schedules, the writing as neat and beautiful as printed text. One of them, because it was Sunday, had returned to the dormitory to busy himself with something. He is none other than Wang Youpu, who had recently been admitted to Datong University Affiliated High School on a scholarship.

Like him, there are many others who have been successfully nurtured by the Shanghai Ciyou Training Institute and gone on to further education. The most outstanding are the female student Zhang Yuehua, now in her third year of junior high school at Jinling Girls' High School in Pudong; Wang Yueqing, in her first year at Minli Girls' Middle School. Among the male students, besides Xiong Binghua, who is at Qingnian Middle School, there is also one at Yuqun Middle School in the first year of junior high school. In addition, there are female students like You Bao and Xu Mei, and Ci Ying, who was admitted to the Shenbao scholarship, and the one who was admitted to the Xinwenbao scholarship, who are in the first year of junior high school at Xinben Girls' Middle School. The Ciyou Training Institute continues to shoulder the responsibilities of a parent for all these female middle school students.

Social Service

### Layman Wanghailou Donates Free Hospital Beds for Students

Your organization's aid to students is something I deeply sympathize with, and I am ashamed that I have not donated due to my own meager resources. Today, I have discussed with the Foguang Sanatorium and obtained their consent. If any students suffering from typhoid fever or other illnesses are unable to afford medical treatment and need to be hospitalized for treatment, they may be admitted to the hospital with a written certificate from your organization and the permission of the hospital's doctor. There is a monthly limit of three people. All hospitalization and medical expenses will be borne by me. The hospital has Buddhist compassion and charges low fees for its wards. All those who are ill and wish to be treated at the hospital are welcome. Outpatient services and medication are provided in the morning. The hospital is located at 123 Masnan Road. Sincerely, Layman Wanghailou.

### Prevention of Chilblains

Winter has arrived again, and many people will inevitably suffer from chilblains. Those who work outdoors and housewives will definitely feel uncomfortable when they get chilblains, and they will also waste a lot of unnecessary money. The weather is not yet very cold, so to avoid digging a well only when you are thirsty, here is a preventive method. That is, every night before going to bed, wipe your feet with cold water (preferably not hot water), then rub them with raw ginger. Then apply some Vaseline or similar ointment. Doing this can prevent chilblains from developing. Readers may wish to try it. (Cheng Qipeng)

### Epiphyllum Exhibition

The Daguan Art Garden at 354 Jing'an Temple Road, founded by famous calligraphers and painters Zhang Zhongyuan and Jiang Hanting, has several pots of epiphyllum. The petals are currently in bud and are expected to open this afternoon (the 12th). It is said that they were obtained from a large monastery and are rare treasures in Shanghai. Those with a penchant for appreciating flowers should not miss the opportunity to be the first to see them.

### Responding to the Winter Clothing Donation

Having read the article in your newspaper on the 9th about poor teachers requesting winter clothing, I was deeply moved. I am now sending savings certificates worth 500 yuan to help the poor teachers purchase winter clothing. I am well aware that this amount is very small, and I sincerely hope that benevolent gentlemen in the community will, with a heart of respect for teachers, donate according to their ability, so that small contributions can accumulate into a larger sum, allowing those who are teachers to stay warm, continue teaching, and thus be fortunate. Respectfully, Zhi Ji. (Note: The donation has been received and will be forwarded accordingly.)

### Prominent Figures Respond to Old-Age Assistance Funds

— Mingde

The "Old-Age Assistance Fund" originally proceeded with the encouragement of the "Bao Fu Fa" [Preservation of Wealth Law], initially receiving one hundred yuan, but then stalled. Now that winter is approaching, with cold and hunger arriving together, and the four sufferings of old age, illness, and death all advancing, it is truly appropriate to loudly appeal for concern for the elderly, to address the various problems of illness, death, birth, and death, and to arouse the great aspirations of supporting the elderly, respecting the elderly, giving the elderly respite, and relieving the elderly, in order to conform to the sacred creation of "revering the elderly" in the Great Learning and inspiring filial piety among the people, to cultivate the people's hearts, to practice filial piety and brotherly love, and to demonstrate peace and prosperity, which is what we pray for. Yesterday, Mr. Zhu Juefo donated 50 yuan, Mr. Gao Hanqing donated 100 yuan, and Mr. Zhao Ximing donated 50 yuan, for a total of 200 yuan.
