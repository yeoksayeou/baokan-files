### Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth

Yesterday, the Supreme National Defense Council's temporary meeting resolved to implement the essential guidelines and interim regulations for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. The purpose is to crack down on hoarding and suppress prices. We believe that all the people of the country, except for those who are hoarders themselves, will express sincere joy and emotion at this wise measure of the government. The reason for this joy and emotion is simple: it is hoped that the evils of hoarding will gradually be eliminated, that the abnormal prices will be reasonably suppressed, and that people's lives will be stabilized. The issue of prices, which has been the talk of the town, will take this appropriate measure as a turning point and establish a foundation for reasonable adjustment, how can it not be exciting and moving?

We have never been afraid of trouble, nor have we hesitated to be frank. For the sake of loving the government and improving people's livelihoods, we have continuously made various appeals for adjusting prices. Four months ago, we published an article entitled "Requesting the Government to Resolve to Crack Down on Speculation and Hoarding," in which we stated our views. Afterwards, the government issued an order to investigate thoroughly, and we increased our belief in support. Although it was stalled at the time for some reason, we still did not avoid suspicion and continued to offer advice. Now that the government has announced the "Essential Guidelines and Interim Regulations for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth" and implemented them immediately, we are even more willing to sincerely support the effective implementation of this measure with the people of the country, carry it through to the end, and further expand it to other daily necessities.

Regarding the published essential guidelines and interim regulations, since they have been carefully discussed and decided by the Supreme National Defense Council, we do not need to rashly comment on them. However, regarding the concerns raised by all parties about this measure, we would like to first state our humble opinion as follows:

What is most worthy of everyone's attention, and what is most reassuring to the public, is the issue of the disposal of cotton yarn and cloth after the purchase. The Chairman has earnestly stated: "The government should take the maintenance of people's livelihood and the increase of production as the main purpose in purchasing cotton yarn and cloth from Chinese and foreign merchants. It should formulate reasonable allocation methods and properly plan the distribution. In addition to the already determined foreign trade and the exchange of materials in various places, it should strive to use it for domestic people's livelihood needs in order to revive the economy." The public should have a deep understanding of this, absolutely trust the Chairman's promise, and wait patiently for gradual implementation.

Secondly, what deserves the attention of the public is that our friendly nation, Japan, has also adopted the same measures and is actively assisting our country. All cotton yarn and cloth owned by Japanese merchants in China will also be handled according to this principle. We believe that this cooperative attitude of our friendly nation Japan will strengthen the efficiency of the purchase work. It can not only avoid the path of taking advantage of loopholes, but also silence the critics. Here, we sincerely hope that the Japanese authorities and merchants in China will focus on the long-term vision of cooperating for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and will not hesitate to sacrifice local interests, and fully give cooperation and respect to Chinese laws, so that this work can be successfully completed. At the same time, while we accept the assistance of friendly nations, we must also be self-disciplined and strictly implement the law, so as not to fail the kindness of friendly nations.

To our fellow merchants who hold cotton yarn and cloth, we would like to sincerely offer a word: from today onwards, everyone will no longer look at you with the eyes of hoarders. Today is the time when you should wake up and restore your reason. Everyone is a constituent of the country and society. Only when the public has interests can individual interests be maintained. Even if you have a lot of wealth, you cannot isolate yourself from the crowd and society. The "wise men who protect themselves" who only care about their own interests are unreliable. Now that the government is implementing purchases for the benefit of the public, then your interests, which are only those of a few, must be sacrificed. We hope that you will no longer be obsessed with private interests, and deeply realize the inevitable trend. Not only is there no room for violating or evading government laws and regulations, but you must openly support them. The ancients said: "All the past is as dead as yesterday, and all the future is as born as today." Don't bother calculating the digits of your assets. Moreover, the purchase price set by the government has already taken into account the previous purchases and is not considered low. If it is based on the cost of production, it may be even higher, because most of these hoarded yarns and fabrics are inventory from two or three years ago, not produced recently, and absolutely cannot be compared with the current unreasonable black market price.

In addition to yarn and cloth, the amount of daily necessities stored in Shanghai must also be considerable. Under the government's overall price suppression policy, a comprehensive adjustment is very likely. At this point, we hope that the hoarders of other daily necessities should act promptly, not dream of being a rich man forever, and set an example themselves. Secondly, those who are preparing to become new hoarders should especially open their eyes and no longer tie themselves up. We must realize that hoarding and profiting in large quantities is certainly a dead end, and even a small amount of hoarding to prevent famine and price increases will eventually be "a dragonfly eating its tail, eating itself," which is also a dead end. Everyone understands that if everyone does not hoard goods, then the supply and demand of materials will be normal, and prices will naturally tend to be stable.

We sincerely support this measure of the government. However, from the promulgation of the law to the achievement of results, the distance is not near. What kind of effective implementation is needed? What kind of strict adherence to the law is needed? Only then can it be successfully achieved, and this is the most enthusiastic expectation of the public.

Finally, we deeply feel that stabilizing people's livelihoods is already being planned by the government. If everyone works together and cooperates to move forward, then people's livelihoods will naturally be stabilized, and the government's position will inevitably be strengthened. Cotton yarn and cloth are indeed essential for people's livelihoods, but food is even more important. We hope that the government will, in the near future, give practical adjustments to food in addition to the purchase of yarn and cloth. For example, the amount of household rice in this city is still the same, but the time has been extended, which inevitably makes the public frown. Now that the concessions have just been taken over, the authorities should do their best to maintain and increase the food supply to boost public morale. We have said everything we can, and we are discussing it incidentally.

### Supreme National Defense Council Passes Measures for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Friendly Nation Japan Adopts Same Measures Taking 10,000 Yuan per Bale of 20-Count Blue Phoenix Yarn as the Standard

For months, Chairman Wang has been deeply concerned about regulating prices, punishing hoarding, in order to revive the economy and stabilize people's livelihoods, and actively cooperate with the Greater East Asia War. After careful deliberation, he decided on emergency economic measures. Yesterday afternoon, he convened a temporary meeting of the National Defense Council to resolve the essential guidelines and interim regulations for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. After the meeting, the Chairman, in the name of the President of the Executive Yuan, issued a statement as follows:

### Government Statement Designates the Shanghai Commercial Control Association to be Responsible for Handling Cotton Yarn and Cloth Stored in Shanghai

Since our country entered the war, the government has been working to restore the economy and stabilize people's livelihoods, in order to actively cooperate with the Greater East Asia War. Recently, prices have been rising sharply, and the trend is getting worse. If we do not take effective measures, economic recovery and people's livelihood stability will be difficult to achieve.

In order to stabilize prices, punish hoarding, enhance the value of currency, and protect the interests of legitimate merchants, the government, at today's National Defense Council meeting, resolved to implement the "Interim Regulations on the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth" from today. The National Commercial Control Association will be responsible for handling cotton yarn and cloth stored in Shanghai. For the sake of the interests of the entire people, the government will overcome all difficulties and resolutely implement this extraordinary measure. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will understand the government's intentions, support the national policy, and abide by the law.

Regarding the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, our friendly nation, Japan, has also adopted the same measures and is actively assisting us. All cotton yarn and cloth owned by Japanese merchants in China will also be handled according to this principle. This cooperative spirit is deeply appreciated. We also hope that merchants from other friendly nations will understand the intentions of the National Government and continue to provide active assistance. As for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth from Chinese and foreign merchants, the government should take the maintenance of people's livelihood and the increase of production as the main purpose, formulate reasonable allocation methods, and properly plan the distribution. In addition to the already determined foreign trade and the exchange of materials in various places, it should strive to use it for domestic people's livelihood needs in order to revive the economy. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will have a deep understanding of this.

Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan, September 9th

### The National Government Implements the Purchase of Yarn and Cloth Japanese Ambassador Issues a Statement Actively Assisting the National Government in Adopting the Same Measures

Shanghai, Central News Agency, 9th. Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani, recently issued a statement on the National Government's decisive implementation of the purchase of yarn and cloth, which roughly stated that since China entered the war, the National Government has been carrying out various measures to cultivate combat power and stabilize people's livelihoods in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. In view of the fact that price countermeasures should be promoted in cooperation, the Interim Regulations on Punishing Crimes of Hoarding Major Commodities were promulgated and implemented. A Materials Investigation Committee was organized to find a large amount of registered yarn and cloth in stock. In order to implement state management and reasonable allocation, and to prevent the recurrence of hoarding, the Interim Regulations on the Purchase of Yarn and Cloth were specially promulgated and implemented. The first goal is the yarn and cloth owned by Chinese merchants in Shanghai that has been fully registered, and all of it will be forcibly purchased by the National Commercial Control Association. The purchase price will be determined based on 10,000 yuan per bale of 20-count Blue Phoenix cotton yarn. In order to avoid the rapid occurrence of capital, appropriate measures will be taken, so not only can important materials be ensured, but also the price of Central Reserve Certificates can be stabilized, and the sound production and exchange of materials can be restored, which will greatly contribute to the economic recovery and the stability of people's livelihoods. The Japanese side deeply feels that this measure is the most effective and appropriate, and at the same time, the Japanese side expresses its respect for the National Government's determination and launching of strong political power. The Japanese side will also implement the purchase of all yarn and cloth owned by Japanese merchants by the Japan-China Trade Federation at the same price as the Chinese side, and the payment will be made according to the principle of the regulations of the Chinese side, in addition to the public price registered in Japan. The Japanese military and political authorities will give the greatest cooperation to this. It is hoped that the Japanese expatriates will deeply understand the significance of this and abide by these regulations to show their determination to serve the public sincerely under the decisive battle, cooperate to establish a stable economic foundation in Central China, ensure important materials and reduce prices, so as to achieve the purpose of maintaining currency, and move towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War.

### Commander Yan Returns to Nanjing After Inspecting Mengjiang Issues a Statement

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 9th. Commander General Ri Yan went to North China and Mengjiang on the 2nd of this month for inspection and returned to Nanjing on the 7th. He also issued a statement as follows: This inspection of North China and Mengjiang lasted about a week. The officers and soldiers are full of vigor in this hot summer. The local officials and people are all united to cooperate with the garrison troops and engage in mop-up operations. Chinese officials and people can also recognize the situation and engage in the construction of a new China with a sincere attitude and a belief in victory. This is truly gratifying. According to the comprehensive efforts of the Chinese and Japanese military officers and people this time, the combat power is increasing day by day, and the construction is progressing day by day. The belief that the long-term war will be won is now more solid. However, the still restless common bandits in the area attempt to disrupt public order. This not only hinders the advancement of Chinese administration and the development of new China's construction, but even sacrifices the people in the name of resisting the war to expand their own labor range. This should not be ignored.

### Cooperation Between China and Japan in North China Resolves the Food Problem Wang Kemin Inspects Food Administration in Various Places Political Committee Holds War Commemoration

Beijing, Central News Agency, 9th. As the Greater East Asia War enters the decisive stage, North China's mission as a military base is becoming heavier. The North China Political Committee and the Beijing Japanese Embassy Office have decided to work together to mobilize all organs under their jurisdiction to solve the food problem in North China, promote bandit suppression work, and launch the North China New Construction Movement from the 9th. The implementation period of the movement is from August 9th to October 31st for the first phase. The North China Political Committee, with the cooperation of various organs of the Japanese side, has decided to mobilize administrative organs and various Chinese organs such as the New People's Society to solve the food problem in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and achieve the mission of a certain military base.

Beijing, Central News Agency, 9th. Mr. Wang Kemin, a member of the North China Political Affairs Committee of the National Government, convened all the superintendents and senior officials above the level of the director general at 11:00 a.m. on the 9th in the auditorium on the second floor of the Diplomatic Building to hold a war commemoration ceremony. Chairman Wang presided over the meeting, reported on the overview of promoting the construction of North China and strengthening the wartime system in North China, and explained that solving the food problem is the key to promoting new construction.

### Prime Minister Tojo Banquets Thai Foreign Minister

Tokyo, Central News Agency, 9th. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo hosted a banquet for Thai Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon and his entourage at his official residence at 6:00 p.m. on the 9th. Those who attended the banquet included Military Attaché Hiranuma, Chief of the General Staff Sugiyama, Chief of Naval Operations Nagano, President of the Political Society Abe, Secretary-General of the Association Maruyama, Director General of the Asia Federation Nagano, President of the International Cultural Promotion Association Nagai, President of the Southern Development Bank Sasaki, President of the Japan-Thailand Cultural Association Ichiyanagisawa, Chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce Fujiyama, and President of Yokohama Specie Bank Kashiwamoto, etc., more than 150 famous people from the government and the public, as well as various officials and deputy ministers from various ministries, etc. The situation was extremely enthusiastic. During the banquet, Prime Minister Tojo gave a welcome speech, and Thai Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon gave a reply. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until late at night before dispersing.

### Britain and the United States Implement Amphibious Strategy in the Mediterranean The Powerful German Army Prevents the Enemy from Deepening The Battle in Northern Sicily is in Full Swing

Berlin, Central News Agency, 9th. According to the Maritime News Agency, a German news military interviewer wrote today, stating that those who study the current war situation must have a basic understanding, that is, the difference between land warfare and amphibious warfare. The so-called amphibious warfare is the offensive launched by Britain and the United States in Sicily and the tactics that will be engaged in the Mediterranean. Germany is the strongest in Europe, and only land warfare can defeat it. Today, the only one who can contend with the German army is the Soviet Union. Although the strength and experience of the Soviet army are admired throughout the world, it cannot make a decisive victory over the German army. Then, for the British and American armies, with the British army as the main force, to accomplish what the Soviet army cannot accomplish is tantamount to climbing a tree to catch fish. Taking the situation in Sicily as an example, although the Allied forces of Britain and the United States can implement an amphibious strategy on the Mediterranean island, if they deepen inland, not under the cover of naval artillery, the British and American armies will be forced to fight the strongest army in the world, and their experience and strength will inevitably show their inferiority.

Rome, Central News Agency, 9th. Today's war report from the Italian military headquarters stated that in the northern part of the Sicilian front line, fierce battles are in progress in front of the German-Italian military positions. The Axis aircraft fiercely attacked the central points of the rearguard. The German air force effectively attacked two light cruisers and destroyers near Sicily. The British and American naval and air force units carried out ineffective bombing on the coasts of Sicily and Calabria yesterday.

### Japanese Ambassador to Burma Presents Credentials Yesterday Determined to Strive to Promote Friendly Relations Between the Two Countries

Yangon, Central News Agency, 9th. Mr. Sawada, the first Japanese ambassador to Burma, presented his credentials to Burmese National Representative Ba Maw in the Burmese Government Hall at 3:30 p.m. on the 9th. Ambassador Sawada arrived at the hall on time with Naval Attaché Kitajo, Counselor Shimazu, Secretary, etc. Burmese Deputy Prime Minister Thakin Mya, Foreign Minister Thakin Nu, etc. were present. First, Ambassador Sawada gave a congratulatory speech to National Representative Ba Maw, stating that the close relationship between Japan and Burma is the key to completing the Greater East Asia War and building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The envoy is now appointed as the first ambassador to your country and will strive to promote friendly relations between Japan and Burma with sincerity and consistency so that the relations between the two countries will be established on the spirit of morality. He will make the best efforts to achieve the purpose of the treaty of alliance between our two countries. After the speech, he presented his credentials. National Representative Ba Maw gave a reply, stating that the independence of Burma is entirely dependent on the sacred power of the Japanese Emperor and the military achievements of the Japanese soldiers. Today, a close relationship between the two countries has been created. It is a pleasure for the seat to be close to Your Excellency the Ambassador and to be appointed as the first ambassador to the country. However, although Burma has gained independence, there are still many difficulties in the future. Therefore, it is hoped that Japan and Your Excellency representing Japan will give great understanding and cooperation, and it is also believed that its request will be granted.

### Examining the Problem of Commodity Prices in China

— Yoshida Seiji

Frequent Movement of Goods

What is even more striking is the unexpected abundance of various goods in the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing. As mentioned earlier regarding the night scene of Nanjing Road, various commodities are being moved or stored throughout the city. If one assumes that goods are being secretly hoarded, then the absolute quantity of materials can be said to be extremely plentiful. Walking through every street corner of Shanghai and Nanjing, it seems impossible to find people so impoverished as to be starving. In the suburbs of Shanghai's Great Western Road and outside Nanjing's Zhongshan Gate, groups of peddlers carry various vegetables, grains, fruits, and other items. Consequently, a wide variety of goods enticing to these people are displayed in abundance in the stores. There are no lines formed at any store to purchase goods. From outward appearances, this state of affairs cannot be considered a situation of material shortage. The state of material shortage may be lurking in deeper currents, unnoticed by people, because many leading figures are unanimously advocating the need to increase production.

Commodity Prices and Currency

Is the cause of the sharp rise in commodity prices since January of this year, particularly after April, really due to currency factors? It is commonly said that the amount of currency has the closest relationship with commodity prices. Because the extent of the issuance of Reserve Certificates has not been announced, the general public assumes that it has reached a considerable quantity, which is wrong. Moreover, the interest rates in the Shanghai market are much higher than last year, and the deposits in banks have visibly decreased according to the announcement of the Silver Money Trade Association, amounting to only a little over 30% of what they were before the China Incident. Furthermore, over 90% of the deposits are current deposits, with fixed-term deposits accounting for less than 10%. In this situation, despite the extremely tight financial conditions, commodity prices are soaring, so it would be inappropriate to judge commodity prices solely from the amount of currency.

Then, can the reason for rising commodity prices be derived from the public's trust in the currency itself? In my opinion, not necessarily. Reserve Certificates are now widely circulating and accepted in a broad area of Central China, and the vastness and speed of their circulation can be described as a surprising phenomenon. Seen in this light, it is also difficult to discover and grasp the reasons for the soaring commodity prices from the currency aspect.

Currently, commodity prices in Shanghai are roughly 70 to 100 times higher than before the China Incident. A five-minute ride in a rickshaw costs ten yuan. A piece of pastry costs three to five yuan. What is the cause of this phenomenon of high commodity prices? What will the future trends be? I do not fully agree with the pessimistic and worried views, and I will not discuss the details here for the time being. The main point is that the reason for the high commodity prices in Central China does not lie in simple economic principles.

Beyond Economic Principles

In summary, the phenomena of the recent economic situation in China, especially the high commodity prices, must be attributed to causes beyond economic principles. The cause beyond economic principles is the psychological effect of the people. The most powerful forces dominating the people's psychology are: the observation of the world war situation by the Chinese people, and the effectiveness of the economic strategies of the enemy's conspiracy. Therefore, we can conclude that the core of the 'economic problem' in China today can only be found in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Other countermeasures should only be implemented along this general direction. When implementing individual, local, and economic measures, the true nature of the situation should be fully understood, and prudent vigilance should be exercised to ensure that our economic policies leave no room for the conspiracies of the British, American, and Chongqing factions to exploit.

### Italy Resolves to Uphold Alliance, Not to Make Humiliating Peace. Milan Air Raid Causes Extremely Heavy Damage.

Rome, September 9th, Central News Agency: Since the political change in Italy, more than ten days have passed. Observing the reaction of the people to the progress of the war situation and to the new government, it can be seen that our country has not yet escaped its predicament. The editorials of various newspapers unanimously express support for the new government to continue the war effort. For example, the Popolo d'Italia recently published an article stating that neutral countries have used the national strength cultivated in the four years of the European war to wait for the arrival of peace. They will take advantage of Anglo-American cooperation to improve their international position, so they are greatly promoting peace at the time of this political change in Italy. However, Italy is determined to uphold its alliance with its allies and give up all political rights to speak. Therefore, peace talks are absolutely impossible. Although Italy has encountered difficulties in the war situation, the Italian army has not been surrounded, and the entire territory of Italy has not been violated. The enemy's intention is to make Italy withdraw from the war and to use the Italian peninsula as a base for attacking Germany. If we are swayed and subdued by their tactics, it will be even easier for enemy troops in Sicily and Sardinia to land in Trieste and Venice in northeastern Italy. If this happens, Germany will certainly not tolerate it, and the defense war of the Alps will unfold in the Po River basin. Northern Italy will become the battlefield for both enemy and us. If we do not rise up to resist the enemy, true peace will not be obtained. We would rather die gloriously in battle than be humiliated and mocked by the world.

Rome, September 9th, Central News Agency: The Stefani News Agency revealed today: A large number of enemy aircraft attacked the residential areas of Milan on Saturday evening, causing serious damage. Between 1:00 AM and 2:30 AM, enemy aircraft flew over the city in formations, dropping countless incendiary bombs and explosives. Among the buildings directly hit were the churches of San Simpliciano, Santa Croce, and San Giovanni. The governor of Milan inspected the disaster area and comforted the injured.

### Italian Newspapers Urge People to Cooperate with the Government

Milan, September 9th, Central News Agency: Seria stated in his editorial yesterday that all Italians should work together with the government and bear their responsibilities for the current all-out war. Close attention should be paid to it. Italians should not make rash judgments about the new government, nor should they embellish its great undertakings.

Although the new government does not particularly enjoy praise, it cannot accept unlimited criticism either. Accusations that would aggravate the difficult situation do not help the facts but rather pose a great danger to national security.

### Famous Educator Gao Jiansi Passes Away

According to visitors from Macau, Gao Jiansi (real name Yang), a famous rural educator from Jiangsu, died in Guilin on July 4th due to illness. Gao was from Wuxi and dedicated his life to education. He founded the private Wuxi Middle School, single-handedly providing huge funds, which led to the depletion of his family's wealth. He served as the dean of the Jiangsu Educational Institute for many years, focusing on cultivating talents for rural construction, and was as famous as Zouping in Dingxian, enjoying a high reputation throughout the country. Later, he served as the president of Guangxi University. A few months ago, he resigned due to a worsening lung disease, which eventually led to his death. At the time of his death, only his eldest daughter, Jin Yu, was by his side. He left behind the instructions: "Public before private, others before oneself," and "Be frugal in wartime funeral arrangements." He left behind three sons and four daughters, the youngest of whom is only seven years old, to be raised by his wife, and their education is extremely difficult. Friends and relatives were saddened by the news.

### Eastern Front War Report

Berlin, September 9th, Central News Agency: The German High Command's war report today stated: On the Eastern Front, Soviet troops continue to launch ineffective attacks on the Kupyansk bridgehead. There were only localized battles on the Isthmus front and in the middle reaches of the Donets River. Large Soviet infantry units attacked in the Belgorod and Oryol areas but failed. Near Vyazma, four enemy divisions, supported by tanks, launched an offensive, but all breakthrough attempts were crushed by German forces. There were only minor skirmishes south of the Laticheva River. The enemy's tank losses on the Eastern Front in recent days amounted to 352 vehicles.

### After the Recovery of the Two Concessions, Territorial Jurisdictions of Each District

Each district will establish a district public office responsible for promoting local administration.

The Shanghai's two concessions have been recovered. In the future, a district governance system will be adopted to make the governance of Greater Shanghai more clear under the complete national territory. According to sources, the city will be divided into eight districts: District 1 is the former area of the Public Concession, District 2 is the city center, District 3 is the northern Shanghai area, District 4 is the western Shanghai area, District 5 is the northeast Pudong area, District 6 is the southeast Pudong area, District 7 is Nanshi, and District 8 is the former French Concession. Each district will establish a district public office responsible for promoting local administration in its respective area.

As for the reports in the newspaper the other day about cracking down on unsound businesses and unnecessary enterprises, the authorities are still carefully studying the matter.

### This Period's Household Oil Rations Are Currently Being Rushed

Recently, the supply of cooking oil in the city has been quite lacking, and various parties are eagerly hoping that methods will be found to adjust the situation in the future. According to news from the Oil and Grain Professional Committee, the committee is currently actively rushing to process the distribution of household oil for the fifth period and will definitely not interrupt it. Also, a certain person in charge said that the first batch of 20,000 dans of edible oil from North China can arrive in Shanghai before the end of this month, and there will be successive shipments to Shanghai later. Moreover, edible oil from various places can be transported freely, so there will be no oil panic.

### 200,000 Tons of Coal Fairly Rationed by Authorities Coal Briquette Factories Increase Production, Supply Becomes More Widespread, Price Limits Set, Absolutely No Overcharges Allowed

The fuel market situation in the city has returned to normal. According to news from the coal industry yesterday, the mining and transportation operations have been carried out with all efforts in the past month. Statistics show that approximately 200,000 tons of bituminous coal were transported from the production areas in the past month. This coal will be fairly rationed by the authorities, and price limits have been set and strictly enforced. At the same time, a considerable amount of firewood has also been transported recently, so the amount of goods in the city's large and small coal yards has also increased compared to the past. The future supply is expected to be adequate, and there will be no shortage. Although the number of factories resuming operations has increased, the number of coal tickets has also increased sharply, but the authorities will provide a sufficient allocation.

Increased Production of Coal Briquettes

It is also learned that the supply of coal briquettes in stock once decreased. The reason is that the supply of raw materials (coal seams) to the coal briquette factories was slightly changed. In order to maintain normal needs, each factory cautiously controlled the supply to prevent hoarding. Now, the authorities have allocated sufficient raw materials to each manufacturing factory, and in order to consider the needs of the city market and stabilize public sentiment, production is gradually being increased. Therefore, the supply of coal briquettes in stock has become more widespread in recent days, and residents can purchase them for fuel nearby.

Goods Dispatched to the Market

Regarding the thirteenth batch of goods, a total of eight hundred tons of coal, including lump coal and dust coal from Datoushan, were dispatched. The Coal Retailers Association notified the industry to pay for the goods and pick them up with orders from designated agencies within the specified period. It is learned that these coals have already been put on the market separately. However, businesses must sell them at the limited price and must not illegally hide them or raise prices for profit. At the same time, sales are limited to civilian users, and the burning of each factory is strictly prohibited. Anyone who dares to violate this will be punished according to law.

### Prohibition Order on Stateless Refugees Regulations State that They May Not Leave Designated Areas Without a Permit

### The District 1 Education Office Establishes Four Sections and One Office

### Major Reforms to Education in District 8 Nung Juhui Gave a Talk

Since the National Government recovered the Shanghai French Concession and renamed it District 8, the education issues in the district have attracted attention from various parties. A reporter from Wangfeng News Agency interviewed Director Nung Juhui of the District Education Office and Deputy Director Chen Yan yesterday. They were received and answered the questions in detail. In the past, the French Concession authorities neglected education. Although the office was open, only four or five people were actually in charge, and most of the management and implementation were perfunctory, which is regrettable. In the future, the office's organization and personnel will be expanded and reformed. The memorandum has been signed and submitted to Director Chen, and an order will be issued soon. The public schools in the district that have been taken over include Lagena Elementary School, Saposai Elementary School, and Remi Public School, and they are currently being actively reorganized. All private primary and secondary schools in the district will be ordered to register and file with the government soon. Other policy outlines will also be announced soon. Rice Rationing Association Discusses Supply

### To Seek Smooth Rice Supply, Grain Bureau Issues Procurement Certificates Rice Rationing Association Discusses Supply

Since the authorities implemented food rationing to promote grain policy, they have emphasized the circulation of food and the active increase of production, so that the wartime food problem can be solved smoothly. It is learned that rice in the city could not be transported to Shanghai in large quantities for various reasons for a time. Recently, in order to ensure the rice supply, the Grain Bureau issued procurement certificates, and it is heard that merchants in the city have rushed to apply for them and are purchasing rice from various places.

Rationing Association Issues Loan Rice

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency inquiring with the Zhongzhong Rice Rationing Association, the association was reorganized from the former Zhongzhi Laigu Rationing Association on the 26th of last month. The reason for the reorganization was to reduce the scope. It was also learned that the association transferred the right to purchase national rice to the Rice and Grain Joint Operating Company at the end of June. As of now, although the association has sold off the responsibility of allocating food to the Chinese population, it was indeed persuaded by the Rice and Noodle Rationing Office during the past month to loan the office its stored rice for rations, and the amount loaned was not fixed for each period.

The Exact Number for Last Month, Hoping to Supplement

According to the food allocated by the Grain Department to Shanghai for the Shanghai area in July, a total of 250,000 bags, the United Jin Company's transportation mechanism is not yet flexible, and up to now, only tens of thousands of bags have been transported, so the company should transport the rice that has not yet been transported to Shanghai last month as soon as possible, to supplement the lack of household rice last month.

### Authorities Will Encourage Citizens to Report Opium Dens and Gambling Sites Plan to Prohibit Opium and Gambling is Being Prepared, and a Large-Scale Campaign Can Be Launched Next Month

The campaign to ban opium and gambling in the city has been actively discussed and planned by various concerned authorities.

The authorities plan to launch a large-scale propaganda campaign first, and then the authorities and the public will cooperate to completely eradicate opium dens and gambling sites and take practical actions. At the same time, residents will be encouraged to report secret opium dens and gambling sites to the authorities, so that the authorities can arrest them. According to sources, a large-scale campaign to ban opium and gambling is expected to be launched next month, and a sound plan is being prepared. At the same time, it is expected that the closure of gambling sites in the city is not far away. The authorities have discussed the livelihood problems of the employees after the gambling sites are closed. As for those who are addicted to opium or other toxic smoking products, the deadline for quitting will also be implemented. Rice Rationing Association Discusses Supply

### List of Approved Names for the Fifth Round of Grants Will Be Announced Today There Were More Than 6,000 Applicants for this Round of Grants Elementary School Grants Will Be Issued Mid-Month

The fifth round of the Shen Bao Lecturers' Scholarship has been underway for nearly two months. Thanks to donations from all sectors of society, the grants have reached more than 1.2 million yuan as of yesterday. (The number of continued deposits reported includes the surplus from the previous round.)

Thanking Donors from All Sectors of Society Registration and application forms began to be collected at this office. There were nearly 10,000 applications, and more than 6,000 were filled out and submitted. Among them, there were more than 2,000 who had previously received grants. Such a large number of students were worried about dropping out of school, and those who were selected were able to continue their studies. We should express our gratitude to the donors.

Thanking the Teachers for Grading Due to the large number of students applying for the elementary, junior high, and high school grades, Mr. Xu Xuehai of the Youth Association and other teachers presided over the screening test and evaluated 3,000-4,000 student test papers, so that the newspaper's scholarship affairs were fairly allocated. We should express our gratitude to the proctors.

List of Approved Names to be Published Today

The applications for scholarships from the first and second grades of senior elementary school have been reviewed and completed. More than 1,000 students have been approved for assistance. All of them have qualified grades and are from poor families. The list of names for the first grade of senior elementary school will be published on the fourth page of this newspaper today. Tomorrow, the list of names for the second grade of senior elementary school will be published. As for the amount of approved grants, the criteria are as follows: 1. The tuition fees of the schools vary. 2. Those with excellent grades and deceased parents will be given additional miscellaneous fees and book fees in addition to the scholarship. 3. Those with poorer grades will have their grants reduced. 4. Those with failing grades and those from relatively well-off families will not be approved.

Dates for Elementary School Students to Receive Scholarships

All approved students will receive their scholarships in the form of a school-titled check on the 14th and 15th for first grade senior elementary school students and the 16th and 17th for second grade senior elementary school students. Students should bring their original registration certificates to the office, fill out receipts, and collect their scholarships and submitted documents. Those whose grades are not qualified and have not been approved for assistance will have their submitted documents returned by mail.

Welcome Reports, Review at Any Time

After the list of approved names has been published, it is inevitable that letters will be received stating that a certain student's family is relatively well-off, requesting that the scholarship be taken back. The newspaper is deeply grateful for the enthusiasm and assistance of the public and classmates. However, it is difficult to make a fair judgment about a student's family situation without a deep understanding. If someone claims to be poor and deceives the investigators, the newspaper is very willing to have the public report it at any time, and the newspaper will reinvestigate it. However, if the reporter does not provide their name and address and is not responsible, it will be difficult to accept the report.

### Various Groups Convene Economy Meeting

The News Federation specially held the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Citizens' Economy Movement Committee and the first preparatory committee meeting yesterday (the 9th). Leaders of various groups attended. Mr. Zhang Lingbo proposed the central issue of economy and suggested expanding efforts to persuade citizens to stop superstitious Guan Gong victory celebrations, in order to save resources. Subsequently, Mr. Cheng Zhiliang suggested starting with the Baojia system for persuasion. Mr. Lu Feng also suggested initiating economy measures to encourage wealthy merchants to reduce extravagance, rectify the extravagance of salaried classes, and that economy can stabilize prices. The entire body wholeheartedly agreed on the principle of thoroughly implementing the short-clothing movement and decided that the preparatory committee would start today.

Shanghai District Procuratorate Moves Part of Its Office

The Shanghai District Procuratorate, after formally announcing its establishment on the 1st of this month, found that its original office space was insufficient due to the expansion of the procuratorial system.

The office of the Chief Judge of the Second Special Court was converted into the office of the Chief Procurator, it is said.

Zhou Yuchan Discusses Speculation "On Real Estate Speculation"

Mr. Zhou Yuying, Director of the Nanshi Office of the Ministry of Social Welfare, was invited by the Anti-Anglo-American Association of the Chinese Nation to speak on the Shanghai Radio Station at 9:30 PM last night (the 9th), on the topic "On Real Estate Speculation." Excerpts are as follows:

Real estate speculation in Shanghai was initially controlled by foreigners. The average Shanghai citizen has long suffered from the problem of housing. In the four or five years after the incident [likely referring to the outbreak of the war], real estate was not favored due to security concerns, and there were many materials that could be hoarded. Real estate could not be hidden, so the phenomenon of real estate speculation can be said to have stopped. Unfortunately, in the past year, Shanghai's order has stabilized, investment targets have decreased, and too much idle capital has accumulated. Real estate speculation has been revived. The current real estate speculation involves three types of people: first, those with strong financial resources; second, land speculators with some financial resources; and third, "land ghosts" who have no financial resources and specialize in advising homeowners and establishing shell real estate companies. If the government authorities do not quickly seek to ban and remedy this, housing disputes will disrupt the entire Shanghai. Therefore, I say that if Shanghai does not implement a policy of "equalization of land rights" as soon as possible to correct speculative real estate practices, many real estate disputes may lead to a violent real estate revolution.

### Emergency Relief Basketball Tournament, Act II: North China to Battle Paramount Again Tonight

The second round of the North China Emergency Relief Charity Basketball Tournament, jointly organized by the Paramount and North China Athletic Associations, is scheduled to start at 7 PM tonight at the YMCA, where the two teams will engage in fierce competition. Tickets are divided into four types: Honorary Tickets worth 1,000 yuan, Patron Tickets worth 500 yuan, Special Tickets worth 300 yuan, and Ordinary Tickets worth 20 yuan. In the first game on the 8th, North China fought hard and eventually reversed the defeat, defeating Paramount by a score of 32 to 24. In tonight's second game, the prelude will be a drama between the Central Trust and the Central Bank. The former has drama stars such as Shi Hui, while the latter's players have superb ball skills. The latter is organized by colleagues from the Central Reserve Bank and has long been known for its strong fighting power in the banking industry. The main battle is between Paramount and North China. Paramount unfortunately lost to North China yesterday. The reason for the defeat was not due to a lack of fighting spirit, but because Captain Chen Xianglong miscalculated, resulting in a lack of leadership. Tonight's game is crucial to the outcome of the championship. Paramount wants to wash away this humiliation and will go all out. The schedule for tonight and the player lists for North China and Paramount are as follows:

Drama - Central Trust vs. Central Bank (starts at 7 PM)

North China vs. Paramount (second game) - 8 PM

North China Team: Zhong Zhong (leader and captain), Chang (coach), Wang Yumin (officer), Yang Youmei (manager), Zhang Shi, Xu Zhaoxiong, Shen Gong, Zhao Yalin, Li Zhong, Wang Yumin, Luo Kechang, Mu Shiyan, Chen Xuechong, Li Zhenzhong, Hua.

### Commentary: The Gains of the Japanese Delegation to China

In the spring of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], the gains of the Japanese delegation to China were the assistance of the Shanghai Japanese Bankers' Association with the legal tender policy, handing over silver reserves to be exchanged for legal tender. Unfortunately, due to the Xi'an Incident, further economic cooperation between the two countries was not possible. This July, Japan sent a second delegation to China, led by Masatane Ogura, with Akio Ishii, Saburo Nanjo, and Kozo Kotera as members. Although the gains from their visit have not yet been seen in fact, the views expressed by the four after returning home seem to allow for some preliminary speculation.

Ogura believes that to solve the current economic problems in Central China, first, political and economic relations must be integrated; second, the guiding economic ideology must be transformed from private interests to public interests; and third, people's livelihood must be stabilized so that everyone can maintain their minimum living standards amidst wartime austerity. "It seems very difficult to increase production immediately in Shanghai, but if China provides resources and labor, and Japan provides capital and technology," it may not be difficult.

Ishii believes that to accomplish the Great East Asia War, friendship between Japan and China is a prerequisite, and that the economy of Central China must be controlled in the Chinese way. The excessive number of banks in Central China is also a cause of currency instability.

Nanjo believes that manufacturing industries centered on Shanghai's lack of money certainly have the potential for revitalization, and that the prerequisite for this is a steady supply of raw materials.

Kotera believes that China's textile industry has reached world standards, so Japan should entrust this industry to the Chinese mainland while focusing on high-level, precision heavy industries. Therefore, it is necessary for Japanese textile factories to move to the mainland and cooperate with China.

### Speculative Financial Institutions Will Gradually Collapse Automatically

The national government, in view of the increasingly rampant hoarding of goods in Shanghai, which has caused prices to soar endlessly and greatly affected people's livelihood and social order, has specially commissioned the heads of relevant Chinese and Japanese departments to form a Materials Investigation Committee. The committee has appointed investigators to lead investigation teams to investigate the stockpiling of goods in warehouses throughout the city. On the one hand, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank will investigate the lending business of various financial institutions in batches. If any hoarding behavior is found, or if loans are suspected of being used for speculative goods, they will be reported immediately and punished according to law by the competent authorities, and their hoarded goods will be confiscated. Therefore, general hoarding merchants are greatly panicked, and all goods stored in warehouses cannot be moved or sold. According to a Central News Agency reporter, reliable sources have recently reported that due to the authorities' thorough investigation of goods and strict prohibition of moving hoarded goods, financial institutions have greatly tightened their acceptance of warehouse receipts as collateral for loans, effectively halting lending operations. This has made it difficult for newly established financial institutions that use speculative funds to turn around their funds. Following the suspension of business by the Jiangduan Qipiao Bank the other day, it was reported yesterday (the 9th) that many newly established financial institutions are engaging in disguised loan sharking. It is hoped that the entire financial industry will gradually move towards normal development thereafter.

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market opened with a sharp decline. The financial sector was particularly affected, with tight credit conditions putting pressure on speculators to liquidate their positions. Investors were cautious amidst the turmoil, and stock prices continued to fall. Sentiment across the board was generally weak.

### Firewood Shortage to be Subject to Controlled Procurement

Firewood is a necessity for people's daily life and is also a major industrial fuel in times of coal shortage. Because the city and surrounding areas are located on the coast and lack mountains and forests, the source of firewood is very limited. In the past, it relied solely on the felling of miscellaneous trees by farmers in the rural areas along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Jiaxing roads, which were then transported to Shanghai for sale. However, over time, the trees in the countryside have been cut down to the point of depletion, so the price has gradually soared, causing fuel panic, which is quite concerning. It is reported that the government authorities, in view of the current situation, believe that it is necessary to set a price limit and control the purchase of firewood. Therefore, they are now actively preparing everything, and it is expected to be implemented in early next month. As for the areas where controlled purchases will be made in the future, they will be the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai. The purchase price has not yet been determined.

### Shanghai Match Factories Increase Production

The supply of matches in the market is insufficient, and the price has soared, which has had a significant impact on people's livelihood. Therefore, the Business Control Association has designated the Match Industry Joint Association to actively prepare matches for allocation to households to meet the basic needs. It is reported that the Sino-Japanese joint venture China Match Company and the Meiguang Match Company, which was transferred from the Japanese side to the management of the national government, have both actively started work and are working hard to increase production. The output of the two companies accounts for about 40% of the total consumption in Central China, so the supply and demand of matches is expected to improve in the future. The Business Control Association has also ordered the match industry association to assist the employees of various factories in finding ways to dredge the sources.
