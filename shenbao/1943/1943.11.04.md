### Social Welfare Undertakings and Winter Relief

The scope of social welfare undertakings is extremely broad. If properly managed, their effects will not only help maintain social stability but also promote social prosperity. Modern nations attach great importance to social policies, vigorously promoting them with all their might, and this is not without reason. The government has established a dedicated department to oversee their implementation, demonstrating the importance it places on social welfare undertakings.

The state should have a comprehensive plan and detailed program for conducting professional social welfare. Executing the program requires ample funding. In particular, charitable relief undertakings require a large amount of funding, which is a consumption-based recurring expenditure. Naturally, it cannot be borne solely by the national treasury and must be raised from all sectors of society. As for social welfare undertakings organized by private individuals or groups, those inclined towards charitable relief in nature require funding that may be used as a fund or raised temporarily through external donations. Although their purpose falls within the scope of social welfare, they tend to focus on individual good deeds and rarely connect with the overall social welfare undertaking. From the perspective of society as a whole, this should be corrected. In short, unit undertakings can cooperate and concentrate their efforts within the overall undertaking, but they should not act independently and disperse their efforts.

At this point, we already know the importance of social welfare undertakings, and their successful implementation depends on fundraising and the connection of undertakings. In other words, unified fundraising and unified management of undertakings. By using unified strength to promote the entire undertaking, we can make contributions and achieve something in social welfare.

Recently, the Ministry of Social Welfare has drafted the "Outline for Unified Fundraising of Social Welfare Funds in Provinces, Cities, and Counties," which has been promulgated and implemented by the Executive Yuan. As for privately run social welfare undertakings, the Ministry of Social Welfare has also formulated "Rules for Fundraising," which, according to yesterday's newspaper, have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and will be promulgated and implemented soon. Therefore, in the future, there will be a legal basis for unified fundraising for both public and private undertakings. We hope that after unified fundraising, unified management of undertakings can be gradually realized in the near future under careful planning.

In addition, it was reported that the central and municipal social welfare fundraising committees have been established. The selection of committee members was carefully discussed and decided by the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the first joint meeting of the central and Shanghai social welfare fundraising committees was held yesterday afternoon. Among the important items discussed was the fundraising plan for the city's winter relief for the 32nd year. We raised the issue of "preparing for winter relief" in our editorial on the 21st of last month, and specifically advocated that: first, the importance of timeliness should be emphasized, and preparations should be made calmly, not hastily; second, the importance of comprehensive strength should be emphasized, and communication and consistency should be achieved between government agencies and social organizations, and among various organizations, in order to achieve the efficiency of comprehensive strength. We are aware that the winter relief held in our city last year was too late, and in fact, it was already the time for spring relief. Now that it has been decided to hold winter relief, it must be done quickly. Now that it has been stipulated that a special committee will be responsible for fundraising, it must be implemented quickly. Start planning the fundraising methods and measures immediately, starting from the 16th of this month and ending at the end of this year, lasting for one and a half months. If we can proceed actively, it will not be hasty. Secondly, regarding the content of winter relief, we have already offered some preliminary views before, and it is worth repeating at this time that active guidance undertakings should be emphasized more than passive relief undertakings, such as small loans to help people make a living, sheltering and educating homeless children, and organizing light handicrafts to enable the unemployed to work, etc. Communication should be established between various relief organizations to improve the efficiency of relief work and reduce fraud.

Social welfare undertakings, led by the government and assisted by the people, should, in theory, have a bright future with satisfactory results. This winter relief in our city is the best test of cooperation between officials and civilians. The quality of their cooperation can determine the quality of the results. Let us wait and see.

### Yesterday Was Japan's Meiji Day: The Emperor Personally Performed Sacrifices, Prime Minister Tojo and Others Visited the Palace to Offer Congratulations

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Today was Japan's Meiji Day festival. A solemn ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace. His Majesty the Emperor personally performed sacrifices. Prince Chichibu and other members of the imperial family also visited the palace at 11:00 AM to pay respects to the Emperor and Empress and offer congratulations.

### American Air Force Heavily Damages Bougainville Island: 500 Aircraft Shot Down in Three and a Half Months

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army withdrew from Kolombangara Island, the American offensive in the Solomon Islands has concentrated on Bougainville Island and New Britain Island. Recently, a large number of aircraft have been mobilized and continuously dispatched in an attempt to inflict heavy damage on the Japanese army's front-line bases. The Japanese naval air force and the army and navy ground forces have established a strong defensive posture against this counterattack by the enemy. If the enemy does not move, they will not be attacked, but if they do, they will be dealt a heavy blow. According to the figures released by the Japanese General Headquarters and the battle results from the front-line bases, from July 17, after the enemy landed on Rendova Island, to the end of October, in the three and a half months since the invasion of Bougainville Island, the total number of enemy aircraft attacking the island reached 3,589, of which 504 were shot down, a shooting down rate of over 14%. Assuming an average of five people per bomber and fighter plane, the loss of enemy airmen in Bougainville Island alone is no less than 2,520. In addition, adding the losses of the enemy forces in the entire Solomon Islands and New Guinea, regardless of the loss of aircraft, the loss of thousands of airmen is not small. Furthermore, considering the enemy's lack of airmen, the severity of the damage they have suffered can be imagined.

Airman Okumura and Others Talk About Their Experiences in Air Combat

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain base in the South Pacific, the intensity of the fighting in the Solomon Islands has reached its peak. The Japanese naval air force on Bougainville Island near Buin, on September 14th, intercepted over 340 attacking enemy aircraft, and together with ground fire, shot down 60 of them. The Japanese aircraft also sacrificed five aircraft. On this day of air combat, Airman Okumura of the fighter squadron was the most active, shooting down ten enemy aircraft in one day, including one large aircraft and nine fighter planes. The commander of a certain fleet specially awarded him a white-sheathed military sword with the inscription "Exceptional Military Achievement." In order to understand the truth about the enemy on this day, the reporter visited Airman Okumura and other air combat heroes who had performed outstanding deeds. They described the details of the air combat on that day: "At 6:30 AM that day, we received news of an enemy aircraft invasion. Several fighter planes immediately took off for patrol. After 35 minutes, we saw a large formation of enemy aircraft flying in from Rendova Island. We made preparations to intercept them. The weather was clear that day, making it an excellent day for air combat. In an instant, the enemy aircraft arrived, and we immediately engaged in a fierce air battle with eleven Type Zero fighter planes and thirty occupational fighter planes. Senior Airman Okumura was the first to shoot down a Sikorsky-type enemy aircraft, and then we successively shot down seven enemy fighter planes. As a result, all the enemy fighter planes were scattered, leaving only the large bombers. Japanese aircraft once attacked a large enemy aircraft. Airman Okumura was the first to hit the aircraft, and chased after it at maximum speed. After 30 minutes, the enemy aircraft was hit by more than ten bullets, burst into flames, and crashed. At 8:00 AM on the same day, enemy aircraft flew over the airfield and dropped bombs. Several Japanese aircraft also took off at this time, but it was a little late. Twelve Type Zero aircraft and thirty fighter planes had already fled into the distance. By 8:40 AM, because the enemy aircraft had fled without a trace, the Japanese aircraft were about to land, but the signal from the ground told them to 'delay landing' and wait in the air. However, the enemy aircraft never came. When we wanted to land again, the signal still called for a delay. In an instant, a total of forty enemy aircraft, including P-38s and B-24s, flew in from an altitude of 6,000 meters. However, the P-38 and B-24 enemy aircraft were no match for the Japanese aircraft. After a fierce battle of 30 minutes, more than half of the enemy aircraft were shot down, a total of 22, including two P-38 enemy aircraft and one B-24 enemy aircraft shot down by Airman Okumura. Afterwards, several Japanese aircraft landed at a certain base due to lack of fuel. Airman Okumura and another aircraft returned to Buin for a short rest, and the maintenance crew replenished fuel and ammunition. Just as we were about to replenish oxygen, the enemy aircraft attacked again, and we had to fly out again. The maintenance crew on the ground, worried about the lack of oxygen, shouted 'Do not fly above a certain number of kilometers!' Then several of our aircraft took off and waited. As expected, we discovered a large number of enemy carrier-based bombers and fighter planes flying in, 50 of the former and 60 of the latter. At this time, our morale became even higher, and we rushed into the enemy aircraft formation, which was several times larger than ours, regardless of everything. Enemy aircraft were successively shot down. After 30 minutes of air combat, a total of five enemy carrier-based bombers and twenty fighter planes were shot down, including one carrier-based bomber and four B-24 enemy aircraft shot down by Airman Okumura. Airman Okumura has shot down 50 enemy aircraft since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and has now set a record of 54 enemy aircraft shot down. A certain commander said that shooting down enemy aircraft over a long period of time is not new, but the record of shooting down ten enemy aircraft in one day is still rare. Airman Okumura's attacking spirit and strong physique are truly admirable."

### The Chongqing Side Is Extremely Disturbed After the Sino-Japanese Alliance, The People Unanimously Yearn for Peace

Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) - This conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty seems to have greatly disturbed the Chongqing side, so the Chongqing authorities have maintained a silent attitude and have not made any statement to this day. At present, Chongqing, whether politically, militarily, economically, or socially, has fallen into a difficult position from which it cannot extricate itself. It merely hopes for the shifting of the world war situation and the international situation, relying on external forces to prolong its life. The results of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Chongqing Kuomintang are the best proof of the worsening situation it is in. However, Chongqing has not yet taken any positive measures to solve the difficult situation of rising prices and rampant inflation. It is using Chiang Kai-shek's assumption of the chairmanship as a deceptive policy, and so-called post-war construction and other sweet words to deceive the people. At the same time, although the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Chongqing Kuomintang decided to implement constitutional government within one year after the war, it no longer mentions the implementation of its Four Northwestern Constructions and price countermeasures. This is enough to prove the political ills of Chongqing. In terms of military affairs, its combat strength is declining day by day. Although the Chongqing side is eager to seize Burma to determine the path of Chongqing's survival, it has been struck by the Japanese army's operation in the Nu River in Yunnan Province, and its connection with the British and American forces has been cut off. The Chongqing side is now in a forced situation where external assistance is cut off, and it admits that it is unable to solve this difficult situation, and is merely seeking to rely on external forces to prolong its time. This fragility has caused great turmoil among the powerful classes supporting the war of resistance, and the people's hearts are exhausted due to the bleak prospects of the war of resistance, and they are all looking forward to peace. Recently, a certain official of the Chongqing side who arrived in the Lunan peace zone stated that the people of Chongqing are mostly looking forward to the arrival of peace. The anti-Japanese theories of the Chongqing intellectuals have been shaken by the concretization of Japan's new policy towards China. Guilin, the central city of southwestern China, is also full of hope for peace, and the impact of this Sino-Japanese alliance treaty on Chongqing is even deeper. This time, if Chairman Wang denounces Chongqing's war of resistance, it will be known that its war of resistance is not for China, but for Britain and the United States, which will inevitably cause strong opposition from the people.

### British Aircraft Shot Down Over Yangon

A certain base in Myanmar, 3rd (Central News Agency) - At 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, the British Air Force sent a new, fast reconnaissance aircraft, the "Mosquito," to invade the airspace over Yangon. It was immediately intercepted by a new Japanese fighter aircraft and shot down. It is reported that the British reconnaissance aircraft was originally intended to be made into a light bomber to bomb Germany, but it did not achieve any results, so the plan was changed to make it into a twin-engine wooden reconnaissance aircraft, which first appeared in the skies over the India-Myanmar border in July. This reconnaissance aircraft claimed by the British is powerless before the new Japanese fighter aircraft.

### Overseas Chinese in Penang Contribute to Aircraft Purchase, Japanese Medical Doctors Association Also Donates Money

Penang, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The local Overseas Chinese Association had previously prepared to donate funds for the manufacture of fighter planes. It has now raised 300,000 yuan, and after the completion of the Meiji Day celebration ceremony on the 3rd, Lian Yuxiang, the chairman of the Overseas Chinese Association, presented it to Governor Itami.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Medical Doctors Association initiated the presentation of a military aircraft named "Medical Care" to the government. It has now received donations from medical doctors across Japan, and presented 120,000 yen to the Army and Navy ministries. The presentation ceremony for this military aircraft was held at 2:00 PM on the 3rd

### Chongqing Is Deeply Dissatisfied With Britain and the United States

Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency)

The Chongqing side is deeply dissatisfied with the lack of sincerity of Britain and the United States in assisting Chongqing. The Chongqing organ newspaper, the Central Daily News, recently published an article criticizing Britain's cold attitude. The main points are as follows: Since American senators returned home after inspecting the front lines, they have stated that Britain has not made sufficient efforts to assist Chongqing, and we deeply agree with this. In addition to criticizing Britain's irresponsible attitude, we also hope that Britain will express itself on this matter. In addition, Britain adds British marks to the military equipment loaned by the United States to Austria and sends it to other countries in an attempt to gain an advantageous position after the war, and we are extremely unhappy with this behavior.

Japan takes morality as the foundation and treats our country as equals. Our country should unite with it and move towards the revolutionary ideal together to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will. This signing of the alliance treaty is the culmination of the development of Sino-Japanese relations.

### The Soviet Army Captured Crimea But Faced Strong German Resistance; Landing Forces on the Kerch Peninsula Were Annihilated

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced the Eastern Front situation on the 2nd as follows: German forces launched a successful counterattack north of Kryvyi Rih and thwarted the Soviet attempt to land in Crimea; Soviet forces attempted to land on both sides of the Kerch Peninsula on the Eastern Front. German forces encircled and annihilated the Soviet forces at one location, forcing them into a small area. German forces also heavily damaged Soviet forces at other landing sites; German forces continued to fight Soviet mechanized units attacking in the southern Nohai Steppe downstream of the Dnieper River.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: The center of the autumn battle on the Eastern Front is currently south of Kryvyi Rih, where both sides are engaged in a war of attrition with large tank units and artillery. The outcome is unpredictable. Both sides have transferred reinforcements. The battle in this area, as well as the battles north of Kryvyi Rih, in the Nohai Steppe, and in the Kerch Strait, should be regarded as part of the large battle currently underway. The Soviet forces are attempting to isolate the Crimean Peninsula by blockading it from the north and attacking it from the east, but the German forces have apparently anticipated this development. Powerful Soviet forces attempting to land on both sides of the Kerch Peninsula were almost completely annihilated before they even reached the coast. The Soviet forces protecting the operation failed to establish a beachhead. As a result, the Soviet forces only completed their landing at one location. It is expected that the Soviet forces will continue to attempt to land in the future, so the eastern coast of the peninsula seems to have been strongly defended by the German forces. The situation north of Crimea is not optimistic for the Soviet forces either. The German command does not have any reason to withdraw from Crimea. Regarding this point, the Soviet claim to have conquered Perekop has not been confirmed by the German forces. It is possible that a few scattered Soviet tanks are operating in the nearby flat, treeless area. But even if this is the case, these tanks would encounter strong German obstacles in the Perekop Isthmus. The main force of enemy motorized units continues to target the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, which raises a number of interesting possibilities within a certain scope.

### German Forces Continuously Counterattacking on the West Bank of the Dnieper River

However, Soviet military officials continue to remain silent on this point, as they do on the German victory north of Kryvyi Rih. But the figures contained in the Soviet war report on Tuesday provide some clues. What is even more noteworthy is that the German losses north of Kryvyi Rih were actually very light. Although the fighting in the area lasted for many days, the German command did not need to reorganize its forces.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: On Monday, the focus of the fighting in the Dnieper River bend remained north of Kryvyi Rih, where German harassment teams annihilated scattered Soviet units. Prior to this, the connection between these Soviet units and their main force had been severed, and they were hiding in deep valleys. According to current reports, 21 Soviet tanks were destroyed in this military operation, including three of the heaviest type. At the same time, the spearheads of the German tanks continued to attack fiercely and made further gains on the ground. The fierce fighting between the Saksagan River and the Inhulets River continues. In one area alone, approximately 12,000 Soviet soldiers were killed, which shows the intensity of the fighting in the area in the past week and the heavy losses suffered by the Soviet forces. German forces captured more than 5,000 Red Army prisoners and seized a large number of tanks and artillery, as detailed in the German war report on Tuesday. The Soviet forces' attempts to attack fiercely to the southwest and northwest in the Kryvyi Rih area in order to relieve their oppressed main force were completely ineffective.

Tug-of-War Continues in the Nohai Steppe

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to the Overseas Chinese News Agency: The German counterattack in the Great Dnieper bend is still gradually progressing. German reinforcements are continuously arriving at the front line, so the German attack power will continue to increase. The Soviet forces that have penetrated into the Nohai Steppe have not made much progress either. German forces have established positions on the edge of the steppe to prevent enemy forces from entering Crimea and crossing the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. Although these positions were subjected to the most severe pressure on Monday, they have not collapsed. In the main part of the steppe, the mobile units of the Soviet and German forces are engaged in a tug-of-war. In the course of the fighting, the Soviet forces continue to advance towards the mouth of the Dnieper River. The Soviet landing operation in the Kerch Strait cannot be considered successful from the perspective of the overall war situation. On Monday, the Soviet forces launched local attacks within the area from Kryvyi Rih to Minsk and Smolensk on the Eastern Front, especially fierce to the east of a certain auxiliary area and southwest of Gomel, but the enemy forces have not gained anything.

### Light Snow Has Fallen on the Northern Section of the Eastern Front; Climate in the South Is Deteriorating

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: The weather in the southern part of the Eastern Front has deteriorated, but military activity has not been affected. The muddy season in the north has gradually begun, slowing down military operations in the area. There have even been reports of light snow in some places.

### The Situation of the Coal Mine Strike by Lewis and Ickes: Severe Fuel Shortage in Various Parts of the US

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Washington reports that Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, conferred with US Secretary of the Interior Ickes on Tuesday regarding the coal mine strike. Only a small number of miners returned to work on Tuesday. In Pennsylvania, only 28,000 out of 80,000 miners resumed work.

Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Washington reports that Roosevelt issued an order to the eastern coal miners on the 1st, instructing them to cease striking. However, these miners showed a defiant attitude towards the President's order, taking concerted action and continuing the strike. Miners who were working also joined the strike. As a result, a general strike of 530,000 workers in the coal mine workers' union has formed. Except for some workers affiliated with the American Federation of Labor who continue to work, coal mining in eastern America has completely stopped. Roosevelt set the deadline for ending the strike at the morning of the 3rd. The striking workers stated that unless the union headquarters issued an order to end the strike, they would not cease striking even if the President designated a deadline for resumption of work. Therefore, the attitude of union president Lewis is attracting great attention. Lewis met twice on the 2nd with Ickes, the Director of the Fuel Administration, who is responsible for government-controlled coal mines. At the same time, the union's policy committee further postponed its decision for three days. Prior to the formation of this general strike, there had already been a prolonged strike, so from the first day of the general strike, the US has been experiencing a severe fuel shortage. Coal for steelmaking in Birmingham relies on the supply from coal mines in West Alabama. Currently, due to the coal shortage, smelting furnaces have been shut down. Major cities across the US, including New England and Pittsburgh, are reporting a shortage of civilian coal. For example, New York's civilian coal reserves are only enough for the next two or three days. According to observations from the coal mine owners, even if the miners return to work on the morning of the 3rd according to Roosevelt's orders, it will take at least a week for the coal mines to return to their pre-strike state. Fuel Administration Director Ickes issued a freeze order on the 2 million tons of coal currently being transported on the 2nd, and decided to suspend allocations to coal storage operators from the 10th, and to strengthen restrictions on civilian coal allocations to prevent any contingency.

### US Officials Deny Freezing Argentine Funds

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports from New York that officials have stated that the US has not frozen the funds of Argentine banks. This is in response to yesterday's report that the US Treasury Department had frozen the assets of two Argentine banks in Washington.

### The National Government Promotes a Decisive Economic War: Interview with Minister of Industry Chen by Japanese Journalists

The National Government's economic policy is gradually establishing a genuine wartime economy through the compulsory purchase of cotton yarn, cloth, and rice. During the recent reshuffle of ministerial-level figures in the National Government, Chairman Wang resolutely replaced the Minister of Industry, the authority responsible for economic measures. This illustrates the National Government's determination to implement wartime economic measures. Therefore, the aspirations of the new Minister of Industry, Mr. Chen Junhui, are of utmost importance in terms of the future direction of the National Government's economic policies. Mr. Miyamori, a reporter from the Mainichi Shimbun, met with the new minister and learned of his aspirations regarding the current economic situation and future policies.

Q: The National Government's wartime economic measures have taken a genuine first step with the compulsory purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. What are your views on the actual situation of the economic world?

A: The outline for the wartime economy was decided at the beginning of this year, which shows the general picture of the wartime economic policy. The question is how to realize it. In the future, to promote wartime economic policies, first, we will focus on the spirit of the decree and complete the increase in production of necessities and the adjustment of supply and demand of materials. Second, we will strengthen private economic institutions to adapt to the wartime economic system, and officials and civilians will cooperate to vigorously promote the wartime economic policy. Third, the relevant government authorities, from planning to implementation, from the central to the local level, will strengthen the content of various institutions in both vertical and horizontal aspects, and further tighten the relationship between various agencies, so as to take a consistent pace and promote policies towards common goals.

Q: The National General Chamber of Commerce is the central organization for the National Government to implement wartime economic policies. How to make good use of it seems to be the key to the success or failure of the National Government's economic policy. What are the improvement plans?

A: In order to operate the General Chamber of Commerce and to establish a close relationship with the National Government, the following three points must be implemented:

First, under the guidance of the government, the General Chamber of Commerce should exert the automatic control spirit and dynamic power of the private sector, and use it for the purchase and allocation of materials and the increase in production, so as to implement the wartime economic policy. Second, the government should give substantial assistance to the General Chamber of Commerce, and at the same time, the General Chamber of Commerce should also make its best efforts to the government. In this way, the completion of the wartime economic policy can be expected, and the reality of official-civilian cooperation can be realized. Third, the government is promoting the implementation of wartime economic policies and actively implementing the strengthening of administrative institutions. Future reforms will be implemented one by one based on actual needs. However, the unification of policies, the adjustment of pace, and the consistency of intentions are indispensable conditions.
Q: For example, regarding the compulsory purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, how can this spirit of authoritarian control help improve people's livelihoods? It seems necessary to make concrete efforts to show this to the public.

A: It is most important for the public to understand the controlled economy. The public must fully understand the policy and understand it through implementation based on facts. Therefore, we must continue to present the facts and actively promote publicity and enlightenment. In terms of publicity work, make them understand the Greater East Asia War and restrain individual interests during wartime.

Q: How will the types of controlled commodities be expanded and the scope of regions expanded after cotton yarn and cloth?

A: To promote wartime economic policies, we must strengthen the controlled economy. Therefore, first, we will implement the principle of centralism and implement control around this center. Second, the conditions for implementing full control in China are not yet fully available, so we hope to actively carry out preparatory work to complete all conditions. Third, we must quickly complete the implementation of the economic control plan under the wartime system. Therefore, the government hopes to start with simple and feasible parts, make its best efforts, and implement strong control.

Q: What is the actual situation of Chinese national capital? Also, what are your thoughts on the ideal of restoring industry and Sino-Japanese division of labor?

A: There are two questions here. One is the utilization of factories returned by the Japanese side, and the other is the issue of the use of national capital necessary for this. Utilizing national capital is the most important task. Therefore, we must eliminate the various conditions that hinder factory operation. That is to say, through the rationalization of investment, to ensure profits, supplement raw materials and fuels, promote the exchange of materials between industry and agriculture, to seek the rational allocation of material procurement, allocation, and production. Especially, the development of Shanghai's industry and the exchange of materials with the interior are the most important prerequisites. Currently, the revival of Shanghai's industry is slow. As for the Sino-Japanese division of labor, of course, China engages in light industry and Japan engages in heavy industry. However, in the current situation in China, many people do not understand the distinction between so-called heavy industry and light industry. Therefore, some people think, to what extent can China do heavy industry, and can China not do the heavy industry that China can do on its own?

Q: The controlled economy uses power to grasp the economy. Power depends on credibility. To achieve practical results, it depends on whether there is clean politics to implement the controlled economy. What are the methods?

A: To promote the controlled economy, the thoroughness of clean politics is an indispensable condition. Therefore, in the passive aspect, the government has already formulated punishment laws, and hopes to thoroughly implement them in the future. In the active aspect, improve the treatment of civil servants and strengthen supervision and guidance to various agencies, hoping to obtain the results of clean politics from this. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen political training for civil servants, such as the New National Movement.

Q: What are the National Government's hopes for Japan in the promotion of economic policies?

A: First, the implementation of the New China Policy is most appreciated by the Chinese people, and we hope to further implement this spirit. Second, eliminating the regional economy existing in China is what the people unanimously hope for. Third, increasing production is the most important countermeasure. In terms of technology, transportation, and other aspects, we hope to provide the greatest assistance within the possible range. (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, October 21st)

### US Labor Union Congress Demands Repeal of Two Bills

Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Philadelphia reports that the American Federation of Labor Congress recently held its sixth annual meeting here and resolved to demand that the government immediately repeal the No-Strike Act and the Universal Low-Wage Iron Factory Wage Act. The main points of the two proposals are as follows: Repeal the No-Strike Act. Observing the government's brutal expansion of actions against labor unions is tantamount to indicating the dangers of democracy and the future of the war. The establishment of such legislation is detrimental to the patriotism of workers and the unity of the nation. The government should immediately abolish this evil law. Repeal the Universal Low-Wage Iron Factory Wage Act. The people have great expectations for a sound and stable economic policy, but it is unfortunate that it has not yet been realized. At a time when a strong price policy and a comprehensive allocation system are implemented before taxation is implemented, workers' wages must be adjusted from time to time. The government should abandon the stabilization wage policy based on the universal low-wage iron factory wage law.

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) - London reports that 10,000 female workers and other workers in an engine manufacturing factory in Glasgow, England, began a strike on the 1st due to demands for improved treatment. Although the General Federation of Trade Unions immediately carried out appeasement work, more than 10,000 workers also joined the strike.

### Republican Party Wins US State Elections

### Spanish Government Appoints Chargé d'Affaires to China

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Spanish government recently appointed Kong Shi Lei Xi Ge Li Ya Li Bo Si, the first secretary of the Spanish embassy in Manchukuo and concurrently Chargé d'Affaires, as the interim Chargé d'Affaires to China. Spanish Foreign Minister Yueh Tan Na recently sent a special telegram to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government for reference.

### Argentina Expresses Strict Neutrality

Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Argentine Foreign Minister General Gilberto recently said in an interview with a reporter from a Chilean newspaper stationed there that Argentina does not want to be an enemy of any country in the world. Therefore, Argentina will maintain complete and absolute neutrality. This attitude of Argentina is not unique. For example, the Soviet Union has not declared war on Japan. In Europe, there are Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, and even Ireland that continue to adhere firmly to neutrality. Turkey also adopts the same policy. Therefore, Argentina has no reason not to adopt this same neutral policy, and this policy is completely consistent with the psychology of the Argentine people. Argentina is willing to be friends with anyone. Only countries that infringe on Argentina's sovereignty and dignity will Argentina sever diplomatic relations with. Argentina is independent in handling its own affairs and has no external pressure. The current government is the strongest government it has ever been.

### Relations between Japan and the Soviet Union Remain Unchanged

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency), Huitong News Agency reports from London that well-informed sources in Moscow strongly state that Japanese-Soviet relations will not change due to the anti-Axis cooperation decided at the Moscow Conference.

### Results of the Moscow Conference: A Diplomatic Victory for the Soviet Union; Several Points of the Four-Nation Declaration are Worthy of Attention

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - As a result of the Moscow talks between representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, a joint four-nation declaration and a joint communique between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union were issued. The following points are noteworthy: In the four-nation joint declaration, the Chongqing side is merely a figurehead. Although Fu Bingchang, the Chongqing Ambassador to the Soviet Union, is nominally included, the joint declaration and the joint communique do not involve the position or interests of the Chongqing side, but only attempt to deal with it with abstract and general decisions. It is only natural that the Chongqing side was not invited to the talks. Its status in the joint declaration is only formal and subordinate. The joint declaration and the joint communique only discuss European issues and do not touch on East Asian issues at all. This is clear evidence that the Moscow talks downplayed the status of the Chongqing side and made no concrete decisions on East Asian issues. As recognized in the joint communique, many of the proposals put forward at the trilateral talks have not yet been resolved, such as the so-called "attached committees" delegated to future diplomatic handling. The issue of the second front was not clearly studied. The so-called "military issues that have been decided" in the joint communique are undoubtedly centered on the Soviet Union's demands. Regarding the results of the discussion of political issues proposed by the UK and the US, key points such as southwestern Europe, South Asia, and Northern Europe were avoided, and only issues of Italy and Germany and the Austrian issue, which the Soviet Union considered unimportant, were raised. This is also the Soviet Union's intention to suppress the UK and the US, and the discussion of political issues stopped midway. In short, the results of the Moscow talks were the same as expected beforehand, a diplomatic victory for the Soviet Union. In other words, the UK and the US have always followed the Soviet Union. What has troubled the UK and the US the most is that the "Hull-Molotov talks" issue, which had the greatest expectations for this meeting, did not yield any results, and only a joint declaration was issued with the empty names of the three gentlemen. From this point of view, it can be said that this meeting has been half a failure.

Effectiveness of the Agreement

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Washington reports that a spokesperson for the US State Department declared on Wednesday that although the agreement signed in Moscow has not been ratified, it has the same effect as a treaty in international law for each signatory country, as do the details regarding the implementation of the agreement.

German Commentary

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German Foreign Office expressed its views on the Moscow Conference communique on the 2nd as follows: The Moscow Conference communique is the UK and the US surrendering to the Soviet Union's hegemony in Europe, confirming that the whole of Europe is succumbing to communist forces. Judging from the content of this communique, it can be seen that the policies of the UK and the US have completely failed. This communique does not mention European countries that have interests related to the Soviet Union, but instead raises the issue of Austria. However, Austria became part of Germany in 1938 based on the free vote of the people. This is the principle of democratic voting and merging with Germany after the world war, but the UK and the US believe that the results of the people's vote are contrary to the Treaty of Versailles, so they declare it invalid. The Atlantic Charter touts national self-determination, but does not respect the will of the people of the country, and strongly demands so-called "freedom of a democratic nature," which is difficult for the world to understand. The communique criticizes the German army and the National Socialist Party, but considering the fact that the Soviet army massacred a large number of Polish soldiers in the Katyn Forest, this criticism is a shameless statement. German newspapers also wrote separate criticisms on the 2nd. The Hamburg "Hamburger Fremdenblatt" stated that the communique listed various words and phrases and is a strange document. The points not mentioned in the communique are perhaps more important than those mentioned, and it does not fundamentally mention the proposals on which the representatives of the three countries could not agree. In particular, no agreement was made regarding the Soviet Union's borders, which is clear evidence of the UK and the US succumbing to the Soviet Union. Some members of the German public also said that this communique was as expected, focusing on the psychological warfare aspect. From a military and political point of view, there were no results. The results of this meeting have determined that the most powerful party in the anti-Axis camp is the Soviet Union.

Romania is Deeply Concerned

Bucharest, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Romanian political figures commented on the final communique of the Moscow Conference, saying that because Romania is one of the small countries bordering the Soviet Union on the west, it is greatly affected by the territorial proposals decided at the Moscow Conference. The Soviet Army newspaper "Red Star" once said that after defeating Finland, the Red Army did not consider itself satisfied. Therefore, the Romanian newspaper pointed out that neighboring countries all shared the same fate as Finland.

### German Troops Deploy Trapezoidal Defense Line in Italian Mountain Area; British and American Advances are Slow

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced the battle situation in southern Italy: US troops launched several offensives in the area west of the Volturno River in the evening, which were repelled. East of the river, enemy troops were tracking the rearguard units of the German army that were retreating, and were heavily damaged by heavy artillery and aircraft bombing.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: From Monday to noon on Tuesday, the situation along the Adriatic coast and the Trigno River remained unchanged. On the left wing of the British Eighth Army in the central Apennine Mountains, activities began again, but they only advanced a few kilometers, and had not yet crossed the line from Cartaluho to Fresoione as of Monday. The British vanguard advancing towards Isernia was blocked by German artillery fire, but the main force continued to push forward. To their left, part of the US Fifth Army attempted to encircle the German troops occupying Mount Miletto, in order to eliminate the threat to the flank of the US troops in the Volturno Valley. The US troops continued to attack Venefro on Monday without progress. The center of the US Fifth Army is now attacking Mount Croce. After occupying Teano, they were unable to continue advancing along the foothills. In the battle of Teano, the US military suffered heavy losses, with 21 tanks destroyed. In the coastal area of ​​the Gulf of Gaeta, the left wing of the US troops temporarily stopped advancing after crossing the small city of Montella, but the artillery and assault teams intensified their activities, which are expected to be a prelude to a general offensive. In general, the German army has deployed a trapezoidal array along the mountains, equipped with new heavy weapons. It will be difficult for the enemy to cross.

### Anti-Axis Aircraft Attack Southeastern Germany

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Yesterday, enemy aircraft attacked southeastern Germany. There were some civilian casualties and damage to buildings. Seven enemy aircraft were shot down. German forces also attacked military targets in the London area last night.

Budapest, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: The Hungarian official news agency stated that several formations of British and American aircraft flew over the western border of Hungary at noon on Tuesday, and then flew to the northwest. The enemy aircraft later returned along the original route. There have been some bomb drops reported.

### Results of the South African Union Elections

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to the results of the South African Union elections, the Government Party and the parties supporting the Government Party are in the majority in three provinces, while the Nationalist Party has an advantage in the Orange Free State.

### British and Turkish Foreign Ministers Hold Meeting in Cairo; US Ambassador to Turkey Will Also Participate

Ankara, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, and Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu left Ankara for Cairo, where they will meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden.

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) - London Radio announced today that when British Foreign Secretary Eden and the Turkish Foreign Minister meet in Cairo, the US Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, will also participate. Steinhardt stayed in the US for several weeks and only set off to return to his post last Monday.

### Special Edition on the Burma Campaign: Overview of the Burmese Theater

Mountbatten Convenes Meeting

Upon assuming office as the new Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia, Lord Mountbatten immediately convened a military conference in New Delhi. Present were British and Indian military commanders, including General Auchinleck, Air Marshal Peirse, Admiral Somerville, Vice-Admiral Godfrey, Major General Davidson (Commander of the U.S. Tenth Air Force stationed in India), General Stilwell (Commander of U.S. Forces in the China-Burma-India Theater stationed in Chongqing), Song Ziwen (Foreign Minister of the Chongqing government), liaison officers, and many others. The conference focused on the recovery of Burma and coordinated the Allied counter-offensive strategy in East Asia. Subsequently, on the 16th, he invited Lieutenant General Sir Henry Pownall, Chief of Staff of the Southeast Asia Command, to a meeting on "Operations in the Southeast Asian Theater." The headquarters of the Southeast Asia Command is clearly actively engaged. This Allied counter-offensive in East Asia is based solely on the common views of Britain and the United States at the Quebec Conference. Its scale is undoubtedly far greater than the Arakan offensive this spring. It is not difficult to imagine this. But how exactly are the British, American, and Chongqing forces preparing to implement their counter-offensive plan? Let us examine the enemy's intelligence, assess their strength, and review their operational plans.

Enemy Force Estimates

According to reliable sources, the enemy's forces currently in India include hundreds of thousands of British troops, three divisions of the Chongqing Expeditionary Force stationed in India (approximately 50,000 men), 30,000 U.S. troops stationed in India, and an air force consisting of five squadrons of the British Royal Air Force and one division of the U.S. Air Force, totaling approximately 1,500 aircraft. However, this entire force is not entirely concentrated in the Southeast Asian theater.

Approximately 200,000 ground troops are deployed east of Calcutta, with approximately 150,000 in the eastern sector and 50,000 from Chongqing. Similarly, approximately 500 aircraft are also deployed in the eastern sector.

Enemy's Future Strategy

With this force, the enemy may attempt to break through the Nu River front in the north, connecting the Arakan Mountains, the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar Islands, the Sabang, Nias, and Mentawai Islands – the weakest point in the Japanese arc-shaped defense line. However, the enemy must disperse their forces. Will they attempt to break through Arakan? Or launch a landing operation in southern Burma? Perhaps use the Andaman, Nicobar, or Mentawai Islands to strike at Sumatra, concentrating their attack there. However, the natural barriers of the Arakan peaks do not allow for large-scale, rapid operations by the enemy's forces. The enemy's invasion routes are limited to two: the Imphal route directly to the Kaladan River in central Arakan, and the coastal route south from Chittagong via Cox's Bazar and Teknaf. Moreover, the wounds from the British-Indian army's "Arakan tragedy" this spring have not yet healed. How dare they contemplate challenging Arakan head-on again? If so, where will the 150,000 troops concentrated on the eastern Indo-Burmese border and the southern Indian army find their point of attack? Regarding this matter, a Reuters dispatch on August 25, titled "Southeast Pacific Allied Operations," offers the following observations:

Ensuring Naval Supremacy in the Bay of Bengal

Recapturing the Nicobar and Andaman Islands

Surprise Landing on the Burmese Coast

It also points out that Admiral Lord Mountbatten, a renowned expert in surprise landing operations, has assumed command of the Southeast Asia Command, emphasizing the possibility of the southern Indian army launching an offensive against the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Enemy broadcasts also claim that they have heavy troop concentrations between Calcutta and Chittagong and have made thorough preparations for air power, which is crucial to the success of a landing operation. However, the "Ethnic Weekly" in the United Kingdom expresses a pessimistic view regarding the maritime transport for the landing force's supply lines, stating:

Landings Are Extremely Difficult

"Supplying landing forces is extremely difficult, at most securing a small bridgehead militarily." If a large-scale naval offensive is launched from Ceylon or southern India, a single division's offensive would require an estimated 300,000 tons of shipping. If 200,000 troops are involved, at least 5 million tons of shipping would be needed. However, the Indian Ocean fleet alone is definitely not sufficient for navigation. It would be necessary to reinforce with the British Mediterranean Fleet, which is currently operating in the eastern Mediterranean. To complete all preparations would take at least until the end of this year, so the offensive would not be possible until the beginning of next year. If the offensive target is, as Reuters suggests, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, we can infer the following points from the distances involved. From Ceylon to the Andaman Islands is 1,080 kilometers, and to the Nicobar Islands is 1,150 kilometers. If Calcutta is used as the base, then it is 1,180 kilometers to the Andaman Islands and 1,570 kilometers to the Nicobar Islands. Based on our air power, Japan has already secured more than twice the advantage of the enemy. The enemy's reliance on aircraft carrier supply would be entirely under the fierce power of Japanese land-based aircraft, leaving them no other way out.

### Anglo-American Struggle for Command

Since arriving in New Delhi two weeks ago, Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia Lord Mountbatten, in addition to appointing his chief of staff and other personnel, has convened military conferences with military experts in the region daily. He also traveled to Chongqing to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, but the purpose was merely for publicity. A Berlin newspaper published an article on the 24th titled "Mountbatten's Operations and Possibilities," the gist of which is as follows:

Mountbatten's Shadow

Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia, Lord Mountbatten, has been in office for nearly two months, and only recently arrived in New Delhi. Upon arrival, he immediately convened military conferences with the heads of the army, navy, and air force in the region daily. However, Commander of the Southwest Pacific Area General MacArthur neither accepted the invitation to attend nor sent a representative. Furthermore, Chongqing did not send a representative. It can be inferred that the command scope of Churchill's newly appointed "military genius" Mountbatten does not extend to the entire East Asian Allied forces. Moreover, the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which is necessary for the Allied operations against Japan, is naturally under the command of its commander, Admiral Nimitz, and is unwilling to be under Mountbatten's command. Therefore, the Allied operations in East Asia are actually commanded by MacArthur, Chiang Kai-shek, Nimitz, and Mountbatten. The appointment of Mountbatten as Supreme Commander, so painstakingly decided at the Quebec Conference, has no practical significance whatsoever. From this, it can be seen that there is a deep and insurmountable divide between the British and American armies. The Anglo-American Allied plan for attacking Japan is extremely chaotic in terms of command.

The Overall Situation in Four Theaters

Secondly, the Anglo-American forces have four bases for attacking Japan: the Aleutian Islands, mainland China, the Southwest Pacific, and eastern India. These battle lines span tropical regions and areas near the Arctic Circle. The regions are vast, and replenishment becomes a problem first in the Burma campaign and the South Pacific campaign. Furthermore, operations in the Aleutian Islands are only possible for two months in the summer, and operations in the Burmese border area are impossible during the rainy season. Due to these climatic constraints, the Anglo-American desire for a simultaneous offensive on all fronts is absolutely impossible. The Anglo-Americans greatly overestimate Chongqing's strength, harboring the dream of using it as a base to bomb the Japanese mainland in the future. However, the Chongqing forces, which recently launched counter-offensives in Shandong and Zhejiang provinces, were soon defeated by the Japanese army. This fact proves that the Chongqing forces cannot be considered a strong ally of the Anglo-Americans today. To effectively promote the Chongqing forces, it is necessary to drive the Japanese army out of Burma and secure the supply line to Chongqing. But that is impossible today.

Among the aforementioned four battle lines, the only one actively engaged today is the Southwest Pacific front commanded by MacArthur. This has been ongoing for over a year and has no direct connection to the Quebec Conference. Just how fiercely MacArthur's forces are fighting in this area can be seen by the fact that, since the counter-offensive began on Guadalcanal Island last August, it has been over a year, and to this day, the number of landing sites they have secured can be counted on one's fingers. In the Guadalcanal landing battle alone, the Allied forces suffered tens of thousands of casualties, and the Australian army suffered extremely heavy losses in the Buna area. It took 23 days to cover the short distance from the Moresby airfield to Buna. The forest battle of Salamaua took six weeks and cost the lives of 5,000 Australian soldiers. These are all facts that speak louder than words. Furthermore, the Japanese army skillfully retreats and ambushes the enemy at another location, so MacArthur's battles are extremely difficult. On the other hand, on the Burmese front, chastened by the disastrous defeats of April and May this year, they dare not act rashly.

The Anglo-American Navy Will Face Crisis

London believes that strong naval support is indispensable in the Burmese campaign. Since the surrender of the Italian navy, the British Mediterranean Fleet has been able to transfer a sizable fleet to the Far East, but it is still unable to independently confront the Japanese navy. For the Southwest Pacific operation, the U.S. Navy constantly hopes that the British fleet will be relocated to the Far East. From this fact, one can see the painful situation of the U.S. Navy since the Pearl Harbor attack. As for the main force of the Japanese Navy, it remains intact to this day. With the best training in the world and backed by the Japanese people with their vigorous fighting spirit, the Japanese Navy's foundation is stable and unshakable. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox once said that he could subjugate Japan in three months if war were declared. But in these two years, Knox has learned many lessons and now even says that the Anglo-American navy is in danger of being annihilated by the Japanese navy. Knox clearly understands that the Anglo-American offensive against Japan will require an unexpectedly enormous sacrifice. Knox's anxiety now casts a shadow on Mountbatten's operational plans.

### Impressions of Traveling North with the Inspection Group to Manchukuo

— Huang Wan

The Propaganda Department organized a Chinese journalist inspection group to Manchukuo last month, gathering reporters from newspapers in Beijing, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Anhui, and other places, a group of seven people, who arrived safely in Beijing and Shanghai a few days ago. I was honored to participate on behalf of this newspaper and also returned to Shanghai yesterday. I will briefly record my impressions of this trip as follows:

Warm Climate in the North

"I haven't traveled by train for six years. This time, I was sent to Manchukuo for sightseeing, traveling with an eye disease. Fortunately, the climate in the north is warm this winter, and I didn't feel cold. I only stayed in Manchukuo for half a month, passing through cities such as Xinjing, Jilin, Qiqihar, Fengtian, and Anshan, with the shortest stay of four hours and the longest of four days in each place. The daily itinerary was arranged early, a superficial observation, with very few opportunities for individual browsing. Moreover, my eye disease and foot problems made it difficult to walk. If I said I understood Manchukuo, it would be a lie. But I can't say that this trip left me with no impressions at all. Our first impression upon arriving in Manchukuo was the spirit of hard work and struggle shared by the government and the people, which gave it the atmosphere of an emerging country. Wherever we went, we were warmly welcomed and entertained by the authorities and the literary and artistic circles. We were also grateful to Mr. Luo Zhongliang, a special affairs officer of the Information Department, who guided us all the way, allowing us to sincerely interact with various circles and increase our knowledge. The feeling of loving their [Manchukuo's] prosperity is becoming increasingly universal.

The Whole Country is Advancing

We witnessed the real situation of Manchukuo after eleven years: (1) The security of peace; (2) The reform of domestic affairs; (3) The integrity of officials; (4) The improvement of education; (5) The development of industry; (6) The revitalization of crafts. Administrative affairs are concentrated in the General Affairs Office, practicing a wartime system that is unified and effective. From top to bottom, everyone is working hard for nation-building. The atmosphere of harmony is very strong, which coincides with the hard-working spirit of the Chinese people. Everywhere, we experienced the diligence and hard work of the people of Manchukuo, which was astounding. Manchukuo has its own methods for solving problems. Daily necessities are fairly distributed by the government, and there is no black market for prices. They are consistently hoping that domestic production will be sufficient to meet the consumption of the entire nation. Because of the shortage of food, there are certain restrictions on people's diet. Civil servants eat barley and glutinous rice. Restaurants also have fixed hours, do not sell alcohol at noon, and only have one slice of bread and a bowl of coarse rice for each person at 4 pm. No refills are allowed. Generally, people wear coordinated clothes, put on a brocade belt, and that is considered formal wear. Women also mostly wear short, elegant, and simple clothes, with no extravagant phenomena such as perms or high heels. Wearing luxurious clothes would be despised.

A Glimpse of Prices

Under the rationing system, the poor and rich receive the same amount. Rice: 4 kilograms for children, 9 kilograms for those aged 11 to 25, 8 kilograms for those aged 26 to 40, and 7 kilograms for those aged 40 to 60. The rationed prices are quite low. In Manchukuo currency, sorghum is 9 fen per jin, first-class flour is 11.6 yuan per bag, salt is 1.5 jiao per jin, sugar is 4 jiao per jin, a large bundle of matches is 6 jiao, and Crane brand cigarettes are 1.8 jiao each. Leather for cattle is replaced with horsehide and pigskin, and wool is replaced with hemp. Coffee and milk are all replaced with substitutes. Hotels save on water, electricity, and fuel. Washing starts at 5 am. Those with families are not allowed to take long showers. During the day, horse-drawn carriages are used instead of rickshaws, along with buses and streetcars. At night, people have to walk.

Xinjing, a Modern City

The total population of Manchukuo is currently 43 million, with Han and Manchu people making up the majority. The writing, language, customs, and habits are all Chinese. They adopt a politics of benevolence, respect sacred teachings, and promote the inherent civilization of the East. Wangdao academies are established in each province to cultivate nation-building talents. Touring the entire city of Xinjing, after eleven years of construction, it has now grown into a modern city. There are many facilities that our country can learn from. Unfortunately, time was pressing, and what I saw was limited to eastern Manchukuo. Fortunately, I received photographs and reference materials from various people. When I have time in the future, I will write separate notes to share with my countrymen.

### Cutting Noodle Industry Requests Crackdown: Rice Shops Selling Cutting Noodles

In this city, there are approximately over one thousand merchants dealing in fragrant cutting noodles. Recently, due to the inability to obtain sufficient raw materials (wheat flour), the industry has been greatly affected. However, the entire industry, recognizing that cutting noodles are also a staple food for citizens and cannot be interrupted even for a day, have been painfully purchasing raw materials on the black market to continue production to meet market demand. Yesterday, according to the responsible person of the industry association, after various rice shops successively began to sell cutting noodles concurrently, ostensibly for the convenience of citizens easily cooking flour noodles, each of these rice shops has different methods, deducting the amount, and hoping to obtain undue profits. Without "Cutting Noodle Business Licenses," they are openly selling concurrently, which is clearly violating the authorities' regulations. Conversely, each member of our industry, due to legal constraints and consideration for the citizens' livelihoods, cannot but reluctantly manage the business, and now we are suffering a serious threat. If we are once forced to shut down, the livelihoods of thousands of workers will be unimaginable. Therefore, we specifically submit a petition to the authorities to effectively crack down on rice shops concurrently selling cutting noodles.

### Residence Certificates of Deceased Persons Should Be Returned Immediately

In order to ensure local security in all districts under its jurisdiction, the Second Cotton Inspection Bureau of this city has implemented the issuance of residence certificates under orders. Since its implementation, the public has generally prepared residence certificates. As a result, it is particularly difficult for villains to mix in. However, it has been found that when the person using the residence certificate dies, their relatives and children often do not immediately return the certificate, causing it to be lost into the hands of bad people, who replace the photo and use it, which is a serious violation of discipline. Therefore, the Bureau specifically ordered its subordinate branch bureaus and district police bureaus to strictly check residence certificates and, more strictly, to pursue and recover them after the death of the people, so as to eliminate evil.

Economic Circle Commentary

### Checking Commercial Fitness

The structure of a commercial organization is like the human body. It is necessary to check it from time to time to ensure its soundness. The items to be checked all have detailed regulations. For example, what is the weight? How is the heart activity? What is the blood pressure? How is the diet and digestion? These are all the guidelines that must be followed by those who examine the human body. The principles for checking commercial organizations are also the same; What is the capital? How is the operation? How much profit? What is the trading form? All of these are sufficient to show whether a commercial organization is normal or sound.

However, the doctor examines the body, and the individual maintains it. After the doctor's examination, it is necessary for the individual to set the rules to restrain the body and mind, in order to maintain the health of the body; Commercial organizations are also the same. For example, the recent self-discipline of banks, the repricing of various industries, the trading rules of the market, and the business rules of the stock exchange are all like the rules for individuals to restrain their body and mind. Now, let's take the details of the stock exchange industry as an example. The punishment regulations it stipulates cannot be said to be not strict. Point 7: "Spreading false rumors and using fraudulent transactions to shake the market," and Point 9: "Violating general commercial ethics and being recognized as losing credibility among the brokers of the exchange," directly reflect the two topics "Economic Toxins" and "Merchant Morality" discussed in this column before. The main purpose of its exhaustible operational malpractices is exactly what we have said, that is, after the stock exchange resumes formal trading, we must pay attention to how to prevent speculation and stabilize prices at any time, so as to make the stock market tend to the right track. Only then will the China Merchants Stock Exchange have a sound commercial fitness!

### 170+ New or Expanded Banks and Financial Institutions in This City in Four Months

Previously, the Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that new financial institutions in Shanghai have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain in recent years, including general banks and financial institutions with insufficient capital and unsound organization, feared that this would affect the entire finance under this wartime situation. In order to implement the management of financial institutions, it promulgated new measures to address the reorganization of general small financial institutions (such as banks and financial institutions), ordering the banking and financial industries to increase the amount of capital within six months from July 1st of this year. The capital of banks and financial institutions must be increased to at least 6 million yuan. According to the provisions of the Company Law (because financial institutions have been ordered to change to a limited company organization), one-half of the amount, that is, 3 million yuan, must be collected first before they can operate. Ordinary commercial banks engaged in agency business must have a minimum fee of 5 million yuan, of which 3 million yuan is the capital of the banking department and 1 million yuan is the capital of the trust department. If financial institutions do not increase their capital according to the amount within six months of receiving the order, they will be ordered to merge or close. It is now known that after receiving the order, various financial institutions have gathered to increase their capital. Up to now, 78 banks have increased their capital, and more than 100 financial institutions have done so. About 3% of the financial institutions are still preparing to increase their capital. It is expected that all financial institutions will be able to complete the increase in capital by the end of December.

Statistics on New Financial Institutions in This City

Since the Ministry of Finance has implemented the management of financial institution operations, the restrictions on new banks and financial institutions have been very strict. It is now known that from three years ago to the end of July this year, the statistics on new financial institutions in this city are as follows: 194 new banks and 51 new branch banks; 136 financial institutions.

### The Reality of Apprentice Life in Shenzhuang

— Ying Shi

I am an apprentice living in a Shenzhuang shop on the third floor. I am only seventeen years old this year. All day long, I hide in a room that is not exposed to sunlight all year round, doing mechanical slave work. One year, two years, three years, the giant wheel of time keeps moving forward, and my work is always so stereotyped, humble, and has never changed. After the suspension of export vessels on December 8th, the staff in the store either resigned or stopped working. Invisibility adds to the burden of work. I am responsible for everything from writing letters and calculating accounts, going to and from banks, to cooking and cooking, sweeping the floor, and everything else. In my spare time, I have to hold the children and squeeze the limited-price goods. I am really overwhelmed.

As for the salary? It is almost negligible. Although the price of rice has jumped from 10 yuan per load to nearly 20 yuan per load today, my monthly salary is still stuck at 20 yuan. How can this meager 20 yuan be used? I have tried my best to tighten my daily expenses, but fixed expenses such as haircuts, laundry, bathing, shoes, and socks, which are inevitable every month, always put pressure on me on a regular basis. As a result, I still have to borrow money.

However, how many relatives and friends are willing to lend you money when you are a young man who has just entered society? And—and unfortunately, it has to be repaid. Even if you lend it to you once, twice, or even three times, if you have no money to pay it back, will you be willing to lend it to you in the future? Ah! I absolutely dare not use reason to imagine what will happen in the future.

In this Shanghai city where merchants gather, there must be tens of millions of apprentices in the same situation as me, struggling with their own destiny in desperation, and eager for society to speak out for them!

Every time I see in the newspapers about raising donations for refugees and appealing for elementary school teachers, have we, this army of apprentices who have been trampled on by feudal ideas for many years, been forgotten by society? No, no, absolutely not. In this modern century where you are singing about human equality, there must be many people with new ideas who are calling for us. At the same time, I also hope that all walks of life will respond and use appropriate methods to adjust our lives.

### Implementation of the "Decisive Battle for Life" in North China

— Beiyan

The war is gradually entering its final stage, and adjusting wartime life is a pressing matter. In the last ten days of the new construction implementation work, the North China authorities held a "Decisive Battle for Life" campaign to promote new construction in North China, aiming to make the public understand the relationship between daily life and the war. This campaign started on the 21st of this month. Chairman Wang even telegraphed to the chief officials of the four provinces and three municipalities in North China, instructing them to prohibit banquets and drinking during the "Decisive Battle for Life" campaign, not to buy any non-essential items, and for public officials to avoid taking cars to and from work unless absolutely necessary. Chief Zhao of the Information Bureau also gave a moving speech on the radio for this campaign. The newspaper editorials also used this as a topic to express their high opinions. The importance of the "Decisive Battle for Life" campaign can be imagined.

Good Air Defense Results

Because of the epidemic prevention, Beijing temporarily suspended the long-prepared air defense exercise and let other cities in North China hold it. Now that the epidemic prevention has become a thing of the past, the news of the complete removal of the epidemic prevention measures has been published in the newspaper on the 22nd, and the epidemic prevention headquarters was officially dissolved on the 21st. As a result, the atmosphere of air defense has come again. The "New Beijing Daily" and "Mass Daily" also held an air defense speech contest to permeate the public with air defense ideas. There were as many as 18 applicants, and the first prize winner, Chen Xiaoshan, even received a bonus of 100 yuan. On the other hand, the police defense corps of the old capital also held a training review of the air defense groups, starting from the 22nd. On the morning of the first day, the first session of the first district was reviewed by Chen Xiong, a standing member of the corps headquarters, and Liu Julien, a standing member. The location was Wangfujing Street. In the afternoon, senior member Sun Yunzhang and Yamashita reviewed the third detachment of the third district in the east, located at Dongsi North Street. The review focused on the protection team members' fixed monitoring actions, fire prevention and firefighting actions, rescue actions, avoidance, and prone positions. It is said that "the results were all good." On the second day, the sixth district was reviewed in the morning and the fifth district in the afternoon. Needless to say, the results were also good. The newspaper also carried the news that the Municipal Government regularly holds air defense film festivals. It is said that this conference will be held on the 29th and 30th at the Central Zhenguang two film studios. In addition to the North China Film Company providing "films related to air defense knowledge such as Ape Sanji's Air Defense Battle and Air Defense Big Pear Incendiary Bomb", various agencies will also send people to give speeches.

Enemy Property Management Committee Established

Since the Nanjing National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, most of the British and American enemy properties in China that were confiscated by Japan have been returned by Japan to the Nanjing National Government for management. The enemy properties in North China will be managed by the North China authorities, which have decided to organize the North China Enemy Property Management Committee. The chairman is Wang Shi, the superintendent of the Ministry of Finance. The other standing committee members are Zhang Zhongzhi, the director of political affairs of the Political Affairs Committee, Zhu Shuyuan, the director of the Secretariat, and the directors of various General Offices. This committee has been prepared recently, and the inaugural meeting was held at the Ministry of Finance on the 18th of this month. The cultural institutions of British and American enemy properties in Beijing are mostly used by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. In addition to housing soldiers, Yenching University in the suburbs also runs a North China Comprehensive Survey and Research Institute. The Xiehe Hospital is used to house troops. Other primary and secondary schools, such as Jiao Ying Baiman, have been changed to municipal schools, and hospitals such as Daoji Tongren have also been changed to municipal hospitals. As for churches and YMCA, they continue to exist, and are either managed by the North China Christian Church.

Electricity Saving Campaign

Recently, people in Beijing often encounter the phenomenon of sudden dimming of electric lights when going out at night. According to the investigation, this is an intentional power-saving method by the electric light company, which divides the entire city into several districts and takes turns to dim the lights and cut off the current for 20 minutes. It can be seen that saving electricity has become a necessary measure in wartime North China. Not only are electric lights being limited, but recently the newspaper also published news about saving telephone resources in various parts of North China. The North China Telephone Company decided to control and recover all non-urgent and unused telephones in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Xuzhou, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Tangshan, Tanggu, and Zhifu from October 1st to December 31st for two months. After the recovery, the company will pay "600 yuan for the first class, 600 yuan for the second class, 450 yuan for the third class, 450 yuan for the fourth class, 450 yuan for the fifth class, and 300 yuan for the sixth class" as compensation. This is really a very proper method. On the other hand, the North China Electric Power Company has also restricted users from adding electric lights or sockets since September 1st. Without the company's permission, they are not allowed to do so privately. At the same time, the electricity system has been changed, and the fees for exceeding a certain amount of electricity are particularly expensive. Chinese people have never known how to cherish electricity. This is not only a necessary measure during wartime, but it can also train Chinese people to cherish motive power.

Solving the Coal and Oil Shortage

The coal and oil shortage in Beijing is now getting worse. Coal briquettes have risen to the level of four yuan of joint currency per 100 jin. Along with the coal shortage, firewood has also risen sharply. The firewood brought by the villagers in the streets has risen to 32 yuan per 100 jin. The coal shortage in North China, which is located in the coal-producing area, can be said to be a bit inexplicable, but the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants is at least one of the reasons. Zong Ji, the director of the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, believes that this phenomenon of "rising prices without end" is very harmful to the general public, and has decided to send personnel to investigate the wrinkled prices and the inventory of coal merchants, and on the 19th, he issued a statement to the coal merchants: "They should adhere to the concept of self-discipline and sell to the city at fair prices, and must not engage in hoarding and speculation. Once discovered or reported by the public, they will be severely punished without leniency." As for the oil shortage, its severity is unimaginable. All oil mills have stopped making oil. Now, except for small peddlers selling zero oil, all oil shops do not sell oil. Occasionally, in black market transactions, peanut oil is sold for more than ten yuan per catty. The general public has no way, so they go to food stores to buy raw vegetable oil instead, so raw vegetable oil has also risen from about four yuan per catty to around ten yuan. However, now even raw vegetable oil is not easy to buy. Under this situation, the Beijing Municipal Materials Price Handling Committee specially convened the relevant personnel of the Beijing Sesame Oil Industry Association and the Oil Shop Industry Association on the 22nd of this month to discuss ways to solve the oil shortage, and at the same time began to investigate the sources and supply of oil from the oil shop industry and sesame oil industry associations.

### The Origin of the Cigarette Black Market

— Gong Bing

Since the spring of this year, the China Tobacco Distribution Association has uniformly distributed cigarettes (including products from Yizhong, Zhonghua, and Huashang factories) to small retailers at a limited price. Small retailers are divided into four levels: A, B, C, and D. The distribution volume is one to fourty eight (for example, if the D level is 1,000 yuan, then the A level is 8,000 yuan). The distribution period for the first phase was March 20th of this spring, and it has now reached the fifteenth phase, with an average of about two distributions per month. The distribution quantity for the D level has always been around 2,000 yuan per period (C level 4,001 yuan, B level 8,000 yuan, A level 11,600 yuan). The legal profit is stipulated as 15%, and it was increased to 20% from the thirteenth phase.

My shop is in the lowest level of cigarette shops, and we get about 4,000 yuan of cigarettes per month. The stipulated legal profit is 800 yuan (only 600 yuan before the thirteenth phase). It is found that cigarette shops mainly sell cigarettes, and their trade accounts for more than 80% of the turnover (my shop specializes in selling rolled cigarettes and matches). May I ask if a cigarette shop can cover its expenses by relying only on this so-called main business of 800 yuan gross profit per month? If you remove the heavy taxes (including business tax, license tax, income tax, Economic Bureau registration fee, license fee, and trade association membership fee), I am afraid that even the water, electricity, and rent cannot be paid, let alone food and salaries. Since small shops cannot cover their expenses (and large shops with A-level legal profits can only earn 6,400 yuan per month), they have to take the risk of doing business on the black market to survive (there is no question of profiting). Therefore, I think that while the authorities should vigorously crack down on the black market, the legal profits of small retailers should also be reviewed slightly to ensure that they can maintain a minimum level of expenditure.

The price of cigarettes has more than doubled since the thirteenth phase. In theory, the legal profits of small retailers can be increased by more than double in this case. However, in fact, this is not the case. The amount of cigarettes distributed after the price increase has suddenly decreased by more than half, so that the legal profit remains the same as before, without any increase. Moreover, after the price increase, the number of miscellaneous brands of cigarettes has increased, accounting for almost 80 to 90% of the total (there were no Yizhong cigarettes in the fourteenth phase, and only two boxes of British Old Knife in the fifteenth and sixteenth phases). These miscellaneous brands of cigarettes are high in price and of poor quality, making them very difficult to sell (such as Gaoerfu, Liming, Black Girl, Haolaixi, Fayuaner, etc.), and they must be sold at a loss. Because miscellaneous brands of cigarettes have to be sold at a loss, the prices of cigarettes produced by the major brands have to be raised or bundled to make up for it. This fact is obvious to everyone and cannot be denied.

This is the basis of the black market from the perspective of small retailers. Furthermore, the real reason for the black market is that the supply and demand are not balanced (that is, demand is greater than supply). Cigarettes are not essential for life. I think that the price of cigarettes can be continuously increased according to the black market price to reduce the demand. If the demand decreases, the supply and demand will be balanced. If the supply and demand are balanced, the black market will naturally disappear. Therefore, to completely eliminate the cigarette black market, it is necessary to adopt the price increase method. The excess profits obtained by cigarette factories can be used for public welfare purposes. Cigarettes are consumer goods. Having them is not too much, and not having them is not too little. Increasing the price will not affect the livelihood of ordinary people (and the profits from the cigarette price increase can be used to subsidize the price of hardship rice, which will lower the price of household rice, benefiting ordinary people immeasurably). If the quantity distributed to small retailers does not decrease after the price increase, the legal profits can be increased proportionally. At the same time, if miscellaneous brands are not used to make up the numbers, small retailers can maintain their expenses and will naturally not be happy to sell on the black market illegally.

However, one thing should also be noted, that is, after the price of cigarettes continues to rise, if it exceeds the black market price and cannot be sold, the unsold cigarettes can be taken back at the original price within the stipulated time limit to avoid losses for small retailers. At the same time, it is also necessary to cancel the cigarette distribution to South goods stores, department stores, and oil and wine shops, and ensure that the distribution quantity of real cigarette shops is increased, so that they can obtain more legal profits and implement the principle of using cigarette shops to support cigarette shops. This is what is hoped for from the distribution association. If the above points can be achieved, it will be a fundamental solution to eradicate the black market. Now I summarize it as follows: Continuously increase the limited price, reduce consumption, and balance supply and demand. Do not reduce the distribution quantity or use miscellaneous brands of cigarettes to make up the numbers, so that small retailers can increase their legal profits. If the limited price is too high and small retailers cannot sell all of them, the association will still take back the unsold portion at the original price within a reasonable time limit. Cancel the cigarette distribution to non-cigarette shops to increase the distribution quantity of cigarette shops. (End)

### Ranked First But Did Not Apply for Scholarship

Although my father is noble and self-respecting, I can't help but cry out

I am a poor elementary school student studying at the Sapo Sai Elementary School in the Eighth District. I have been there for three years. Fortunately, I ranked first in the last semester of last year and the first semester of this year. Now I am in the fifth grade, but I have never received a scholarship or loan. I see that my family is in difficulty. My father is a professor at ×× University, and his monthly income is less than 1,000 yuan. He can't find a part-time job, and he has to support my mother, my two sisters, and me. My brother is still asking for money from home from time to time. It really makes my father feel desperate, but my father's stubborn nature always suffers in silence and doesn't try to get a loan for me. I think what kind of society is this? My father's nobility is just suffering. Next door, there is a family with two concubines who seem to be quite wealthy, but two of their sons have received loans, which makes me feel that there will be no good days for high-ranking people, and I will have no books to read. I see that my clothes are not warm enough this winter, and my schooling next year has become a problem. I want to take first place every semester, but taking first place can't solve the family's difficulties. So I wrote this letter to your newspaper for publication. I ask to be able to continue studying in the future, and I ask to be able to get some loans in the future. Can't society give me some sympathy?

### By Mail

After Yang Sujun's article "The Imminent Wheat Production Increase Work" was published in the National Forum on October 26th, a reader, Mr. Lv Wenrui from the Chinese Alcohol Factory, inquired about the purchase place of Jinda 2905 wheat. Here is the author's reply:

The Tongde Agricultural Research Institute of the Chinese Science Society on Yale Road, Shanghai, recently purchased 10 tons of this wheat from the Nanjing Chinese Youth Workers' Association. You can inquire whether it can be distributed.

The Jiancun Seed Education Department attached to the Chinese Youth Workers' Association at No. 12, Embroidery Flower Lane, Nanjing, has a large number of this wheat seed. You can write to inquire.

The Nanjing Grain Department recently ordered a certain food production increase plan, and will centrally distribute the 2905 wheat after centralization. You can write to the Department's Production Increase Department to request it. If permission is granted, it will also be much more convenient in terms of delivery.
