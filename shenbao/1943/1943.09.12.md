### Wartime Social Policy Issues

— Ren Yuan

Social policy in peacetime is a policy used to remedy the shortcomings of the modern economic system, with the aim of guiding society and transforming society. Although the content of theories and policies are not entirely the same, in principle they are not too far apart. As for wartime, the national economy inevitably undergoes drastic changes, and society and national life will undergo major transformations. The discovery of abnormal phenomena and shortcomings in the process is unavoidable. Therefore, social policies that can adapt to wartime conditions are needed to remedy and guide them. At this moment when the World War is heading towards a decisive stage, it is no coincidence that social policies of various countries are given the same importance as military economy. The article "Japan's Wartime Social Policy" published in the Shen Bao on the 8th is a good example.

Throughout the dynasties, Chinese politicians and their administrations have always attached great importance to the lives of ordinary people, and assistance and guidance have been listed as important political strategies. Chinese ethics take "filial piety" as the primary meaning, "family" as the foundation of society, and "five generations living under one roof" as a symbol of happiness. The saying "may your descendants be numerous" has become a congratulatory idiom. Therefore, invisibly, it has become a driving force for the national population reproduction policy among the people. Modern Japanese and German wartime social policies place their emphasis on population policy, that is, the maintenance and cultivation of human resources, using various methods to encourage marriage and childbirth, in order to achieve their wartime national policy. However, in our country, it is actually unnecessary to put much effort into this aspect. Today's social policy in our country, in terms of population countermeasures, instead of focusing on increasing the population, it is better to study how to improve eugenics, that is, to strive to encourage the reproduction of outstanding citizens and find ways to prevent people with genetic diseases from giving birth. What is even more important in our country today is "population maintenance," that is, the maintenance of the minimum living standards of the existing population, the protection of health, and the guidance of physical and mental activities. Efforts must be made to reduce infant mortality, maternal mortality, and lower the general mortality rate of the people. According to general statistics, the reproductive capacity of the Chinese population is not as good as that of European and American powers, but the high mortality rate is comparable to that of India (India has the highest mortality rate in the world, but its reproductive rate is also particularly strong), and among the people of the whole country, the number of truly healthy people must be calculated in terms of a few thousandths or ten thousandths. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen once shouted loudly, "The crisis of the extinction of the Chinese nation." If we want to stand side by side with the great powers in the world after the war, we must redouble our efforts in population maintenance policies at this time, eliminate abnormal population mortality, and eliminate the shame of the "sick man of East Asia."

The main items of the policies of maintaining and cultivating human resources of contemporary powers are roughly: Guarantee of the minimum standard of living and improvement of national life; Expansion of the social insurance system; Protection of the lives of workers, staff and agricultural laborers; Enrichment and popularization of medical, health and health care facilities; Promotion and improvement of national social education. In order to realize these requirements, the government has specialized institutions and personnel responsible for implementing wartime social policies, the government includes in the budget the definite funds necessary for implementing social policies, the government also sets up a certain supervisory body, and at the same time maintains close contact with public opinion organs, so that wartime social policies not only have brilliant laws and institutions, but also can harvest real results, assisting the country's entire wartime policy and completing the system of total war. Today, we hope that the authorities will not neglect this aspect and catch up quickly.

In order to protect the national life during the war and further improve it, in addition to the protection laws for mothers and children, rescue of teenagers, etc., disaster protection laws, and children's abuse prevention laws, Japan also has judicial protection, wartime disaster insurance system, and a sufficient rationing system for food, clothing and daily necessities to stabilize national life. Germany also has unemployment relief, protection of pregnant women, assistance in infant rearing, protection of maternity, and popularization of nurseries. In our country, the first thing to be solved is the problem of food for the people, so that everyone has enough to eat; then eliminate the phenomenon of extreme wealth and poverty to improve the national wartime life. Secondly, the social insurance system has been in place in the great powers for a long time. Recently, the Ministry of Social Welfare has launched labor insurance to meet the special needs of wartime. It seems that it should be promoted as soon as possible. The social insurance system in Japan has made great progress during the war, and has successively created the national health insurance system, the staff health insurance system, the seafarer insurance system, and the worker pension insurance system, and the results are remarkable. Germany has sickness insurance, accident insurance, pension insurance, disability insurance, clerical insurance, and miner insurance. In short, they are all sufficient to show the country's practical concern and protection for the people's lives during and after the war, and then the people can automatically stand up and be loyal to the country. Otherwise, even if they are supervised day and night and punished severely, the effect will be minimal.

Under the total war system, in order to win the decisive force for the final victory, in addition to the soldiers on the front line, it also depends on the cooperation of the people in the rear, especially the efforts of workers and peasants in the production sector. Therefore, how to improve the enthusiasm of workers and peasants in production to serve the country is one of the central tasks of social policy.

Medical, health and health care facilities are even more important during wartime. Taking Japan as an example, the core agency "Health Center" that guides national health during the war was planned to build 49 in 1938, but now there are 239, and 80 more will be added by the end of this year. The number of health care instructors has also increased from 4,000 to 7,000. In terms of medical care, the National Medical Care Act was formulated last year, and the Japan Medical Group was established with a business fund of 600 million yen to engage in the prevention and eradication of tuberculosis. In order to improve the content of medical care, national medical institutions are universally established from cities to villages throughout the country, and they are becoming increasingly developed. Our authorities seem to be making urgent efforts in this regard to protect national health.

Finally, it is hoped that the popular promotion of national social education will enable ordinary citizens to have a correct understanding of war and the country and society. At the same time, for the practice of wartime life, the importance of public health, the cooperation of social services, and the maintenance of public order, everyone can be self-aware and self-help and self-govern through the popularization of social education. Then, under the unified policies and laws of the country, it will be gathered into a huge force. In this way, total participation in the war will have its actual meaning, and the construction of the new China and the Greater East Asia can be guaranteed most reliably.

After I take office, I will immediately start to improve everything and seek the stability of the people's lives. Under the organization and jurisdiction of the central government, all local policies should be in line with the central government's intentions and absolutely accept the orders and guidance of the central ministries and departments. The format of official documents to the central ministries will also be in the style of reports from subordinates to superiors. After taking office, I will not make any changes in personnel, because they serve the country, not me personally. The appointment of personnel should follow the central government's intentions and be based on their experience and knowledge to determine whether they are competent. Even for the position of county magistrate, they must have at least three years of experience as a section chief in the county government before they can be appointed. As for national taxes, in addition to asking the central government to send people to be in charge of accounting, the local elders should be responsible for ensuring that national tax revenues are remitted to the national treasury without any leakage to enrich the national finances. The date of taking office has not yet been determined. I will take office as soon as the transfer of the Ministry of the Interior is completed.

### Hitler's Radio Declaration of Determination to Fight, Condemning Badoglio's Betrayal of Faith

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - Breaking a long silence, German leader Hitler delivered a speech via radio last night (8:30 PM Berlin Summer Time on the 10th), stating that he would use all means to crush the enemy's hopes. He then said that Italy's involvement in the war, apart from being of little military importance, was due to Germany's constant assistance to the Italian army since the war began. Germany should repay former Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's efforts to eliminate the enemies of the Italian people. Germany now has ample reason to be firmly confident, which can be seen in the determination and achievements of the German army. He assured the people that the German army would achieve final victory and that they have now been liberated from being misled by expectations. Therefore, it is time to address the German people again. The collapse of Italy was foreseeable, not because Italy could no longer mount an effective resistance or because there was no need for resistance, but because of the ambition of those who made the surrender possible. It was the result of their planned conspiracy of sabotage. What they have succeeded in doing is merely handing over the rule of Italy to the common enemy through actions that betray Germany and all of Italy's allies.

Tracing the Roots of Past Events

After England and France declared war on Germany in September 1939, Italy had no choice but to declare solidarity with Germany based on treaty relations. Prime Minister Mussolini wanted to implement a general member's action, but those who caused the surrender had already created the power to prevent Italy from joining the war in August. At that time, it was known that Italy's domestic difficulties did not compel it to immediately join the war, and Italy was allowed to choose when to participate. In June 1940, Mussolini completed the necessary internal preparations and allowed Italy to participate in the war on the German side. We are extremely grateful for Mr. Mussolini's attitude and steps taken in extremely difficult circumstances.

Sharing Weal and Woe, Fighting Shoulder to Shoulder

Since then, German and Italian troops have shed blood together in various places, and General Rommel has made significant contributions. In the spring of 1941, the German army decided to assist Italy in the Balkans, not according to the will of the Italians, but solely to remove the German crisis. When the German army was operating in the Balkans, it was actually preparing for an attack on the Soviet Union. The Germans believed that Mussolini, the helmsman of Italy, had obtained the absolute protection of the Italian people, which was a prerequisite for the continuation of the German-Italian alliance. Its collapse will surely be felt by the Italian people as a lifelong disgrace. The final action of the Italian coup was due to Mussolini's request to intensify the war, and he took strict measures against those who sabotaged the war. Finally, Mussolini wanted to eliminate Italy's enemies in order to seek Italy's security. At that time, the Germans, regardless of everything, their navy, army, and air force still fought bravely in Sicily, not only protecting Germany but also protecting Italy's territory.

Betraying Faith is Unforgivable

The leaders of Italy decided to destroy the alliance, causing Italy to become a battlefield. There may be many reasons, but it is unforgivable that they acted alone without informing their allies. On the day the armistice agreement was signed, Badoglio even told the German chargé d'affaires that he would never betray Germany and that Italy had no intention of surrendering. However, an hour later, his treacherous actions were publicly announced. The claim that the Italian Chief of Staff had informed the German military representatives about this matter is merely British propaganda. Within two years, the Germans had truly understood the development of this betrayal and treachery, and they had fully understood the true intentions of the change of government. The German army had already taken all necessary measures in response to the actions of the Italians. People's war is extremely sacred, because the defeated will be destroyed, and only the victorious have the hope of survival. Therefore, we have decided to take all steps to crush the enemy.

Personal Life Long Forgotten

Italy's withdrawal from the Axis has little significance in terms of military essentials. Germany is determined to continue fighting. It is a great mistake for the enemy to think that they can use the same methods against the Germans as they did against the Italians. It is impossible to create another July 25th in Germany. I have long ceased to care about my personal life, and what I value is the security of the nation for hundreds of years to come. I once told the parliament that neither time nor force in the world can destroy Germany. What the enemy can do now is to use terrifying air raids. Not only are we using mechanical means to break this offensive, but we have also made even stronger retaliations. For strategic reasons, we may be forced to abandon certain strongholds, but the steel ring made by the blood of the German army cannot be broken. The German people should have the ability to be confident and self-reliant. The Italian incident has proceeded according to plan. The lesson of the Yugoslav rebellion can provide an excellent example for countries that are currently allied with Germany.

### The Fifth Year of the European War: A Review of the Internal and External Situation of Various Countries (Part 1)

Germany

This war is a world war. From a geographical perspective, it is divided into two different battlefields, Europe and East Asia, but in essence, it is one war. Purely from a military point of view, once the victory or defeat of either Europe or East Asia is decided, it will naturally have a decisive impact on the other battlefield. From a post-world view, there are two major ideals: the construction of a New Order in Greater East Asia with Japan as the leader, and the construction of a New Order in Europe with Europe as the leader. War inevitably broke out between these two and the Anglo-Americans who hindered and suppressed these ideals. Neither side can stop before achieving these ideals, even if they encounter setbacks in China.

The Main Battlefield is Still on the Eastern Front

Germany began fighting the Soviet Union two years ago, and to this day, it is difficult to predict when the military resolution will come. Even the German authorities have repeatedly stated this. In terms of mobilized troops and other factors, the main battlefield for Germany today is still the Eastern Front. The view of the Soviet battlefield, which determines the entire war situation, is an unshakable fact. Assuming that the strength of the Soviet Union has been exhausted before this winter, Germany will withdraw most of its troops from the Eastern Front, especially the air force, to prepare for attacks from England and the United States, and to strengthen air defense, and it is even very likely to advance and capture the British mainland.

The Dream of Victory

Before the fall of France in 1940, the war indeed progressed in favor of Germany, unexpectedly for most people. The British army was almost completely defeated in Dunkirk. At that time, everyone thought that Germany's victory was about to be completed. The Balkan War in 1941 also proceeded smoothly. Before that time, Germany was immersed in the dream of victory. This absolute view of victory more or less had a negative effect on the German-Soviet war that began this summer. However, this view of victory seemed to prevail even in the battles between Germany and the Soviet Union. It was not until the winter of 1941, when Germany encountered unexpected severe cold and fell into a difficult situation, that it deeply realized that it was a war that was not only different in scale but also in nature from the war against France.

Increased Pressure from England and the United States

In 1942, Germany once again launched attacks towards Ukraine and the Caucasus. In the winter of that year, there was a Soviet winter offensive. From the beginning of July this year, the Soviet Union launched another offensive between Orel and Belgorod. During this period, in December 1941, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War made the United States, which had already been virtually an enemy country, a de facto enemy of Germany and Italy. The pressure from England and the United States gradually increased from the southwest. In the fall of 1942, they landed in North Africa. Soon, they succeeded in attacking Tunisia. However, the establishment of a second front that could reduce the burden on the Soviet Union has not yet been realized.

The indiscriminate air raids by England and the United States against Germany and Italy, which brutally massacre women and children and destroy cultural facilities, are barbaric acts that are left aside for the moment, but the impact they have on the people of Germany and Italy, both mentally and materially, cannot be ignored. However, the result is that this cannot be said to be a decisive factor in the war.

Stable Domestic Situation

In terms of the domestic situation, the political control of National Socialism is extremely stable, and there is no danger of fissures arising from within and expanding and organizing, as happened during the previous World War. To calm the social unrest that may be caused by enemy air raids, Commander of the Guards Himmler also serves as Minister of the Interior, strengthening his authority to suppress it. In terms of the most important food supply, a consistent "thin and long" strategy is still adopted. Neither the soldiers on the front lines nor the general public in the rear feel full or hungry. The general public endures all kinds of unfreedom and inconvenience and continues the war unyieldingly. From this perspective, even if Germany cannot defeat the enemy's combat power, it has already inflicted painful blows on the enemy in this summer's battle, and will continue to strike the enemy in the future. Therefore, if Germany can shift its forces to the southwest, it will, as mentioned earlier, transform today's defensive posture, take an offensive posture, and prevent the enemy.

### Rice and Grain Control Committee Holds Formal Meeting Today; 5 Japanese Representatives Participate in the Control Committee

The Rice and Grain Control Committee held a preliminary meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce a few days ago for preliminary discussions. It was decided to formally hold the first preparatory meeting today, which will be based on the decisions of the preparatory meeting to determine the organizational regulations, preparatory guidelines, and operational procedures. The meeting will be presided over by Chairman Yuan Ludeng, and all other committee members will participate. According to Shanghai News Agency reporters, the committee members, in addition to the nine representatives announced by the Chinese authorities, there are also five Japanese representatives. Mr. Hirono of the Central China Rice Distribution Association is one of them. Among the Japanese committee members, there are also figures related to Mitsui and Mitsubishi. All Chinese and Japanese committee members will attend today's first preparatory meeting.

Grain Bags Should Be Returned

The Materials Procurement Office of the First District Public Office yesterday issued a notice to rice shops in the 1st and 8th districts, stating: "The empty bags of corn, barley, and sorghum distributed by this office to the rice retailers in each district should be returned to this office. Before returning the above-mentioned empty bags, each retailer should obtain a certificate for returning empty bags from Office No. 801 of this office and send it to the China Bank C-character warehouse at No. 1040 North Suzhou Road on the same day as the rice bags and flour bags. The hemp bag warehouse of this office will inspect and accept them. If the empty bags are deemed qualified after inspection, this office will compensate the retailer 28 National Currency Yuan per empty bag. If they are deemed unqualified, or if they are not empty bags used to contain corn, barley, and sorghum, or if they are not empty bags distributed by this office, they will be rejected. Those who fail to return them will be fined 200 Yuan per empty bag. According to the notice issued by the Municipal Council before June 21st, if any of the retailers fail to return the empty hemp bags and empty grass bags or small hemp bags, this office will impose a fine of 200 Yuan for each hemp bag and 100 Yuan for each grass bag or small hemp bag. All points listed above should be followed."

Difficulties with Orphans' Living Expenses

Over 40 orphanages in this city have experienced difficulties in maintaining the living expenses of 8,000 orphans in the past two months due to the increase in sugar prices. The relief funds obtained solely from the public and the authorities are far from sufficient to maintain their livelihoods in the future. It is said that the China Philanthropic Association for Children has allocated 45,000 Yuan from the First District Public Office, but continued public assistance is still needed, as each orphanage currently needs 10,000 Yuan for food alone, not including other expenses such as medical care.

Two Jin of Flour Per Person in the Fourth District

The 15th period of household flour for the Fourth District of this city has been fully issued and distributed by the Joint Office of the District Public Office. It has been decided to begin general sales today. At that time, citizens within the district can purchase two 'shi jin' of No. 2 flour for 14 Yuan each with their 15th-period flour purchase certificates.

Allocated Rice Mixed with Sand and Mud

Central News Agency - The recent two rice allocations by the Municipal Food Bureau have both been red brown rice, and it seems to be mixed with sand and mud. Therefore, it is not only difficult to cook, but also difficult to eat. If it is re-milled, there will be a lot of loss. However, the amount of rice allocated to citizens each time is limited. The general public relies on the rice allocated by the authorities to maintain their livelihoods. However, if this continues, it will have a significant impact on the health of the people. Therefore, the general public sincerely hopes that the authorities can understand this and seek improvements to benefit the people's food supply.

### The Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Has Been Completed; It Will Be Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval

The office of the National General Association for the Unified Control of Industry and Commerce for the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has completed the handling of the applications for export and supplementary registration of yarn and cloth from cotton yarn and cloth manufacturers and holders in the Shanghai urban area on the 6th of this month. In addition to the quantities of yarn and cloth that have been statistically registered this time, the application forms for applying to sell yarn and cloth were also completely sorted out at 5:00 PM this afternoon (11th). All categories and quantities of applications for selling yarn and cloth will be reviewed by the Commercial and Industrial Association and the Japanese Embassy, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. As for the purchase prices of various yarns and cloths, the Quality and Price Assessment Committee, jointly established by China and Japan, is continuing to conduct separate small-group meetings to determine the prices. It is expected that all prices will be determined and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and publication within the next week. It is heard that the Japanese merchants have started bundling and storing old yarns and cloths into warehouses since yesterday. In addition, the issue of distribution after the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth will be decided in the executive meeting of the Materials Control Review Committee within the next week.

### Match Allocation Plan Pending Approval and Implementation; Rationing System Based on Population and Tickets Will Be Adopted

The long-rumored match allocation is about to become a reality. A reporter from the Commercial Press recently learned from the Match Industry Association that the detailed plan for match allocation has been completed by the association and is currently being reviewed by the relevant authorities. Once approved, it will be implemented immediately. As for the allocation method, in order to eliminate malpractices, a rationing system based on population and tickets will be adopted. Purchase certificates will be distributed according to the household registration of the Baojia system. Citizens can use the certificates to collect goods at designated retail stores. Although the allocation quantity has not been officially determined, it will be sufficient to meet the legitimate daily needs of citizens. All procedures have been completed by the association, and they are waiting for the authorities to approve it.

### First District Public Office Strictly Prohibits Subordinate Staff from Extortion

In order to prevent improper behavior by staff, the First District Public Office specially ordered all external staff of its subordinate offices to be friendly to the merchants and people directly governed when performing their duties within the First District, and must not have any intention of being arrogant. Even if any progress is discovered in the merchants and people, it must be reported to the competent officer in accordance with the regulations, and then handled after review. No extortion is allowed, or private settlements with money. If any of the above occurs, in addition to allowing the parties to report to the District Public Office at any time, personnel have been dispatched for secret investigations. Once the facts are verified, no leniency will be shown.

Brief Commentary

### Starting from Stickers

Recently, the glass of shops along various roads has been covered with various stickers. Why are stickers needed? How should stickers be applied? We will not discuss this for the time being. What we want to say is: the forms and patterns of the stickers vary. Some are meticulous and painstaking, inlaid into meaningful advertisements, such as sports equipment companies, which paste paper strips into the form of tennis rackets, and music companies, which paste rows of staff paper. What we consider most meaningful is the four large characters "Time Problems" pasted on the window of a certain clock shop. They seem to give us an alert: "How precious is time!" However, there are also many that are crudely made, distorted, scribbled, and absolutely devoid of art.

This cannot but arouse some thoughts in us: those thin paper strips, with different forms, represent not only the so-called "appearance" on the surface, but also the different personalities, artistic senses, and abilities of countless managers and shopkeepers. In short, the form of the stickers, if they are neat and exquisite, also indicates that the person in charge is serious in handling affairs, and thinks of being better than others even in the details. They must be the winners in the industry. The Christian classics say, "He who is faithful in little things is faithful also in much!"

From this sticker application, we infer from the small to the large. Society and the country are no exception. Therefore, whether the social leaders and the national ruling authorities are responsible and serious can be seen from all aspects of this society and this country. In other words, the face of a society and a country can reflect whether the leaders and the ruling authorities are using the right people.

### Reorganization and Handover of the Municipal Party Headquarters Completed

### Movement of Scrap Cloth, Broken Flannel, and Old Wool Yarn Is Not Restricted in Any Way; Permits Required for Cotton, Regardless of New or Old

The Shanghai Old Goods Industry Association once sent a letter to the Commercial and Industrial Association to inquire whether permits are required for moving and transporting old scrap cloth, broken flannel, old cotton, and old wool yarn and for moving them within the city. It is now learned that the association has clearly instructed: after checking, the three items of old scrap cloth, broken flannel, and old wool yarn, if they are indeed old bedding materials, whether transported out of the Shanghai area or transported into Shanghai or other districts, or moved within this city, do not require permission from this association. As for cotton, regardless of whether it is new or old, bringing it into the Shanghai area requires permission from this association, and moving it within the district is subject to restrictions.

Comments from Economic Circles

### The Mentality of Shanghai's Economic Circles

Regarding the surrender of the Badoglio government and the determination of Shanghai's economic figures, Mr. Aoki Takashi, Chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said in his speech yesterday: "The situation in Shanghai's economic circles is extremely calm. We should not shake our mentality due to the progress or retreat of the war situation, and at the same time, we should not waver due to the political changes in other countries."

Speaking of the mentality of Shanghai's economic circles, we have said before that in a certain period, the most common mentality is to see the value of goods as high and the value of currency as low, followed by the mentality of getting rich personally and not caring about national interests. We have also said that today, Shanghai's financial products market, with people's hearts consistently feeling timid and adopting a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a sluggish market, is a morbid state of mind. A morbid mentality means that the will is wavering and weak, with no enterprising spirit, and the result is nothing but self-deception.

"There is nothing in the world, but fools trouble themselves." This is an old Chinese saying. There is clearly nothing to worry about, but people insist on adopting the mentality of "the man of Qi worrying about the sky," resulting in "suspiciousness." As a result of the mentality, it is as if factories are about to run out of raw materials or factories are about to be unable to start work. Under a decisive policy of promoting production and stabilizing people's livelihoods in wartime, how can such a mentality of "giving up eating because of choking" be allowed to exist? Besides, there is no need to talk about "choking" at all.

Since the economic situation in Shanghai is extremely calm, then the mentality of Shanghai's economic figures should be calm at all times, and they should continue to work hard to move towards production, and not "trouble themselves," lest they mislead their future.

### Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Members' Meeting Scheduled for the 26th

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its 12th joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, chaired by Yuan Ludeng. First, a report was given on the full list of personnel for the Chamber's Wusong office. It was resolved to hire He Zhenya and Geng Hanchen to temporarily handle the affairs and begin operations. According to the regulations, the Chamber's annual general meeting of members should be held in mid-June each year. Previously, due to the various trade associations in the city being ordered to merge and reorganize, there were frequent changes, making it difficult to convene the meeting. The 10th joint meeting of standing directors and supervisors resolved to postpone the meeting, which was recorded in the minutes. Now that the various trade associations in the city have been largely reorganized by the competent authorities and have registered to join the Chamber, it is proposed to convene a general meeting this month. A draft of the Chamber's work report has been prepared for instructions and discussion. It was resolved to hold the meeting at 2 PM on the 26th of this month in the Chamber's auditorium. Regarding the issue of whether membership certificates of various trade associations should continue to be exempted from affixing stamp duty, a decision was requested. It was resolved to follow the Ministry of Finance's instructions and notify all trade associations to comply.

Ministries of Food and Real Estate Issue Order to Establish

Production Cooperative Mutual Aid Societies

An order from the Ministries of Food and Real Estate states: "The effectiveness of cooperative undertakings originally lies in regulating civilian finance, promoting public production, and also controlling distribution to eliminate corruption. It is truly a good policy for improving the economic lives of civilians and implementing a controlled economy. Our ministries, mindful of this, are solely finding ways to promote it. Currently, the rural loan business has been launched. In order to broadly promote and solicit local production businesses to rise up, the original cooperative system is organized to be strict, making it difficult to promote quickly. Temporary measures for production mutual aid societies are ordered so that various places can implement them accordingly to nurture. This type of production mutual aid society can separately manage production affairs and guide members to join cooperative societies as powerful members, as the grassroots organization of cooperative affairs. These measures have now been approved by the Executive Yuan for record-keeping and were promulgated and implemented by our ministries on August 18th. In addition to issuing separate orders, a copy of the temporary measures for production mutual aid societies is enclosed for your provincial government's registration and for instructing your subordinates to comply accordingly."

Hua Stock Trends

Yesterday, Hua stocks fluctuated constantly, with two drops being immediately recovered. The situation after the noon closing was particularly tight. However, the initial decline encountered resistance, and the price was uniformly lower than the previous day. People's minds were uncertain, and transaction volume decreased significantly. Financial circles and major players were still watching. The department store sector was the weakest initially. Wing On twice sharply declined and then recovered. After the noon closing, demand exceeded supply and suddenly rose, but was still lower than the previous day. Sincere, National Goods, and Lihua three companies declined more significantly. China Underwear also declined sharply. King Fook Shirts and Socks saw lower prices again. The decline in textiles was limited. Wing On Textiles reduced prices slightly. After the noon closing, there were buyers. Dasheng lost 1.32, Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving, Guangqin, and Qingfeng Textiles all sought declines. Small denomination shares declined more sharply. Zhongfang, Leihe, Wuhe, Hongxing, Hongyuan, and Da Zhonghua Weaving all saw lower prices. American Lun Mao remained weak. Xinrongye only saw Zhongxi and Zhongying remain at the original price. Wuzhou, Sino-French, Xinya, Xinyi, and Xin Xing all fell. The cultural industry's Commercial Press and Zhonghua both saw smaller price decreases. Yongxiang, Donggong Papermaking, and Standard Paper Products were quoted at the original price, with few transactions. The utilities sector was stable. China General Edison rose. Zhabei Water and Electricity, Public Motor, and Xiang Sheng Tricycle had little change. Mainland Tap Water, China Xing Coal Mine, Hanyeping, and Qing Shao Shipping's reduction in value was similar to the previous two days. China and Hua Cement were both weak. Da Zhonghua Firerock declined significantly. Huacheng Tobacco's demand and supply prices did not converge, with few transactions. Nanyang Tobacco Company entered the ranks. China Hua Oil reported stable weakness. Home Industry sang. Sanyou Industrial remained flat. China Rubber suddenly saw a decline. The industrial sector was the weakest. Jiu An, Xinghua, and Da Zhonghua Industrial were all sharply declining. Xin Ya Construction was also seen declining. Real estate declines were limited. Xin Yi. Tuohua. Yongxing's small plates were limited. Baoan Glass was uniquely flat. Meilin Canned Goods. Sosheng buyers quoted lower prices. Zhunwei MSG and Fumin Dairy Products remained deadlocked. Dahua accumulated stocks and Zhong planned to weave a level market. Jin Bang Industry also declined, with only Zhongyi seeing little change. Dalu, Shanghai, Zhejiang Xing, Jin Cheng, and industry banks all showed weakness.

Business Summary

Government Bonds: Yesterday's unified government bond market started with a firm sentiment. However, there were many sellers in the middle, and the market turned weak as a result, but it rebounded until noon. As a result, Type C rose two grades, and Types A, B, D, and E also saw significant increases. All other bonds also opened higher.

Rice: The rice market had limited sources, but the stock was still abundant. Retail transactions were slow, and retail investors were not interested. Because the Mid-Autumn Festival was approaching, there was no stock, and late rice fell. There was no honor or disgrace for new rice. Few du soybeans arrived, and the black market was stable.

Wool: Since the supply from Australia was cut off, this city is quite lacking. The existing stock has been almost completely collected. Woolen fabric manufacturers have switched to using North China and Zhejiang-Hubei wool, but the domestic product is not cheaper than the imported product. The quality is coarse and can only be used to weave coarse wool products. In addition, due to transportation and control issues, the goods are also scarce. However, recently, North China goods have remained firm, while Zhejiang-Hubei goods have felt light because their quality and uses are different.

Tea: The market trend can be called peaceful, but buyers' appetites are difficult to open, resulting in a lack of significant progress in transactions. Only this street in the city has selectively added a little dyeing, and the supply is also balanced, so the market price is rarely volatile. In short, due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, both buyers and sellers are busy sorting out their accounts, so they are unwilling to accept or hand over.

### A Quick Sketch of the Shanghai Charity and Relief Association: A Shelter for the Elderly, Disabled, Widowed, and Orphans

Cries for urgent help echo from the muddy ground and straw sheds

Except for the occasional passing cart, few upper-class citizens frequent the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road. At the southern end of the "New Yamen" (government office), there is a pile of old, dilapidated low houses standing on the wide road paved with gravel. From afar, one can see the broken roofs of several shanty dwellings. Approaching the low houses, one can see that the door facing east clearly bears the sign "Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Association Relief Home"! It is said that this is the largest charity organization run by the Chinese in Shanghai!

A Tour of the Charity Relief Home

Stepping through the gate, oh! It turns out to be a wasteland, originally the former cemetery! On this uneven wasteland, the most conspicuous are the several straw sheds in front on the right side. Ravaged by a recent wind and rainstorm, they look as if their eyes have been gouged out, ears cut off, limbs severed. No! They are simply crumbling skeletons! Where is there any human breath here? Who would believe that this is a corner of Shanghai, a prosperous city? What is seen before one's eyes is not the sandy battlefield described in the ancient wartime texts as "miserable and tragic, with sad winds and a bleak sun"? However, even before approaching these crumbling, skeletal shacks, one is surprised that these are precisely the groups of helpless elderly, disabled, widowed, and orphaned living inside!

This is the main undertaking of the Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Association: the Charity Relief Home. These shacks are divided into four sections: elderly, disabled, orphaned, and widowed.

The elderly section currently occupies a large shack. At the entrance, there is a small house for the manager, which is relatively intact. The blackboard states that it accommodates 76 elderly men and women over the age of 60. It is evident that the original scale and organization were meticulous. Several elderly people are curled up or lying on the ground and upper bunks, each with their own ragged and filthy quilt and mat. The heavy rain and wind have left traces of coolness. The upper bunks allow free passage of wind and clouds. Although the lower level has a floor, it is broken and full of holes. It is lunchtime, and several are scooping up porridge to eat, chanting "Amitabha," expressing their gratitude to the providers.

The disabled section occupies another large shack even more dilapidated than the people. It states that it currently houses 97 people. The conditions inside are the same as in the elderly section. The heavy rain and wind have created mud in the indoor walkways. To support the shack and prevent it from collapsing, many diagonal pillars are propped up inside. Anyone passing through the aisle must bend over and squeeze through again and again. Branches from the roof will be blown onto your head by the wind, and one careless step will make you fall. But the disabled are content, and the suffering of begging on the streets makes them feel that this place is already paradise.

Orphan and Widow Sections and Children's Education Center

The widow section houses widows and their children among the refugees, said to number as many as 273. The shack they occupy, although equally dilapidated, is being worked on by the widows, who are more capable than the elderly over 60 and the disabled, to repair it after the storm. A refugee from Guangdong is helping her child clean and repair their bunk. Some of the bunks are separated by straw mats, and there are even thermos bottles, utensils, and their own bedding. Some are already eating white rice porridge with pickled bean curd, enjoying it heartily. Others are cutting pumpkins on their bunks, preparing lunch. Although most are dressed in rags and exposing flesh, some are dressed relatively neatly because they go outside to "work" and earn some meager income.

The orphan section is the largest, with four shacks originally. Two are workshops and "classrooms," and the other two are bedrooms. The workshops mainly produce net bags and white gloves (for workers). Especially the net bags, they use better materials and make them more delicately, larger and sturdier than those seen in the market. They are sold to major companies. Seeing these products, no one would think that they are made by the hands of orphans who lack food and clothing! Look, how neatly and beautifully they are knotted!

Now, the orphans' shacks have also been destroyed by the storm. The workshop has been suspended. 89 orphans are crowded into a relatively intact shack. However, the roof and walls cannot withstand the invasion of wind and rain!

To the left of the entrance is the Tzu Chi Children's Education Center, which is smaller in scope and the buildings are relatively more intact, but there are still signs of mess, dirt, and mud after the storm. The children's homes, utensils, and tableware are things that people dare not touch with their hands, and perhaps dare not even look at directly. However, the children live vigorously. It is noon, the boys have already washed the tableware, and the children in the small courtyard are knitting woolen sweaters and the like, which the education center accepts as orders from the outside world. The boys' clothes are relatively worse, and the girls are still quite neat, like the children of middle and lower-class families. (Continued on page 4)

### Shen Bao's Letter to the Industrial and Commercial Community

To the esteemed members of the industrial and commercial community: Shanghai's industrial and commercial enterprises have always been known for their prosperity. In the past, there were specialized publications such as credit directories, which were convenient for reference. In recent years, there have been many new establishments and changes, but there is still a lack of detailed investigation and systematic recording. Moreover, due to the high cost of paper and labor, few new editions have been published, making inspection and reference inconvenient. In view of this, our newspaper plans to start compiling a "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Directory" to collect extensive information and ensure accurate investigation. We have received much assistance from various trade associations and individuals in the industrial and commercial sectors, who have either provided information or introduced us to sources.

### 19 Primary and Secondary Schools Respond to Organize Teachers and Staff Consumer Cooperatives

Since Mr. Jiang Tong advocated organizing consumer cooperatives for teachers and staff to solve the problem of various material needs in life, teachers and society have risen up to offer suggestions and study them in detail, which shows the need for such an organization.

Education is the foundation of a country, and the mission of our teachers is extremely arduous. However, at present, teachers and staff are under the high pressure of prices. All day long, what they get is not enough to eat. Whether it is supporting their parents or raising their children, some say that at a time when the country is facing unprecedented difficulties, the people should all practice frugality and frugality to strengthen national power and cope with the crisis. The principle is indeed normal. However, it is difficult to be fair and just. Our teachers and staff are under tremendous hardship. Those who sympathize in the society often encourage them with the words "noble and clean", and they themselves often comfort themselves with "noble and clean". However, whenever they are hungry, they really feel non-laughing. However, this kind of spirit of serving the country and society cannot be achieved by a profession.

Now that the pioneers of our education community have advocated cooperation to solve the problem of their own lives through their own organizations, this is indeed very important. Since our own needs have not been advocated first, we should respond later, hoping that our education members will quickly rise up to organize and see the results as soon as possible. It is very fortunate!

### Citizens Yearn for Household Oil

— Qiang Mengzhao

The news has come that the sixth term of household sugar, although said to be late, has actually been allocated. Although the quantity is small, it is better than painting a cake to satisfy hunger. The so-called: "Better than nothing", and the price remains unchanged, which is the painstaking effort of the authorities and is also celebrated by the citizens. But "cooking oil", which is more important than sugar, is still out of reach and there is no trace of it! Forbearance makes citizens look forward to it. Is "cooking oil" really scarce? But it doesn't seem to be. Private sellers carrying oil buckets in the streets and the rumbling breweries, secretly out-of-the-way black market oil (soybean oil, raw oil) shout the price. Exceptionally rampant This is not the family of the middle and lower classes, right? (No purchasing power.) The first term of household oil issued to citizens by the former Public Works Bureau has not been used for half a year. Now that the rent has been recovered, all the people look forward to it. I hope that the authorities will quickly practice "counting the mouths and training" to lower the price limit and allocate it immediately, so that the people will not have vegetables and lack nutrition and the people will not be resentful.

### Buddha Hall, Clinic, and Workshop

Within the Charity United Hospital, there is a Buddha hall, the most orderly and cleanest place in the entire compound. The scene is not much different from ordinary small temples. It is a pity that there is no permanent person in charge, so detailed inquiries cannot be made. Only a male tailor, whose hearing seemed not very clear and reluctant to see people, was working there. On the big bell at the entrance of the hall, a list of names of great benefactors was written. It is said that every morning someone strikes the bell and chants scriptures as a "morning lesson," which is probably the main educational activity.

For the orphans, it is said that there used to be informal education, divided into six levels. They worked in the morning and studied in the afternoon, but it was discontinued due to financial difficulties. Now, perhaps also due to the devastation of the recent storm, only a few roof frames remain of the classroom. Therefore, it is impossible to visit the teachers, which is a real pity. As for the "Children's Education Center," it has a school-like structure in terms of scale. Unfortunately, it was visited several days after the storm, and formal educational facilities had not yet been restored!

It is said that great attention is paid to the lives of the elderly, disabled, orphans, and widows. Director Qian of the General Affairs Department introduced us to a shed labeled as a clinic, which contained a few tables and a large cabinet displaying some medicines. It was said that a Chinese medicine doctor, Xu, regularly came for diagnosis and treatment, and two nurses were constantly in the hospital to take care of them. Next to it was a ward where several female patients were ordering attendants to do minor things like adding porridge, which seemed to indicate their status. Everything in the ward was indeed much better than the living conditions of the elderly, disabled, orphans, and widows.

Attached to the hospital is a "Joint Workshop Cooperative," which is actually a toy factory. Its main products are wooden toys, such as pistols, tanks, cars, dogs, etc. The equipment is complete, the work is intense, and it is full of vigor, making it a profit-generating organization. However, apart from absorbing a small number of orphans and widows from the hospital as workers, it seems to have no direct affiliation with the Charity United Association, which is a pity.

Looking Back and Looking Forward

Such is the general situation of the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association. However, the association is indeed of great significance to Shanghai society. The elderly, disabled, orphans, and widows it accommodates were all left behind during the war in Shanghai. In the past, they almost all had happy families. Many men and women had received proper education. When the war broke out, they abandoned their homes and fled into the Shanghai concessions. Because of their honesty and lack of speculative skills, they pathetically sought refuge in various refugee shelters. After February of the previous year, the situation in Shanghai changed, and shortly thereafter, there was a food shortage. At the same time, society gradually stabilized, so the refugee shelters were officially dissolved in the spring of last year. However, at that time, the homeless, elderly, sick, disabled, orphans, and widows were almost in a desperate situation. Compassion is in everyone's heart. Philanthropist Wen Longting made every effort to assist in transferring those who could not be repatriated when the refugee shelters were closed to the Charity United Relief Association to establish this Charity United Nursing Home. In order to rescue poor children who had mothers but were unable to raise them, he joined forces with the Chinese Jisheng Food Company to establish the Charity Children's Education Center. From the beginning of the reorganization of the Nursing Home in April of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession was responsible for providing supplies for three months, totaling 100,000 yuan. The amount exceeding this was supplemented by the Charity Relief Association. After July, all expenses were entirely borne by the Charity Relief Association. However, the association itself had no funds or assets, and the donations it received had to cover other expenses, so it could not be used exclusively for the Nursing Home, resulting in extreme financial difficulties. Later, the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association was established, and an application for subsidies was submitted. Commissioner Yonghua went to investigate and believed that there was an urgent need for subsidies. From February of this year, the Nursing Home was subsidized with 12,000 yuan per month, and the Education Center with 4,000 yuan per month, totaling 96,000 yuan until June. In August of this year, another subsidy of 30,000 yuan for the Nursing Home and 9,000 yuan for the Education Center was provided. However, due to the small amount of general donations and the rising prices and increased expenses, the Nursing Home currently accommodates a total of 545 elderly, disabled, orphans, and widows, with 20 staff members and 64 workers, totaling 619 people. Each person receives rice twice a day, 5.3 taels each time, requiring more than 10,000 catties per month. The Education Center accommodates 265 disaster-stricken children, with fewer workers, but the expenses are also considerable. As for the general workers, they are completely embracing the spirit of sacrifice and service, with everyone having the spirit of "I will go to hell for others." Their salaries are no more than 240 yuan at the highest, and the workers are paid only 12 yuan! Their living conditions are almost the same as the refugees. Many staff members' families have also been incorporated into the refugee team because they cannot make a living! They are seeking benevolence and finding it, enduring hardship without complaint. However, how can enthusiastic people in society bear to see them constantly in hardship, especially at present, with the sheds collapsing or on the verge of collapse, unable to shield them from wind and rain? If a large amount of money is not immediately raised to renovate them, then the autumn rains and winter winds will inevitably cause these nearly a thousand lives to freeze and starve to death. This will make people lose confidence in charitable undertakings. We earnestly hope that people with the power in society will rise up to assist, and those with resources will provide assistance!

### China Health Association Expands Medical Services

Health is the foundation of life and career, and also the fundamental force for all construction in the country and society. All countries in the world are vigorously promoting health care systems to maintain the health of their citizens, with remarkable results. Our country has always paid attention to this. Enthusiastic people in society deeply feel the seriousness of the current livelihood and medical problems, and believe that there is an urgent need to take action. Therefore, the China Health Association was organized to actively promote preventive health care work for citizens.

The association adapts to the needs of society, concentrates all the latest hospital treatment equipment, establishes a large-scale medical service organization, and, according to the most advanced health care policies of various countries, first divides the guidance and service departments as follows: those belonging to nutrition guidance include the food and beauty department; those belonging to prevention and inspection include the pathology and chemical examination department and the blood pressure examination department, trachoma examination department, and tuberculosis prevention movement department; those belonging to rescue and protection include the tuberculosis rescue department, the poor and sick relief department, and the smoking and opium cessation department; those belonging to women and children's health care include the women and children's health care department, etc. In the future, teachers and cultural figures from middle schools holding certificates from this association for health check-ups will be served and treated faithfully and cooperatively by doctors from various departments. The association's address is the Majestic Building, Jing'an Temple Road.

### Zeng De Yi School

The Zeng De Yi School has been increased with a commercial part-time compulsory night school. The site has been found at Guangyi Middle School, 270 Chengdu Road (north of Weihaiwei Road). The level ranges from the fifth grade of elementary school to the third grade of junior high school. Four classes are temporarily set up. The curriculum focuses on commercial knowledge and skills. Tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived. A deposit is slightly collected (those who are guaranteed by formal commercial firms and factories are exempt from payment). Aspiring students can go to register from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM or from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM every day from now on. Old students should also go to complete the enrollment registration procedures. Students who were not admitted to the subsidy this year can also take the exam.

### Fang Shentong's Calligraphy and Painting Charity Sale Preview

— Wang Yizhi

Fang Shentong, I heard, is the younger brother of Mr. Zijun from my hometown. He is thirteen years old and studies in high school. In his spare time, he learns calligraphy from Mr. Li Renzhangjian. His writing includes various styles such as cursive, seal, and official script. His ink works are all excellent. Now, he is using his spare time to create more than 200 pieces of calligraphy and painting, all of which will be donated to the Shanghai Children's Shelter to supplement its operating expenses. His enthusiasm for promoting children's education is also admirable. It is now scheduled to hold a charity sale at the Ningbo Fellow Association from the 12th of this month. There will surely be a grand occasion. Therefore, I wrote a poem to him: Once read the landscape painting of Shanyin, the three perfections of art talk about Fang Chan. Looking at the divine child through the ages, dancing snake is not alone. Zhang Dian's drunken Su mixed chapters, ink dripping, how many lines of words. Not only is Wang Youjun's style still there, but the Han official script is also in one furnace.

### Tuberculosis Prevention Slogan
