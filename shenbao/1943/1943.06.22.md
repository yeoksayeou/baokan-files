### Ways Japan Is Implementing Its New Policy Towards China

On the 16th of this month, at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet, Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech explaining the true intentions behind Japan's new policies towards all nations and peoples within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The following points are particularly noteworthy:

"...Currently, looking at the trends in Greater East Asia, the trust of various nations and peoples in Japan, and their sincere assistance in voluntarily completing the Greater East Asia War, are increasing day by day. Japan's unwavering policy is to ensure that the entire Greater East Asia region is permanently liberated from the shackles of Britain and the United States... The ten ethnic groups of Greater East Asia have understood Japan's true intentions and jointly believe that if the Greater East Asia War is not completed, East Asia cannot be liberated, a new order cannot be established, and the peoples of East Asia cannot have happiness..."

"China has suffered from British and American aggression for a century, experiencing immense suffering, but now it has broken free from its shackles and is striving for self-reliance... The long-cherished wishes and ideals of the Chinese people have already been realized... In addition to sincerely congratulating China on this prosperity, we have decided to increase our support and plan to fundamentally revise the treaties signed between China and Japan, so that the cooperative relationship between the two countries will become closer."

Furthermore, on the 17th, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, at the plenary session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, elucidated Japan's diplomatic policy.

Its main points are:

"To grant complete independence to the countries in the Greater East Asia region or to allow their broad participation in politics, in order to achieve their hopes. To establish cooperative relations of good neighborliness on the basis of mutual equality and benefit... The so-called realization of the long-awaited expectations of the national states in the Greater East Asia region, to cooperate with each other on an equal and mutually beneficial footing, has already been gradually realized in the new policy towards China, which is to re-explore the new relationship between China and Japan and establish good neighborly relations between the two countries... The Eastern policies of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands are policies of division and rule. Taking Britain as an example, Britain's policy towards India is to separate them in order to govern them... In East Asia, it is to alienate China and Japan and make them fight each other, because they do not want a powerful country to exist in East Asia... Furthermore, their economic policies are to occupy colonies and then seal them off to monopolize their benefits, which is fundamentally different from Japan's advocated policy of liberating resources, mutual benefit, and equality."

Yesterday, at the general meeting of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, Japanese Minister to China, Mr. Tajiri, delivered a speech, the main points of which are:

(1) In his report on diplomatic policy at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu mentioned "equality and mutual benefit." In the past, Britain and the United States also used this as a diplomatic slogan. However, in reality, the so-called "mutual benefit" between Britain and the United States was purely based on the interests of one country. But now, the "equality and mutual benefit" of the countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is completely different. It is under a common goal, with each contributing all their remaining strength to build a new order in East Asia.

(2) The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is like a large family, with the head of the family and family members each having their own duties and responsibilities, working together to seek the stability of the entire family, so that the entire family can be happy. In the past, the countries of East Asia were unable to be close and harmonious because they were provoked by British and American aggression. Now that British and American forces have been driven out, there will be no more factors of discord in the future.

(3) The Shanghai business community in the past has been deeply influenced by the egoism of British and American merchants, only seeking their own huge profits and disregarding the public interest. In the future, it is hoped that the business circles within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, especially the economic circles of Shanghai, will thoroughly change the egoism of British and American merchants in their business goals. Personal interests must be taken into account, but the public interest must be taken into greater account.

Prime Minister Tojo's speech represents the entire national policy of friendly Japan; Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's statement represents Japan's diplomatic policy; and Minister Tajiri's speech yesterday was an extension of the meaning of Prime Minister Tojo's and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's speeches. The reason why we specially extracted and repeated them is that we can thereby know for sure that Japan's national policy after the Greater East Asia War is consistent and is gradually being made concrete. We would like to further elaborate as follows:

(1) The Chinese people for several years, especially in the last year and a half, have been eagerly awaiting a clear declaration of the national policy of friendly Japan and a change in its policy towards China. Before Japan's national policy was clearly declared and its policy towards China was not changed, the Chinese people's passive and indifferent attitude towards Japan was extremely natural. Since the beginning of this year, Japan has implemented a new policy towards China, and responsible officials from Prime Minister Tojo downwards have from time to time issued clear declarations on national policy and consistent guidelines. At the same time, policies are being gradually implemented in concrete terms, such as returning concessions, abolishing extraterritorial rights, returning enemy property, and transferring control rights. Under this development of facts, the Chinese people, who previously held a passive and indifferent attitude, have begun to recognize and consider a positive and attentive attitude, which is also extremely natural. In Prime Minister Tojo's speech this time, "The treaties signed between China and Japan will be fundamentally revised so that the cooperative relationship between the two countries will become closer." We look forward to its early manifestation in facts. Then we dare to assert that what people call a "two-sided" policy will no longer exist from now on.

(2) In terms of the current facts, if Japan wants to implement its new policy towards China, it must first strive to promote the completion of a comprehensive peace in China. Then it can gather the 450 million people of China and cooperate together. The way to complete a comprehensive peace: First, the National Government must be strengthened. Anything that weakens or hinders the strengthening of the National Government must be improved, and friendly Japan in particular must examine itself. Second, while strengthening the National Government, the strength of the Chinese people must also be strengthened. A government that gains the support of the people is also bound to be one where the people and the government are united and generate strength. This is the real strengthening of cooperation. Third, if the National Government, thanks to Japan's cooperation, has improved its politics and gained the sincere support of the people in the peace zone, then we can predict that the hearts of the people under the rule of Chongqing will also very quickly and consistently turn towards it.

(3) Minister Tajiri said: East Asia is like a large family. Then, China and Japan are undoubtedly younger and elder brothers. In terms of the current facts, Japan is strong and China is weak. We naturally respect Japan as the elder brother and regard ourselves as the weaker younger brother. The weak younger brother of today should of course humbly learn from the strengths of the elder brother, such as political clarity, the popularization of education, the development of science, and even physical health, in order to grow up and be able to share the responsibilities of the elder brother. However, the elder brother should understand and forgive the psychology of the weak younger brother with friendly emotions, so that there will be no quarrels, and the family can truly be close and harmonious, with boundless happiness.

### General Matsui Iwane Inspects Model Camp in Guangdong; Delivers Speech After Arriving in Hong Kong

Guangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency) - General Matsui Iwane, after arriving in Guangzhou by plane on the 18th, inspected the Model Camp of the Pacification Commissioner's Office at 11:00 AM on the 19th. He was accompanied by the Liaison Department Chief and the Chief of Staff of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. Upon arrival, Camp Commander Chen Xun led his officers and soldiers in a welcoming parade, and then guided him to inspect all the facilities in the camp, leaving at 12:00 noon.

Hong Kong, 21st (Central News Agency) - Advisor Matsui Iwane, on this trip to the South for observation, arrived in Hong Kong on the 20th. On the 21st, he met with Chinese reporters and expressed his impressions of coming to Hong Kong, stating in essence: This is my sixth visit to Hong Kong. The first time was before the Chinese Revolution. Also, when I came here in 1922, I went to Guangzhou to visit Hu Hanmin, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, etc., and exchanged views with them on Sun Yat-sen's advocated Greater Asianism and Sino-Japanese cooperation issues. At that time, Hong Kong newspapers pointed out that the Greater Asianism I held was a mask for aggression against China. In the end, due to some Chinese people's misunderstanding of this idea, the Sino-Japanese Incident was unfortunately triggered. But now, Chinese people have understood that Japan's Greater Asianism is not an imperialist ideology for aggression against China. Regarding Japan's recent new policy towards China, it is consistent from beginning to end, and its purpose is to realize genuine cooperation between the two countries. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese Incident, I fought in Shanghai, but its purpose was not to fight the Chinese people, but to eliminate the evil forces of Britain and the United States, because the evil forces of Britain and the United States exist, which caused China and Japan to meet with weapons. Japan has now begun to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights, so Chinese people should have a new understanding and display the true face of East Asians.

### Mayor Li of Xiamen Presents Donation to Chairman

### Commander Shibayama of Japanese Army Inspects Wuhan and Delivers Speech

Hankou, 21st (Central News Agency) - Commander Shibayama Kaneshiro of the Japanese Army served as the Chief of the Hankou Special Affairs Department from 1939 to 1940 and made great contributions to the post-war reconstruction of Wuhan. Mr. Shibayama came to Hankou again yesterday. Yesterday morning, he inspected the 29th Division of the Army and conducted a review. He expressed his gratitude for the division's achievements in fighting alongside friendly forces. At 5:00 PM, he met with reporters at the Provincial Government in Yihua Village and expressed his impressions. Mr. Shibayama first said, I have not been to Hankou for three years. Compared to today, everything in Wuhan has progressed, which is inspiring. The hot weather of Hankou is what impressed me the most. Yesterday, I inspected the Chinese National Army. As for other matters, I cannot report them yet. Secondly, regarding the progress of the Chinese National Army, Mr. Shibayama stated his impressions, saying that the National Army in Wuhan, whether in terms of quality or training, has made rapid progress and can now cooperate with the Japanese Army to ensure transportation lines, maintain public order, and achieve considerable results in suppression operations. This is the result of the efforts of Chinese cadres at all levels. Other political and economic aspects are more well-organized than they were at that time. Taking the Central China Industrial Bank as an example, I am very pleased to hear about its current situation. The achievements of the new provincial and municipal administration are gradually improving due to the efforts of the Provincial Governor and Mayor. Today, I visited the 28th Division of the Hankou Army and spoke to them in the scorching sun for about 40 minutes. Their posture of standing at attention remained unchanged from beginning to end, which shows that they have been well-trained. The quality of an army depends on the quality of its commander. Although there is no shortage of excellent troops in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, in general, the local troops are superior to those in the lower reaches. However, if the Chinese Army wants to achieve true excellence, improvements are still needed in terms of organization, equipment, and pay. After I return home, I will strive to study how to build an excellent army. I have not been to Hankou for a long time and have been quite concerned, so I came to Hankou despite the hot weather. Mr. Shibayama then answered reporters' questions regarding the recent surge in the number of Chongqing military generals participating in the peace movement, saying that the new policy of January 9 has penetrated the "Chongqing Army" on the front lines, which is constantly being strongly suppressed by the Japanese Army. Chongqing has now lost the basis of its spirit of resistance, and the politics of the National Government have been put on track. Therefore, the cooperation of the Japanese side is all the more necessary. The Chongqing side is trying its best to cover up the true state of affairs, but its predicament is obvious. At this time, the politics of the National Government have been established, and the National Army can take the place of the Japanese Army to independently maintain public order and expel the Communist Army, so that the meaning of participating in the war can be realized, and public order can be established, material resources can be enriched, and productivity can be increased, so that it can serve as a logistics base for the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, the recent rise in prices and the obstruction of transportation and production are a major reason. If public order can be independently maintained, it can be resolved. If the National Army can replace the Japanese Army in maintaining public order as soon as possible, the Japanese Army can devote all its strength to destroying Britain and the United States and realizing the spirit of Sino-Japanese unity, one body, common life, and common death.

### North China Japanese Army Declares Assistance for Food Policy

### Japan Willing to Assist China in Achieving Self-Reliance and Independence – Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Publishes Editorial

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Asahi Shimbun published an editorial today titled "A New Stage in Sino-Japanese Solidarity," stating the following: Prime Minister Tojo, in his policy speech to the 82nd Extraordinary Diet, clarified that he would fundamentally revise the treaties concluded between China and Japan and further seek to achieve a cooperative system between the two countries. This point deserves special attention. As for the content of the revision, it is not something that we can speculate on. However, the fact that Japan has spared no effort to assist China in achieving self-reliance and independence is a clear fact. Secondly, with the Chinese people as their partners, they are realizing the sincere desire for harmony and mutual assistance. From this, one can see Japan's high expectations for China. Therefore, the Chinese people should thoroughly understand that without completing the Greater East Asia War, Greater East Asia cannot be liberated, and without engaging in the construction of Greater East Asia, Greater East Asia will never have happiness. The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must be based on the spirit of good neighborliness and cooperation, united by the ten billion people of Greater East Asia. However, the absolute prerequisite is that China and Japan, the axis of East Asia, must thoroughly understand each other and cooperate with sincerity. It is no exaggeration to say that without complete harmony and solidarity between China and Japan, the Greater East Asia War cannot be successfully concluded. The new Japan's policy towards China, implemented in January of this year at the same time as China's entry into the war, has enabled China to break away from a century of shackles and achieve the goals of the Chinese National Revolution in abolishing unequal treaties and striving for independence and freedom. From this, one can see Japan's true intention is not to destroy China, but to complete China's independence and national prosperity. As for the current Chongqing regime, which is now engaged in resistance against Japan, it must also recognize this fact. Therefore, Japan's new policy has a profound impact on the Chongqing side, and the internal turmoil in its camp is impossible to conceal. Japan's China policy has had a great effect on resolving the incident, but it has not yet caused the anti-Japanese regime to collapse immediately. As far as the true meaning of resolving the incident is concerned, even if the anti-Japanese regime has collapsed, if the entire Chinese people do not want to participate in harmonious cooperation and mutual assistance with Japan, then the goal will still not be considered achieved. For the present, looking forward to the Chinese government enabling the people to more thoroughly understand Japan's sincerity, fundamentally breaking away from the idea of resisting Japan, and making further efforts to realize Sino-Japanese cooperation, we believe that the revision of the Sino-Japanese treaty in the future will aim to develop and realize a new path of harmony and mutual assistance between China and Japan, and will be implemented as soon as possible.

### On the Eve of a Storm: The European War Brews: Italy Announces Mobilization of All Female Youth to Actively Strengthen Domestic Defenses

Rome, 21st (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency's correspondent in the Italian capital, Hohenbasshu, declared: The current relative calm on all fronts is a "the calm before the storm" phenomenon. It is predicted that a major war will erupt in the summer. Italian newspapers are taking a reserved attitude towards criticisms of various possibilities and future changes. They all say that the current calm in the war is to allow Italians to be prepared to prevent possible enemy attacks. As for the Italian domestic front, it is now actively preparing everything. This is an unprecedented phenomenon since the Fascist government came to power. Furthermore, the Italian authorities have announced the mobilization of Italian women aged +8 to 2+4. This measure is of profound significance, especially because women in southern Italy are extremely conservative and traditionally stay at home before marriage. In addition, all areas in Italy that have been bombed are still evacuating people.

Rome, 21st (Central News Agency) – Sweden News Agency reports: According to an order issued by the Italian Cabinet yesterday, the implementation of forced labor service in Italy was originally the responsibility of the Fascist party, but has now been transferred to the Labor Union Department to continue.

### US Coal Miners Carry Out Third General Strike: Munitions Industry Faces Unprecedented Crisis

Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Washington: The US coal miners' strike has not improved after the second temporary resumption of work deadline expired on the night of the 20th. 570,000 coal miners across the United States have begun their third general strike. After the first two strikes, the amount of coal reserves in the steel industry and munitions factories across the United States was greatly reduced. Therefore, this general strike will have a greater impact than in the past. It is expected that most steel factories in Alabama and Pennsylvania, although they can barely maintain operations for a few more days, will eventually have to shut down. Therefore, the entire US munitions industry can be said to be in an unprecedented crisis. The citizens of Cincinnati are extremely disgusted and disappointed with both the mine owners and the miners. American public opinion is also criticizing union president Lewis for failing in negotiations and condemning the incompetence of the US government. Furthermore, the anti-strike bill recently passed by the US Congress has been sent to Roosevelt. Government officials have repeatedly requested the President to sign and punish Lewis and others, which will inevitably provoke the anger of the miners and worsen the situation.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) US Secretary of the Interior Ickes, who was originally scheduled to travel to Columbus, Ohio tonight to deliver a speech at the Governors Conference, has cancelled the above-mentioned itinerary this evening due to the sign that a national coal mine general strike will occur at midnight tonight.

Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Washington: US coal miners' union president Lewis convened a policy committee on the afternoon of the 20th to discuss what attitude to take because the wartime labor board had rejected the union's demands. The result of the discussion seems to have been to entrust Secretary of the Interior Ickes to resolve the dispute. It is reported that Frankfurter met with representatives of the union on the 20th to discuss the issue after the police were alerted. It is said that Lewis had already expressed a tough stance, saying that there was no room for negotiation with the mine owners and the wartime labor board. Therefore, Ickes began mediating. However, the policy committee has drafted a statement to clarify the union's attitude. The main content of the statement is that the temporary resumption period expired on the night of the 20th, and the 554,000 miners across the country should no longer continue to work given the attitude of the mine owners and the labor board. However, the policy committee is willing to negotiate with Ickes.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) German News Agency reports: On Saturday, Soviet forces launched three strong attacks in the northern section downstream of Kupensk, attempting to penetrate the spearhead positions held by German grenadiers, but were unsuccessful. In the remaining sections of the front, there were no major events to report except for guard and reconnaissance activities. The only battle worth mentioning is that a small German tank detachment carried out a sudden raid in the southern section, penetrating the Soviet fortified position and destroying over fifty bunkers in a very short period of time.

Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency) The German Air Force on the Eastern Front has been heavily bombing Soviet frontline positions and rear bases for several days. On the 19th, a powerful long-range bomber force attacked the key transportation hub of Yelets, about 400 kilometers southeast of Moscow, causing heavy damage to railway stations, freight cars, and railway facilities.

Although officials said that the meeting discussed wartime industrial problems, political circles in New Gold Mountain believe that the meeting is related to the upcoming elections. Prime Minister Curtin has not left his home for several days due to a throat ailment and was unable to attend the meeting.

### How to Understand the Other Party's Psychology

— Yoshida Toyosuke

The best way for Japanese people to understand China is to first observe everything from the standpoint of being in China. In other words, suppose you were Chinese, what would you think in that situation? In some cases, things that Japanese people would naturally find displeasing, Chinese people wouldn't get angry about. If Japanese people think that Chinese people are the same kind of people as Japanese people and don't get angry, that's a big mistake. Chinese people do get angry, and in fact, they are angry now. They know that if they get angry without thinking, disaster will soon befall them, so they don't show their anger outwardly. Judging by the appearance of Chinese people, they are different from Japanese people, so it's assumed that Chinese people are things. Japanese people are people, and Chinese people are people too. They feel hot things hot and cold things cold. No one is so stupid as to not know such a simple truth. But once it becomes a problem between nations, people can sometimes become that stupid. Let's give an example to illustrate:

If Japanese comrades quarrel, they don't just argue verbally like Chinese comrades; they immediately resort to physical violence. And Japanese comrades don't consider it a terrible insult to be beaten in a quarrel. However, if a Japanese person is beaten by a Chinese person in Japan, what do Japanese people think? Thinking a little further, Japanese people can't beat Chinese people in China. And the Chinese side considers being beaten a great humiliation. It's as insulting as having someone spit in a Japanese person's face. If a Chinese person spat in a Japanese person's face, what would that Japanese person think? Perhaps that Chinese person would soon be sent to the hospital!

I have a friend who works as a supervisor in a factory. Because a Chinese worker was lazy and couldn't work as he wanted him to, he put on a stern face to warn him. As a result, that Chinese person didn't come to work at the factory the next day, quit the company, and what's more, all of his lazy worker's friends didn't come to the company either. I said, "For Chinese people, being beaten is like having someone spit in their face for Japanese people." From then on, my friend never beat Chinese people again. My friend put himself in the position of the Chinese person and began to realize the seriousness of his actions.

My friend only beat one worker. If the other party was one of Shanghai's "dignitaries," what would be the result? Everyone knows that in Shanghai, there are so-called "dignitaries," who are respected and admired by Shanghai citizens, such as Mr. Wen Lant亭, Zhang Yi矚, Yuan Lv登, and Lin Geng侯, who are highly respected. Shanghai people use the affectionate term "old fathers" to respect and love these elders. In the era of chaotic political conditions in Shanghai, the status of these elders naturally became a political center. When trying to engage in social activities in Shanghai, people must first listen to the opinions of these elders and decide their attitude according to their opinions. Therefore, the social status of these dignitaries is equivalent to generals and ministers in Japan. And the reason why Shanghai society respects these elders so much is not because of their position, but because of the charisma of their personalities, so their position is quite strong. If these old gentlemen were beaten by Japanese people, Shanghai citizens would feel as if they themselves had been insulted. If a Japanese minister or general was spat on by a Chinese person, the Japanese people would not remain silent on this issue and would inevitably cause a major international problem. Therefore, when Japanese people in Shanghai beat Chinese people, it will cause unexpected and serious consequences. Looking at it this way, if the local Japanese people put themselves in the position of the Chinese people to consider things, things seem simple, but in fact, it should be known that there is a significant political impact between China and Japan. If most Japanese people have the generosity to observe everything from the standpoint of the Chinese people, the Sino-Japanese problem will present a completely different state from today! The spirit of the "Message to Japanese Soldiers" issued by the commander of the dispatched army, which has already been published, is to admonish Japanese soldiers to examine everything from the standpoint of the Chinese people. I believe that when this spirit is thoroughly implemented by the Japanese residents in China, it will be the time when the two major nations of China and Japan truly unite.

### Source of Rice for Citizens, Supply is Guaranteed, No Shortage: A Conversation with the Director of the Municipal Food Bureau

In order to promote wartime food administration and stabilize the entire food supply for citizens, the Municipal Food Bureau has completed the city's food system in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Food. From now on, the city's food supply will be more stable. Rice is the most important food for the people. In the past, it was supplied by the Central China Rice Distribution Cooperative, but now it has been transferred to the Rice Joint Operation Agency. Yesterday morning, a central reporter specially visited Mr. Zhang 　之, Director of the Municipal Food Bureau, to inquire about the future rice supply situation. He gave the following statement: "In the future, the purchase of rice will be handled by the Rice Joint Operation Agency under the regulations of the Ministry of Food. This kind of institutional adjustment will be more stable. Metered rationing will still be handled by the original agencies. Various rumors are purely speculation. There is absolutely no problem with the source of food for the people. The city needs more than 200,000 bags of rice per month. The rice source is abundant, and the supply is guaranteed. July and August are originally the lean months, but we can still get through them safely. In September, when the new rice is harvested, the rice supply will naturally be more abundant."

### Shen Bao Scholarship Fund, Registration Divided into New and Old Student Groups, Tingyunlou Holds Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings to Help Students

Since the active preparation of the fifth Shen Bao Scholarship Fund, it has been decided to start accepting applications from July 1. However, it is expected that there will be many applicants, so it has been decided to divide the registration into new and old student groups. When students collect the registration form, they must first specify whether they are current students or new students, so as to avoid errors. In addition, all sectors of society have spared no effort to support this scholarship fund. Tingyunlou's charity exhibition of calligraphy and paintings to help poor students, the Cheng Society's charity performance of plays for children who have dropped out of school, and donations from all sectors to establish more scholarships are all appreciated. Details are as follows:

Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings at Tingyunlou

The charity exhibition and sale of calligraphy and paintings hosted by Tingyunlou opened today (22nd) at the Daxin Art Gallery. It has collected more than 2,000 fan paintings from famous calligraphers and painters at home and abroad, which will be sold at marked prices. All proceeds will be donated to the Shen Bao scholarship fund. The initiators of this event are all well-known figures in Shanghai, and the exhibitors are all outstanding figures in the literary world. All expenses of the exhibition and the more than 2,000 custom-made fan paintings are borne by Shao Daren. The exhibitors participate in calligraphy and paintings completely as donations and do not calculate remuneration. The Daxin Art Gallery originally charged a commission on each item, but it has also generously waived it. All of these efforts are to benefit poor students and cultivate talents for society. It is hoped that there will be no lack of sympathy in the country, and that people will actively compete to purchase and jointly support this charity event. The origin of the event is recorded below:

Cheng Society Scheduled to Give a Charity Performance of a Play

The Cheng Society, composed of some students from various universities, will respond to the Shen Bao scholarship fund during the summer vacation. It is scheduled to give a charity performance of the historical costume drama "Wu Zetian" at the Xuangong Theater on July 3, 4, and 5.

### Mutual Assault between Police and Vendors Occurs at Central Market Yesterday

At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, a dispute occurred between street vendors and market gate guards at the Central Market on North Xizang Road, resulting in mutual assaults and injuring one police officer and several vendors. The incident was triggered by the market police's spot check of vendors' registration certificates. These registration certificates are not usually strictly checked. Yesterday, the enforcement was suddenly strict, resulting in many vendors who had not registered and had no certificates, or who had certificates but did not carry them, being refused entry to the market. In an instant, hundreds of people gathered outside the market, inquiring of the police. The police, seeing the large number of people, resorted to force to disperse them. The vendors refused to obey, leading to mutual assaults. When the market police captain arrived, the crowd had already dispersed. The injured were sent to the hospital for treatment, and the incident was reported to the market authorities. They are now studying ways to improve the gate management.

"Heavenly flowers, diligent irrigation to make them flourish; auspicious metals appearing on the earth, skillful molding to make them tools. Those called national treasures are truly the youth. If people are not taught, the country will have nothing to rely on. This is the effect of Wei Wen收's respect, diligence, and study, and Goujian's merit of living, gathering, teaching, and training. Now, gold is expensive, rice is like pearls, and firewood is like cassia. Poor scholars find it difficult to live in peace in their homes, and many orphans drop out of school on the road. We and others are secretly worried, ashamed of having no great mansions, thinking to strive to do our best, using our meager abilities. Therefore, we have solicited two thousand pages of fans and invited calligraphers and painters from home and abroad to donate calligraphy and paintings. We will hold an exhibition and charity sale at the Daxin Art Gallery, and donate all the proceeds to the Shen Bao scholarship fund to help the poor and nurture talents. However, things rely on the strength of the masses. We hope that righteous persuasion and benevolent giving will jointly fulfill our grand wish. We want to make the flowering brush a testament to the cultivation of the wisdom of scholars; we also want to make the money spread on the ground a blessing to the benevolent winds of the broad seat. Respectfully."

### Materials Investigation Committee Establishes Chinese and Japanese Investigators, Thoroughly Investigates Hoarding and Rectifies the Source, Chairman Chen Expresses His Views

The Shanghai Materials Investigation Committee has been formally established and will begin its work immediately. Mayor Chen of the city, who is also the chairman of the committee, spoke yesterday about the tasks, directions, and aspirations of the committee after its establishment: The Shanghai Materials Investigation Committee held its first Sino-Japanese joint meeting yesterday. The members present and the matters resolved have been reported in the newspapers. The members came from Nanjing especially, and their enthusiastic participation is greatly appreciated. The most important point is the agreement to establish Chinese and Japanese investigators, and to establish the committee's and investigators' offices immediately. The investigators will begin their work soon. In the future, the materials held by people of any nationality inside and outside the city and concessions will be investigated at any time and anywhere in accordance with the authority granted by the committee. From registration to inspection of public and private warehouses and private storage, all will be handled by the relevant agencies designated by the committee, so as to detect materials in the most expeditious manner. If this is carried out, hoarders will find it difficult to hide. As for the materials seized, they will be handled in accordance with government laws and regulations. Wartime materials should be concentrated and utilized, on the one hand to meet the needs of the war, and on the other hand to stabilize people's livelihood. If merchants and private individuals can deeply understand righteousness, implement national policies, and cooperate in the war, seeking only legitimate business profits, then the government can regulate supply and demand and coordinate responses under the implementation of control policies. However, in recent years, even in Shanghai alone, unscrupulous merchants have taken advantage of wartime opportunities to hoard and speculate, seeking only huge profits and disregarding the interests of the public, even endangering the future of the country. It goes without saying that they have violated the laws, but because they have hindered the needs of the war, their crime is greater than profiting. Since the government has recognized the problem of hoarding, it is also paying attention to legitimate supply and demand. Therefore, the investigation and handling of hoarding, the dispatch of personnel to thoroughly investigate, has been reported in the newspapers. Now, in order to further rectify the source, the committee has been established, with Chinese and Japanese members working together and thoroughly investigating, so that unscrupulous merchants have no place to hide and hoarding has no place to conceal. With the materials no longer in the hands of a few hoarders, and able to circulate, prices will naturally tend to be flat, which is the purpose of the establishment of this committee and its only task.

### Police Headquarters Promulgates Special Self-Defense Precautions, Lao Zha District Special Police Managed by Police Station, Each Industry as a Unit of One Company

In order to adapt to the needs of the environment, the Police Headquarters has ordered various public places to organize special self-defense groups to assist patrol police and existing self-defense group members in maintaining public security. Most public places have followed the order and organized themselves one after another and started performing their duties. However, there are still many who do not understand the responsibilities of the special self-defense groups and the allocation of members. Recently, in order to correct this shortcoming, the Police Headquarters issued notices to various public places, elaborating on the points to be noted in the organization of special self-defense groups.

Special Self-Defense Precautions

There are nine points to be noted: (1) Public places of considerable scale (dance halls, restaurants, cinemas, bathhouses, etc., the register is prepared by the detective office) should send one or several employees to patrol every day. (2) The personnel assigned to this task are called "special self-defense." (3) Special self-defense personnel are exempt from guard duty at Baojia pavilions and police duties. (4) Special self-defense personnel should be equipped with a white armband with the letters GCS (the first letters of special self-defense in Western characters) and the Chinese characters "Special Civilian Police" in black, which will be supplied by the police station. (5) The duties of special self-defense begin when the place of employment of each self-defense opens for business, and end only after everyone in the place has completely left. (6) The manager or person in charge of each public place should prepare a weekly duty roster for each employee assigned to special self-defense. One copy of the roster should be prominently displayed in the office of each place, and another copy should be sent to the Baojia office of the police station. Any changes in duty should be notified to the police station in writing within 24 hours. (7) Special self-defense personnel should pay attention to checking for packages or objects left in the place by customers that are suspicious in form or weight. If suspicious packages are found, the special self-defense personnel should immediately notify the person in charge of the place and the police station. Under no circumstances should the suspicious objects be moved. If there is a danger of danger, all people in the room where the package or object was found should be completely evacuated. (8) If customers have conversations about actions that violate public order, the special self-defense personnel should immediately report to the police station. (9) Under any circumstances, special self-defense personnel should be careful when performing inspection work. The civilian police in the Lao Zha district are managed by the police station.

The chairman of the meeting was Wen Lanting.

Wen Lanting's Speech

First, Mr. Wen Lanting delivered a speech, the original text of which is as follows: "It has been four months since the Association convened its general membership meeting on February 25th. Originally, the Association's affairs should have been actively carried out, but due to the busy schedules of the members and the lack of a suitable meeting place, progress was delayed. Thanks to the assistance of various friendly foreign agencies, especially the enthusiastic support of the naval attaché's office, we were able to lease this well-equipped meeting place. Here, all of our members should express our deep gratitude. At the last membership meeting, in addition to welcoming new members, we also welcomed Minister Tajiri, Consul General Yano, and other gentlemen from the embassy.

"I remember that Minister Tajiri said at the time: 'You may have misunderstood Japan's military, territorial, and even economic ambitions to conquer China in the past. In fact, Japan's intention is not to conquer China. Japan always views China as a friend and desires to make China independent and to respect its autonomy and sovereignty.

"'I came to Shanghai last November and was deeply surprised by the economic decline of Shanghai and the severance of its relations with the interior. Therefore, I have been striving to revive Shanghai's economy as soon as possible and to facilitate the flow of goods in the interior. When the scope of activities of Chinese and Japanese industrialists and businessmen is broadened, the restrictions on the movement of goods should naturally be eased.

"'However, no one should take advantage of the extensive scope of trade to hoard goods for personal gain, nor should anyone handle goods arbitrarily for the sake of profit. In this regard, I hope that industrialists and businessmen will take the initiative to develop appropriate measures. In the current situation, we must be vigilant against anything that smacks of war aims.'

"In these four months, Japan's new policy toward China has been gradually implemented, such as the concretization of the return of concessions, the organization of the Commercial Control Association, and the crackdown on hoarding. These are all the result of Minister Tajiri's efforts, and we express our sincere respect and gratitude.

"We are very pleased that Minister Tajiri, General Oka, and other officials have graced today's membership meeting with their presence. We would like to ask Minister Tajiri to address us and give us guidance. Furthermore, Mr. Kanjiyama, the secretary of our association, will soon be transferring to the Tianjin Mitsui branch as manager. He has worked diligently for the association in the past. Today, we bid him farewell and present him with a specially made silver cup as a memento, and we wish him boundless future development."

Minister's Speech

Following this, Minister Tajiri gave a speech, saying in brief: "The goal of building the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is to liberate the countries of East Asia. Within the East Asian region, all countries, regardless of size or strength, should cooperate with each other in order to reap the greatest strength. For example, one plus one equals two is a mathematical certainty. In my view, under the current circumstances, when one country cooperates with another, its strength is not just two, it must become three, or four, five... Therefore, the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere hopes that each country can cooperate with each other, not fight each other, and unite together in order to increase the great strength of the entire East Asia." The recent Japanese special session of parliament included a report on diplomatic policy by Foreign Minister Guang. He put forth "mutual benefit and equality." The United Kingdom and the United States have also used this as a diplomatic slogan in the past, but in reality, what the United Kingdom called "mutual benefit" was purely based on the interests of one country. However, the "equality and mutual benefit" of the countries within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is completely different. It is under a common goal that each contributes all of its remaining strength in order to build a new order in East Asia.

"The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is like a large family. The head of the household and the family members each have their own responsibilities and duties, and they work together to ensure the stability of the entire family so that the entire family can achieve happiness. In the past, the countries of East Asia were invaded by the United Kingdom and the United States, and the forces of discord have now been driven out. In the future, there should be no factors of discord.

"Japan's hope for China is that China will be successful in its revival and reconstruction. The Shanghai business community in the past was deeply influenced by the egoism of British and American merchants, who only sought their own great profits and disregarded the public interest. In the future, I sincerely hope that the business community within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, especially the economic circles of Shanghai, will thoroughly change their business goals. While personal profits are necessary, the public interest must be taken into consideration."

Report on Association Affairs

Finally, Secretary Dong Daoqing reported on the affairs of the Association:

"(1) Brief Overview of Association Affairs: Since its establishment last September, the Association has received support from all sides, and its affairs have made increasing progress. In the beginning, No. 301 Hong Kong Road, the Bank Association, was used as a temporary office. Later, through the efforts of Japanese Deputy Director Komuro and Secretaries Kurimoto and Kanjiyama, the Association was able to lease Nos. 408 to 411 and No. 3 on the fourth floor of the Xingya Building as its new headquarters in May of this year. Furthermore, the Association originally had 100 members. Since February of this year, in accordance with the resolution of the first board meeting, 20 new members have been recruited from both sides, for a total of 140 members. All of them are highly respected figures in the industrial, commercial, and financial circles of this city, so that we can jointly plan the development of the Association's affairs. This is truly something to be celebrated for the future of the Association.

"(2) Finances: The Association's finances currently rely entirely on membership fees, but membership fee income is limited. As the Association's affairs progress in the future, expenditures will increase accordingly. Measures should be taken in advance. I will report separately as follows:

"1. Revenue and Expenditure: The Association's membership fee is 50 yuan per month per member. Before March of this year, there were 100 members, with a monthly membership fee income of 5,000 yuan. Because expenses were kept to a minimum, this could be maintained with effort. Any shortfall was made up with the 20,000 yuan of founding fees paid by the founders. The rent for the new headquarters alone is 9,195 yuan, and other expenses such as water, electricity, and property taxes have also increased, resulting in a monthly shortfall of about 10,000 yuan. The second board meeting resolved to raise 60,000 yuan for the next six months, plus 100,000 yuan for the equipment of the new headquarters, for a total of 160,000 yuan. 2. Increase Membership Fees: As the Association's expenses will increase in the future, the original membership fee of 50 yuan per month per member will not be sufficient. Starting in October of this year, the monthly fee will be increased by 100 yuan. This is hereby submitted to the general meeting for ratification. 3. Endowment Fund: In order to develop the Association's affairs, the second board meeting has resolved to raise an endowment fund of 1 million yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Members will jointly raise the funds and are free to make donations. This is submitted to the general meeting for ratification. 4. The addition of approximately 100,000 yuan of furniture for the new headquarters is hereby submitted to the general meeting for ratification. 5. Soon, a simple dining hall is planned to be set up for the use of members."

After the report, Chairman Wen, on behalf of the board, telegraphed Secretary Kanjiyama a silver cup. Secretary Kanjiyama then gave a speech of thanks. Afterwards, refreshments were served, photographs were taken, and a movie was shown. The meeting adjourned around 7:00 PM.

Economic Circles' Commentary

### On Centralized Trading of Chinese Stocks

Thirty-five Chinese stock brokerage firms in this city, after being granted licenses to resume business, are reportedly preparing to temporarily organize a "Chinese Stock Brokerage Association" in order to earnestly adopt a policy of self-discipline and plan for centralized trading. This is a precursor to the organization of a formal stock exchange and the establishment of a formal stock market, and should not be taken lightly.

On February 24th of this year, this column stated: "In the current wartime economic environment, there is a need to establish a formal market for Chinese stocks as soon as possible. We hope that the authorities will convene representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors to discuss the establishment of a formal stock market based on the local environment and with reference to the established practices of other countries. At the same time, they should instruct them to lead stock brokerage firms in organizing a formal association to engage in the proper operation of Chinese stocks in accordance with laws and regulations, so that industrial and commercial enterprises can obtain flexible funding and promote production through normal Chinese stock trading."

According to recent news reports, the government, in order to guide idle capital into proper investment channels, has reportedly approved the resumption of the securities exchange. The organization of the "Association" by Chinese stock brokerage firms at this time demonstrates that the centralized trading of Chinese stocks will certainly become a reality. Its significance can be explained as follows: (1) Centralized trading can eliminate the independent business practices of Chinese stock brokerage firms and make the Chinese stock market an open market, preventing the harboring of stock speculation. (2) Centralized trading can facilitate all kinds of communication, make stock turnover more flexible, and prevent stock prices from being manipulated behind the scenes, so that they do not fluctuate erratically. (3) After centralized trading, securities trading can gradually guide idle capital into the production sectors of national capital. This is the basic goal of securities trading, especially in today's China—a time when foreign goods are disappearing and domestic goods are rising. Improving production, increasing output, and improving products are the only prerequisites for increasing the value of securities.

Therefore, the future of Chinese stocks should be judged by the future of production enterprises. If any other measure is used to assess Chinese stocks, it would not only be too superficial and unreasonable, but also would not be instructive.

### Silver and Money Shops to Adjust and Increase Deposit Interest Rates Starting in the Second Half of the Year

Silver and money shops have decided to increase deposit interest rates in principle in order to attract idle capital from society. Each bank and money shop will handle this with reference to market conditions and will begin to implement it starting in the second half of the year (i.e., July 1st). Yesterday, it was learned that each bank and money shop has adjusted the interest rates on commercial, savings, and trust deposits. They especially emphasize the interest rates on time deposits. Previously, the maximum annual interest rate was 1%, but now it has been increased to 1.5%, depending on the term of the time deposit. The interest rate for one year is 6% or 8%, for two to five years it is 8% or 1%, and for more than five years the interest rate is above 1%. The interest rate on demand deposits has been increased from 0.1% to 0.4% or 0.5%. For example, Juxingcheng Bank has announced: "The interest rate on all types of demand deposits in this bank, originally set at an annual rate of 3%, will be uniformly increased to an annual rate of 5% starting from July 1st of this year." The use of deposit funds will be handled entirely in accordance with laws and regulations and will be used for production and construction projects, such as loans to agriculture and industry. However, the above-mentioned loans will be given special scrutiny, and will be rejected if they do not meet the established standards, in order to prevent speculation and hoarding.

### The Accounting of Siming and Other Banks Has Been Completed, and Reorganization Will Be Implemented in Mid-July, Following the Same Steps as the Central and Bank of Communications

The National Government's Ministry of Finance believes that it is necessary to thoroughly reorganize the Siming, China General Chamber of Commerce, China Industrial, and China National Products Banks, which were jointly operated by officials and merchants before the incident, in order to dissolve their relationship with Chongqing. All government shares should be taken over by the government. Therefore, it specially ordered the Financial Inspection Office to work with the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Office to reorganize and investigate the accounts of the four banks and decided to reorganize them. All government shares will be taken over by the Central Reserve Bank. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Office and the Financial Inspection Office have completed the investigation of the accounts under order. They submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance for approval yesterday. According to a Central News Agency reporter, among the four banks, except for the China National Products Bank, which is a branch in Shanghai, the other three banks—China General Chamber of Commerce, Siming, and China Industrial—are all headquartered in Shanghai. Government shares account for 90% of the shares, while merchant shares account for only 10%. Therefore, the government's reorganization will re-evaluate the amount of shares held by officials and merchants. The reorganization steps will be roughly the same as the reorganization of the Central and Bank of Communications. All business policies and important personnel of the four banks will be designated and determined by the Ministry of Finance. It is heard that the reorganization of the four banks will be implemented around mid-July.

### Bankers Association to Hold General Membership Meeting Regularly

The Shanghai Bankers Association, in order to comply with the current Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Associations of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and to implement the reorganization of association affairs, has now decided to hold a general membership meeting at 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month to elect directors and supervisors and amend the articles of association to suit the wartime economic system. It has already sent letters to all members, instructing them to send representatives to attend and participate in the discussions on time.

### Edible Oil Industry Federation Held Its Second Meeting of Directors and Supervisors Yesterday

Now, before the implementation, the Commission has stipulated measures for purchasing food in order to make procurement smooth, instructing the cooperatives and transport cooperatives responsible for purchasing to comply with and handle them from the 19th.

### Tobacco Merchants Organize China Tobacco Company

According to a Datong News Agency reporter, Chinese tobacco merchants Chen Chenglun, Yang Runlin, etc. in this city have initiated the organization of "China Tobacco Co., Ltd.," with a total capital of 30 million national currency. At the first founders' meeting, 15,120,000 yuan was subscribed by the founders. At the second meeting of the founders, it was resolved that the remaining 14,880,000 yuan would be subscribed by various tobacco industry members. However, the number of shares subscribed by each member shall not exceed 200,000 yuan. The subscription procedure will end at the end of this month. The Shanghai Tobacco Industry Association has also notified all members to expedite the membership procedures, but the association will not reserve places for those who have not joined and subscribed for shares by the deadline.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks initially stabilized but then fell back, but a few stocks were favored by investors. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Co. moved towards a high peak, while World Book fell back. In the department store industry, Wing On, Sincere, and National Products fell by a few yuan, and lingerie also fell by a few cents. In the shirt factory sector, Jinglun rose, while Jingfu was slightly weaker. In the textile industry, Wing On Textiles outside the customs area was unlikely to stand for long, and the price of Sino-British rose significantly, but then stabilized. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water & Electricity and China General Edison remained firm. However, the new pharmaceutical industry showed significant weakness. Jiu'an Industrial and Tung Yih Trust remained firm; the transaction price of Amoy Food reached a new high; and Canned Foods continued to trade outside the customs area.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds: In the gray market for unified government bonds, the prices of the five types of bonds (A, B, C, D, E) all rose by one to several yuan.

Gold and Silver: Gold shops trading jewelry were charging a handling fee on top of the limited price. The transaction prices inside and outside the industry fell slightly, more than one hundred lower than last Saturday, due to uncertain sentiment and weak trading. The listed price of standard silver did not move, but the transaction price inside and outside the industry has exceeded the limited price.

Grains: In recent days, grain prices have risen sharply. The price of soybean cake has risen particularly sharply due to strong actual sales and speculation, and the price has broken out of the customs area and is rising rapidly. The prices of other grains such as soybeans and mung beans have also jumped, and the price of broad beans has also rebounded.

### Constancy and Contingency

— Sha Lei

Constancy is easy, but contingency is not!

Under normal circumstances, everything is rational, following steps in an unhurried manner. Dealing with it in this way reduces the chances of committing great errors to almost zero. This is not only because there are certain rules to follow and ample time for broad consultation, but also because the river is fundamentally calm. Even a small boat, even if the driver's knowledge and experience are immature and lacking in skill, will not likely face the tragedy of capsizing. Although it may take more effort and time and involve more twists and turns, reaching the other shore is not difficult.

But things in the world are never always smooth sailing. As the saying goes, "Trouble arises unexpectedly, disaster starts within." At this time, if one panics, loses focus, and becomes speechless, like a storm suddenly striking the sea, one will be intimidated by the wind and tossed about by the waves, unable to hold the rudder and oars, and the ship will naturally lose its balance. Coupled with inappropriate responses, the rudder may be mistakenly turned, the oars lost, and the turbulent waves will engulf everything.

Contingency is a moment of great urgency. The first thing to do is to maintain a calm attitude, assess the direction and degree of the oncoming force, and look for its weaknesses. At this time, the intellect and vision honed by knowledge and experience will emit the light of wit and keen insight. It will unleash the power of a strong wind to sweep away everything!

Mediocrity and competence are only clearly distinguished in constancy. Contingency will be a touchstone. The glory of life, like gold refined a hundred times, becomes more brilliant the more it is polished. This will forever be shown in the annals of human history.

### Should Love be Discussed During School Years?

— Shen Ai Ying

A Humble Opinion on the Merits and Demerits of Co-education

In its societal commentary on the 5th of this month, this newspaper, under the title "A Re-examination of the Merits and Demerits of Co-education," discussed the advantages and disadvantages of co-education, claiming that "from theoretical verification to reality, the co-educational system has not yielded results as beneficial as predicted." Moreover, it asserted, "the reality is that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages." Indeed, we should acknowledge the prevailing negative situations in many secondary schools, such as the excessive pursuit of freedom, indulgence in frivolous activities, reckless discussions of love, and neglect of academic pursuits. However, I believe this is not merely an educational issue but is closely linked to the family and society as a whole. In other words, it is a part of the entire societal problem, and its remedy must be intertwined with other societal issues.

Considering the co-educational system itself, it is inherently good. Whether we examine it from a historical, socio-political, or educational perspective, it has reasons and value for its existence. In my humble opinion, the so-called "reckless discussions of love" are not entirely a result of co-education. If "reckless discussions of love" only arose because of co-education, the solution would be simple: abolish co-education, and the problem would be completely solved. However, such a solution is not thorough. To thoroughly remedy this malpractice, at least the following issues must be addressed:

(1) The issue of family education. As the proverb says, "The mother is the cradle of humanity." This means that the foundation of a person is built upon family education. Looking back at our country, most parents generally do not pay much attention to their children's education within the family (although there are exceptions). Especially in wealthy families in Shanghai, with very few exceptions, they simply do not prioritize family education. They only know how to indulge their children, thinking that as long as they raise them and send them to school, they have fulfilled their responsibilities. This is a terribly misguided mentality! Therefore, if parents want their children to improve, they must set an example themselves and thoroughly emphasize family education to be effective.

(2) The issue of school education. Education is inherently a sacred undertaking, shouldering the responsibility of cultivating well-rounded individuals. However, the corruption of the education system in Shanghai is far more serious than the "reckless discussions of love" arising from co-education! They use education as a tool for profit and wealth. What they focus on is not cultivating well-rounded individuals, but how to make their businesses thrive. This has led to ugly phenomena such as infighting and mutual exclusion among "competitors." In such circumstances, students who were already poorly behaved become worse, and those who were originally better become corrupted. This must be thoroughly reformed.

(3) The issue of the social environment. As the aforementioned societal commentary stated, "The social landscape of Shanghai is, undeniably, a trap of extravagance and dissipation." Here, both government-run and private casinos open their jaws like bloodthirsty beasts, relentlessly devouring people's money and even their lives! Here are low-brow, cheesy movies; disguised and tempting dance halls; and the most expensive luxury cosmetics and decorations... With so many "great places" to go, it is only natural that "going to movies together, dancing together, secretly taking money from home," and "enjoying dressing up, wearing makeup, and acting strangely" will continue to occur frequently. The authorities should also use their utmost determination to thoroughly eradicate gambling, improve the content of films, correct the purpose of dancing, and limit or even prohibit the production and sale of luxury cosmetics. In this way, if there are no traps in society, young people will not be in danger of falling into them. If there is no danger of falling into them, they will all readily embrace goodness, and there will be no major drawbacks.

(4) The issue of youth themselves. Can young people in their student years discuss love? My answer is yes. Because discussing love is inherently a part of youth. If young people don't discuss love, when will they? However, we should not engage in "reckless" discussions of love. First, we must establish a correct view of love. Love should not be merely for the sake of desire or temporary emotional impulses. True love is built on mutual work, the development of each other's talents, the pursuit and effort to gain mutual knowledge, and concern for social causes! Otherwise, it will be like fleeting clouds, easily dispersed. Understanding this makes it clear that love is not harmful or unhelpful. Overemphasizing emotions and recklessly engaging in love is akin to suicide. Emphasizing reason and engaging in correct love is akin to rebirth. In such circumstances, what sustains love is not money, going to movies, dancing, or wearing makeup, but the pursuit of knowledge, passion for work, and the development of talents. Of course, I am not against entertainment, but entertainment should be proper. True entertainment contains the meaning of "recreation" – restoring the spirit. In this sense, music, playing ball, painting, walking, etc., are all excellent methods. If one must seek particularly stimulating things, that is definitely not true entertainment. Therefore, those with a correct understanding of love will not hinder their future. On the contrary, it is a powerful factor in creating the future.

### ### Necessary Conditions for Success

— Zhu Fei

Although the determining conditions for a person's success are multifaceted, there is only one primary condition: having determination. Whether or not they can put in the effort to achieve great things!

Intelligence, knowledge, guidance from the environment, and encouragement from friends can all be said to be conditions that contribute to a person's success. However, if the person in question does not have the "determination" or "effort" to work hard, no matter how much guidance, encouragement, or innate talent and profound knowledge they possess, it will all be for naught. Among those who wander and die or beg from door to door, one cannot say that they do not possess the aforementioned conditions.

Conversely, there are many who are not inherently intelligent or who have not had the opportunity to acquire knowledge but still achieve success. Liu Bei and Zhu Yuanzhang were merely "village rascals" and "cowherds," yet they ultimately succeeded as "political leaders of an era" and "national heroes." The reason is that they possessed "determination" and the ability to "work hard."

Sun Yat-sen's success in revolution also depended on his unwavering "determination" and his persistent and continuous efforts despite numerous setbacks. This is also a very evident fact.

Eight or nine years ago, I had a relative who, as a child, was extremely naughty and rogue-like. Even at the age of twenty, he still wandered aimlessly, neglecting his duties. As a result, all the relatives despised him, and his parents and family hated him. Everyone affirmed that he was "a good-for-nothing." Later, he suddenly realized his mistakes and changed his attitude completely, becoming a very good person. Soon after, he applied to the Central Military Academy at the time, and after graduating, he quickly rose to the position of regimental commander or higher. Who could have predicted that!

Therefore, if we want to achieve our ideal goals and become extraordinary people, we must first have "determination" and then strive with an unyielding spirit. One day, we will surely succeed.

### ### Trying

— Wen Zhong

"Trying" can be said to be the initial step in turning ideals into action. If you harbor wonderful ideals but are afraid to try, those ideals will remain ideals and can never become reality. Because "trying" is the starting point for achieving success.

Through "trying," we can understand the overall trend and gain valuable lessons.

What is most important is that before trying something, you must carefully consider it with reason and confidence, have a broad vision, and thoroughly understand the advantages and disadvantages. Otherwise, trying rashly may lead to the tragedy of "one wrong step leading to eternal regret." Because "trying" is not only the starting point of the glorious road to success, but also the starting point of the diverging path to failure!
