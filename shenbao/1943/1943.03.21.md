Two months into the war, apart from the moral support, there seems to be no substantial assistance to our ally, Japan, for which we should feel ashamed. However, the realities manifested by the Chinese and Japanese authorities since entering the war have provided what we have been seeking for a century. The guarantees of China's independence and freedom, as stipulated in the Sino-Japanese Agreement, can now be said to be dawning. As the National Government increasingly embarks on a sound course, private enterprises seem to have hope of taking this opportunity to revitalize themselves, hence entering the war. The interrelationship between participating in the war, nation-building, and industrial development is also gradually understood by the general public. However, it must be particularly pointed out here that the current construction, whether national or private, must first consider the needs of participating in the war and whether it is beneficial to participating in the war; otherwise, everything will be in vain. Therefore, nation-building and industrial development during the period of participation in the war naturally have their limitations and characteristics.

Today, when we talk about nation-building, we indeed rely on the goodwill assistance of our ally, Japan, such as the supply of capital, technology, and machinery. However, in a general sense, the responsibility of completing the great task of nation-building is originally borne by us freely, and we must prepare for it immediately today, without any pretense or slackness. It is undeniable that our country is currently backward in industry, inconvenient in transportation, lacks capital, and has immature technology. Speaking of the great task of nation-building, there are truly numerous things to be done. However, precisely because of this, we must have a comprehensive and detailed plan, distinguish between urgency and importance, predetermine steps, and earnestly promote it. We must devote all our efforts to the important and urgent matters and complete them within a time limit. We will temporarily set aside the less important and less urgent matters and gradually plan their construction. In the past, because of the eagerness to achieve governance, we often planned too many things, and human and financial resources were insufficient. Therefore, some projects could not be completed as scheduled, or they encountered setbacks midway due to insufficient talent. From now on, we must resolutely change our style. We will not undertake projects without sufficient funding or without appropriate talent. For those projects that must be undertaken, we should strive for their completion with a spirit of competition and meticulousness. In particular, we must strive for accuracy and eliminate the long-standing habits of seeking to do too many things, competing with each other, only focusing on appearances, and not valuing achievements. In this way, various undertakings can be completed effectively, and the central government's finances can avoid severe pressure. This is the first point.

When we talk about the great task of nation-building, judging from the literal meaning, it seems that all matters related to the future of the country should be handled by the government. What private individuals operate has nothing to do with nation-building, nor can it be expected to be completed by private individuals' efforts. But in reality, in addition to certain special departments that must be fully planned by the government, many undertakings rely on the cooperation and promotion of the people. We hope that the government will establish a design and guidance institution, and enable the business community to use allied loans and absorb floating capital through formal securities markets to assist the government in developing industries. If the government has such a design and guidance institution, it can now classify and geographically specify various projects that should and can be done, and accurately announce them to the public, guide investment, and provide practical assistance to private enterprises. In this way, those with capital will know where to go, the degree of floating capital mischief can be considerably reduced, private industries will gradually develop, and progress in the national economy can be expected immediately. This is the second point.

Within the economic sphere, nation-building and industrial development are actually two sides of the same coin. The government undertaking projects is nation-building, and the people undertaking projects is also nation-building. In the war, everyone should be a soldier, and in the great task of nation-building, everyone can strive for first merit. Based on this concept, we believe that those with capital should have a broad vision and lofty aspirations, not seek immediate gains or quick profits, plan enterprises to benefit the country and the people, and currently, in addition to the necessary use of financial resources in business, they should save as much as possible in preparation for post-war needs. Reducing the circulation of legal tender at present is not only of great benefit to the country, but also the best plan for expanding their own business in the future. This is the third point.

In short, participating in the war is extremely important for winning national independence and freedom, but national independence and freedom can only be permanently guaranteed if nation-building is successful. Therefore, nation-building and industrial development are also extremely important. We sincerely hope that both the upper and lower levels will invigorate themselves, work hard in their respective positions, be pragmatic and realistic, and jointly achieve complete success.

Translated Commentary

### Shifts in US Policy toward the Soviet Union

During the course of the German-Soviet war, the United States witnessed the unexpected strength of the Soviet Union. As a result, discussions on the need for a fresh perspective on US policy toward the Soviet Union were rife. Consequently, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Standley, was the first to issue a statement criticizing the Soviet authorities for "not informing the public of the details of US aid to the Soviet Union." The most subtle aspect was that those greatly alarmed by Standley's statement were not the criticized Soviet government, but rather the American government and public themselves.

US aid to the Soviet Union is a fact. According to the review report released by the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee in late February, since the application of the US Lend-Lease Act to the Soviet Union in November 1941, until the end of last year, the materials supplied to the Soviet Union amounted to $1.532 billion. This included 5,600 aircraft and 6,200 tanks. Whether the aforementioned figures unilaterally released by the United States are accurate is unknown; even if they are true, it is also questionable whether the aforementioned materials can completely reach the Soviet Union. But in any case, we must admit that the United States has indeed supplied the Soviet Union with a considerable amount of military supplies. The aforementioned supply volume is only slightly less than one-third of the US aid to the UK, but it is about ten times the US aid to Chiang. Standley's statement that "the Soviet Union is by no means fighting solely on its own" is not an unreasonable fabrication.

However, the Soviet Union also has its own argument. The enormous sacrifices made by the Soviet Union in the war against Germany are insignificant compared to US aid to the Soviet Union. "The Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa is not considered a second front. If the UK and the US, with their national destinies at stake, are determined to form a common front with the Soviet Union, they should realize that they must make significant sacrifices and resolutely open a strong second front in Western Europe"â€”is this not the Soviet Union's view? The Soviet Union provides its human resources to defend the UK and the US, while the US supplies the Soviet Union with necessary materials within the range that ensures its own security. Once victory is achieved in the war, the US will be able to secure the strongest voice. The Soviet Union will not be indifferent to Roosevelt's self-serving attempt.

Standley's intentional statement, from the Soviet Union's independent standpoint, easily raises the risk of causing a negative attitude towards the United States. This is why the United States and even the United Kingdom were extremely embarrassed by Standley's gaffe. If the Soviet Union breaks away from the Anglo-American camp, the UK and the US will face an unprecedented crisis. This is an ironclad fact. While Standley made sarcastic attacks on the Soviet government, US Vice President Wallace claimed on the one hand that "do not quarrel with the Soviet Union" and is now restraining domestic Soviet phobias, expressing flattery to the Soviet Union. However, the re-recognition of the Soviet Union's strength, at the same time, the atmosphere of US vigilance against the Soviet Union, is visibly intensifying. Critic Trosh Thompson warned the nation that "the victory of the Soviet Union means the redization of the world." American "Soviet expert" Duranty criticized Stalin's realism and warned that American dependence on the Soviet Union should be limited. The New York Times said that the demands of the Soviet Union should be curbed. These are just a few examples.

The Soviet Union's growing strength after the war contains the meaning of the redization of Europe, and at the same time, there is a fear of direct conflicts of interest with the Soviet Union in West Asia. This is naturally a very unpleasant situation for the United States. However, in order to overcome the current crisis, it has no choice but to continue to cooperate with the Soviet Union. This dilemma makes the United States and even the United Kingdom feel caught in a difficult position and need to deal with it carefully.

However, the Anglo-Saxons are ultimately cunning and shrewd people. Because Stalin is not easily tempted by the UK and the US, they may have deliberately instructed Standley to create waves out of nowhere in order to have personal contact with Stalin. As a result, there were rumors of reaching an understanding with the Soviet Union, and the origin of the Roosevelt visit to the Soviet Union may have originated from this, it is not known. Even so, Roosevelt's visit to the Soviet Union and the supply of weapons may not necessarily lead to a sharp reversal of the estrangement between the UK and the US. The Soviet Union firmly demands that the UK and the US should make huge sacrifices. Only by making huge sacrifices like the Soviet Union can the UK and the US show that they are truly allies of the Soviet Union. If this step cannot be achieved, the Soviet Union will maintain freedom of action towards the UK and the US. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Daily News on March 14)

### North China Political Affairs Commission Convenes Provincial and Municipal Leaders' Meeting; Wang Yintai Reports on Economic Policies; Leaders Hope for Appropriate Handling

Beijing, 20th (Central News Agency) The North China Political Affairs Commission held a meeting of North China provincial and municipal leaders at the Beijing Diplomatic Building on the 20th.

Now, to stabilize the livelihood of the people in North China, the most important prerequisites are to ensure public security and food supply. However, in this extraordinary period, it is only natural to feel the difficulty of food supply.

### Japanese Army on the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River Shells Chongqing Ships, Sinking Seven Large Vessels; Two Warehouses Destroyed

Hankou, 20th (Central News Agency) The artillery unit of the Japanese army in Hubei Province, having detected an increase in Chongqing ships on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River near Pingshanba (8 kilometers northwest of Yichang) and Xiling Mountain (5 kilometers north of Yichang), used multiple mountain guns hidden in the Jiangjunshan frontline position to fiercely shell Chongqing ships loaded with military supplies and the Pingshanba and Xiling port facilities from dawn on the 16th. The attacks continued throughout the day. The Chongqing army, suffering this unexpected blow, either fled from the boats or abandoned their positions and fled far away, causing extreme confusion. The Chongqing side's loss of this large number of ships is unimaginable, and since the Yangtze River waterway is controlled by the Japanese army, it will be even more difficult for the Chongqing side to transport supplies to Yichang as replenishment.

### Introduction of Members of the Japanese Cultural Envoy Delegation: Dr. Shioya Presents His Secret Collection, "The Great Unification Song"

(Tokyo Telephone) The Japanese Cultural Envoy Delegation participating in the commemoration of the return of the capital to China, led by Dr. On Shioya, Professor Emeritus of Tokyo University, a leading expert in the study of Chinese literature, departed from Tokyo on the night of the 22nd, traveling by land to Nanking. The doctor  has gifts to present to Chairman Wang, Foreign Minister Chu, and the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, namely, "The Great Unification Song" which Dr. Shioya has secretly held. "The Great Unification Song" is the lifelong work of Dr. Shioya's great-grandfather, Waka-in Weng, a Confucian official of the late Edo period. The entire work is written in classical Chinese in four-character lines, recording the historical events of the successive Japanese emperors. It is a national anthem of Japan that elucidates the great righteousness, filial piety, and the origins of the national polity. It was proofread and annotated by Dr. Shioya's father, Kazutaka Hara, and Kiyama Shioya, and printed by the Cabinet Printing Bureau Asahi Company in 1913. It is a rare book written in classical Chinese about Japanese history. Preparing to depart at his residence in Hisakane-cho, Koishikawa, he said in his busy schedule with joy at visiting Nanking:

"Carrying ten books is quite heavy. I will use the presentation of this book to introduce Japan's national polity, which I deeply believe is fortunate. On the way through Seoul, there will be a slight delay. It is scheduled to arrive in Nanking on the 29th. To promote Sino-Japanese friendship through thought and culture is only second to the fundamental problems of the military and economic aspects. In this cultural aspect, the revival of the inherent Eastern virtues of benevolence and righteousness is my private wish. When Mr. Tsai and Mr. Chu Minyi visited Japan at the end of last year, I made an appointment with Mr. Chu to definitely go to Nanking in April. I am deeply moved that I can now fulfill this promise."

Since the capital was established, contact between Dr. Shioya and Mr. Tsai has been maintained in various forms. When Mr. Tsai returned to the capital, he entrusted his own state of mind to a poem by Bian:

Indeed, the sun shines brightly on the South,

Transforming the scenery into  glowing clouds.

Four hundred million people  are all red,

Surely spreading the flowers of freedom everywhere.

Someone showed this poem to the doctor, and the doctor responded with a poem:

Four hundred million people  are all virtuous and radiant,

The sunny sky and white sun reflect the rosy clouds,

Peaceful nation-building brings back the leaves of spring,

Blooming and vying to open the flowers of East Asia.

The doctor gifted the poem, with deep meaning. The doctor solemnly carried a poem he had clipped from the newspaper three years ago:

"I plan to present this for your perusal during our meeting this time."

While saying this, he placed this five-centimeter square piece of old newspaper into his business card holder. With the freshness of a young man and an impatient face, he eagerly hoped to meet with Mr. Tsai and others again. (Sho: Translated from the Continental Daily News, March 21)

### Mr. Tanigawa Reveals His Feelings about Visiting China

(Tokyo Telephone) Mr. Tetsuzo Tanigawa, one of the members of the Cultural Envoy Delegation, is scheduled to depart from Tokyo for China on February 26 with Mr. Saneatsu Mushanokoji. At his residence in Higashida-cho, Suginami Ward, he told reporters, "This is my fifth time going to China." The following is what he said to reporters:

When the National Government returned to the capital, I was in Shanghai with Mr. Takeo Kato and Mr. Yoshio Toyoshima, and I was happy to celebrate the return of the capital. It has been three years now, and I think the situation of China's revitalization has greatly progressed. Every time I go to China, I meet with important figures of the National Government and have various discussions about Sino-Japanese relations. What I especially want to see on this trip to China is the activities of the intellectual class in China. Japan's policy towards China has recently made significant progress, and with this opportunity, I should be able to see joyful and lively activities among the Chinese intellectual class. The return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality have given the people of the emerging China vitality and light. China has become a truly independent country, and its bright future is set, so I know that I will definitely see their lively activities.

However, in the future, Japan should further strengthen the opportunity for co-prosperity with China. With this in mind, I would like to listen to the opinions of the people there and reveal my own thoughts. When I return, I will view the ancient art of China with Mr. Mushanokoji, and I am scheduled to return to Tokyo around April 20. (Ding: Translated from the Continental Daily News, March 21)

### Soviet Troops in the Kursk Salient Risk Being Cut Off; German Pressure Increases on Chuguev

Alliance News Agency, Stockholm, 20th â€“ According to news from the German-Soviet battlefront received here last night, the German army intensified its attack on the north side of the southern front of the Soviet army on Thursday. The Soviet troops protruding in the Kursk area are in danger of being cut off. Furthermore, the German army continued to cross the upper reaches of the Donets River northeast of Kharkov. A Reuters dispatch from Moscow stated that the great battle on the Donets River east of Kharkov has reached a critical stage. Both sides are engaging in fierce battles with large infantry and tanks on the half-frozen river, with uncertain advances and retreats. In some places, the Soviet army was forced to retreat, but the outcome of the battle has not yet been decided. German troops on the Chuguev front east of Kharkov are constantly receiving reinforcements, and the pressure is increasing. The German army has chosen several locations along the 150-mile line of the Donets River to set up pontoon bridges at night, which the Soviet army cannot prevent. Furthermore, according to news from Berlin, the Soviet army attempted to infiltrate German positions near Chuguev, about 20 miles southeast of Kharkov. The purpose was clearly to relieve the siege of the Soviet army south of the city, but the Soviet attack was repelled, and the German army made progress. Even if the Soviet reinforcements broke through the German lines, it would be too late, as the Soviet army surrounded south of Kharkov has already been annihilated. As for the area north of Kharkov, after the German army occupied Belgorod, the two armies are currently engaged in fierce battles between the city and Kursk. Although the Soviet army is resisting stubbornly, the German army is gradually advancing northeast. From this, it can be seen that the German commander's purpose is clearly to flank the Soviet army's protruding positions in the Kursk area. This is the last area that the German army must recapture in order to restore the Orel to Kharkov front. In addition, the Red Army continued to launch large-scale attacks in the Orel area, south of Vyazma, and the Yuteraya Lusa area south of Lake Ilmen. It is reported that the Red Army deployed multiple infantry divisions and tank brigades to attack the German lines, disregarding its significant losses, but without any progress. South of Vyazma on the central front, the Soviet army lost 93 tanks, and in the Steraya Lusa area, the Soviet army also lost 18 tanks, with thousands of casualties. The German Air Force continued to launch heavy attacks on the Soviet army on the eastern front and its supply lines. The Soviet side lost 58 aircraft on Thursday.

### Content of the Eden Meeting: Review of Principles Related to the International Situation; Soviet Government Will Remain Silent on China

Central News Agency, Argentinian City, 20th â€“ According to a dispatch from Washington, British Foreign Secretary Eden, after arriving here, quickly held talks with U.S. President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Litvinov. Regarding the content of the talks, Hull announced at a reception for reporters on the 18th that Foreign Secretary Eden and we held talks, which were less about discussing specific cases and more about discussing various principles and policies. The purpose of the talks was to review various principles that the anti-Axis governments can apply to the international political situation now and in the future. The results of the talks were beneficial to each other and very good. Observers here said that, judging from Hull's remarks, there is still little consensus among the anti-Axis countries on various principles and policies. As for the management after the war, it is not easy to resolve. There are still many difficulties regarding everything in the future. Eden's consultation with key figures in the U.S. government was exploratory in nature, but it also proved to be quite difficult.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th â€“ The Soviet government is maintaining a silent attitude towards Eden's meeting in Washington. Soviet newspapers and wireless dispatches have not published any comments on this. However, this silence has been broken by a TASS dispatch from Washington. The news released by the agency was published in newspapers across the Soviet Union. It is said that the scope of Eden's meeting in the United States was quite broad. In addition to discussing the promotion of cooperation between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, it also discussed post-war financial and economic issues. The agency also mentioned that Eden refused to discuss the Soviet-Polish border issue, which the Soviet Union considers to be one of the important issues. At a time when the Soviet Union is engaged in a battle for life and death, the United Kingdom and the United States neglected the interests of the Soviet Union and engaged in empty talk about post-war financial issues, which was dissatisfactory to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet government has rarely made any statements on foreign policy in the past three weeks. Stalin will inevitably maintain strict silence on the consultations made by the Allies in Washington. However, at home, there is extensive propaganda to make the Soviet people aware that what the Allies are currently discussing is not a Soviet issue, but a post-war capitalist issue. "Pravda" recently published an article pointing out that the Soviet Union is fighting alone. All of these are consistent with the Soviet government's propaganda policy, making the people aware that capitalism is still the Soviet Union's greatest enemy. Cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States is only a wartime expediency.

### German Troops Withdraw from Gafsa City According to Plan; German Troops on the Tunisian Coast Occupy One Important Hilltop

Alliance News Agency, Lisbon, 20th â€“ According to a dispatch from Berlin, after the British Eighth Army, under the command of General Montgomery, attacked the German Mareth Line and was defeated, the military appearance was chaotic. German troops in the northern coastal area of Tunisia broke into British positions by ten miles on Thursday and occupied a vital hilltop. As a result, all roads in this area are under the control of the Axis forces. German troops in central Tunisia withdrew from Gafsa according to plan. Yesterday's Allied communique stated that U.S. troops operating at El Guettar (a road junction twelve miles southeast of Gafsa) had occupied Gafsa. According to a Reuters dispatch last night, Italian troops are currently holding the mountainside and the Bo Hamran Valley, controlling the secondary road from El Guettar northeast to the coastal town of Mahares. Heavy rain has fallen for the past two days, accumulating to two inches, which is a quarter of the annual rainfall, causing widespread mud. Heavy vehicles are almost impassable. U.S. military operations are also hindered until the land dries out. At the same time, Allied headquarters disclosed that there are currently three U.S. divisions operating on the Tunisian front, namely the 1st Infantry Division, the 34th Division, and the 1st Tank Division. The British Eighth Army in southern Tunisia attempted to break through the defenses of the German army under the command of General Rommel on the Mareth Line and suffered heavy losses on Tuesday night and Wednesday. The Axis forces counterattacked and repelled the British army. Yesterday's British military activity was limited to patrols, as General Montgomery was clearly reorganizing his troops for another attack.

### French Guiana Affiliates with Kilau

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 20th â€“ According to news from Paramaribo, Dutch Guiana, after French Guiana affiliated with the rebellious Kilau regime, the governor of the area, Weber, has resigned. The acting governor and several judicial officials have succeeded him. Yesterday, they arrived in Dutch Guiana with their families. They are currently temporarily under the jurisdiction of the Dutch Guiana government. Their status will be clarified later.

### Ba Maw Visits Meiji Shrine

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th â€“ Dr. Ba Maw, the chief administrator of Burma, and his entourage departed from the Greater East Asia Guesthouse at 10:00 a.m. On the morning of the 20th, after visiting the Meiji Shrine at 10:20 a.m., they visited the Yasukuni Shrine and silently prayed for the spirits of the fallen soldiers. They returned to the guesthouse at 11:00 a.m.

### Japanese Aircraft Active North of Nitskei

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th â€“ On the afternoon of the 18th, Japanese army air units engaged in a fierce battle with several enemy Hurricane fighters over the Akan area north of Nitskei. Two enemy planes were shot down, and the remaining planes fled. All Japanese planes returned safely.

Central News Agency, Istanbul, 20th â€“ According to a dispatch from New Delhi, British military authorities announced on the 18th that Japanese air units had attacked British positions in the Arakan area on the 18th.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb U.S. Base

Alliance News Agency, Lisbon, 20th â€“ According to a dispatch from Melbourne, General MacArthur's headquarters announced that Japanese aircraft attacked an Allied base 50 miles outside of Buna Port in southeastern New Guinea yesterday, bombing the port facilities and military installations there.

### International Briefs

Havas News Agency, Lisbon, 19th â€“ It is reported that U.S. Vice President Wallace flew to South America on the 17th of this month and has now arrived in San Jose, Costa Rica, in Central America.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th â€“ A short time ago, an enemy submarine that entered the patrol area of a Japanese warship was sunk. This news was first revealed today by an official from a Japanese military base here.

### Roundtable Discussion on US-Japan Air Warfare (Part 2): From Air Raid Routes to Various Defense Methods

How to Cope with Enemy Air Raids? Public Anxiety is More Damaging Than Material Losses.

Reporter: Please talk about some ways to deal with air raids.

Hon'nai: Nowadays, there has been great progress in air defense, unlike before.

Abe: It is much stronger now. Regarding urban air raids, let's not talk about the fires caused by incendiary bombs for the moment. The most frightening result of a general air raid is not the loss of materials, but the shaking of people's hearts. Look at cities like London. Although they have suffered extremely severe bombing, the spirit of the citizens is always strong, calm, and united. Although there are many differences between Japanese cities and London, we have the confidence to win. If we can endure the first air raid, we can easily deal with air raids later. The last air raid was completely unexpected. Although future air raids will be quite large in scale, if we can deal with them calmly at the beginning, they will later become commonplace and easier to deal with.

Matsuura: I agree. Look at ordinary fires. If you are not careful, they will expand until they cannot be contained. How much more tense will it be during an air raid?

Abe: Air raids mostly come during a period of thorough preparation, which is very different from earthquakes.

Matsuura: It's different from earthquakes. Fujita: Because during earthquakes, the tap water will stop.

Matsuura: Although we are laymen without this kind of experience and dare not say for sure, such wooden buildings in Japan will definitely be at a considerable disadvantage. At the same time, precisely because they are wooden buildings, there are no skyscrapers towering dozens of stories high, so the proportion of the population occupying the ground is small. In short, since the proportion of the population occupying the ground is small, it is definitely not like foreign countries, where people are always on top of people, stacked layer upon layer. So, from this point of view, our country's air defense is more advantageous.

Abe: I think so too. Look at foreigners, many families live in one house. In the event of an air raid, the ratio of population loss will definitely be large. From the perspective of dispersed population, Japanese buildings are almost all two-story buildings, with one household per family. This is really in line with the principles of air defense. However, the houses are too vulnerable to bombing.

Matsuura: Houses like ours, even if they are hit by a bomb and destroyed, the value of the house is much smaller than the bomb. This way, we can compete with them to see who loses more. (Roaring laughter)

Fujita: This is really throwing a brick to get jade, a way to use shrimp to catch turtles.

Hon'nai: Last time I saw a fire, fortunately there was no wind, so it was easy to put out. If incendiary bombs are dropped when the wind is strong, once they explode and burn, I am afraid that an uncontrollable prairie fire will appear!

Abe: Once a fire becomes large, there is no way to deal with it. Therefore, within one or two minutes after the outbreak, we must immediately mobilize the neighborhood groups (similar to the baojia organization) to actively put out the sparks. But if we delay, the fire will become raging, and its destructive power will indeed be terrible. Because the burning speed is very fast, if we fail to put out the sparks in time, it will become an infinite disaster.

ÅŒnishi: Is air defense equipment different from region to region?

Abe: Air defense equipment is endless, there is no limit. Therefore, we can never say that preparations have reached a degree of complete perfection. At the same time, a slight lack of preparation often leads to failure and all previous efforts are wasted. In addition, many things that were unintentionally created in the past can be used as substitutes for air defense facilities. This is just like being on a front line without trenches, where you have to use the stones around you for cover. If we pay attention to these substitutes, we can plan effective air defense facilities in the city. However, in the current state of war, we must anticipate how to save materials and metals, and we should also eliminate temporary and stopgap measures and adopt a long-term approach. Our country has been engaged in civil air defense for ten years and is now becoming particularly active, gradually making amazing progress. As I said just now, we can find countless valuable things in the over-prepared air defense facilities. In a word, this is the achievement of the principle of prioritizing key points.

Matsuura: Since Tokyo is the most important place, people who rely on huge sums of money and live off interest should often evacuate from Tokyo, leaving only those who cannot live without Tokyo. This may be beneficial to air defense.

Abe: That's great. If possible, they should always evacuate to the countryside with all their property, otherwise the consequences would be unimaginable.

Matsuura: If the central area or the Marunouchi district is hit by incendiary bombs, service personnel can run from places like Nakano and Kichijoji to rescue.

Abe: Different places often have very different population densities during the day and at night. Therefore, air defense methods must also vary depending on the time of day.

Hon'nai: Although we are talking about fire prevention, evacuating the population is still the best policy, but it is really not easy.

The Possibility of Germ Warfare and Poison Gas Warfare? The Non-Combustible Nature of Japanese Buildings.

Reporter: In addition, is anyone researching non-combustible paint for fire prevention? Abe: Yes, it is being researched. However, even if the material itself is very heat-resistant, if it is used as paint and applied to things, because the paint film is very thin, even if the film itself can withstand fire and heat to some extent, if this heat is transmitted through the film to the flammable material inside, it will immediately become dangerous. At present, sturdy plaster made of cement and sand is still useful. Although there is also fire-resistant wood among wood materials, and there is also paint used as a fire retardant in some areas, it would be a little ridiculous to think that this would prevent fires from occurring.

Hon'nai: There are also many controversial regulations regarding roofs. I forget whether it was Shizuoka or Hamamatsu, but when the wind is strong, fire can get in through the cracks in the tiles. If this is the case, the fire can start burning from inside the roof.

Abe: Now, although some people put a layer of soil under the roof tiles, and some people place non-heat-conducting materials under the roof, the temperature that rises first due to a fire is still inside the roof. Because major fires start from these places, we must pay special attention.

Hon'nai: I've never seen it before, fire seeping into the cracks in the tiles, burning fiercely, and causing a major fire.

Abe: Although it is currently impossible to build all houses with fire-resistant steel and concrete, newly built houses are built with non-combustible materials in accordance with air defense construction regulations. Some houses are replacing the outer walls or the insides of the rooms that are most prone to fire with non-combustible materials, and installing protective boards on windows and entrances. During the last air raid and during ordinary fires, many such buildings were spared. Fire prevention should be the most important task in Japanese cities. We must prepare diligently and strive to achieve the goal of preventing houses from burning. Increasing water dragons, connecting waterways, opening up reservoirs, and so on require many aspects of preparation.

Reporter: I heard that there is a tactic of spreading bacteria. Please give me some guidance.

Abe: Among the bombs dropped are incendiary bombs, explosive bombs, poison gas bombs, germ bombs, and leaflet bombs, etc. But of course, the issue of bacteria also requires considerable and troublesome countermeasures. So-called Bacteria are different from poisons, and it is said that they are relatively easier to deal with. Spreading this kind of thing in places that supply food requires a separate set of specialized preventive measures. This kind of spreading method by the Fifth Column is more harmful than dropping them from the sky, and this must also be taken into account.

ÅŒnishi: It is a bit unclear to non-experts. Ordinary people cannot distinguish between Bacteria and poison gas. This is the reason why a special anti-gas squad is needed. The same goes for poison gas.

Abe: Of course, special training is also required to recognize and distinguish various poisons, and of course, equipment for distinguishing and testing poisons is also needed. The relevant parties are prepared for these kinds of facilities.

Matsuura: If the enemy comes to attack, they will definitely adopt a variety of different methods.

Okada: On the whole, preparations have been made to deal with all the enemy's methods.

ÅŒnishi: I live in Setagaya Ward. Many people believe that this area will not be bombed. Of course, it is possible to bomb, but from a military value point of view, it may not be bombed. If there is no target for the enemy to bomb, the enemy will not deliberately bomb such a place randomly. Of course, it is possible to be mistakenly bombed here, but... it seems that many people have a feeling of groundless worry.

Matsuura: However, if hundreds of planes come, it will take a lot of time to find targets one by one, and they may just bomb randomly and fly away. In short, if the fleet is two hundred planes, of course two hundred planes will suddenly appear together and leave together, and those who cannot find a target will definitely not go back with the bombs.

ÅŒnishi: It will be the same if they come from the stratosphere.

Matsuura: If so, wouldn't your place be in danger?

ÅŒnishi: Of course, some people think that it will be terrible in that case. At the same time, many people have an optimistic idea, believing that it is bad luck, bad fate.

Matsuura: Not being afraid of anything is different from being optimistic.

Hon'nai: It is not appropriate to gamble in Tokyo. It is better to go back to the countryside and work hard to do something. In the countryside, you can work hard to train.

Abe: Whether it is training or facilities, they are too formalistic. It is not good not to consider the local emergency response.

Reporter: It is really not easy to deal with densely populated areas like Shitamachi. We must consider that there are many trees and many open spaces in the suburbs, and we should evacuate to the suburbs.

Abe: We are now maintaining and expanding these green open spaces. I believe that planting fire-resistant trees is also a current task.

Reporter: What is the most effective air defense method?

ÅŒnishi: Knowing in advance that enemy planes are coming to attack, and intercepting them before they reach the city, shooting them all down into the sea and burying them in the bellies of fish, is probably the most effective method.

Abe: In short, since they are coming to attack military targets, it is best to use military force to preemptively defeat the enemy.

ÅŒnishi: If an aircraft carrier comes to attack, it is best to sink the aircraft carrier before the planes leave the ship. If they take off from an airfield to attack, of course, it is also best to destroy this base.

Reporter: Is air combat more effective than anti-aircraft artillery bombardment?

ÅŒnishi: That's right. Anti-aircraft guns are not easy to hit. It may not be appropriate to say so, but in air combat, it is easy to hit the target. Therefore, air defense equipment such as anti-aircraft guns is not very effective. Those who bomb the navy are really unable to deal with them.

Okada: What we are most worried about, as Mr. Abe said just now, is that the purpose of the enemy's air raid is to shake people's hearts. No matter how much air raid we suffer, it is not a failure in the war. Just look at the current situation in London and you will immediately understand. Therefore, we can know that if our spiritual conditions and ideological environment are very sound, then the scale of the air raid, no matter how large or small, will not have any effect. I am afraid that the scale of future air raids will be quite large and there will definitely be some degree of tragic situation. Then, of course, some degree of confusion is inevitable. The Japanese people will definitely be able to endure this pain and get used to it, and then there will be no confusion. Then, the question is whether it will take one day, two days, or a week to get used to it. My friend returned from London and said that there was great confusion at the beginning of the air raids in London. I think this is unavoidable. Is it easy to get through that kind of air raid, or will it take three days or a week of confusion? That is the question. How to prevent confusion is, I think, a question of people's decisiveness or hesitation. If an alarm is issued on Sunday morning when we are about to go out, and we have to go out, I think it is okay to go out, but we should get everything in order, and even if we are not at home, we should ask our neighbors to take care of it, or leave someone to watch the house. When encountering an emergency alarm outside, we should always carry a towel with us. If we can be so calm and decisive, we will not panic. However, we must first know that if we think that the preparatory alarm is not intended to make people nervous, and we deceive ourselves and do not make any preparations, and we are at ease, and then enemy planes fly over the city, then we will be at a loss and panic. The problem is all here. Many people were skeptical about the last alarm, so they inquired everywhere about whether it was real. But since it is a matter of command of the military authorities, they will never issue alarms randomly without any basis. If we know that the purpose of the military authorities is to make the public obey the leadership in an orderly manner, then there is no reason to doubt it. There were really a lot of people asking around. If we always deal with the news in this way, then if there really is an air raid, there will be a great danger. Therefore, the problem is always to give a correct understanding of air raids. If the people really understand, even if there is a large-scale air raid, they will not lose their minds or become confused. The enemy's task is to disrupt thinking and shake the spirit. Then, our orderliness will make the other party's attempt fall into the water. Even if ten or twenty houses are burned down, it is not a big deal. That is what I think. I don't know if it is correct.

Hon'nai: During the last air raid on April 18, even though we were so mentally uneasy, nothing happened, because everyone looked at the sky like fools and were not afraid. Maybe it will be the same in the future!

Okada: So, it won't be on that small scale next time. If it is a large-scale air raid, won't we be even more mentally uneasy? If we don't increase the degree of confusion, then we need to know now that the future air raid will definitely be large-scale. We must have this preparation. That is what I mean. Therefore, I think this is what needs to be discussed at this symposium.

Hon'nai: However, everyone probably believes that Japan will be attacked!

In order to effectively rectify public rice sales in the urban area and prevent malpractices, Zhang Xianzhi, the director of the Municipal Grain Management Bureau, posted a notice in various public rice sales offices in the urban area yesterday, which stated, "Since this bureau has been handling public rice sales, there have been reports from citizens accusing rice shops of fraudulent activities. However, when this bureau sends people to investigate, it is often difficult to find evidence of fraud because of the passage of time. In order to protect the interests of citizens, if citizens discover rice shops engaging in fraudulent activities in the future, they will be allowed to bring their documents to the bureau to report at that time. If the investigation by this bureau confirms the facts, they will be severely punished as a warning to others," and so on.

### Increase in Shipping Frequency Between Shanghai and South China

### Welcome the Toho Dance Troupe to Visit China

Japan's most famous Toho Dance Troupe, in order to celebrate the return of the National Government, came to China for a visit. All the members of the group are excellent and highly accomplished individuals. Upon passing through this city, they briefly performed at yesterday's reception. In addition to observing the arts, we deeply feel that there is a deeper meaning in this. At present, under the common goal of striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan need to cooperate in political and economic aspects, and also need to communicate the feelings between the people of both countries. The art form is best suited to move people's emotions and has the most effective results. We have repeatedly pointed out that the true friendship between China and Japan can only be firmly established on the basis of the harmony of people's emotions. Therefore, the visit and performance of the Toho Dance Troupe will surely be able to accomplish this mission. Soon, the Japanese cultural envoys will also come to China. Their purpose and mission should also be here. It is seen that the feelings between the people of both countries will become more harmonious, and the degree of love will become more intimate.

### The Proceeds from the Charity Sale at the Gongchunlou Antique Exhibition will be Donated to this Newspaper's Scholarship Fund

Lawyer Shi Zhenchang, the owner of Gongchunlou, gathered more than a dozen collectors and exhibited antiques at the Zhuangyan Temple on Pope Road. Among them are hundreds of valuable antiques such as the Iron Ling of Sun Deng of the Jin Dynasty and the large red glaze bottle of the Kangxi Dynasty. The stone fossils were most precious. The association also opened a charity sale department, and the proceeds from the sale will be entirely donated to this newspaper's scholarship fund. The exhibition period is from the 16th to the 22nd of this month.

### Investigate the Cost of Papermaking

In order to understand the prices of products produced by Chinese paper mills in this port, the Price Investigation Section of the Public Works Bureau specifically convened a meeting of members of the Paper Industry Association yesterday and instructed them to report in detail the cost of papermaking and products so that the General Assembly could formulate and submit them to the authorities. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, all 17 Chinese paper mills in the city formally established a joint business office the day before yesterday and passed the draft articles of association, the main ones being: (1) Unifying production and sales matters; (2) Standardizing product prices to avoid speculation and manipulation; (3) Adjusting the supply and demand of the market. According to the person in charge of the industry association, Chinese paper mills have used waste paper as the only raw material since the allocation of paper pulp was stopped. They have now requested Japanese Ataka & Co. to allocate it. The manager of Ataka & Co. has already left for Japan to handle the matter and is expected to obtain a response soon.

### Counterfeit Stamps Still Not Eliminated: Easy to Identify with Slight Attention

The counterfeit stamps of one yuan and two jiao have not yet disappeared. However, with slight attention, they are easy to identify. The tower-side roads in the true stamp pattern are made into an arc, while the roads in the counterfeit stamp are straighter. In addition, the real stamp has burrs on the edges of the punched holes, while the holes in the counterfeit stamp are smoother. In the future, all merchants should pay attention to this at all times. If anyone is found selling counterfeit stamps, they should be immediately sent to the police station for strict handling in accordance with the law.

Critical Essay

### Leaders in the Economic World

From the perspective of the people, more advanced socio-economic conditions depend on the support and promotion of leaders in the economic world. Leaders in the economic world are not only leaders in economic endeavors but also leaders in economic thought. Their authority over the people is no less than that of political leaders.

Since leaders in the economic world are also leaders in economic thought, they must have a thorough understanding of the people's lives and their intentions. In other words, the strategies and methods they devise must be based on and adapted to the people's living environment and the demands of their intentions. One particularly important condition that leaders in the economic world must possess is rationalized thinking. All measures and actions, as long as they are permitted by the current local environment, do not harm the government, and benefit the people, can be suggested and contributed as much as possible, without worrying that the government will not accept them or that the people will not welcome them.

What we hope from leaders in the economic world is not only their participation in a certain department designated by the government but also their use of rationalized thinking to seek fundamental solutions to current social and economic problems. The so-called fundamental solution must concentrate thought and effort on (1) assisting the government in regulating finances to make them stronger, and (2) assisting the government in increasing production to make it orderly. Because with the fundamental solutions to the above two points, a fundamental solution to the entire people's livelihood problem will naturally be obtained.

Shanghai is known as a place where leaders in the economic world from all over the country are concentrated. It has now entered the initial stage of economic reform experimentation. It is believed that in the near future, the achievements of Shanghai's economic leaders will shine brightly in the economic world of the entire country and create a new record.

### Economic Advisor Ishiwatari Discusses National Government's Financial and Currency Policies

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Ishiwatari, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, traveled to Shanghai on the 18th with Mr. Tsushima, President of the North China Development Company. On the afternoon of the 19th, at 3:00 PM, he met with a group of reporters at the Cathay Hotel to discuss the National Government's financial and currency policies and commodity controls under the new circumstances. Among the points he made, the following are particularly important: the exchange rate between the reserve certificate and the Japanese yen will soon be implemented at a rate of 18 yen, the relationship between the reserve certificate and the joint bank notes will also be determined soon, and the rice purchasing agency will not be included under the subordinate organizations of the National Commercial Control Association for the time being, but will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Food Department. Details are as follows:

Financial and Currency Issues

The issuance of reserve certificates increased significantly last autumn, but since this year, the withdrawal has been progressing smoothly. The amount issued in February and March has decreased somewhat, which is because the reserve certificates issued to the interior as purchasing funds are now gradually flowing back. In order to promote the integration of military notes and reserve certificates, the amount of reserve certificates issued will be increased again according to needs in the future. However, this is not for inflation. At the same time as the military notes and reserve certificates are integrated, the exchange rate between the reserve certificates and the Japanese yen will be implemented at a rate of 18 yen. As for the relationship between the reserve certificates and the joint bank notes, the government and various parties are currently studying it, and a concrete decision should be made soon. Recently, many small banks have been established in Shanghai without the approval of the National Government, which is sufficient to disrupt the National Government's financial control. Therefore, it is planned to take decisive measures.

Commodity Control Issues

The commodity movement control has been eased this time, and the control affairs have also been decided to be entrusted to the National Commercial Control Association, a private autonomous organization. Since the announcement of the commodity movement restrictions, prices have generally fallen, which is gratifying. However, the National Commercial Control Association has just been established, and its organization is not yet complete. Therefore, it is planned to expedite its completion, complete its subordinate organizations, and establish commodity control organizations. However, rice purchases will not be placed under the jurisdiction of the Control Association for the time being, but will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Food Department of the National Government. In the future, after the organization of the Control Association is complete, it will be placed under the Control Association again.

Financial Issues

The abolition of extraterritoriality will be implemented in the near future, and the issue of recovering taxation rights is also included. However, the National Government's budget for this year has not considered the increased tax revenue resulting from the abolition of extraterritoriality. There is also a plan to issue food treasury bonds (tentatively named) to raise funds for rice purchases, which is also being planned. As for the issuance of lottery tickets, it is also being considered and may be realized soon.

### Japanese Policy Companies in China Change Basic Policies

Central News Agency, Shanghai: According to Domei News Agency, Mr. Sonoda, a director of the Tokyo branch of the Central China Development Company, revealed to reporters yesterday at the Broadway Mansion that the basic policies of Japanese policy companies in China will undergo major changes. He said that the capital, materials, and natural resources of these policy companies will henceforth be gradually supplied from the Central China area. This new policy for the 1943 fiscal year is the opposite of the past policy, as in the past, the capital and materials of these companies have all relied on Japan. Mr. Sonoda recently arrived in Shanghai to confer with officials of the Central China Development Company headquarters and financial leaders here regarding the future trends of Japanese policy companies in China. He said that the activities of these companies next year will focus on the production of military supplies and the development of wartime industries. Although the business policies of these companies have undergone various reforms since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the activities of these companies in the middle of last year still progressed smoothly. The development process in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas has also progressed smoothly, and the important natural resources of Central China are now being developed smoothly according to plan. The budgets of the companies are compiled with the main purpose of developing important natural resources and cultivating Japan's war power, and have been approved by the Cabinet Planning Board after careful review by the relevant authorities.

### Since the Establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, the City's Commerce Has Been Moving Towards the Right Track. The Board of Directors and Supervisors Continued to Hold Meetings Yesterday. News is Centralized for Handling by the Secretary-General.

Since its establishment, the National Commercial Control Association has been working very hard on its affairs. Yesterday, it continued to hold a joint meeting of the Board of Directors and Supervisors, and in addition to resolving various important cases, it also stipulated that future news releases will be handled centrally by the Secretary-General. All manuscripts must be reviewed and stamped by the Secretary-General and a copy retained before being issued, in order to ensure accuracy and prudence.

Since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, the city's commercial activities will shift from abnormal hoarding to normal trade. Currently, goods returning from Shanghai to the interior, except for the eleven items that require a permit from the Commercial Control Association, such as automotive parts, petroleum, various machinery, communication equipment materials, metal products, medicines, rubber, cotton yarn, candles, matches, and soap, and incoming items such as rice, wheat, and beans, are allowed to be moved out and transported in freely. Therefore, Shanghai's commerce can move towards the right track in the future. In recent days, some merchants have already shipped goods such as cigarettes to the interior for sale, and some non-controlled goods from the interior have also been transported to Shanghai. Therefore, the prices of goods in the interior and Shanghai will gradually stabilize.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council's Material Registration Files Will Soon Be Handed Over to the Commercial Control Association for Handling.

Central News Agency, Shanghai: The National Commercial Control Association was officially established on the 15th of this month. However, because the Shanghai Municipal Council has not yet handed over the relevant files for material registration, it is not possible to handle the issuance of material movement permits. At the first meeting of the Board of Directors and Supervisors, it was resolved that: (1) all files of inventory registration from all industries held by the Shanghai Municipal Council should be handed over to the Association for receipt; (2) all industries should complete inventory registration before the 23rd; (3) before the establishment of the general membership meeting, all industries should automatically suspend movement; (4) before the establishment of the general membership meeting, the above measures should be communicated to all industries by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for Chinese merchants and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry for Japanese merchants, respectively. The Association will notify the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the above measures, and notify all relevant trade associations for joint information. As for the files for issuing material movement permits by the Shanghai Municipal Council, they will soon be transferred to the Commercial Control Association for receipt and handling. It is reported that various trade associations, such as the rubber industry, have complied with the order and notified their members to collect registration forms from their respective associations and register before the deadline, and to automatically suspend movement before completing registration, in order to protect their own rights and interests. Otherwise, if they remain wait-and-see, delay registration, or move without authorization and encounter obstacles, or even prohibition, the trade associations will not be responsible. As for the names of registered products, the associations will notify them separately.

Editorial

### Realization of Autonomous Economic Control

After the transfer of material movement control in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to the National Government, the National Government, in order to adapt to the times, handed it over to private autonomous control. The National Commercial Control Association is a private organization dedicated to this task. We should have a deep understanding of the great significance of the complete transfer of economic control to the Chinese side. At the same time, we cannot help but admire the National Government's wise measures in being able to make the determination to entrust it to economic organizations for autonomous control. The new control mechanism will surely facilitate the flow of materials, restore Shanghai's productivity, and at the same time achieve economic self-sufficiency in the interior. Its great contribution to establishing China's wartime economy need not be elaborated.

The economic control exercised by the National Commercial Control Association is autonomous control. We must first pay attention to this point. The lower-level organization of the Control Association should be prepared immediately. We have not seen its actual affairs, but we are confident that it is an agency representing the general will of the business community. The business community will surely appreciate the government's hard work and handle economic control affairs, which will be stronger and more effective than any control by force. The future is bright and predictable. Moreover, there is no lack of precedents for autonomous control by commercial organizations in China, so there is no need to worry unnecessarily. The Control Association is not a new attempt for the first time. The Chinese economic community has often done this kind of work during important periods in the past, which is noteworthy.

However, the Control Association has another epoch-making significance in its content, that is, Japanese merchants participate in the association's internal affairs and assist in economic activities on completely equal terms. Private cooperation is most important, which we often advocate. And the true private cooperation is only possible with friendly cooperation on equal terms, and the Control Association can do this, which is gratifying. Another point worth mentioning is that Japanese merchants are able to actively cooperate and adapt to the new situation on equal terms. It is fortunate for the new system in the future.

However, the current problems of the Control Association are very serious. In order to open up a new life for the economy of Central China and cultivate war power, we must make the greatest efforts. If the direction of application is wrong, it will be tantamount to suicide for the new China. Fortunately, the Association has many capable talents such as Tang Shoumin and Wu Zhenxi, and also has the assistance of financial giants. Autonomous control can definitely be smoothly promoted without error. Finally, it should be noted that during the process of the Association's preparation, there will inevitably be some changes in the financial world. Perhaps with the smooth flow of circulation, the price of a certain kind of commodity will rise once. If people are surprised and doubt this transition phase because of the current phenomenon, this can be said to be a misunderstanding of not distinguishing reality and not understanding the principle of control. We should have a heart to support the Control Association and should not make hasty judgments. We must clearly recognize it and allow it to grow. Only it is the root of maintaining China and Japan. (Yun Peng: Translated from the Continental New News, March 17)

I believe that in order for the Chinese and Japanese people to seek thorough and sincere cooperation and defeat the aggressive forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, they must have a world view of East Asian familism and clear away the individualistic view of selfishness. My purpose is to promote the world view, eliminate the individualistic view, seek a fusion of the thoughts of the people of the two countries, and realize coexistence and co-prosperity."
