### Expectations for the Cotton Control Association

The position of Director-General of the Cotton Control Association has been officially announced by the National Government, with Mr. Wen Lanting appointed. Furthermore, the Chinese and Japanese committee members have also been internally decided. It is anticipated that the association will be established and begin purchasing and allocating cotton in the near future. The cotton harvest has been underway for some time, but as it is a controlled commodity, trading has been completely halted until the control organization is formed and purchase prices are determined. Farmers are holding cotton but unable to exchange it for cash to cover expenses, so their economic hardship is self-evident. Similarly, manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials and are depleting their capital, so their situation is just as dire as that of the farmers. Therefore, both farmers and manufacturers urgently await the early establishment of the control organization and the rapid implementation of purchasing and allocation.

There are three aspects to controlling commodities: controlling production, controlling purchasing, and controlling distribution. The latter two are symptomatic, passive measures. Only the first—controlling production—is a fundamental, active measure. Since the establishment of the National General Chamber of Commerce, only symptomatic measures have been taken, which is due to legal regulations. However, if fundamental measures are not advanced simultaneously, purchasing and allocation will inevitably reach a point of exhaustion. Therefore, we hope that the soon-to-be-established Cotton Control Association will, before its scope of work is determined, suggest to the government that controlling production be included within its scope, so that production, purchasing, and allocation can be seamlessly integrated. Relatedly, we believe that the Grain Control Association's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee should also be given this mission.

Since the opening of trade, the volume of imported cotton products has increased year after year. In the past decade, there has also been a large influx of raw cotton, which demonstrates the inadequacy of our nation's cotton production. The most important mission of the Cotton Control Association should be to actively research improved cotton varieties, expand the area of cotton fields, and find ways to guide farmers to adopt scientific planting and fertilization methods, increasing cotton yields to gradually close this gap. The textile industry should also be actively encouraged to adopt scientific management and improve technology, so that costs can be reduced and product quality improved. Only then can we compete with foreign goods and completely change the national mindset of valuing imported products.

The current work of the Cotton Control Association undoubtedly lies in purchasing and allocation. Regarding this aspect, we would also like to contribute some suggestions:

Purchase prices must take into account farmers' production costs, plus a reasonable profit; otherwise, it will affect the enthusiasm for selling this year's crop, and even more so next year's production.

The purchasing process must not utilize political power. For example, the rumored method of the Grain Control Association to use the Baojia system for promotion must be avoided at all costs.

Purchasing organizations should be established and completed in advance, and the funds for purchase prices should be planned and sufficient. Once the price is announced, purchasing must begin immediately to avoid farmers becoming impatient and being exploited by intermediaries.

Strictly supervise all purchasing agencies to ensure that quality is not arbitrarily lowered and quantities are not arbitrarily deducted. In particular, the receiving procedures should be simple and quick, and absolutely no delays should be allowed, to avoid increasing losses for farmers and giving operators opportunities for manipulation.

The above are the points to be noted regarding purchasing. Regarding allocation, it is said that this purchasing work will be carried out by textile trade organizations separately, and then the Cotton Control Association will approve their retention of a portion, with the remainder being allocated in a unified manner. If this is the case, in order to maintain their operating rates, it is feared that factories will inevitably underreport their acquisitions. To prevent this phenomenon from occurring, the Cotton Control Association must exercise particularly strict supervision during purchasing. The production volume of each factory must also be investigated at any time. The Cotton Control Association is the last of the subordinate organizations of the National General Chamber of Commerce to be established and has many good and bad experiences to draw upon. We hope that the Cotton Control Association can learn from the strengths and avoid the weaknesses to improve its organization and complete this important mission.

### At an Osaka Roundtable Discussion, Japanese Foreign Minister Delivers a Speech Elucidating the Reasons for the Inevitable Victory in the Greater East Asia War

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency): According to Osaka telephone reports, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, at 3:00 PM on the 15th at the New Osaka Hotel, attended a roundtable discussion hosted by the Osaka Prefecture Chamber of Commerce and Industry and delivered a speech to approximately one hundred representatives of the Kansai economic community, elucidating the reasons for the inevitable victory in the Greater East Asia War as follows: The Greater East Asia War is a war of Asians defending their homeland. After the Greater East Asia Conference, the belief that "without Asia, there is no Japan, and without Japan, there is no Asia" has now spread throughout Asia. The Greater East Asia Declaration is fundamentally different in nature from the enemy's various declarations. The Greater East Asia War is a war that advocates world justice. The audience was deeply moved. The main points of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's speech were as follows:

·Reviving East Asia·

Much of Asia's fertile land is controlled by Britain and the United States. The diligent people of Asia have suffered under the tyrannical rule of Britain and the United States in the past. However, with the progress of the Greater East Asia War, the Asian people have all awakened and are willing to revive East Asia with fervent determination. They have now risen up to liberate East Asia, defend East Asia, and unite the strength of Asia to destroy the enemy. Asia has now returned to being East Asia, no longer a colony of Britain and the United States. However, Britain and the United States remain obstinate, attempting to reconquer Asia and permanently turn Asia into their colony for exploitation and plunder. In order to return Asia to the Asians, Japan has dispatched expeditionary forces to distant lands. Asia is the homeland of all Asians, and all Asians should defend their homeland to the death. If Asia loses this war, we will lose our homeland. Therefore, this war should be called the Asian War of Independence. We still remember that the United States struggled for more than seven years to gain independence and break free from its shackles, winning glorious independence. Therefore, the United States' invasion of Asia is actually denying its own historical life. Ultimate victory is always inseparable from justice. If we examine history and trace the causes of prosperity, it is an unchanging iron rule. Ultimate victory is ours, and the reason for this lies in this principle.

·Building a Foundation·

Speaking of the foundation for building Asia, it is to stabilize Asia. Therefore, we should first defend East Asia and establish the stability of East Asia. Second, the construction work should be carried out based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has been announced to the world, and the five major guidelines for East Asia's construction can be called the Greater East Asia Charter. Therefore, all the people of East Asia support it. Representatives from various East Asian countries attended the Greater East Asia Conference with great sincerity. Therefore, the joint declaration was passed unanimously at the conference. The Greater East Asia Conference was a grand occasion rarely seen in history. Representatives from various countries fully expressed their sincerity. All speeches came from the bottom of their hearts. The Greater East Asia Conference can be said to be the voice of Asia. Asia is united in heart and mind. Without Japan, there is no Asia, and without Asia, there is no Japan. This has become a strong belief throughout Asia. The reason why we will surely achieve victory lies in this. The fifth item in the Greater East Asia Construction Guidelines states that we should increase friendship with all nations, eliminate racial discrimination, communicate culture, and further open up resources in order to contribute to the development of the world. This has shown our aspirations to the world and demonstrated our plans for world peace.

·Opening Resources·

What we expect is to open up the world's human and material resources, promote communication in culture and religion, and realize the ideal of harmony among all nations. The great way has no gate, so there is no way to open it. As the saying goes, "If there is no East Asia, how can there be South Seas?" This is the idea of openness that we adhere to. The enemy has repeatedly made propaganda-like opinions on post-war management. Most of them are just tricks, and this can be seen from the contradiction of their past words and deeds. What the representatives who participated in the Greater East Asia Conference welcomed the most was that the fifth item in the declaration had already been explained. From this point of view, we know that the vision of East Asia's leaders is not limited to East Asia, but extends to the entire world. Today, our enthusiasm for completing the common war has become increasingly high, and the reason for the ultimate victory lies in this. The reason why the representatives of various countries had common feelings and resonance was that the joint declaration was based on the ideals of justice. The representatives of various countries were able to touch the true face of Japan and understand Japan.

·Completing the Mission·

During the conference, representatives from various countries confided their inner thoughts to me. To make justice shine, this is the essence of our national structure. To revive East Asia and create a smooth path for East Asia, if we can carry on with indomitable faith and work together with the comrades of East Asia, advancing bravely, then even if the enemy Britain and the United States are strong, they will surely succumb to the truth, and the final victory will belong to us. The ten billion people of East Asia, who share joys and sorrows and whose destinies are closely related, are now standing on their own positions, bravely struggling to fulfill the belief of living and dying together, and to shoulder the noble task of East Asia's construction with blood and sweat to complete this mission of peace. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is built with the fresh blood of the ten billion people of Greater East Asia. At the time of this conference, the Japanese army achieved new and great victories in the South Pacific, and therefore the spirit of the ten billion people of East Asia was even more激昂. It is believed that the construction of Greater East Asia will surely progress with the great victories of the Japanese army.

### Andaman Islands Select Strong Young Men to Organize Volunteer Army; Inauguration Ceremony to Be Held on the 25th

Andaman, 15th (Central News Agency): Japanese Prime Minister Tojo previously stated at the Greater East Asia Conference that the Andaman and Nicobar Islands would be transferred to the Provisional Government of Free India. The residents of Andaman are extremely grateful for this. The 18,000 Indians, who make up the majority of the local residents, are particularly grateful. The initial reaction was that these Indians donated to the national defense fund on the 12th. Furthermore, the Andaman branch of the Indian Independence League held a meeting at the Civil Administration Department on the 11th and decided to organize a volunteer army under the branch director. Committees have been selected to be responsible for selecting strong young men between the ages of 20 and 40 from various villages on the island. The inauguration ceremony is scheduled to be held on the 25th.

### Japanese Information Officer Inoue Meets with Foreign Correspondents, Vigorously Denouncing False Propaganda by the U.S. Authorities

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency): Japanese Information Bureau Information Officer Sadao Inoue met with a group of foreign correspondents on the 15th and vehemently denounced the false propaganda by the U.S. authorities, stating: After the U.S. authorities suffered a disastrous defeat in the waters off Bougainville Island, they continued to engage in false propaganda in an attempt to deceive the world. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox even claimed on the 12th and 13th that "Japan's statements are all fabricated propaganda" and even stated that no American ships in the Pacific had sunk since October 6th. Such words are all acts of self-deception and only arouse deeper suspicion and distrust of American pronouncements among the domestic public and the people of the world. In particular, the fact that the U.S. government still maintains a calm attitude despite suffering millions of casualties and losses on the seas off the islands of Bougainville in the South Pacific can be described as completely devoid of conscience. The biggest reason why the enemy resorts to this kind of deceptive propaganda is that the U.S. government is deeply afraid of the public's morale weakening. Moreover, the American people are now increasingly doubtful about the purpose of sending their children to the front lines of the South Pacific, so they are creating a war atmosphere. Second, the U.S. government is alarmed by Japan's active promotion of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, even during the war. In particular, since the announcement of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the Greater East Asian nations have reached a consensus on the goals of the war, and the unity of the Greater East Asian nations has become an unbreakable fact, which makes the United States deeply anxious. Therefore, the U.S. government is increasingly secretive about its failures in order to avoid arousing anti-war sentiment among the people.

### Japanese Naval Aircraft Night Raid Torokina Point; Enemy Positions on Mono Island Also Bombed

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency): A report from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific states that Japanese naval aircraft bombed enemy positions at Torokina Point on Bougainville Island on the night of the 11th, and then bombed enemy positions on Mono Island at dawn on the 13th, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. There were no Japanese losses.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency): A report from a certain base in the South Pacific states that Japanese naval air units attacked an enemy transport convoy off Torokina Point on Bougainville Island on the night of the 10th, sinking one ship. In a second attack, one enemy transport ship and one destroyer were hit and burned, and then sank. The enemy's total losses were two transport ships and one destroyer.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency): A report from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific states that Japanese naval aircraft attacked enemy positions on the Puruata Island, an enemy landing point at the mouth of the Torokina River on Bougainville Island, late at night on the 10th. Five enemy warehouses were destroyed by the bombing, and a large fire broke out in one place. Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency): Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission of the National Government, visited Japanese Prime Minister Tojo at 10:00 AM on the 15th and had a friendly conversation for an hour before departing.

### U.S. Aircraft from Chongqing Raid Haiphong

### Chairman Wang Personally Gives Instructions at Yesterday's Health Administration Meeting; First Meeting Designates Review Committee Members for Each Group

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency): The first National Health Administration Conference, convened by the Department of Health, grandly opened at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association yesterday (the 15th) morning at 10:00 AM. Representatives from various regions gathered at the Central Hotel at 7:30 AM, led by the Conference Chairman Lu Runzhi. At 8:30 AM, they arrived at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to respectfully pay their respects to the Father of the Nation and presented wreaths on behalf of the entire delegation. The ceremony was simple and solemn. Returning to the venue at 9:30 AM, at precisely 10:00 AM, Chairman Wang, dressed in a new national uniform and radiating energy, personally attended the conference. All personnel stood respectfully at the entrance to welcome him. The Chairman entered the venue to the strains of military music, and the opening ceremony commenced. Present were officials from various agencies, including Chen Bijun, member of the Central Committee; Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Zhou Longxiang, Secretary-General; Li Yi, Director-General; Xi Zewen, Vice Minister, and dozens of guests. First, the Conference Chairman Lu Runzhi delivered the opening remarks, followed by a respectful invitation to Chairman Wang to give instructions, elucidating the relationship between hygiene and the nation and people.

(Another report) The Health Conference has opened yesterday (the 15th), and the group review meeting will continue at 9:00 AM today (the 16th) at Nanjing.

Main Points of Chairman Wang's Instructions

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency): At the first National Health Administration Conference on November 15th, Chairman Wang personally gave instructions, encouraging medical professionals nationwide to focus on health administration and relieve the suffering of the majority of the people. While it is understood that engaging in health administration is less profitable than private practice, the allies currently have medical experts enlisting in the military, prioritizing the needs of the nation over personal gain. Our country has few medical professionals, and most are concentrated in cities, so the majority of the people cannot benefit from modern medicine, and their diseases and suffering cannot be alleviated. Modern medicine has become the exclusive domain of the wealthy. This is deeply distressing. The purpose of health administration is to concentrate medical professionals, establish a rational organization based on patriotism, and alleviate the diseases and suffering of the majority of the people. In short, the great problem facing the country is not only the lack of medical professionals, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical materials, but especially the failure to rationalize the organization of health administration, with more doctors engaged in private practice and fewer serving general health. His words were extremely solemn.

Chairman's Opening Remarks

He stated briefly, "Today is the first National Health Administration Conference. We are honored to have the Chairman of the National Government personally give instructions, the ministers of various Yuan and Departments provide guidance, and medical experts and administrative leaders from various regions travel from afar. It can be said to be an unprecedented grand event in the health administration field since the return to the capital. Our department was established under the wartime system, especially during the promotion of the New National Movement. We look up to the central government's commitment to health administration, which is about to enter the stage of practice and has become an important task in the national mobilization. We who serve in this difficult time of creation must take on the responsibility of construction. The first task is to improve administrative institutions, and the second is to secure special health funds. These two tasks are the prerequisites for our duties. Therefore, we must gather all the talents together to discuss and find more accurate answers. From these two issues, we can extend to all other issues, naturally discern and reveal, and express our opinions. In recent days, I have browsed proposals from various parties and feel that the colleagues at this conference have already reached a consensus on the goals of health administration. After this sincere discussion, we will surely have fruitful results. We will talk today and act tomorrow. With great excitement, let us move forward on the path of health construction."

### Japanese Forces Launch Sweeping Campaign on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Line; Chongqing Forces Surrounded and Heavily Damaged

Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency): Japanese forces launched a sweeping campaign along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line. On the first day of action, they occupied Zhangmutou, a stronghold of the Chongqing Sixth Advance Column. On the night of the 11th, they encircled the remnants of the Chongqing forces south of Laifangdao Lake on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, forming an encirclement. On the 13th, they launched a concerted attack, and the Chongqing forces are currently trapped within the Japanese encirclement. Furthermore, the Japanese air force, in coordination with ground forces, heavily bombed Hettang Pai and Dashi Ling, key points of the Chongqing forces in that area, on the 13th, inflicting heavy damage.

Hong Kong, 15th (Central News Agency): Japanese forces in South China and the Hong Kong Defense Forces are currently launching a new sweeping campaign in the area along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. This operation has particularly profound economic implications, as the only links between Hong Kong and Guangzhou are air and sea transport. Once the area along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is cleared, land transport will be possible. If this is realized, Guangzhou's economy will be further improved. The flow of goods, such as rice, hemp, and sugar, between Hong Kong and Guangzhou will be smoother, and Hong Kong's food problem can also be solved easily.

### Japanese Forces Attack Chongqing Forces in the Feng River Area

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency): According to a report from Chongqing, a spokesman for the Chongqing Military Council explained the battle situation on the 13th as follows: The fighting near the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces is currently taking place in a large rectangular area 50 kilometers wide east-west and 100 kilometers long north-south. The western side of this rectangle is Yidu on the bank of the Yangtze River. To the south are the areas of Nie Jiahe and Yuyangguan, and further south, the area of Shimen along the Feng River. The Japanese forces that have reached this line are engaged in fierce fighting with the Chongqing forces holding the western points of the mountainous area of northern Hunan. The southern side of the rectangular battle line is the Li River. The Japanese forces are attempting to cross the Feng River from the direction of Shimen Jinshi and attack southward.

Hankou, 15th (Central News Agency): After the Japanese army defeated the Chongqing 79th Army's 194th Division west of Chixi River, it detected that the remaining strength of the division, about one regiment, was fleeing near Wangjiafan (20 kilometers west of Chayuansi). Therefore, the Japanese army launched an attack on it at 1:00 PM on the 11th. By midnight, they broke into Wangjiafan. At dawn on the 12th, they finally occupied the hilltop held by the Chongqing army, completing the sweeping campaign.

### Delegates' Remarks at Press Conference

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Greater East Asia Press Conference is about to be held here. Delegates from various countries within the Co-Prosperity Sphere have arrived one after another. Reporters recently interviewed the delegates separately to ask about their aspirations for the conference and their impressions of visiting Japan. The delegates provided statements, which are recorded as follows:

Xu Liqiu, Head of the Delegation from our Country, stated: I am deeply excited to have been sent by the National Government to attend the Greater East Asia Press Conference. After arriving in Tokyo, I witnessed the progress of construction by our allies and the solemnity of wartime life. The peaceful cooperation between China and Japan, and even the peaceful cooperation in East Asia, not only strengthens diplomatic relations between governments but also enhances affection and sincerity among the people. This is what we firmly believe. The press bears the responsibility of public opinion and is the mouthpiece of the people. Therefore, the close cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese press is a crucial pivot for the affection and sincerity between the two peoples. For this reason, the Propaganda Department of the National Government convened the first East Asia Press Conference in August of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). Last year, the State of Manchuria held the East Asia Journalists Conference. This year, our ally Japan is holding the Greater East Asia Press Conference. In addition to the press from China, Japan, and Manchuria, representatives from the newly emerging East Asian countries that have been liberated by the Greater East Asia War are also participating. The significance of this is self-evident. This Greater East Asia Press Conference is taking place after the signing of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration. It has an even greater practical responsibility for completing the war and building East Asia. To put it felicitously, this conference can be described as a combat meeting on the fourth front in the Greater East Asia War. The delegation from the Republic of China is very willing to dedicate its determination to contribute to the war and its enthusiasm for building East Asia, to the best of its ability, to fulfill its responsibility as a member of the East Asian press. During this trip, we received great help from the Japanese authorities in our country. Passing through Manchuria and Korea, we received great convenience from the local authorities. After arriving in Tokyo, we were also treated with great care. We are sincerely grateful and would like to take this opportunity to express our deepest gratitude.

Chen Bingshu (President of Shen Bao), a delegate from our country, said: This is my third time coming to Japan. What I have seen along the way is that there are no idle people in Japan now, and nothing is wasted. Both human and material resources have been mobilized. This has not yet been achieved in China, which is truly regrettable. This is also what we should learn from Japan.

Sema Nir (Full Pen of the Thai Mai Daily), a delegate from Thailand: After I return to my country, I will introduce what I have seen in Japan to my countrymen and talk about the recent situation in Thailand. The Thai people especially want our motherland to be an independent country forever.

Bao Qister (Editor-in-Chief of the Philippine Forum), a delegate from the Philippines, said: Since Manila was captured by the Japanese army, the newspapers and magazines in the Philippines have gradually developed. Now, the Manila Press has published seven daily newspapers, five weekly magazines, and two monthly magazines. In the future, these newspapers and magazines will inevitably unite with each other to do their best to develop the discourse of Greater East Asia together with the Japanese press organizations. The national language of the Philippines is now stipulated as Tagalog! Our policy is to make the residents understand the reality of Greater East Asia construction as much as possible so that they can unite the national will under the banner of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. I hope that this conference will exchange views on common issues.

U Dongtang (Editor-in-Chief of the Kyet Thaye Daily), a delegate from Burma, said: This is my first visit to Japan, and what I am most surprised by is that the Japanese people and the Japanese living in Burma have no sense of racial discrimination. After I learned that the Greater East Asia Press Conference would be held, I was extremely happy. After I arrived here and came into contact with the Japanese people, my conviction that the construction of Greater East Asia will be completed has become even stronger. Burma is now at the forefront of the Greater East Asia War, so there are some difficulties at present. However, people from all walks of life in Burma are well aware that this war is not someone else's war but their own war. If you ask me how the Burmese people feel about the war, I can answer that you can rest assured on this point. The Burmese people's morale for the war is by no means lower than that of other Greater East Asian nations. Indeed, we Burmese have spent two years in the war, but we can endure any suffering to achieve victory.

### Arab Nations Protest Lebanese Incident; Demand Exclusion of (French) Influence

Buenos Aires, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from Cairo: Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas told a group of reporters on the afternoon of the 13th that the Egyptian government would not tolerate the oppression of its compatriots in Lebanon. The Egyptian government will not cease negotiations until the Lebanese President, Prime Minister, and other cabinet members are released. The Egyptian government, in the name of the citizens of all Arab countries, demands that the legitimate Lebanese government resume governing the country.

Ankara, 15th (Central News Agency) - Anatolian News Agency reports: The Iraqi parliament held a special session yesterday and unanimously passed a resolution protesting the attitude of the French Committee towards Lebanon and its leaders. The resolution was sent to the parliaments of the United States and the United Kingdom, demanding the removal of French influence in Lebanon until the end of the war, with the dispute to be resolved by a peace conference. Prime Minister Sayid informed the parliamentarians of the regrettable events in Lebanon during the session and explained the Iraqi government's response. He declared: The Regent of Iraq has expressed Iraq's dissatisfaction to the British Ambassador and the American Counselor in Iraq and has sent a letter through the Iraqi Counselor in Beirut to the families of the Lebanese President and his cabinet members, stating that Iraq will make its greatest efforts for Lebanon and is willing to provide personal assistance at any time.

Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to the Reuter News Agency: London Chronicle's correspondent in Ankara, Mr. Zordan, believes that Turkey will not enter the war within a few months and that England is of greater value to Turkey. The standard for determining the benefits granted to Turkey by the anti-Axis powers after the war depends on the timing of Turkey's entry into the war. In other words, the extent of Turkey's benefits will depend on how early or late it joins the war. It is heard that the Turkish Foreign Minister said that what Turkey wants cannot be provided by the anti-Axis powers, which indicates that Turkey does not plan to enter the war in the short term.

Syrian Prime Minister Yali gave a speech, declaring solidarity with Lebanon. Reports indicate that the unrest in Syria has the potential to escalate.

### Prelude to the Battle of Bougainville: America Attempts to Recapture Air Bases

We have seen the Imperial Japanese Headquarters announce the great results of the four air battles over Bougainville in the newspapers for several days. This article clearly tells us how the Battle of Bougainville came about. The United States used a large amount of air power, and also used aircraft carriers to launch attacks, attempting to recapture the air bases in the Solomon Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the New Guinea Archipelago, as bases for spying on the Dutch East Indies and cutting off the connection between Japan and the resource areas in the South Seas. The Battle of Bougainville undoubtedly dealt a fatal blow to this American plan - Translator's Note

The United States used its large air power to attack the Japanese front-line air bases, planning to advance its turf to Cape Torokina on Bougainville Island. If successful, they would deploy all their air power to first seize the Bismarck Archipelago, including Rabaul. Here, they would set up many air bases, deploy several times more air power than that, spy on the Dutch East Indies in the Japanese resource zone, and on the one hand, add carrier air power to the air power in that area, directly attacking Japan's certain areas in the South Seas, attempting to cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the resource zones of the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Combined Carrier Operations

But what is most noteworthy this time is that the United States previously relied only on base air units, but in this offensive, they used aircraft carriers at the same time. Although this tactic of using aircraft carriers in combination was thwarted by the activity of Japanese naval aircraft, they are determined to completely annihilate the air power in the Rabaul area, the largest Japanese base, and destroy the Japanese fleet in order to take the opportunity to reinforce Cape Torokina, and even want to land in New Britain, to maintain victory in one fell swoop.

In the previous enemy air raids on Minamitori Island, Okinotori Island, and the major air attacks on Rabaul, Palau, etc., aircraft carriers were also dispatched. The reason why the enemy chose the line of the Solomon Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the New Guinea Archipelago in the offensive operation is that this line is the only one where a large amount of air power can be deployed to attack the Japanese mainland and resource zones. The remaining islands, such as the Aleutian Islands, or the small islands scattered in the Pacific, are not sufficient to build large air bases. Moreover, the enemy does not have the extra capacity to build aircraft carriers carrying more than 100,000 aircraft, so their offensive route is naturally limited to the Solomon area. The offensive in this area is, needless to say, their main force.

So what methods do they use to advance their air bases? Before the landing operation, they often used large groups of hundreds or two hundred aircraft to bomb the base. For example, in this landing operation on Mono Island and Cape Torokina, the enemy first used a mobile unit centered on aircraft carriers to attack Minamitori Island, Okinotori Island, etc., and used long-range bombers to constantly attack the Gilbert Islands. They tried to concentrate Japanese air power on the Bougainville Island area where they intended to land, within the range of possibility, so that Japan would strictly guard against this area.

In this way, in the Solomon and Bismarck Islands area, the Japanese bases in Palau, Rabaul, Buka, Rabaul, etc., were air raided every day, with as many as three hundred and several dozen aircraft at most. Their tactics are that when they attack with a formation of more than two hundred aircraft, fighters first fly at a considerable altitude to distract our vigilant fighters, and then our fighters chase after them and engage in fierce air combat. At this time, many fighters protect the bombers and attack at low altitude. Of course, the number of our fighters is less than theirs at this time. Although we can shoot down a few of the enemy aircraft, countless bombers drop bombs on our air bases. After the bombing, or even in the midst of the enemy aircraft bombing, the maintenance personnel, quartermaster corps members, etc., of course, rush to repair day and night, but they can't keep up with the damage caused by the hundreds of aircraft that drop bombs every day. Moreover, the enemy also drops time bombs everywhere, which explode at any time, so it is quite annoying. As a result, the bases in the Solomon Islands, Palau, Barale, etc., were destroyed by the enemy and could not be used temporarily. The enemy then landed on Mono Island and Cape Torokina.

The Life-and-Death Battle of the South Seas Islands

But although the enemy suppressed our bases in the Solomon Islands, they failed to succeed in the Rabaul area alone. In the landing operation from October 31st to the morning of November 2nd, many were shot down by our naval aircraft flying from Rabaul. Why couldn't the enemy suppress our Rabaul area? This is of course because the air power deployed by the enemy air bases in Guadalcanal, New Georgia, Utarak, Vella Lavella, Toropryan, etc., is now not fully supplied. Bases must be equipped with ammunition, gasoline, and many other storage facilities. These supplies are constantly being bombed by our naval aircraft, so replenishment is not very sufficient. That is why they dare to use aircraft carriers equipped with sufficient bombs and gasoline, at least able to carry hundreds of aircraft. They actually disregarded the iron rule that aircraft carriers cannot easily enter the territory of enemy air bases and attacked with two aircraft carriers at the same time, showing their determination to seize our important strategic strongholds and take Rabaul in one fell swoop.

This is a desperate tactic that cannot be underestimated. Fortunately, thanks to the outstanding command of our operation headquarters and the great activity of naval aircraft, we were able to defend it. The enemy still has many aircraft carriers, and they will probably appear one after another. In response, from now on, our soldiers must make their best efforts.

### Shanghai Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office Established by Chinese and Japanese Jointly; Handling Shanghai Flour Unified Allocation Tasks

Central News Agency News - After the National General Commercial Control Association's Flour and Wheat Special Committee implemented the purchase of wheat, it distributed the purchased wheat to flour mills in the Jiangsu and Anhui areas to produce flour, collected and implemented the allocation for civilian needs, to assist civilian food supplies, and provide genuine benefits to people's livelihoods, which is no small feat. Regarding the Shanghai flour allocation matters, before a proper solution was obtained, the Flour and Wheat Special Committee still calculated the quantity of flour to be allocated and allocated to the original Shanghai Wheat Flour Control and Allocation Association, distributing the flour to each responsible district according to population to ensure supply. Now, in order to improve the allocation mechanism and achieve strict flour allocation according to population, the Shanghai Flour Industry Association, in accordance with the Flour and Bran Centralized Allocation Plan promulgated by the National General Commercial Control Association, sent representatives to meet with representatives of the Japanese Shanghai Wheat Flour Control and Allocation Association to discuss and decide to jointly establish the "Shanghai Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office". Members of the Flour and Bran Group of the Flour Industry Association will be selected to participate as six Chinese representatives, and five Japanese representatives will be selected to participate, to jointly prepare for the organization. After being approved by the Business Coordination Committee, it was officially established yesterday (the 15th) to handle flour allocation matters for Chinese and Japanese merchants and residents in the Shanghai area. The Unified Allocation Office is located on the fourth floor of the Wanhe Building on the Fourth Road. It is said that the office is directly under the guidance of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee to handle unified allocation tasks.

### Unfortunate Women and Children's Families: China Relief for Women and Children General Association

In a semi-feudal society, the fate of women is not guaranteed. In addition, education is not universal; women who suffer under old customs and evil forces will never see the light of the future and will not find their proper way out. "Since ancient times, beautiful women have had unfortunate lives" has become the definitive assessment of the lives of suffering women. Especially in Shanghai, which is still subject to feudal shackles and full of corrupt labor in the commercial port, there are lost sheep everywhere. Now, there are helpless women and children. Who knows that there is also a benevolent agency dedicated to teaching and helping these unfortunate women and children--the China Relief for Women and Children General Association?

Long History

Xingqiao Street, near Ningbo Road, is a prosperous street where lower-middle-class people live. It is an old "Renyi Yangtang" (Benevolence and Righteousness Orphanage), a large hall, an old-fashioned theater-style building, which gives people a sense of comfort. Now, the venue is temporarily the site of the China Relief for Women and Children General Association.

Talking about the China Relief for Women and Children General Association, it already has a history of more than 30 years. It was before the founding of the Republic of China. At that time, Shanghai had become a department of commerce and western difficulties. On the one hand, due to the general commercial development, the city became a gold rush in the minds of citizens in nearby small towns. Men and women flocked to it. On the other hand, due to international relations and convenient transportation, criminals gradually made Shanghai their nest. As a result, wandering and helpless women and children are everywhere, and those who are lured, abducted, sold, and even fall into the sea of misery are everywhere. It has created all kinds of family tragedies and social crises. At that time, there was a group of benevolent people who witnessed the heartache and hoped to work together to provide relief. Therefore, Song Hanzhang, Tian Zimin, Yun Sheng, He Qiushi, Xu Qianlin, etc. initiated the good cause of helping helpless women and children. Soon, they were supported by Zhu Zao, Wang Yishi, Ju Runsheng, Xie Ting, Xiang Rusong, and Lao Jingxiu, and in the third year of Xuantong, they began to organize the China Women and Children Relief Association to rescue lost and abducted women and children. Use the power of society to do social undertakings. Although they have not received government assistance, the cause has developed rapidly due to the support and support of the general public. Later, a nursing home was established at the Jade Buddha Temple near Jiangwan Railway Station. The scale was quite large and the equipment was gradually improved. Unexpectedly, after the two wars, the Association was completely destroyed. However, countless women and children in distress have been added after the war. At that time, major charitable organizations in Shanghai tried their best to provide relief, but they still felt that their efforts were far away. How could this organization, which was originally dedicated to providing relief to helpless women and children, not recover immediately? Under the urgent demands from all quarters, "China Women and Children Relief Association" sign finally appeared again in the Renyi Shantang on Xinqiao Street.

Target of Relief

China Relief for Women and Children General Association's pure work target is to help helpless women and children. The targets of relief are refugee women, refugee children, lost women and children, those who have been abducted, and women and children who are homeless and wandering the streets. According to the person in charge of the Association, there were originally six major items stipulated for relief work, namely:

1. Rescue: The association used to have several honest and reliable detectives who were in contact with the police at stations and other public places to rescue women and children who had been lured and abducted. This work, which is full of chivalrous spirit, has now been changed to investigation work because the local environment has changed, and it is no longer engaged in rescue by itself. Moreover, in fact, maintaining the women and children who have been rescued is not an easy task. It is also difficult to accommodate the rescued women and children sent by various charities.

2. Collection: After the association takes in lost and abducted women and children, after certain investigation and registration procedures, those who have a clear address will be properly sent back. Most of them will be immediately advertised for collection. As long as their family members can find a proper guarantee, they can take them back without paying any fees. For those who escaped due to intolerable mistreatment, their parents were severely advised not to mistreat them again in order to maintain humanity and justice. If this work to protect the oppressed is carried out in a righteous manner, it is truly immeasurable merit.

3. Repatriation: According to the person in charge of the Association, for women and children who are lost and abducted, if they can tell the detailed address, even if it is far away in another hometown, the Association will send staff to escort them back home without charging any fees. Now, due to limited funding and inconvenient transportation, they have no power to repatriate except for those near Shanghai. The above-mentioned tasks are all passive in nature. Now the full force is focused on supporting the following active education work:

4. Nursing: The Association treats the abducted women and children as if they were their own flesh and blood, so that the young can be taught, the strong can return, and the old can be taken care of. In the past, there were kindergartens, male nursing homes, female nursing homes, and elderly homes in the Jade Buddha Temple. Now most of the undertakings have been inherited. The young and male nursing homes are located in the Renyi Shantang, and the female nursing home is located on North Chengdu Road.

5. Skills: The Association stipulates that when the women and children who are supported reach a certain age, the Association will introduce them to the agreed factories or shops to learn skills, so that everyone has a skill to solve their own life problems and become good citizens of society. Now, more academic education is being added in the Association to enable them to be self-reliant after leaving the Association.

6. Begging for support and choosing a match. The Association stipulates that citizens who have proper occupations and status and lack heirs or spouses can apply to the Association to select suitable objects (children or wives). However, they must abide by the Association's regulations on begging for support and choosing a match, find reliable guarantors, and handle it carefully in order to protect the future happiness of the women and children who have been taught by their own blood.

For more than 30 years, the China Relief for Women and Children General Association has rescued and supported tens of thousands of helpless women and children. In addition to sending them to be received, begging for support, and arranging matches, and introducing them to find work in the industrial and commercial circles, the total number of women and children currently being supported is still more than 500, and the trend is increasing.

Economic circles Comment

### Comparative wartime economy of India

Twenty Indian economists, centered around Professor U Aman, a famous economist, issued a joint statement on India's wartime economic policy, using the Indian budget for the 1943-44 fiscal year as the theme. It describes the current situation in India as follows: The food panic that occurred in India was entirely due to the Indian government's large-scale plunder of boxed grains, the responsibility of which should be borne by the Indian government. Cotton products and products are problematic for the people because the Indian government has the right to buy them and forcibly control exports. Most of India's paper industry has fallen into a state of suspended production. Therefore, the Indian paper panic has become a serious problem.

Looking at the above-mentioned economic situation in India during the war, it can be seen that the Indian people are living a life of lingering on under the double attack of material shortages and inflation. Their predicament is naturally far above ours. Our food problem has indeed not been thoroughly solved. However, the government authorities have recently tried their best to solve the rice control problem. How to actively dredge the source of rice and how to actively increase the amount of rice dust are the only topics for our country to solve the people's reality today. Secondly, in terms of the people's clothing, it is natural not to use Shanghai as a representation of the national people's clothing problem, because the clothing needed by the vast majority of people in our country is not silk, wool, or Bi, but cotton and cotton cloth; since the purchase of cotton yarn cloth, the implementation of the distribution method has become a blessing that the people of the whole country are waiting for. Therefore, whether or not there is a problem with the people's clothing depends on the success of the implementation of the cotton yarn cloth distribution. Thirdly, the paper problem, which has a great relationship with culture, has recently been reported that paper mills in Central China are actively increasing production, and the results are satisfactory. Paper mills in Shanghai are also stepping up their efforts to enable Central China to be self-sufficient in papermaking. However, in order to ensure the supply of paper in the future, the whole country must save unnecessary consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen paper control.

### Various Associations Prevent Black Markets: Newly Established Trade Regulations; Inventory Registered on a Periodic Basis

Various trade associations in this city, in order to prevent their members from engaging in black market transactions, have imposed extremely strict restrictions on the buying and selling of goods between members. Recently, each association, recognizing that some members have failed to comply with the regulations, has specially formulated several new rules, advising members to strictly adhere to them; otherwise, the association will impose penalties. The key points of these regulations are as follows:

The buying and selling of goods is limited to fellow association members and registered goods. All transactions must be spot transactions, with same-day delivery and settlement. Forward transactions are prohibited, as is the practice of selling first and buying later, or buying first and selling later, similar to speculative transactions, in order to prevent speculation. The buying and selling locations are limited to the original markets and designated places of each association or organization; off-site buying and selling is strictly prohibited. The nature of buying and selling is divided into two types: genuine needs and nominal needs. The former refers to the direct practical consumption of the substance, and buying and selling should be based on permits, not exceeding the approved quantity. The latter refers to the circulation of funds among fellow traders, only involving transfer registration or processing and manufacturing into other commodities, without reducing the total amount of physical goods; the quantity is not limited, but both the buyer and seller must complete transfer or change registration. Prices are subject to appropriate restrictions by the association or organization. Violators will be suspended from trading. The inventory and production, buying, and selling of all goods and products by fellow association members must be registered with the association or organization. Unregistered goods will be treated as privately hoarded. The association or organization will report the registered amounts to the Federation on a ten-day basis, and the Federation will report to the Commercial and Trade Association on a monthly basis. All registered goods are the responsibility of the association or organization, the Federation, and even the Commercial and Trade Association, layer by layer upwards.

### Shanghai Special Municipality Public Bonds: First Lottery Redemption Held Yesterday at the Bankers' Association

The Shanghai Special Municipality Public Bonds for the year 1931 of the Republic of China, with a fixed amount of 10 million yuan, held its first lottery redemption at the Bankers' Association on the 15th of this month, in the presence of the public. Representatives present included Li from the Ministry of Finance, Chen Yongsan from the Auditing Department, Shen Zhenxu from the Municipal Government, Wang Boyuan from the Fund Management Committee, Zhang Pingyi from the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank, and guests from various sectors. Yuan Houzhi, Director of the Finance Bureau, was elected as chairman. The details of the proceedings are recorded as follows.

Chairman's Report

He stated that the issuance of public bonds was originally for the purpose of organizing municipal administration and establishing new security teams. The government aims to build the local area, promote the prosperity of the market, and strengthen public security by setting up security teams, so that every citizen can live and work in peace. However, a large amount of funding is required. At that time, the municipal treasury was very tight, so the Executive Yuan approved the issuance of these public bonds with a total value of 10 million yuan in June of the 31st year of the Republic of China. The bonds will be repaid in ten years by means of a lottery. Interest has already been paid twice, last November and this May. Today's lottery will redeem 30 bonds worth 10,000 yuan each, 125 bonds worth 1,000 yuan each, 120 bonds worth 500 yuan each, 100 bonds worth 100 yuan each, and 100 bonds worth 55 yuan each. Those whose last two digits of the bond number match the drawn lottery number will be the winning bonds for the first redemption. The total redemption amount is 500,000 yuan, which can be collected from the Shanghai Central Reserve Bank or the Shanghai Fuxing Bank at the end of this month.

Lottery Situation

Each supervisor examined the lottery tickets and the bottom sheets of the tickets. Representatives from the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank, Shanghai Fuxing Bank, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Bankers' Association, and Money Trade Association took turns drawing one ticket each.

Winning Numbers

The winning numbers for the first lottery are "27," "03," "69," "00," and "91." Each supervisor stamped and certified the bottom sheets of the tickets separately to ensure solemnity. All winning tickets, together with the interest due, will be redeemed in cash at the end of this month.

### Leather Purchase Work Research Organization

The leather control and purchasing organizations in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the Nanjing and Shanghai areas have recently undergone review by the Chinese-Japanese relations sector. Opinions from all parties are becoming consistent, with a Chinese-Japanese joint venture planning a leather purchase committee with a predetermined capital. However, the internal organizational system has not yet been finalized and is currently under study.

### Authorities to Supply Raw Materials to Enable Factories to Resume Operations

Preparatory Work Currently Underway

The relevant authorities in this city, recognizing that some factories have suspended operations due to a shortage of raw materials, which not only has a significant impact on the development of industry and commerce but also greatly affects the supply of goods and prices in the market, have taken steps to purchase a large amount of raw materials from various production areas and allocate them to factories to enable them to resume operations. Factories have already registered their monthly needs for various raw materials with the authorities. In the future, after a large batch of raw materials is transported to Shanghai, the authorities will allocate them fairly according to the registered quantities of each factory. The prices will be lower than those obtained by the factories themselves. Some factories that have been shut down are now engaged in cleaning up factory buildings, overhauling machinery, and preparing for work. At the same time, they are holding shareholders' meetings to raise capital. Once a large amount of materials is allocated, large-scale production will begin.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the decline in Chinese stocks expanded, showing a tendency to collapse. Credit tightened, and financial institutions rushed to sell off their holdings, causing all stocks to decline sharply. Department store and textile stocks retreated rapidly first, followed by real estate, industrial, and public utility stocks. Only the cultural industry stood out, showing an upward trend. Small denomination stocks continued to hold, with active trading. The performance of various industry stocks is recorded below.

Department Stores: Wing On Company broke through the barrier at the opening and continued to decline, remaining weak in the afternoon, eventually settling slightly above the previous day's closing. Sincere declined more than half a barrier. China Emporium rebounded slightly. China Underwear declined considerably.

Textiles: Wing On Textile declined steadily in the morning and weakened further in the afternoon, settling with a small amount remaining. China Textile and Sin Hwa showed excess supply, with large amounts entering the market. Liberty Textile rebounded after falling on heavy trading. Mei Ya Factory also declined slightly. Five Harmonies opened around the previous day's closing price. Small denomination stocks such as Lun Zhang, Rui Tai, Da Gong, Tian Lun, Xin Feng, and Da Zhonghua Weaving were held up by behind-the-scenes operators. Jing Fu Shirt rebounded to flat after falling, while Most Lun Cai settled slightly lower. Tuan Tuan Dyeing hovered.

New Industries: New Asia Factory declined slightly to the barrier. Sino-French broke through the barrier. Five Continents, Sino-Western, Sin Yi, New Star, and Jiu Fu Pharmaceuticals all showed declines.

Culture: Commercial Press and China Bookstore were the only ones advancing towards the high point amidst limited supply and strong demand. World Bookstore declined slightly.

Finance: Continental and Zhejiang both traded slightly lower. Shanghai, Jin Cheng, and Yanye.

Real Estate: Union Realty and Xin Yi followed the downward trend. Wing On returned to within the barrier.

Public Utilities: Zhabei Water & Electricity fell below the barrier again. China Merchants Electricity weakened further.

Other: Da Zhonghua Matches declined steadily. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco also declined slightly. Jiu An Industrial also declined considerably. New Asia Construction also entered the barrier. Da Tung, Da Zhonghua Industrial, and Tuan Hwa Investment all declined. Kang Yuan Canned Goods continued to decline. Standard Monosodium Glutamate opened at the barrier. China Film rose sharply on buying, showing a unique upward trend.

### Wholesale of Dried and Preserved Goods to be Subject to Price Controls

Due to the lack of price controls on dried and preserved goods, the selling prices among traders have not been consistent, directly affecting social livelihood. In order to standardize prices and achieve effective results, the trade association for this industry has requested that wholesale prices be controlled first, so that prices can be suppressed. The association has submitted a report to the municipal authorities. It is reported that the municipal government has instructed the relevant departments to verify the matter thoroughly and then respond.

### Commercial News in Brief

Public Bonds: Yesterday, the market continued to weaken. It is said that due to tightening credit, it is only a temporary phenomenon. Investors are nervous, causing market prices to remain weak and slowly decline. It is expected that this decline will not continue indefinitely. Yesterday, type C began to rise and then rose to the barrier. After that, it gradually declined, declining significantly compared to last weekend. Types A, B, D, and E all showed declines, but the degree of decline was generally balanced.

Call Loan Interest Rate: Yesterday, the Money Trade Association's call loan interest rate remained unchanged at 1.7%. Credit tightening continues.

Grains: The source of supply has recently been quite good. Due to reduced obstacles along the way, rice has arrived in abundance, resulting in a drop in prices, which are even lower than before. There is also a large supply of oilseeds, and cargo owners are eager to sell, but buyers are few, making it difficult for the market to rally.

Dried and Preserved Goods: Recently, due to more arrivals and slow sales, there has been no improvement. Buyers are few and far between, and the market is very sluggish. Government-issued red dates fell below eight barriers yesterday. Other details are available upon request.

Artificial Silk: Yesterday, it turned stable, with mostly scattered transactions. The opening price was the same as the previous report.

Daily Necessities: The distribution of matches and soap is being delayed because the authorities are still sending personnel to investigate the goods in stock. Although sales are quite sluggish, the needs of residents in this city are strong, so some retailers with goods for sale are selling Phoenix brand matches at surprisingly high prices per small box. The soap market is also continuing to rise. As for the cigarette market, it remains stagnant, as the allotted goods arrive on schedule, so there is no panic. A large number of miscellaneous brands from other ports have arrived, and sales have been slow as a result. Therefore, Zhonghua, Da Ying, Lao Dao, and Qian Men brands have seen stable to weak performance. Old cigarettes such as Quan Lu and Jin Qiang are rarely inquired about. National cigarettes such as Jin Die and American cigarettes are selling well due to limited supply. The market is lively.

Green Tea: Yesterday's tea market was buoyant, continuing the strong performance of the previous report. Coupled with the good color of the tea, merchants were still eager to bid, so the gate was united in buying and selling, with a happy atmosphere. As a result, various colors of tea were promoted greatly compared to the end of the previous report. It is estimated that 44 dan of fried green tea were traded from Water Street, etc. At the same time, there were still 15 tael of natural pearl mustard seed. The transaction price varied depending on the quality. The goods were sold by tea shops such as Zhenhua Chun Ji and Gong Chang. As for Keemun black tea, although buyers intended to be active, the holders of the goods were motivated by the green tea market and pushed up sales efforts. Therefore, in this situation, the future sales price will also be firm.

### The Truth About the British and American Air Forces Stationed in India

— Osawa Kanzou

Between last October and June of this year, before the rainy season began in Burma, Japanese army aircraft shot down countless enemy combat aircraft and jointly launched expeditions to Meng-Mei-Jin-Ki, Calcutta, Kunming, and other places, inflicting significant damage on the enemy air force. Although the enemy air force's technology is poor, they try to compensate with a quantitative advantage, desperately replenishing the number of aircraft shot down and destroyed. As Burma entered the official rainy season, enemy combat observation aircraft conducted guerrilla warfare despite the adverse weather, and enemy bomber squadrons stubbornly launched attacks, mainly targeting our transportation lines such as railways, bridges, and ships, conducting blind bombing.

The number of these blind bombings totaled 182 times (856 aircraft) in June, and approximately doubled in July, totaling 312 times, with the number of aircraft increasing to 1158.

This shows that the enemy is actively replenishing its air power. The number of first-line aircraft was approximately 650 in May (including 150 American aircraft), increased to approximately 1000 in June (including 350 American aircraft), and approximately 1300 in July (including 450 American aircraft), with a total increase of approximately 300 aircraft per month. The situation in August of this year is known in more detail and is recorded below:

Eastern India Front: Approximately 500 first-line aircraft.

British Air Force (fighter aircraft: 130 aircraft, bomber aircraft: 100 aircraft, other: 20 aircraft).

American Air Force (fighter aircraft: 80 aircraft, bomber aircraft: 100 aircraft, other: 100 aircraft).

Ceylon Island Front: Approximately 1200 first-line aircraft.

British Air Force (820 aircraft, including approximately 100 Indian troops).

American Air Force (more than 400 aircraft).

From this, it can be seen that the air power in India is approaching 2,000 aircraft, and its strength should not be underestimated.

Subsequently, due to the withdrawal of forces from North Africa and the shortening of the Anglo-American air force replenishment route through the Mediterranean after Italy's exit from the Axis powers, the enemy's replenishment became more active, and the bombing of Burma became more intense. The silence of the Japanese army air force during the rainy season has now suddenly become active.

Vulnerable Enemy Warplanes

At the beginning of the air war in Burma, the British Air Force was the main force. After the past two seasons, the Curtiss P-36, Curtiss P-40K, and Hurricane IIB appeared. The characteristics of various fighter aircraft are mostly similar to American-made aircraft.

The Curtiss P-36 is stronger than the Brewster Buffalo and P-40, but is ultimately no match for Japanese aircraft.

The K-type, a successful modification of the Curtiss P-40, has performance that is not yet fully understood. It is equipped with four 20mm machine guns in the wings, making it quite nimble. It is considered an excellent model along with the Hurricane IIB, but it is still insufficient compared to Japanese fighter aircraft.

The skill of enemy fighter pilots is extremely poor, especially the British fighter pilots. In the previous air battle over Duha Rongli, eight Japanese fighter planes ambushed a formation of sixteen enemy fighter planes, shooting down eight of them and causing the rest to flee. However, in this battle, not a single Japanese fighter plane was hit by enemy fire. Moreover, facing an outdated situation, the enemy was very advantageous. From this change of adverse situation and the great results obtained, it can be seen that there is a great difference in skill between the two sides. The air force gave instructions to its fighter planes. . "When you find a Japanese plane above you, prepare to bail out with a parachute? Also, if a Japanese plane is behind you, turning around is equivalent to death. If you want to engage, you must first try your best to escape, and then turn around. Secondly, when attacking Japanese planes, attack from the rear and above, and then leave immediately"!

Also, when requesting Hurricane fighter planes . . "Never engage in close combat with enemy single-engine fighter planes, but only attack enemy bombers". This is the equivalent of telling others not to dare to engage with Japanese fighter planes.

As a result, the enemy fighter plane lineup of the British and American sides, the crews and their capabilities of the British and American sides are not a problem. British fighter squadrons can only cooperate in combat in close-range enemy areas. American fighter squadrons are responsible for the air defense of key airfields around Calcutta, so the enemy fighter squadrons ultimately cannot fly the main task of active air combat.

Other fighter planes include the American P-43, P-66, and the British Buffalo twin-engine fighter plane, but the first two are extremely few in number. The Buffalo model initially served for the air defense of Calcutta, and then roughly formed a team of two aircraft, using their armor to specialize in strafing the ground on the front line, but this is not a problem. In short, the enemy fighter squadrons are actively restoring combat power in the rear.

Status of Enemy Bombers

In contrast, the organization of the enemy bomber squadron is worthy of vigilance.

Since the end of last year, the United States has been actively increasing its air power stationed in India. The British Blenheim, which initially appeared on the Burma front, has now been replaced by large heavy bombers such as the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, North American B-25 Mitchell, and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. Most of the blind bombings mentioned above were carried out by the US Air Force.

Approximately two seasons later, relying on its enormous production capacity as a background, on average, more than 100 aircraft were simultaneously deployed in large formations to blindly bomb long-distance targets, key points related to transportation, production, and replenishment.

The most common enemy bomber on the Burma front is the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, which is the bomber that we are most familiar with, frequently appearing in the skies over the entire territory of Burma. Generally, its altitude is between 5,000 and 6,000 meters. Eight or nine aircraft form a team, creating a single vertical line formation in a three-aircraft triangle formation to attack. Sometimes, three aircraft form a team and approach from various altitudes and directions.

The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress appears frequently in the Pacific, but very much in the Burma front. On June 4th of this year, it appeared in the skies over Yangon, and after shooting down two of them, it disappeared.

As for the B-24 and the North American B-25 Mitchell, which are very familiar in Tokyo, they appear more often in upper and central Burma. The reporter often saw these formations in central Burma.

Other bombers include the British Vickers Wellington, but because it is an old model, it only appears in central Burma at night, which is insignificant. It is not yet clear whether the American Douglas A-20 is in the Indian front. It is unlikely that India has this type of aircraft. The B-26 has not yet been discovered.

It is said that the new British aircraft De Havilland Mosquito has been discovered. We only received a radio message saying: "A new bomber, the Mosquito, has appeared, pay attention!", but it has not yet been seen on the battlefront. After the rainy season, perhaps they will come to bomb with a number of each squadron. The old Blenheim model has been modified into the "Bisley" model after increasing the horsepower of the engine, but it is still a very old model. The British Blackburn Skua dive bomber squadron was deployed in the Akab area, more in the nature of an experiment.

In reality, it is the US Air Force

Thus, in reality, the real entity of the enemy air force in the Indian front has been replaced by the US Air Force, which is at the beginning of the war with the British Air Force, and its center is the US bomber squadron, with the B-24 and B-25 models. However, as the fighter plane situation, as mentioned above, is not enough to form a joint formation with the bomber squadron, it can only rely on its heavy armor to attack.

These bomber squadrons are distributed in more than 90 airfields built within a 60-mile radius around Calcutta, strengthening air surveillance, and air defense fire is quite complete, and is equipped with short-wave warning devices. These more than 90 airfields, each aircraft, is in fact a group of airfields one by one. When one of these airfields in the airfield group is bombed, fighter planes immediately fly out from another airfield to intercept. As an example: the airfields used by the US 7th Bombardment Group include Qiabua, Tehassali, Agartala, and Qilir, etc. (Those marked with 〇 have night lighting equipment.) The bases used by the British include Chitaguan, Feni, Agola, and Sherchia, etc. (To be continued) (翔: Translated from the November 7th Asahi Weekly)

National Forum

### Wartime House Leasing Law

— Wang Xiangzhi

Reading Mr. Chen Bomin's "Discussion on Article 7 of the Wartime House Leasing Law" in this month's 5th issue of the National Forum, I cannot help but feel the weakness of the traditional Chinese concept of law. Regardless of the contradiction between right and wrong, people follow their own likes and dislikes, considering what benefits themselves as right and what benefits others as wrong. The disputes and chaos are endless, and there is no fixed definition of right and wrong. China today is suffering from a lack of attention to rules and agreements from the top to the bottom. People are trying to achieve the unreachable ideal of governing with morality and regulating with propriety to govern the people of today who are far removed from the Three Dynasties. As a result, it is impossible to expect those who make the laws to abide by them.

Focusing on the matter at hand, although the second and third paragraphs of Article 450 of the Civil Code regarding house leasing have not been repealed, the court has never adopted them since the incident. Although tenants have benefited greatly, second-hand landlords have profited even more. However, in terms of the rule of law, what are the gains and losses? I have never heard of anyone who loves propriety without loving the sheep, coming out to discuss it. Is this a good phenomenon? The promulgation of this Wartime House Leasing Law is not that the government is aware of the suspicion of trampling on the law, and rather issues a clear order to amend it, in order to emphasize the spirit of the rule of law. Looking at its contents, it not only protects the peace of residence, but also gives the owner a considerable benefit. The legislator takes both sides into account, and really gets the fairness of the matter, which cannot be easily discussed.

For example, the law allows second-hand landlords to get 50% of the net profit, which the speaker ignores and tacitly approves of. However, for the owner, although it is acknowledged that the rent is low and the loss is too large, only a reasonable rent increase is allowed to compensate for the loss, and no profit is allowed. Is this an unbiased comment?

When it comes to the allocation of daily necessities to stabilize people's livelihood, I only see the authorities' regulations and price limits. Whether for producers or sellers, a certain profit is allowed, and I have never seen anyone discussing its faults. Only for those who own real estate, they are only allowed to have losses and no profits. What kind of logic is this? In short, to discuss things, one must be fair, just, and forgiving, otherwise, it will inevitably be a one-sided discussion.

### Change the Calculation of Household Rice to Jin and Liang

— Huang Zhichao

Our store is a household rice merchant in the third district (Zhabei). In October, we received 34 packages of household rice and 150 packages of household flour in two installments. The profit is set at 18 yuan per package of rice and 10.2 yuan per package of flour, for a total profit of 2,142 yuan. After deducting the rice and flour transportation costs (2 yuan per package) totaling 368 yuan, monthly membership fee of 150 yuan, inspection fee for the supervisory authority investigator (50 yuan per installment of rice, 10 yuan per installment of flour) totaling 120 yuan, 15 yuan returned for empty hemp bags, and 50 yuan for rice certificates, flour certificates, and paper costs, the net profit in October was only 1,439 yuan. The monthly profit for household rice and flour when they are not in short supply is even less than this. How can this 1,400 yuan maintain the store's water, electricity, rent, food, and salaries? Moreover, household rice merchants cannot also engage in black market rice.

The price of household rice has increased from 252 yuan per picul to the current 800 yuan per picul within a few months. The cost has increased by more than three times. After the increase in the price of household flour, the profit has increased from 2.8 yuan per package to 10.2 yuan. However, the profit for household rice has remained at 18 yuan per package for several months. In theory, as the cost increases, the profit should also increase. As for the same allocated goods, the profit percentage of rice is different from that of flour, which is really incomprehensible. We should ask the supervisory authority to consider the suffering of rice merchants and readjust the legal profit of rice merchants so that they can maintain the minimum expenses of a store.

The calculation of household rice should be changed to jin and liang because there is no inconvenience in calculating household flour in jin and liang. The household rice of Japanese residents in Shanghai is also calculated in jin and liang. After the calculation of household rice is changed to jin and liang, unscrupulous rice merchants can be prevented from fraud, and rice merchants can be relieved of the suspicion of deducting measures. Currently, a dou of rice using a dou measure is 16 jin and 4 liang for Saigon rice and broken rice, and only 15 jin for red rice and brown rice. The difference is too large, so the calculation of household rice in jin and liang is beneficial and without disadvantages. (Correspondent)

Social Services

### Improve the Method of Distributing Clothing to Prevent Various Abuses

Our hall has always organized various social welfare activities such as porridge distribution, clothing distribution, and small-loan loans, and has never been negligent. Winter is approaching, and the number of people requesting winter clothing is increasing every day. Our hall should distribute clothing to those who are truly in need according to their names so that they can keep warm. However, there are still various abuses, such as receiving from one place and then receiving again from another place. At this time when the value of winter clothing is extremely high, fundraising is already difficult, and there is still this phenomenon. If there is any negligence, it will be a great disservice to the good intentions of the donors. Therefore, our hall has formulated the following methods for distributing winter clothing: Those who request winter clothing must first register their detailed address, name, etc. After investigation and confirmation, it will be issued based on their own ID card. At the time of issuance, the issuing agency will stamp a small seal next to the ID card with the words "Winter clothing for a certain year has been issued" to avoid the abuse of re-issuance in the future. If there is no ID card, the person requesting winter clothing can only be sent to "one designated place" for issuance, regardless of any charitable organization, and cannot be distributed separately.
