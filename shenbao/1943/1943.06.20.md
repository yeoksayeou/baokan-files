### Re-examining Sino-Japanese Relations

— Chen Binhe

Preface

The May issue of the Japanese "Chuo Koron" features an article titled "New Focus of the China Problem and Japan's Attitude," a collective opinion jointly expressed by Okamoto Seiichi, Nobu Kiyosaburo, Tanaka Kanae, Sugimura Hiroshi, Ishihama Tomoyuki, and others. Its outline is as follows: (1) The China problem before and after this point; (2) Why does Chongqing continue to resist? (3) Why are the US and the Soviet Union pleased? (4) Regarding goods and prices; (5) New paths for Sino-Japanese economic construction; (6) The problem of Japanese people in China; (7) The path that Sino-Japanese culture should take; (8) The China problem in the era of the Greater East Asia War; (9) How to win the hearts of Chinese youth, etc. It is worthy of our reading and discussion. Therefore, it has been translated into Chinese, and opinions from Chinese people concerned about Sino-Japanese relations have been solicited. We have successively received: (1) Mr. He Ziheng's "Review and Prospects of Sino-Japanese Equality"; (2) Mr. Zhou Yueran's "Fusion of Sino-Japanese Cultures"; (3) Mr. Liu Yusheng's "Reflections"; (4) Mr. Yang Guangzheng's "Sino-Japanese Problems at the Current Stage of the War"; (5) Mr. Li Quanshi's "Personal Views on Sino-Japanese Problems"; (6) Mr. Pan Wen'an's "Demand for Autonomous and Self-Respecting Survival"; (7) Mr. Lu Feng's "New Policy Towards China"; (8) Mr. Chen Fumu's "Current Issues Facing Japan." These eight articles are compiled into a special issue and will be published in the June issue of the Shen Bao Monthly (to be published soon) as a response. In addition, Chen Binhe has written an article titled "Re-examining Sino-Japanese Relations," published here to replace the weekly commentary.

The May issue of the Japanese "Chuo Koron" published an article on the "New Focus of the China Problem and Japan's Attitude" by writers Okamoto Seiichi, Nobu Kiyosaburo, Tanaka Kanae, Sugimura Hiroshi, and Ishihama Tomoyuki. With an objective and impartial attitude, they examined, analyzed, and suggested practical issues in Sino-Japanese relations, which are indeed worthy of careful study by the people of both countries. As a Chinese journalist, I feel deeply about the issues and opinions raised by these gentlemen. I will briefly express my views on the psychology of the Chinese people that I come into contact with daily, for the reference of patriots in both countries who are concerned about this issue.

First of all, it is commendable that Mr. Nobu sincerely discussed the economic structure of China and Japan and the development of Chinese private capital under the general topic of "The China Problem Before and After This Point." We should not dwell on old scores, especially in this era of the Greater East Asia War, and as the new order in East Asia awaits the joint efforts of China and Japan to build it, the people of both countries should have the magnanimity to forgive the past so that they can be in complete harmony and shoulder the heavy responsibility of history. This is the premise for us to handle any relationship between China and Japan; otherwise, nothing can be discussed. However, it is also very important to examine the knots of past relations in order to prevent future obstacles to cooperation. From the perspective of economic structure (including productivity and production relations), Japan has been emulating Europe and the United States step by step in the last sixty years, embarking on the road of industrialization, and at the same time inheriting the tradition of capitalism. Therefore, it fatefully needs colonies, markets for sales, and markets for investment to expand its power. This is a fact, which should not be concealed and absolutely cannot be concealed. As for China, it is an economically backward agricultural country. The development of its productivity is internally suppressed by feudal production relations and externally restricted by the aggression of capitalist powers, becoming a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country for a hundred years. However, in the last four or fifty years, internally, there have been revolutionary movements from Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and externally, there have been influences from the Japanese Meiji Restoration and the Soviet Revolution. The awakening of the people has progressed day by day, and the situation is no longer comparable to that before the Sino-Japanese War or the 1911 Revolution. Under the reality of such a vast difference in the national conditions of China and Japan, two major neighboring countries, mutual killing will result in mutual loss, while mutual cooperation is enough to seek the liberation and development of East Asia. Contemporary powers, led by Britain and the United States, only fear the cooperation between China and Japan, which would endanger their illegal rights and hegemony in the Pacific Ocean, from the perspective of their own interests. Therefore, they advocate the "Yellow Peril" theory in Europe and the United States, creating a mentality of contempt and hatred towards the Chinese and Japanese nations, and using cunning plans such as the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and American aid to China to instigate discord, create incidents, and make them fight each other, eventually leading to the unfortunate performance of a six-year bloody war. We painfully reflect on this and hope that people of insight on both sides, especially the power groups on both sides, will completely abandon their mutual suspicion and defense, and restore their original attitude. Only in this way can we ensure the true victory of East Asian liberation. The recent implementation of Japan's new policy towards China and China's participation in the war can be said to be preliminary manifestations. In the future, we must further cooperate more closely. Mr. Nobu said: "The difficulty of the China problem in the past was due to the fact that Japan itself was not fully mature in guiding the increasingly awakened Chinese nation. When Japan itself has the power to truly liberate East Asia as an advanced country due to the sophistication of its economic structure, the China problem will be solved easily." We feel that this may be necessary for Japanese self-encouragement; however, we must believe that any one-sided effort or the development of one side's strength cannot solve international problems. History has already given us clear explanations. Therefore, we want to supplement Mr. Nobu's conclusion, that is, in addition to Japan, we should also help the Chinese nation to awaken and become strong. Under the joint efforts of China and Japan, we can stabilize and prosper East Asia, and truly solve the Sino-Japanese problem in the future. Agree with this interpretation. However, at the same time, we must point out that Mr. Tanaka believes that one of the reasons for Chongqing's continued resistance is that the Chiang Kai-shek faction mistakenly believes that China and Japan cannot coexist, and uses this to deceive the Chinese people and insist on "resistance." This is not in accordance with the facts. In fact, the Chiang Kai-shek faction simply does not care whether China and Japan can coexist, whether they can cooperate, or how the war will be won or lost. They only use resistance to maintain their ruling position and obtain more foreign assistance. When resistance is beneficial to this purpose, they "insist on resistance," and when peace is beneficial to this purpose, why wouldn't they denounce resistance? It is not in accordance with the facts to overestimate the Chiang regime. This should be understood first. Secondly, the theory of "insisting on resistance" does not start from the theory that China and Japan cannot coexist, but from the so-called "resisting Japanese imperialism." Therefore, in the resistance areas, there is no particular emphasis on opposing the Japanese; on the contrary, even within the resistance camp, there are still many who are truly knowledgeable about Japan and pro-Japanese. This is something that must be understood second. In addition, the deception of Chongqing by Britain and the United States, and the activity of the Communist Party, are certainly factors in Chongqing's continued resistance, but they are by no means decisive factors. Because, if the people psychologically understand that resistance is not a good plan, what can the Chongqing regime rely on to continue resistance? Therefore, we believe that Chongqing's regime has been resisting for six years, and only recently have generals been constantly defecting. The reason for this is not simply political deception or oppression, but also the direction of the people's psychology must be taken into account. If we only look at the direction of the people from the perspective of a few generals and senior officials, we will obviously be wrong by a hair's breadth and miss by a thousand miles. As for the resistance faction's psychology of relying on Britain and the United States to fight Japan, it does exist. The Chongqing regime has placed all its hopes on Britain and the United States, and Chongqing has been dreaming of the outbreak of war between the United States and Japan for several years; however, at the same time, we must not say that the six-year resistance has only been supported by this kind of expectation and fantasy. The reason why the resistance faction continues to resist is based on another kind of foundation, which is the general people's lack of understanding of Japan, the erroneous judgment that Japan cannot support a long-term war, and the firm belief in "self-reliance." Every year that passes during the resistance is not a regret for the failure of the resistance, but a celebration of having survived another year. We must clearly recognize that the true power supporting the resistance is here, and the root cause hindering the completion of the Greater East Asia Liberation War through Sino-Japanese cooperation is here. We must find countermeasures from here, which are the only truly effective policies.

Thirdly, Mr. Ishihama analyzed the China problem from another perspective, purely from the current issues of the people's livelihood and the wartime economy in China, with expert investigation and research, which can be said to be the most meaningful. Mr. Ishihama correctly raised the issue of goods and prices, the issue that currency should be prevented from inflating, and the issue that the production of goods must be strengthened, especially pointing out that speculation and hoarding in the current economic crisis are not the cause of the economic crisis, but only one of the results of unsound economic development. This is a penetrating argument, and it is exactly what we have always been willing to speak frankly and directly to the authorities. We have always believed that if the China problem is not solved, the Sino-Japanese relationship will never return to its original state, so as to jointly complete the great cause of East Asian liberation. The crux of the China problem lies in winning the hearts of the people to overthrow the Chongqing regime's long-term strategy of attrition warfare; the focus of the problem of winning the hearts of the people (which should absolutely not be buying the hearts of the people) lies in the solution of economic problems in the peace zones, in the improvement and upward mobility of the people's livelihood in the peace zones, especially in the completion of the increased production of goods and the realization of price policies. After the people have truly achieved a peaceful and prosperous life, King Wen of Zhou established an empire that lasted for eight hundred years with only fifty miles of territory. How much more so is it today, when the peace zones have occupied the richest areas of the country? The "problem of Japanese people in China" is indeed a major factor that affects the success or failure of Sino-Japanese relations. Although Mr. Ishihama's words here focus on his hopes for the Japanese people, it can also be seen that the Japanese people are sincere about the new policy. He frankly said: "Even without relying on military protection, they can live and do business as long as privileges or rights and interests are not within the scope of expulsion. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly understand the whole nature of the policy change before activities can be carried out." We should pay special attention to Mr. Ishihama's advice to the Japanese people; however, at the same time, we should also awaken the Chinese people's belief in the Japanese and their sense of responsibility for mutual love and mutual assistance like hands and feet.

In addition to economy, we believe that the key to solving the Sino-Japanese problem lies only in cultural work. Mr. Okamoto's "The Path That Sino-Japanese Culture Should Take" analyzes the historical relationship between Chinese culture and Japanese culture and the reality that they cannot be forcibly unified in an extremely objective and frank manner, and correctly points out: "For cultural exchange, on the one hand, there is such a common foundation, and on the other hand, the condition must be mutually different cultures. If the two are not heterogeneous cultures, then there is no power for mutual exchange. Therefore, when we think about the future of Sino-Japanese culture, we must first develop its heterogeneity (personality), ensure the reason for mutual existence, and not infringe on the other side by a hair's breadth. Only by recognizing and guaranteeing this heterogeneity can we expect cultural exchange and mutual development." This can be said to be the eternal manifesto, oath, and work program of Sino-Japanese cultural workers.

The focus of the "China Problem in the Era of the Greater East Asia War" is only the four words "winning the hearts of the people." Mr. Sugimura's view is correct. However, "winning the hearts of the people" is definitely not the same as "buying the hearts of the people." Therefore, negatively speaking, "using Japan's huge sums of money to buy the hearts of the Chinese people, if it is believed that the people, although incited by anti-Japanese propaganda, will praise the government as soon as there is an opportunity or cheap way to satisfy their appetite," of course, this is not winning the hearts of the people, but only winning the hearts of a very small number of opportunists. Once this opportunity no longer exists, they will also leave in disappointment. Moreover, grasping the opportunists will certainly further alienate the true and long-lasting hearts, which is an inevitable principle. However, is the Chongqing regime taking this dead end? Mr. Sugimura said: "The anti-Japanese government is constantly working to stimulate the people's desire for profit. At the same time, Britain and the United States are returning their own rights and interests to buy people's hearts, thinking about all kinds of opportunities, and intending to be generous with Japan's rights and interests for the Chinese people, and constantly catering to the anti-Japanese government. This is the reason for the China Incident and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War." Regarding this section, the fact that Britain and the United States lured the anti-Japanese government, and that the anti-Japanese government took advantage of the opportunity, is 100% true. However, if it is said that the anti-Japanese government is buying the people and "constantly stimulating the people's desire for profit," we should recognize that it is not true. Except for a few people who eat anti-Japanese food and make money from the national crisis, the majority of the people—the people under the anti-Japanese regime—only suffer all kinds of actual pain and sacrifice, and no one will think that resistance is a profitable business. It is a completely wrong conclusion to explain the support of a part of the Chinese people for resistance by pursuing their desire for profit. Therefore, in the same way, using "stimulating the people's desire for profit" to persuade the people in the peace zones to cooperate with Japan will not achieve a truly beneficial effect for both countries. Mr. Sugimura said that after the Greater East Asia War, the "true solution" to the China problem "is only the national government that cooperates with Japan, and here we can say how to grasp the focus of the people's hearts." However, we should also add to this conclusion, that is, this is said from the perspective of the national government to the Chongqing regime. To grasp the hearts of the people, it is natural to leave the Chongqing regime and take the national government as the target, but is the national government the focus of the Chinese people's hearts? Obviously, it still awaits the joint efforts of the national government and the folk leaders!

Among Mr. Okamoto's theory of "cultural movement" and Mr. Sugimura's "winning the hearts of the people," one of the most important items is "how to win the hearts of Chinese youth?" On this point, Mr. Okamoto has provided us with an extremely correct theory and pointed out the most open path. Mr. Okamoto observed the China problem not from the superficial and partial phenomena, but from the internal and comprehensive content, so what he grasped must be the core of all problems. He clearly pointed out: "I think, in their—referring to Chinese youth—spirit of abandoning the spirit of modern urban civilization and living in poor rural areas, we can see China decades later. Because I firmly believe that they will be the responsible persons for the future Chinese culture and politics. If, a few years later, East Asia restores peace, and the opponents who associate with us and compete with us in the cultural field are only them. We must deeply remember this." Today, when we talk about winning the hearts of the people, it is certainly not all this generation, but indeed, from a broader perspective, we have to admit that the reason why this generation of young people has emerged and persisted in their aspirations is the highest manifestation of the spirit of the Chinese nation, and it is the truest manifestation of the Chinese people's hearts. If we want to talk about "winning the hearts of the people," we should truly start from this point, which is the fundamentally correct direction. As for the method of grasping, the Chongqing government failed, because, as Mr. Okamoto said: "For those who bear the fate of the nation and face a realistic life, no matter how good your skills are, you will not attract their attention," "we have never heard of an example in human history of moving people's hearts with tricks." Therefore, we also sincerely express Mr. Okamoto's heartfelt voice: "If a policy, action, and words cannot resonate in the hearts of Japanese people who have the same history, nation, and era as us, and cannot move Chinese youth, it is because of the difference in national and historical traditions, and also because they are the opponents in the war. We must deeply consider this point. What achievements have been made in these six years of war?" "If Japan can grasp the hearts of Chinese youth in the near future, it can only be realized when we use a spirit of universal love, generosity, and humility for the individual and the country, and even for all mankind, and our true meaning of hard struggle moves the soul of the Chinese people, and only then will the smell of gunpowder that has disappeared on the mainland naturally."

We believe that the solution to Sino-Japanese relations or the so-called China problem should not seek conclusions based on preconceived ideal policies and slogans, because the result will inevitably be completely wrong. Therefore, we must start from the actual situation of the other party, that is, have the courage to face reality, not be afraid to observe the other party's true face, heart and liver, and the true meaning of their actions, and then dissect and study them. Only then will we reach a true conclusion, and only that kind of conclusion will powerfully promote policy and realize the ideals of both of us. Perhaps this can be said to be Mr. Okamoto's "historical spirit of new conscience." Thank you to Chuo Koron for publishing these articles, which let us know that in Japan, "there are honest people who are racking their brains everywhere now," but in China, how few are the people who are willing to seriously observe and rack their brains!

### Deng Ziyu and Others Swore in Yesterday; Jiangxi Provincial Government Established in Jiujiang; National Government Representative Xu Suzhong Gave Instructions; Governor Deng Announced Policy Guidelines

Jiujiang, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Jiangxi Provincial Government held its establishment ceremony at 9:00 AM on the 17th in the Provincial Government Auditorium. Attendees included Governor Deng Ziyu, mayors and county chiefs, and representatives of the army and navy. After the meeting began, the governor led the directors of various departments and bureaus in taking an oath. National Government Representative Xu Wenguan, Suzhong, gave an instructional speech, followed by speeches from guests and a response from the governor. The meeting concluded at 11:00 AM.

Jiujiang, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Jiangxi Provincial Government held its establishment ceremony in Jiujiang today. The ceremony was very grand. In addition to addressing the public at the celebration meeting, Governor Deng also gave an inaugural speech. The Jiangxi Provincial Government also issued a declaration of establishment. The main points of Governor Deng's inaugural speech and address to the public celebration meeting are recorded below:

Main points of Governor Deng's inaugural speech: In promoting provincial affairs, I will base my efforts on local needs and financial resources, striving to achieve results as opportunities arise. In the future, special attention should be paid to the following points: (1) To establish security and protect the people's livelihood, it is necessary to strictly implement the Baojia system. A thorough household registration should be conducted to ensure that criminals have no place to hide, so that the people of Jiangxi can live and work in peace. (2) The exchange of goods within the province is not smooth, resulting in a shortage of goods. On the positive side, we must develop transportation, regulate finance, and facilitate the flow of goods. On the negative side, we must crack down on unscrupulous merchants hoarding goods and register goods for distribution. (3) In the past, the distribution of salt in the province was unreasonable. In the future, the government plans to manage it uniformly and distribute it equally according to Baojia. As for the recent shortage of rice in the province, we should actively seek remedies, on the one hand, reclaiming wasteland to increase production, and on the other hand, saving consumption and distributing reasonably. To facilitate the supply and demand of salt and rice, it is also planned to establish cooperative enterprises, setting up more cooperative societies in counties, districts, townships, and towns, to eliminate the current bad situation. (4) The province has suffered from the incident, not only has the provincial government been neglected, but also many farms, factories, and businesses have gone bankrupt. In the future, restoring the countryside and revitalizing the market will be essential plans. Reorganizing taxes and abolishing exorbitant levies are also key points for revitalizing industry, and we should urge their implementation. (5) In the future, the province's education must be vigorously restored to cultivate talents for use. (6) It is heard that the habits of smoking and gambling are rampant in the province, which is shocking. In the future, they must be strictly prohibited and eliminated. As for the harm caused by prostitution, we should also strictly prevent it. (7) To this day, some people in Jiangxi may still blindly believe in resistance, or have always been particularly devoted, but cannot temporarily escape the control of the Chongqing side. Continuing to be obsessed and follow the old ways is not only misleading the country, but also misleading themselves. We hope that they will realize this as soon as possible, quickly return, and jointly participate in the great cause of restoring China and defending East Asia. (8) To quickly achieve the purpose of restoring China and defending East Asia, it is necessary to practice the New National Movement. I am willing to take the New National Movement Outline as the only way to restore governance and rule the people. At the same time, I hope that all compatriots in the province will deeply understand the New National Movement Outline and practice it in their own lives. As weapons, we are willing to work hard to promote them and implement them in an orderly manner. In short, we should all be loyal and diligent under the leadership of the highest leader and chairman in all matters that benefit the country and the people.

Main points of Governor Deng's address to the public celebration meeting: At the public celebration meeting, Governor Deng gave a sincere address, using the three points of realizing comprehensive peace, cooperating in the Greater East Asia War, and implementing the New National Movement to encourage the public to restore China and defend East Asia.

### East Asia Broadcasting Liaison Conference; Minister Lin Xuan Attends and Addresses the Meeting; All Delegates to Travel to Shanghai to Continue the Conference

It is also reported that after the two-day session in Nanjing, the delegates will travel to Shanghai to continue the meeting for two days on the 21st and 22nd. The full text of Minister Lin's speech on the 18th is recorded below:

Minister Lin's Speech

Fellow Delegates: The East Asia Broadcasting Liaison Conference is holding its second meeting today. The front-line fighters of the entire East Asia ideological war, having traveled great distances from Japan, Manchukuo, and various parts of North and South China, have gathered in our nation's capital, Nanjing. There are a total of 35 units of propaganda and broadcasting organizations participating in this conference, with more than 70 delegates in attendance. Today, we see among you, delegates, a spirit of sincere unity within a serious attitude. Standing on the overall position of defending East Asia, you are expressing your sincerity and reviewing the future broadcasting strategies. I believe that this will have a great impact on the final victory of the entire war and the steady progress of the new post-war order, which has already filled my heart with infinite excitement. Thinking that during the continuation of the Greater East Asia War, which is also during the unfolding of Greater East Asia construction, our friendly nations are not only constantly striving to obtain glorious war results, but also placing great expectations on the National Government and providing great assistance, for which I cannot help but express my deepest gratitude. Broadcasting is extremely important in ideological construction in peacetime, and it is even more important in wartime. The popularization of the meaning of the war, the raising of war emotions, and the reporting of the war situation all require the use of radio waves to convey all of this to achieve the final goal of the war. In the propaganda policy of each country, broadcasting must be placed in the most important link. Among national groups, in terms of cooperation in the war, it is even more necessary to cooperate closely with a consistent spirit to form a radio wave defense line for protecting the national group. How can we establish close connections with each other, and how can we consolidate this radio wave front? This is the greatest significance of holding today's Broadcasting Liaison Conference, which must be discussed sincerely. In our discussions and liaison, we need to pay special attention not only to technical aspects, but also to reaching a consensus on the content of the broadcasts. In my personal opinion, in order to achieve the above-mentioned goals and to pay attention to the effectiveness of the broadcasts, it seems that we should tailor the content of the programs to the needs of each environment, adapt to the psychology of the general public, and start with the interests of broadcasting in order to win over the majority of listeners and receive our propaganda. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, we have already known that this is a war of liberation for the East Asian peoples. Each East Asian country must contribute all its human and material resources and fulfill its due responsibilities for its own survival, because modern warfare is a war of total strength. In addition to having the necessary military strength, we must also have the spirit of the entire nation as the greatest guarantee for the victory of the war. In the future, East Asian broadcasting should focus on this point, striving to awaken East Asian national consciousness and mobilize the East Asian national spirit together and constantly. This is the second important significance of this conference. Recently, the Chinese side, through the Supreme National Defense Council, promulgated the Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy by the National Government, which determines the entire direction of Chinese wartime culture, and the strengthening of the broadcasting industry also occupies a very important part under this fundamental policy outline. In the future, the Chinese broadcasting industry will naturally advance according to the instructions of this basic policy outline. It is hoped that propaganda workers and broadcasting workers from friendly nations will constantly assist in this ideological war program and its development, so that the construction of China's new cultural propaganda industry can be completed quickly. I sincerely wish you all good health and unlimited future, and I wish the East Asian broadcasting industry an unlimited future.

### Pang Bingxun Announces His Participation in the Peace Movement

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A Central News Agency reporter visited General Gong Bingxun yesterday to inquire about his impressions of this trip to Nanjing. He graciously gave the following statement: I am willing to express with twelve points of enthusiasm my experience and feelings about participating in this peace movement. I have devoted myself to the Party and the country and have been in the military for more than twenty years. I only know the country and do not know the individual. I will spare no sacrifice as long as it benefits the motherland. After the July 7th Incident, I believed that the country could not be saved without resistance, so I fought in Cangzhou, Taierzhuang, eastern Henan, and southern Shanxi battlefields, in hundreds of battles, both large and small. In 1940, I was ordered to cross north and suppress the Communists. I struggled for three and a half years in the Taihang Mountains in a difficult environment without food or ammunition. The situation in which the loyal comrades I led fought against the communist bandits was extremely tragic, which is well known to the people of the country. In 1942 alone, there were as many as thirty-one senior cadres killed by the communist bandits in Hebei Province. The Communist Party is an internal threat to China and a disaster to East Asia. Britain and the United States are the common enemies of China and Japan and the common enemies of the new order. Therefore, I advocate internal pacification and external resistance, as this is the only way for China and East Asia to save themselves. Therefore, China and Japan must cooperate closely and share weal and woe, resist Britain and the United States externally, and eliminate the communist bandits internally, otherwise the future is unimaginable. Since the National Government returned to its capital, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, all constructions have presented a vigorous and new national atmosphere. The positive assistance of friendly nations to the National Government, such as the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions, is clear evidence of sincerity and facts. I have since determined that peace is the only way to save the country, so I am determined to make the greatest effort for peace and the suppression of the Communists. I was greatly encouraged after visiting Chairman Wang and receiving instructions, and I can only pledge allegiance and contribute everything to the motherland. However, my ability is limited, and I am afraid that I will fail to meet the ardent expectations of my compatriots. I hope that comrades from all walks of life will give me more guidance. I am deeply uneasy about the kind reception I received from various leaders, friends, and journalists when I came to Nanjing, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude.

### The Japanese Expeditionary Force Announces the War Situation for One Week

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced the war situation for the week on the 18th as follows: The Japanese army's summer offensive has achieved great results. After achieving its goals, it continued to implement a reversal operation to destroy the Chongqing side's magnetic tactics. The Chongqing side judged that the Japanese army's operation was an offensive into the Chongqing side's hinterland, so it felt quite distressed; however, unexpectedly, the Japanese army suddenly reversed, and thus became active again. It seems that it is now working hard to exaggerate its propaganda. However, according to the Chongqing side's broadcast on the 7th of this month, it was said that the Chongqing army felt the inferiority of its quality in this operation. Also, according to those who recently returned from the Chongqing side's hinterland, the Sichuan army in the hinterland is extremely dissatisfied because various treatments are worse than the central army, and an unstable phenomenon has appeared. Also, a part of the Sichuan system (50th) army in Zhejiang Province has also been shaken due to the same situation. It is said that the Chongqing side is mistreating and discriminating against these local armies and oppressing them. Now, the unstable conditions in various places are emerging one after another, which may affect Jiang's leadership.

Hankou, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the start of the Japanese army's summer offensive operation, the Chongqing Fifth War Zone wanted to contain the Japanese army's offensive from the side, so the Chongqing army's 22nd Army Group (the 3rd Division) invaded the vicinity north of Wangcheng. After learning of this, the Japanese army immediately launched an attack at dawn on the 2nd, inflicting heavy damage on the Chongqing army, and then reversed to its original location. When the Chongqing army took another stupid move, the Japanese army started to move again on the 13th, and completed the encirclement net at Renhedian on the afternoon of the 14th, crushing the main force of the Chongqing army's one division. In this battle, the Chongqing army lost 856 dead and 857 captured, and seized 3 mortars and 8 heavy and light machine guns.

### General Situation of the Recent Progress of the National Youth Movement

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the third anniversary of the National Government's return to its capital, the National Government formed the China Youth League and the China Youth Model League respectively. The China Youth Movement has joined forces with the youth leagues of Japan and Manchukuo to actively prepare for a surprise attack in order to strive to complete the war to liberate East Asia. On New Year's Day last year, Chairman Wang instructed the people of the country that the government was determined to work hard to ensure public security and improve people's livelihood, and at the same time hoped that the people would rise up and work together to complete the Greater East Asia War and promote the New National Movement. Subsequently, in mid-June last year, the New National Movement Promotion Committee was officially established. Under the personal leadership of Chairman Wang, it has been actively active, and the spirit of unity among the people has become increasingly high. At the same time, the people's determination to complete the war has also been strengthened. At that time, Chairman Wang deeply felt that the rapid and strong progress of the New National Movement depended on the young people who are the masters of the new China. Therefore, he changed his past laissez-faire attitude towards the youth movement and placed the China Youth League and the China Boy Scouts directly under the New National Movement Promotion Committee, and reorganized them to strengthen their lineup. On January 9th of this year, when the National Government resolutely rose up to participate in the war, it felt that promoting the New Movement was an urgent task. Therefore, after participating in the war, it immediately established the Central Youth Cadre School in Nanjing to train leaders for young people. In order to merge the China Youth League and the Boy Scouts to enhance the consolidated unity and promotion, it was decided to organize the China Youth League with the students of various schools as the main body, and to organize the China Youth Model League with hard-working young people as the center, as a group to practice the New Movement. After this policy was decided, 5,248 elementary schools, 345 middle schools, 19 normal schools, 4 universities, and 5 independent colleges in various places immediately mobilized the students to form youth teams or juvenile teams. On March 30th, the third anniversary of the National Government's return to its capital, 15,000 outstanding youth representatives from all over the country gathered at the Xiaoying Training Ground in Nanjing to hold the founding ceremony of the China Youth League and the China Youth Model League, and Chairman Wang awarded the league flags separately. On the same day, youth representatives from Japan and Manchukuo also participated in the grand ceremony. At this point, the China Youth Movement launched a groundbreaking activity under the new organization. Subsequently, Chairman Wang personally attended the first general review after the establishment of the Youth League. That night, youth representatives from China, Japan, and Manchukuo held a conference to decide to form the East Asia Youth League with the youth leagues of the three countries as the main body, so that the youth leagues of all East Asia would become one. The National Government also set May 5th as Youth Day to launch the Youth Movement to awaken the youth of the country. On this day, the National Youth League held sports meets in various places, showing the vigorous spirit of the Chinese youth everywhere. The spirit of all the youth in the new China was thus uplifted, and they are now, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, marching forward in an orderly manner and unanimously towards the road of completing the liberation of East Asia and defeating Britain and the United States.

### Indian Leader Bose Arrives in Tokyo; Asks Japan for Cooperation in Liberating India; Firmly Believes Indian People Will Resort to Armed Resistance When Necessary; Expresses Gratitude to Prime Minister Tojo for Concern About Indian Independence

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Indian independence movement leader Chandra Bose met with the press corps at the Imperial Hotel here at 2:00 p.m. on the 19th and issued a statement explaining the purpose of his visit to Japan and his belief in seeking Indian independence. He also answered various questions raised by the press corps. Bose has decided to deliver enthusiastic radio speeches to the 400 million people of India and Germany. He is scheduled to broadcast to India in English, Hindi, and Bengali on the 21st, and to Germany in Hindi and German on the 22nd. On the 23rd, he will give a speech entitled "Motherland India" at the Japan Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society, asking the Japanese political community to understand and cooperate in the Indian liberation movement.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The main points of the question-and-answer session between Chandra Bose and the press corps are as follows: (Q) What are the strategies for Indian independence? (A) Although there are strategies, I cannot say for sure at this time. The Indian people will never adopt a non-resistance policy forever. I firmly believe that they will resort to armed resistance when necessary. Indians residing abroad will maintain strong organizations to assist organizations within India. (Q) Does India need foreign assistance to achieve independence? (A) Given Britain's strength and the collusion of the United States, and Churchill's repeated requests for assistance from Roosevelt, it is natural for India to accept external assistance in order to seek independence. (Q) How will Myanmar's independence affect India? (A) Myanmar's independence has had a tremendous impact on India. I firmly believe that this is at least the most effective answer to the anti-Axis propaganda strategy towards India. (Q) What is the motive for this visit to Japan? (A) I believe that strengthening various independent movements outside of India is necessary for the internal independent movement of India to proceed rapidly. Although I am incapable, I am willing to do my best. (Q) What is your impression of the meeting with Prime Minister Tojo? (A) Prime Minister Tojo is extremely concerned about Indian independence and is determined to provide the greatest assistance possible within his means, for which I am extremely grateful. (Q) How will the state of Indian independence be formed? (A) This will all be achieved through India's own efforts and sacrifices. The Indian people are launching a struggle with power from the bottom of their hearts, and I am extremely optimistic about this. Regarding the people, my personal feeling is that they are determined to push the independent movement to the end, and the power of the current military action will inevitably be extremely strong.

Manila, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Salini, the leader of the Manila Indian Independence League, was extremely pleased to hear of Chandra Bose's arrival in Japan and issued a statement saying in essence that Chandra Bose's trip to Japan was a great blow to Britain, but on the contrary, it was a great boon to the Indian people fighting for independence. The fact that he arrived in Japan under the reverence and anticipation of the entire Indian nation is not only exciting to the Indians in East Asia, but also to the Indians living around the world. He can be said to be the only successor to Gandhi. His return to East Asia will make the Indians who are fighting for liberation under the tyrannical politics of Britain redouble their efforts. Moreover, he was born in Bengal, the birthplace of the Indian independence movement, so this trip will make the Indians in Bengal even more confident of gaining freedom. It is expected that the day when India gains independence is only a matter of time.

Yangon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After learning that Chandra Bose had arrived in Japan, the Myanmar Regional Committee of the Indian Independence League immediately convened a cadre meeting and unanimously adopted a telegram of congratulations, the text of which is as follows: The Indians stationed in Myanmar, having learned that you have arrived safely in Japan, are delighted and eagerly hope to strive for the great goal of liberating India under your leadership.

### Biography of Indian Leader Bose

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – A brief biography of Jiantela Bose, a major figure in the Indian independence movement, is as follows: Born near Calcutta in 1897, he studied at Cambridge University in 1920. After graduating from Cambridge, he participated in Gandhi's non-cooperation movement and returned to his country, where he was elected as a member of the executive committee of the National Congress Party. In 1923, he formed a radical faction within the National Congress Party, and in 1924, he served as the president of the Calcutta Municipal Council. In 1927, he was arrested and detained in Varanasi, but was released due to illness. In 1930, he served as the Mayor of Calcutta. In 1931, while still serving as mayor, he was severely injured and arrested and imprisoned for leading a parade and being beaten by police. In 1933, he was released once, but soon arrested again. At this time, public demonstrations gradually intensified. In 1933, he was released again on the condition of traveling abroad and went to Vienna. In 1936, disregarding government warnings, he returned to his country and was immediately arrested upon arriving in Mumbai. In 1937, while still in custody, he was released again due to illness. In the following two months, he traveled to Europe for a short period, proving that the British government's policy toward India had not changed. In 1938, he was elected as the president of the Indian National Congress Party. In 1939, due to popular support, he was re-elected as president, but was forced to resign due to attacks from within the Congress Party. After that, he formed the Forward Bloc within the Congress Party, declaring opposition to compromise with the British and preparing for armed resistance. In April 1940, he led the Forward Bloc to begin a non-cooperation movement, and was arrested in July. While in prison, he was elected as a member of the Central Legislative Assembly. In 1941, he went on a hunger strike to demand his release and was soon released. On January 26 of the same year, he was reported missing. In 1942, after Singapore was captured by the Japanese army, he suddenly broadcast a radio message to the Indian people in secret, saying that he had now joined forces with Japan and the Axis powers to overthrow the British and achieve complete independence.

### German Foreign Minister Sends Congratulations to Bose

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop issued the following telegram to Jiantela Bose, who is currently staying in Japan: I am pleased to hear of your arrival in Japan. When you left Germany, you sent sincere telegrams to President Hitler and myself. I am grateful for your belief in vowing to cooperate with Germany and advance towards fighting our common enemy. We are even more convinced that you will continue to strive for the liberation of the Indian people and believe that you will surely succeed.

### London Officially Appoints Wavell as Viceroy of India, General Auchinleck Succeeds Him as Commander-in-Chief of India

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) – Last night, London officially announced that General Sir Archibald Wavell has been appointed as the Viceroy of India, succeeding Lord Linlithgow. General Auchinleck will succeed Wavell as Commander-in-Chief of India. The issue that has been discussed by the British public and government officials for over a year has finally been resolved. The current Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, took office in April 1936 and was originally scheduled to complete his term in 1940. However, in view of the outbreak of war and the tense situation in India, his term was repeatedly extended until now. Linlithgow's administration in India has been subject to strict criticism, especially the criticism in the House of Commons this year, accusing him of being incapable of promoting understanding between the Indian government and the Indian people. When Sir Stafford Cripps held negotiations with the leaders of the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League, Linlithgow's attitude was also severely criticized by London. In fact, Linlithgow's most staunch opponents were the prominent leaders of the Congress Party. As for Auchinleck's succession to Wavell in commanding the Indian anti-Axis forces, according to London's explanation, it is merely the restoration of a dismissed general's position, because in August last year, British Prime Minister Churchill blamed Auchinleck for the defeat at Srinagar and removed him from his position as Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East. The date of Wavell's inauguration has not yet been announced. This appointment does not surprise Londoners, as rumors of Wavell being appointed as the Viceroy of India have been widespread for a long time.

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) – Last night, London officially announced that the newly appointed Viceroy of India, Wavell, is currently in Britain and will return to India this autumn to take office. General Auchinleck will immediately succeed him as the Commander-in-Chief of India. According to further news from London, the British authorities announced yesterday that Britain will establish an independent military command in East Asia for the specific purpose of conducting war against Japan. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of India, Auchinleck, will be relieved of his responsibility for the war against Japan.

### British King Travels from North Africa to Gibraltar for Inspection

Madrid, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Larini, the British King has arrived in Gibraltar by plane from North Africa. Governor and Commander-in-Chief General MacFarlane and others all arrived to greet him. After the British King arrived, he immediately began to inspect the fortresses and the garrisons of the soldiers. The British King conducted a thorough inspection with strict security. It is expected that the British King will return to Britain directly from Gibraltar.

Madrid, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Reuters citing Agence Havas, British rescue ship No. 6 arrived in Gibraltar yesterday morning. At the same time, two Swedish cargo ships from the Atlantic Ocean anchored there. In addition, the port currently has two British aircraft carriers, two British battleships, twelve British destroyers, and three American destroyers, all of the latest models. Two British transport ships, which appear to be heading to North Africa, are also currently docked in the port. Yesterday morning, a plane of unknown nationality flew over the port of Gibraltar from south to north. Anti-aircraft guns on the shore and warships immediately fired at it, but missed. The plane soon escaped. Several British fighter planes also took off in pursuit, but soon returned without finding any trace of the foreign plane.

Madrid, 19th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency Larini reported that British King George VI, accompanied by British Secretary of State for War Sir Grigge, inspected the fortresses of Gibraltar and reviewed the exercises yesterday afternoon and has departed from Gibraltar.

### Relations Between de Gaulle and Giraud Not Yet Perfect

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, the political situation in Algiers has not been resolved as reported by Reuters. On the contrary, since the French National Liberation Committee of de Gaulle and Giraud held its first meeting, the situation seems to be more complicated than before. Local French people claim that conspirators are still active behind the scenes, so the dangerous environment has not yet disappeared. It is reported that a "Center Party" will be established there. United Press International said that its task is to serve as an intermediary between de Gaulle and Giraud. The preliminary work for its establishment has already begun at the first meeting of the Liberation Committee yesterday. It is said that Jardel, Monet, and Massigli, who can influence the policies of de Gaulle and Giraud, will be the backbone of the party. It is expected that most members of the Liberation Committee, regardless of their personal relationship with de Gaulle and Giraud, will belong to the party. It is also learned that the Liberation Committee is scheduled to hold another meeting today to discuss the issue of reorganizing the French army based on democratic principles.

### German-Turkish Friendship Treaty

Istanbul, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency, Ankara Radio's broadcast on the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty stated that the friendship between Germany and Turkey is based on a long-standing tradition. Germany helped Turkey after the Balkan War, so this friendship treaty that meets the needs of both parties was established.

### Overview of Japan's Wooden Shipbuilding Industry

The enthusiasm for wooden shipbuilding since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War has been like wildfire, but the general public may not fully realize the ultra-importance of wooden ships at present. There are still many people in the world who think that building wooden ships is of no use. Compared with steel ships, wooden ships are indeed weak and old, and it is not without reason that people arbitrarily despise them. In fact, when the two are compared, wooden ships are ultimately inferior to steel ships in terms of speed, carrying capacity, durability, and seaworthiness.

Needless to say, the current wooden shipbuilding problem, from the perspective of efficiency and economy, is obviously not the focus. However, the wooden ship problem does have the significance of saving iron materials. In this regard, wooden ships and steel ships can be given equal value. Moreover, if the construction of small steel ships is abolished and the steel materials are used for building large wooden-steel hybrid ships, it is beneficial to the national policy.

The steel materials used to build wooden ships are less than one-third of those used to build steel ships, so the steel used to build one steel ship can be used to build three wooden-steel hybrid ships of the same tonnage. In any case, the current ultra-importance of wooden ships has the above-mentioned positive significance.

Therefore, the authorities are naturally making great efforts to build this type of wooden ship with a major mission. The government first divided the wartime standard types of wooden ships from 70 tons to 300 tons into six types. After that, in order to accelerate the construction, it limited them to three types: 250-ton type, 150-ton type, and 100-ton type. At the same time, in order to save materials, eliminate skill requirements, and simplify production, it started to design the hull using a box-shaped design. Thus, efficiency has also been achieved, and the relationship between small 100-ton-class coastal vessels is also sufficient to a certain extent, guiding them to build as many large 250-ton-class wooden ships as possible. Not only that, but recently, wooden-steel hybrid ships of 300 tons and 500 tons are being tested.

At the same time, the control of the wooden shipbuilding industry is also progressing steadily. Terajima, the Minister of Communications, said the most important thing at the 81st Diet session regarding this point:

"Although there are thousands of wooden shipyards across the country, they are all small in scale, and very few employ more than 100 workers. Most only have less than 10 workers. The Ministry of Communications intends to integrate these thousands of shipyards into hundreds of shipyards. Also, when building standard ships, each individual shipyard is too small, so it will gather separate combinations to establish a national federation, place it under unified management, and make this National Wooden Shipbuilding Federation a member of the Shipbuilding Federation, participating in shipbuilding plans."

According to the explanation of the Minister of Communications, the scale of wooden shipbuilding was extremely fragmented and small in the past, and it is quite difficult to bring them together and make them highly productive. This is also the case with engine parts produced in many town factories. The government is advising the field of wooden shipbuilding to adopt a large-scale approach. Responding to the government, many powerful enterprises and companies, such as Nippon Yusen, Osaka Shosen, Yamashita Kisen, Mitsui Bussan, Kawasaki Kisen, Kuribayashi Shosen, Hakodate Dock, Oji Paper, and Panasonic Electric, have newly established wooden shipbuilding companies. Below are a few of the newly established large-scale companies:

Mitsui Bussan Co., Ltd. established the affiliated Mitsui Wooden Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (capital of 10 million yen), with a total of nine yards in Iwate Prefecture, Mie Prefecture, Kagawa Prefecture, Shimane Prefecture, Aomori Prefecture, Oita Prefecture, Tottori Prefecture, etc. Nippon Yusen Co., Ltd. has jointly established Ariake Shipbuilding, Kaisen Shipbuilding, Chugoku Shipbuilding, and Nankai Shipbuilding with local operators in Wakayama, Kagoshima, Oita, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Tokushima, and other six prefectures. Kuribayashi Shosen Co., Ltd. has jointly established East Japan Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (capital of 10 million yen) with Oji Paper Co., Ltd. and Hakodate Dock Co., Ltd., and is building a factory in Kushiro City. Osaka Shosen Co., Ltd. has separately established Hōkoku Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (capital of 5 million yen) and is engaged in construction in Ishikawa Prefecture. Yamashita Kisen Co., Ltd. has newly established K.K. Kudamatsu Shipyard (capital of 5 million yen) in Yamaguchi Prefecture, and Kawasaki Kisen Co., Ltd. has newly established Miyagi Wooden Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (capital of 10 million yen). Furthermore, Panasonic Electric Co., Ltd., which was originally an electrical appliance company, has also established Panasonic Shipyard (10 million yen) and is building factories in Akita and Osaka, which is quite noteworthy.

According to this large-scale progress, Japan's most urgent mass production of large wooden ships and wooden-steel hybrid ships will be realized in the future. At the same time, the adoption of this new method will also provide fresh stimulation to the above-mentioned small and medium-sized enterprises' stubborn and outdated methods. Large enterprises, especially zaibatsu, do not contribute much to their shipbuilding departments in terms of enterprise by building wooden ships. However, the active participation of powerful people is very necessary at this time, and it is a unique wartime color that has never been seen in the Japanese shipbuilding industry in the past, which is quite interesting.

### Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare Discusses "Thrift" and "Disaster Relief," Expresses Support for This Newspaper's Frugal Banquet Covenant

(Central News Agency) Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare has arrived in Shanghai. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially went to interview him. Yang talked about frugality and disaster relief. Minister Ding's speech is as follows:

"I have always advocated thrift, because thrift is frugality, and frugality is a virtue. So-called frugality to cultivate virtue, I advocate that not only should we be frugal in terms of material things, but also in terms of time, energy, and desires and fame and wealth. We should be frugal not only in times of war when there is a shortage of material things, but also in peacetime. Not only should the general public be frugal, but especially public officials should be frugal. The so-called honest and upright customs are all cultivated by frugality. The ancient Chinese all had a frugal style. There is no need to cite distant examples. Even Zeng Wenzhenggong, a modern person familiar to everyone, attached great importance to frugality and practiced it himself. He said, 'If the official kitchen has one less pair of chopsticks, the people will have one more point of strength.' This proves that officials who can be frugal can pacify the people. He also said, 'If you want to learn honesty and integrity, you must first know contentment. Seeing the famine victims everywhere, we should feel fortunate to live in peace and have good food. Why should we be extravagant? Why should we waste?' These words are in line with what Mr. Zhou Fohai recently said in his 'Miscellaneous Feelings on Four Visits to Beiping': 'The food problem in North China is very serious. I often think that I have no special enjoyment, but I eat three meals a day and sleep on a bed at night. Now that I think about it, I am already blessed by God. Having three meals a day means I don't have to eat grass roots and tree leaves. Having a bed to sleep on at night means I don't have to sleep on cement. Isn't this special enjoyment? In special enjoyment, we must never forget the suffering of the people.' The above is worth everyone's special vigilance. Therefore, I personally attach great importance to frugality and often use it to encourage myself and my colleagues."

"There are many ways to practice thrift. I always think that the most important thing is for everyone to first cultivate a spirit of thrift. I very much agree with the many opinions put forward in the Shen Bao recently, especially the method of the covenant to save banquet expenses. It is even more necessary. People like Li Zanhhou, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, and Tang Shoumin have all participated. I think it will definitely be widely promoted. Chairman Wang has already implemented simple banquets and prohibited public officials from entertaining guests with public funds. When I personally entertain guests, most of the food is cooked by the family cook, and there are very few dishes. Everything is simple and crude." "According to the general phenomenon now, on the part of the host, it is considered that rich dishes and grand banquets are not enough to express sincerity, and some vulgar people also regard rich dishes and grand banquets as 'showing off'. This kind of mentality is really not very clever and should be changed urgently. We must cultivate a new spirit of 'taking simplicity and frugality as honor and extravagance and waste as shame'. If everyone does this, it can be popularized over time." Speaking of this, I want to cite Zeng Wenzhenggong as an example again. He said, "Those who are greedy cannot be frugal, and those who are restless cannot be frugal. Greed such as good clothes, good food, good sounds, good colors, calligraphy, paintings, antiques, etc., can all waste the family." But Wenzhenggong himself said that he has never had any hobbies, but he has the drawback of being restless. Today he thinks of doing something, and tomorrow he thinks of visiting a guest, so the expenses increase day by day without realizing it. Later, he emphasized thrift and frugality, and warned himself to not be restless and not go out easily, not start things easily, and not only not do useless things, but also not easily take action to repair bridges, roads, temples, Taoist temples, and charities. Secondly, he said, "Servants should be few, so that those who eat will be few. Affection should be reduced, so that those who use will be comfortable. Otherwise, if we are not frugal today, we will inevitably owe more debts in the future. We will not only owe debts to friends, but also leave debts to our children and grandchildren." Therefore, if we can get rid of greed and restlessness, we can practice simplicity."

Finally, regarding disaster relief, Mr. Ding also put forward his opinions, saying,

"This time, all sectors of Shanghai have been very enthusiastic about donating to the disaster relief in North China, which is really admirable. I hope that the wealthy people in Shanghai will contribute more generously, but those who are too busy to make a profit can not be forced to do so. Secondly, I hope that the wealthy people will participate in the thrift movement, reduce all daily waste, and accumulate little by little to make a huge drink to help disaster relief, which is a win-win situation."

### Price of Household Rice Rises, Two Liters of Rice Now Sold for Nine Yuan

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Notice No. 6393, stating that Rice and Flour Certificate No. 38 will be valid until the 19th of this month and will be invalid after the expiration date. From the 22nd to the 29th of this month, rice shops and the Council's rice sales offices will only sell rice and flour upon presentation of Rice and Flour Certificate No. 39. At that time, rice shops with registered numbers on the certificates will sell one and a half liters of white rice or half-coarse rice, plus half a liter of broken rice or brown rice (totaling two liters), for nine yuan per rice certificate. In addition, twelve taels of No. 2 flour and four taels of No. 3 flour will be sold for four yuan and eight jiao per flour certificate. Furthermore, rice shops and the Council's rice sales offices will be temporarily closed for two days on the 21st and 30th of this month.

### Record of Donations for Longevity Celebrations

Today is the eightieth birthday of Mr. Gao Hanqing. Mr. Gao is a firm believer in Christian doctrines. His accomplishments in life are too numerous to recount. He has lived in Hongkou for generations, and his family was poor. In his childhood, he experienced many hardships. At the age of eleven, he entered the Qingxin Free School in Nanmen, studying while working part-time, focusing on the art of printing. This later became the foundation for his dedication to society and the promotion of Chinese culture. After reaching adulthood, he left school and joined the Meihua Library, where he was in charge of printing. At the age of thirty-four, he co-founded the Commercial Press with Mr. Xia Cuifang, Mr. Bao Xian'en, Mr. Bao Xianchang, and others, serving as General Manager and Supervisor. He still serves as a director today. The starting point of the library was minimal, but with the help of Mr. Zhang Jusheng, Mr. Gao Mengdan, Mr. Li Bake, and others, it developed rapidly. In over forty years, it has become a leading publishing house in the country, occupying an important page in the modern cultural history of China. In 1932, Mr. Xiang Songmao of Wuzhou Pharmacy met with misfortune. Mr. Gao, remembering his old friend, strongly supported Mr. Xiang's son in continuing the old business, serving as Managing Director of the pharmacy. He personally went to work every day, not deterred by his old age. On Fuzhou Road, one could often see the old man walking slowly and leisurely. Mr. Gao is kind-hearted and determined to help orphans and the poor. Therefore, forty years ago, he co-founded the Shanghai Orphanage with Mr. Li Pingshu and Mr. Shen Manyun. Before the Incident, there were more than seven hundred male and female students, occupying more than one hundred acres of land. The talents cultivated in the orphanage are all able to support themselves in society, achieving remarkable results. Today marks Mr. Gao's eightieth birthday. Considering the chaos of the world, he does not wish to celebrate his birthday. His friends jointly initiated a public celebration at 2:00 PM today on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Mr. Gao, being humble, will not accept any gifts and has donated 10,000 yuan to help the disaster victims in the North, which has been sent to the Chinese Christian Association, transferred to the Xinhua Bank for collection. All congratulatory gifts from various circles will also be donated to disaster relief, using the funds for birthday wishes for disaster relief. This is truly a beautiful act of extending longevity to others. It is expected that those who participate in the public celebration will witness a grand occasion.

### Yoshida Toyu's Lecture Yesterday: The Possibility of Resolving the Sino-Japanese Incident

Yesterday (the 19th) at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai Chinese Construction Youth Corps held a symposium on Sino-Japanese issues at the KangLe Hotel. They invited Mr. Yoshida Toyu, a Japanese scholar who has studied Sino-Japanese issues for a long time, to give a lecture on "The Possibility of Resolving the Sino-Japanese Incident." More than fifty people attended, including team members, university students, and guests. Team leader Zhou Paigan presided over the meeting, reporting on the significance of holding the symposium and introducing Mr. Yoshida's lecture.

Summary of the Speech

The main points of Yoshida's speech were: "The famous journalist John Gunther once said in his book 'Inside Asia' that there is no possibility of resolving the Sino-Japanese issue. His reasons are threefold: (1) Japan has a desire to expand its territory, (2) China is unable to drive out the Japanese army, and (3) Japan has many conflicts with European countries. Therefore, he concluded that 'China and Japan will form a permanent war front.' Judging from the current situation, Gunther's words have unfortunately come true. Soldiers of both countries share regrets. During 1936, the 'anti-Japanese' sentiment in China was激昂. The Shanghai National Salvation Association factions, the Communist Party, and the United States and Britain further instigated the Sino-Japanese Incident. At that time, all factions, under the banner of 'unity,' could not oppose Chiang to seek personal benefits. They could only use the name of resisting Japan to attempt to oppose Chiang. The Chiang government could not control the public sentiment for a time, and was unwilling to sacrifice political power. Therefore, it rashly clashed with Japan without considering the consequences. Later, after the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai, the Chiang regime was stationed in Wuhan and had realized that China and Japan should not have a long war. They attempted to find a resolution and organized the Three Principles of the People Youth League, thinking of leading the people towards resolving the incident. The reason why a comprehensive peace between China and Japan has not been achieved to this day is actually due to the obstruction of the United States and Britain and the provocation of the Communist Party. On December 8 of the year, the Greater East Asia War broke out. Japan repeatedly declared its true intentions towards China, and at the same time implemented the abandonment of various rights and interests it had obtained in China, hoping that China and Japan could truly cooperate to defeat the United States and Britain. This measure is now gradually attracting the attention of various parties under the rule of the Chiang regime. Based on this, the possibility of a comprehensive resolution of the Sino-Japanese Incident is no longer remote. Yoshida also solemnly stated that the core of resolving the Sino-Japanese Incident lies in whether the people of the two countries can fully understand each other. If the ideas and intentions of the people of the two countries are inconsistent, even if the Chongqing government can accept the Japanese side's sincerity in cooperation, future conflicts will still be difficult to eliminate. Conversely, if the people of the two countries can be truly friendly, even if the Chongqing government and the United States and Britain and the Communist Party obstruct them, a comprehensive resolution is still very possible. Therefore, our efforts to resolve the incident should proceed rapidly along this path, so that peace in East Asia can reach a permanent and satisfactory state." The lecture lasted for an hour, and the audience was very moved.

Many students who attended raised various questions, and Mr. Yoshida answered them in detail until the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

Economic Circle

### This Newspaper's Economic Circle Symposium

Date: June 19th, 4:00 PM

Location: KangLe Hotel, Jing'an Temple Road

Attendees: From the Commercial Control Association:

Zhang Peishen (Secretary General of the National Commercial Control Association)

Luo Nazhai (Director of the Materials Department of the Commercial Control Association)

Wu Huanru (Secretary of the Commercial Control Association)

Yu Langxi (Secretary of the Commercial Control Association)

From This Newspaper's Economic Circle:

Li Quan, Shi Pan Yang, Yao Liu Yunfang

Scope of Discussion:

The National Commercial Control Association is the only organization for economic collective autonomy. Until recently, its internal structure was finally completed. However, since the public still does not fully understand the various connections within the internal structure of the Commercial Control Association, as well as the actual situation in the implementation of controlled economic work, what methods should be adopted to ensure that all the contents of the Commercial Control Association are made public?

Decided Methods:

(1) Regarding special reporting value for control work, such as the recent "Wheat Unified Purchase" issue, this newspaper's economic circle will propose an interview, and the Commercial Control Association will be responsible for explaining. (2) Regarding issues such as the Federation of Industry and Commerce Guilds, this newspaper's economic circle will invite responsible persons from various federations to participate in the symposium at any time, and responsible persons from the Commercial Control Association will attend at the same time. (3) Regarding general information on the Commercial Control Association's control work, the Commercial Control Association will issue an irregular publication in the near future, but before each issue, it may first choose to allow this newspaper's economic circle to preview and disclose it.

The above three methods are aimed at showing that all work on the side of the Commercial Control Association is absolutely public. Because the Commercial Control Association, under the supervision and guidance of the government, must strive to complete its collective autonomy mechanism and allow the mother period to be contrary to the spirit of its collective autonomy.

This new trade organization includes authoritative figures from the Japanese business community in the Central China region. The work in the future lies in the official guidance.

### Rice and Grain Cooperative Association's Directors and Supervisors Took Office Yesterday; First Handle Rice and Grain Transportation and Distribution

Since the Shanghai District Rice and Grain Cooperative Association was established on the 2nd of this month, the list of directors and supervisors has been submitted to the Flour and Food Department for approval. It has now been approved by the Ministry. There are seven directors and three supervisors. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the elected directors and supervisors held a swearing-in ceremony on the sixth floor of the Pudong Building. The first batch of directors were elected by the Food Department yesterday - Wen Shao, (also Chairman of the Board) Shen Linqing, Chen Shaolian, Huang Zhihe, Xia Tongfu, Yan Jiyun, Gong Mansong. Supervisors Zhu Zhaoqi, Huang Ruyuan, Gu Yisheng. Senior officials present included Director Ji Hua of the Food Department's Shanghai Office, Grain Bureau Representative Wang Daoming, and more than one hundred industry representatives. Director Ji said in his speech, "The directors and supervisors of the Rice and Grain Cooperative Association have now taken office, but when it can start working has not yet been determined. Only after sufficient preparation for the transportation, distribution, people and goods can the Ministry entrust you to start work. At that time, the Central China Rice and Grain Distribution Office will naturally be relieved of its responsibility. The main task of the cooperative association is to prevent speculation, manipulation, and hoarding. In the future, all grain merchants who do not join the cooperative association will not be allowed to participate in buying and selling rice and grain. In other aspects of handling, the cooperative association must also assist in handling with the local administrative organs. As for the relationship between the office and the cooperative association, it is nothing more than (1) guidance (2) supervision (3) assistance (4) support, etc."

### Various Bank Loans to Purchase Wheat for Centralized Distribution

In order to centralize wheat procurement and improve wheat purchase performance, the National Commercial Control Association has formulated ten articles of the Interim Plan for Unified Wheat Purchase. From now on, the Yam Powder Wheat Professional Committee will intensify its efforts in accordance with the established plan and purchase a large amount of wheat from various parts of Central China.

Unified Purchase of Bumper Wheat Harvest

The wheat in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has already entered the market this year, and all have reported bumper harvests. China's Communications, Jiaotong, Jin Cheng, Shanghai Zhongfu, Continental, and Zhejiang Xing banks have lent huge amounts of money. The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has designated areas and sent personnel to various producing areas such as northern Jiangsu, Xuzhou, Wuhu, eastern Zhejiang, and along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, to purchase a large amount of wheat uniformly, and then distribute it centrally. It is expected that the results will be excellent.

Flour Mills in Various Places Will Soon Start Work

It is reported that flour mills in Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou and other regions, such as Fuxin, Fufeng, Sanxing, Dongfu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Guangfeng, etc., will fully resume work as soon as the wheat is fully distributed. It is estimated that the wheat in Central China is sufficient for the needs of various flour mills, so the daily output of various flour mills in the future will be considerable, and the food for the entire people can be guaranteed without worry.

Internal and external trading was active and stronger than before. The official silver price remained unchanged, but internal and external trading prices still exceeded the limited price.

Yarn and Cloth: Yarn and cloth trading was thin due to the weekend, but those holding goods were speculative, creating a situation where demand exceeded supply. The price of various yarn types continued to rise. The cloth market trend remained firm. After opening higher in the morning, the price of various cloths slightly weakened due to selling by floating holders. As a result, premium fine cloths like "Four Gentlemen," "Peach Blossom," "Miss," "Lin Bai Mao" flower cloth, "Kiwi," and others all showed squeezes upwards.

### What I Know About Mr. Gao Hanqing

— Zhang Bingruo

In the autumn of Bingyin (1926), when I began working at Wuzhou Pharmacy, I first met Mr. Gao Hanqing, who was in charge of the company's paintings and calligraphy. Mr. Gao, together with the late Mr. Tong Cuifang, was a great publisher in our country, one of the founders of the Commercial Press forty-six years ago.

In the spring of Jishe (1929), upon the order of General Manager Mr. Xiang Songmao, I entered the factory to study. Mr. Xiang invited Mr. Gao to lecture on "The Path to Success for Young People." Mr. Gao encouraged the students with the four words "frugality and diligent practice," displaying the demeanor of a Confucian scholar. At the time, people praised him as the "Yu Pingzhong of today," a title Mr. Gao undoubtedly deserved.

When the Battle of Shanghai broke out, Mr. Xiang died in the line of duty, and the Wuzhou enterprise suddenly fell into a state of leaderlessness. Mr. Gao, who was already in his late sixties and had retired five years prior, was eventually elected by all the shareholders to take on the difficult task of continuing Mr. Xiang's unfinished business. Mr. Gao's work ethic was to "respond to all changes with constancy," directing affairs with composure, day after day for ten years. The fact that Wuzhou's reputation was able to continue and not decline was largely due to Mr. Gao's efforts.

In the mid-autumn of Guiyou (1933), we were delighted to celebrate Mr. Gao's seventieth birthday. My friend Mr. Lin Huzan edited the Wuzhou Monthly and wrote a lengthy interview with Mr. Gao, in which Mr. Gao recounted his life in great detail. Mr. Gao's self-description as being "like a flower in a mirror, the moon in the water, a dream of grandeur" was widely reprinted in Shanghai newspapers and magazines and regarded as a valuable example.

Mr. Gao's old friend, Mr. Yu Heqin, used the words of Xunzi, "May good intentions prolong your life," to congratulate Mr. Gao on his birthday, which fully demonstrated that Mr. Gao's ability to enjoy a long life was due to his own merits.

In the winter of Jiaxu (1934), Wuzhou established a branch store in Guangzhou. I assisted Mr. Fang Qingcheng in managing it. Before my departure, Mr. Gao instructed me, saying: "Lingnan (Guangdong), is indeed a place I have traveled before. On this trip, you should be amazed by its greatness and vastness, humbly seek progress, and never underestimate yourselves. In the past, our country was closed off, and the culture of the Central Plains spread to the south. Since the opening of trade, new knowledge has been imported, mainly from the south. Medicine and hygiene are related to the health of the nation, so it is appropriate to learn from each other's strengths and compensate for weaknesses, aiming to stand on your own. Your responsibilities are great, and the pursuit of profit is secondary." The elder's earnest expectations also reveal his foresight, which is different from that of a petty merchant.

On the Double Ten Festival of Bingzi (1936), Wuzhou's new building was completed. I was summoned back to Shanghai to assist Mr. Gao with administrative work, and I was able to be close to him day and night, like a son to his father. Lamenting my lack of education in my youth, I sought ways to self-study in my spare time. Mr. Gao always provided me with classical books and patiently explained them to me in detail, just like a strict teacher instructing his students.

Mr. Gao was a devout Christian and remained steadfast in his faith throughout his life. Every weekend, he invited Pastor Xin Sheng to the Songmao Memorial Hall to preach to his colleagues, awakening people's consciousness in this turbulent world. I once accompanied Mr. Gao to banquets at the YMCA and the China Christian Educational Association. Mr. Gao said that thirty years ago, he and Xie Honglai, Yu Guozhen, Li Hengchun, Song Yaoru, Wu Tingsheng, Bao Chengchang, Huang Jia, and other comrades jointly founded the Chinese Christian Association, laying the initial foundation for the self-reliance of our country's churches. Mr. Gao's contribution to the fact that Chinese pastors today are completely independent of mission support and subsidies is truly undeniable.

During the Difficult Year of Dingchou (1937), Shanghai was reduced to an isolated island, and the prices of all goods soared, making life difficult for the people. Labor strikes arose one after another, disrupting the entire city. Wuzhou colleagues organized a fellowship association to demand that the authorities improve their treatment, and I was elected as one of the colleagues' representatives, repeatedly negotiating with the authorities. On one occasion, Mr. Gao, sitting in front of the south window, spoke of the suffering of the world and suddenly burst into tears. The representatives were all moved to tears and ultimately decided to resolve the matter according to Mr. Gao's words. Mr. Gao quoted Wang Anshi's words to warn the crowd: "If the virtuous cannot find their way, the wicked will have their way; if the righteous cannot perform rituals, the powerful will behave rudely." The words of the benevolent can be said to speak out against injustice on behalf of the weak.

Later, I left Wuzhou to accept a position at Nanyang Pharmacy. After fifteen years of serving as a guest, the separation was sudden, and I could not help but feel sad. In recent years, Mr. Gao has moved to the YMCA dormitory, following the principle of concealing his talents and not interfering in external affairs. Whenever I visited him, Mr. Gao always expressed words of comfort and concern, which were deeply moving. On June 20th, we respectfully celebrated Mr. Gao's eightieth birthday. Mr. Gao, compassionate and concerned about the world, declined the celebration and instead donated 10,000 yuan from his savings to help the victims of the disaster in North China. It can be said that he who prolongs the life of others is in fact prolonging his own life. Judging from Mr. Gao's good health and appetite, we can anticipate his reaching the age of great longevity and immeasurable blessings.
