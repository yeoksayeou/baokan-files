### The International Situation During the Preparation Period for the Decisive Battle

The international situation has recently presented a complex and intricate state of affairs. The new situation indicates that a larger-scale war with considerable decisive significance is being actively prepared by the belligerent countries.

In Europe, with the arrival of General Winter, the Soviet Union has launched a near "all-out" counter-offensive. Germany is carrying out a planned retreat, and the plan to encircle Moscow from Stalingrad has been temporarily abandoned. At the same time, it is also withdrawing from the North Caucasus, actively preparing for a new spring offensive this year. Similarly, the Axis powers have also carried out a planned retreat in Africa. The Libyan region has temporarily absorbed British troops, while concentrating Axis forces in Tunisia in preparation for a decisive war. Summarizing the new situation on the European and African battlefields, it can be seen that, on the surface, the anti-Axis forces have shifted from the defensive to the offensive. In reality, due to the astonishingly smooth completion of the Axis forces' retreat plans on the Eastern Front and in North Africa, with minimal losses, they can still firmly grasp the initiative for future wars. Therefore, whether in the Mediterranean or in any part of Europe, once a new war breaks out, the Axis forces will certainly be fully prepared.

The anti-Axis forces have temporarily shifted from the defensive to the offensive, but this offensive is, strictly speaking, quite fragile. The fundamental reason for this fragility is the contradiction between capitalist imperialism and socialism, which is an irreconcilable contradiction. Therefore, Britain and the United States have not only been slow to launch a "second front" but also very slow and limited in providing support in terms of military supplies and materials. The second reason for the fragility of the anti-Axis offensive is the contradiction between Britain and the United States and the contradiction between British and American imperialism and the colonial national movements. These contradictions cannot be resolved simply because of a "common enemy"; they are continuing to develop. An example of the former is the conflict in North Africa between Giraud, who has British backing, and De Gaulle, who has American backing. An example of the latter is the stalemate in the Indian problem and the hypocrisy of British and American aid to Chongqing. (For example, the actual performance of the U.S. Lend-Lease Act in 1942, with loans to Chongqing accounting for only 3% of the total, which even American newspapers referred to as "too pitiful.") These contradictions have created the fragility of the so-called offensive of the anti-Axis forces. Therefore, in the consideration of the undecided battle, there is an urgent need for remedy. Thus, the Casablanca Conference was staged. The theme of the conference was naturally dominated by strategy: first, the so-called Anglo-American-Soviet-Chongqing military conference issue; and second, the issue of future combat directions and strategies. The next most important was political strategy: first, to bring together De Gaulle and Giraud to promote the unity of the French anti-Axis forces; and second, to entice neutral countries. Churchill has now gone to Turkey to lobby. Such is the content of the Casablanca Conference, and such is the so-called decisive battle posture of the anti-Axis forces.

Targeting this new situation, the Axis powers' actions on the Eastern Front and in North Africa represented the first step in a strategic decision to strike nearby. In the future battlefields, regardless of whether it is the Mediterranean air-sea battle centered on Tunisia, or the continental war centered on Southeastern Europe, or even if it is still coastal warfare in Europe, the Axis powers' preparations are quite strict and they are waiting for it. We can prove how strong the Axis authorities' determination to meet the challenge and their confidence in final victory are from the German leader's speech commemorating the tenth anniversary of Nazi rule and from Mussolini's roar as reported in yesterday's newspapers. What cannot be ignored here is Japan's movements in the Greater East Asia War. For example, the concentration of Japan's national power, the Nanjing National Government's declaration of war, and the improvement of politics in the southern occupied areas are all heading towards the road to victory in the preparation for a decisive battle. On the 2nd of this month, a Domei News Agency dispatch stated that Prime Minister Tojo, in his speech on operational goals, indicated: "The Japanese Empire is determined to use various methods to defeat the enemy's combat power, but does not intend to dominate the world. The true intention of Japan is to establish coexistence and co-prosperity among all countries." Prime Minister Tojo pointed out: "In the year since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has become a 'have' nation, with resources exceeding those of Britain and the United States, and its combat power has also rapidly increased. Conversely, Britain and the United States are struggling under the heavy burden of increasing difficulties. In terms of materials, Japan has occupied the vast resources of the southern region, laying the foundation for certain victory. Furthermore, the countries of East Asia have awakened and are closely cooperating with us..." Amidst the so-called offensive preparations of the anti-Axis forces, Japan, with an extraordinary attitude, first launched an attack on Britain and the United States. For example, the Japanese air force's attack on American positions on January 29, which was praised by the German press, was, as stated by Hori, spokesman for the Tokyo Information Bureau: "The decisive victory won by the Imperial Navy Air Force in the battle off Rennell Island is Japan's first strong response to Britain and the United States' boasting about a major offensive in 1943 at the Casablanca Conference. It has shattered the extravagant hopes of the Anglo-American camp and once again proved that the enemy's attempt to break into the vast area controlled by Japan is futile." (Tokyo, 2nd, Domei News Agency dispatch) In fact, the anti-Axis countries are mostly filled with fearful psychology regarding the situation in East Asia. For example, British military commentator Falls wrote an article published in the "London Illustrated News" saying that the hope of the Allied forces recovering the areas occupied by Japan is very slim. He also said: "Australia and the United States have no victory in New Guinea." The Times also stated that "Although the Allies are working very hard, there is no progress in the Pacific military." Australian Prime Minister Curtin has repeatedly called on the United States to pay attention to the serious situation of the war in the Pacific and provide assistance. Chongqing is even more extremely worried about Britain and the United States' neglect of the Pacific war situation. A United Press Chongqing dispatch revealed that "Unless the United States' supplies are transported conveniently and other necessities are transported overland through Burma, the Chinese army will not launch an attack." This pessimistic sentiment about the Pacific war situation is filled among the anti-Axis countries, which can further prove Japan's stable position in the Greater East Asia War and the future decisive battle.

Judging from the current international situation and from the shape of the preparation of a decisive battle between the belligerent countries, we cannot but point out that an unprecedented era in history is fast approaching us, and our future victory is very obvious. However, the dangers of our future journey, the fierceness of the battle, and all unexpected hardships must also be noted and guarded against in this decisive battle between countries, and we must quickly prepare. We want to know? The day when the fate of East Asian nations is decided by themselves is coming soon, but everything depends on the price we pay - how we fight will determine it. We want to ask all East Asian nations to cheer up, unite, prepare for the final battle, and welcome the final victory.

### Japanese House of Peers Passes Amended Military Service Law and Other Bills; Minister of Finance Attends House of Representatives Budget Meeting; Reports on Post-War Public Bond Issuance Situation

Tokyo, 3rd, Domei News Agency Dispatch: The House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:00 this morning and unanimously voted to pass the seven bills submitted by the government to amend the Military Service Law, etc., without any amendments. The bills were immediately submitted to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives did not hold a plenary session today. However, the general budget committee met at 10:13 AM to listen to explanations from the Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry, Commerce, and Finance regarding the taxation of consolidated associations and other issues. The meeting adjourned at noon. The meeting resumed in the afternoon to discuss rural improvement issues and adjourned at 5:35 PM.

Tokyo, 3rd, Central News Agency Dispatch: At the 81st session of the Japanese Diet today, the House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:10 AM. First, Chairman Matsudaira reported that he had cabled the Supreme Commander of the Japanese forces in the South, expressing his congratulations on the great results achieved in the naval battle off Rennell Island. Then, State Minister Ie made a policy speech and answered questions.

Tokyo, 3rd, Central News Agency Dispatch: In order to simplify production administration and unify guidance and supervision, with a view to greatly increasing the production of important wartime military supplies, the Japanese government has submitted a Wartime Administrative Special Exceptions Bill to the Diet. The bill was passed by the House of Peers today and will be submitted to the House of Representatives tomorrow. According to the previous announcement, the Wartime Administrative Authority Special Exceptions Bill is intended to strengthen the Prime Minister's authority in production administration.

Therefore, the operation of the bill after its enactment and implementation is highly valued by all parties. From the government's explanation of the proposal in the House of Peers and the explanation in the House of Representatives' general budget meeting, the fundamental policy of the bill's operation is that the Prime Minister may exercise the directive authority stipulated in the bill without establishing a separate special committee. On the one hand, the Prime Minister will consult with the cabinet ministers, and on the other hand, the opinions of influential people will be adopted as cooperation, and the Prime Minister will be fully responsible for promoting production administration.

Tokyo, 3rd, Domei News Agency Dispatch: The Minister of Finance stated at the House of Representatives budget meeting today that the total amount of national debt issued by Japan from the outbreak of the China Incident on July 7, 1937, to the end of last year was 39,682,000,000 yen. Of this amount, 87.3%, or 34,646,000,000 yen, has been absorbed by the public, which shows that the Japanese people trust the government. The percentage of those who directly purchased the national debt last year reached 96.2%, which is the highest record in the past six years.

### Japan Negotiates with Various Enemy Countries; Sends Ships to Exchange Nationals; Protests to Neutral Countries Regarding Japanese Nationals Abused in Enemy Countries

Tokyo, 3rd, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki stated in the House of Peers this morning that the Japanese government is currently conducting concrete negotiations with enemy governments in order to send ships to exchange nationals and bring back Japanese nationals who are still detained in enemy countries. In response to a question from a member, the Foreign Minister stated that the Japanese government is carefully paying attention to the welfare of Japanese nationals detained in enemy countries and countries with which diplomatic relations have been severed. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japanese nationals in the United States and the Dutch East Indies were immediately arrested. More than 120,000 Japanese nationals along the Pacific coast of Canada and the United States have been forced to withdraw to the interior, living miserably. This is an inhumane act by the enemy countries that violates international law. Under these circumstances, the Japanese government has entrusted Switzerland and other countries that represent the interests of Japanese nationals in enemy countries to lodge strong protests with the enemy governments to improve the treatment of detained Japanese nationals. On the other hand, the Japanese government has given fair treatment to enemy nationals, as evidenced by the report of the representative of the International Red Cross after inspecting the detention camps.

Tokyo, 3rd, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Japanese spokesperson Hori refuted rumors of ill-treatment of the Chilean Minister to Japan, stating, "Regarding the true treatment of the Chilean Minister to Japan, the Chilean government has received false reports. The Chilean Minister is now residing in Tokyo and is being treated with great leniency by the Japanese side. When asked what the basis was for Chile's misunderstanding that its Minister to Japan was being ill-treated, the spokesperson replied that he did not know. It is regrettable that the Chilean government has taken steps before it has accurately understood the facts. The interests of Chile in Japan are being taken care of by the Swiss government, while the interests of Japan in Chile are being taken care of by the representative of the Swedish government."

### German Rearguard Units Withdraw According to Plan; Although Soviet Forces Have Recaptured Stalingrad, the Price Paid is Truly Astonishing

Berlin, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: German forces are using flexible tactics to great effect in the area west and southwest of Voronezh. The Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive in the middle reaches of the Don River, but encountered strong resistance from the German forces and made no progress. They then dispatched fresh troops to continue the fierce attack, attempting to encircle the industrial area in the center from the right wing. The German side is strictly guarding against this plan. The situation is unchanged in the lower reaches of the Don River east of the Don River and along the Manich Line. The German forces between the Don River and the Caucasus are continuing to withdraw the rearguard units according to the established plan and are launching counterattacks from time to time, repeatedly inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. A part of the German forces in the western Caucasus has also begun to withdraw for strategic reasons. The enemy forces are following up and advancing, but have been repulsed southwest of Krasnodar and southeast of Novorossiysk. British reports that the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive in the Kerch area are not true. There were only local small battles in that area, and only two companies of Soviet troops participated.

### German Troops in Stalingrad: Unprecedented Heroism

Berlin, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: The German troops besieged in northern Stalingrad sent their last wireless report yesterday afternoon, saying only "Long live Germany, long live Hitler." After that, the telecommunications traffic there was completely cut off from the outside world. The ten-week resistance has come to an end. It is recalled that at the end of November last year, Soviet propaganda claimed that the German troops in Stalingrad had completely surrendered. By mid-January of this year, the Soviet side had to admit that the German troops were still fighting with great spirit. Now, although the Soviet army has recaptured Stalingrad, the price it has paid is also extremely astonishing. It is estimated that no less than 300,000 Soviet soldiers were buried in the city, and no less than 1,000 tanks were sacrificed. The German Sixth Army resisted an enemy several times its size for so long under the situation that external supplies were completely cut off. In the history of war, its heroism cannot be said to be unprecedented.

Berlin, 3rd, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Official sources here announced last night that although the Axis forces on the Eastern Front repelled the Soviet army's repeated attacks in various places, the German Eleventh Army, which was holding its last position in the northern part of Stalingrad, sent its last report last night. It was learned that the army had heroically resisted the continuous attacks of the Soviet army for several weeks, but was ultimately outnumbered and its line of defense was broken on the first day of this month. By that night, it had run out of ammunition and food, and the entire line of defense had collapsed.

### North China Authorities Actively Promote the Agricultural Production Increase Plan; Designate Model Counties in Hebei and Other Provinces; Compulsory Implementation of Various Improvement Plans

Beijing, 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch: In order to ensure self-sufficiency in food, the North China authorities are now actively promoting the agricultural production increase countermeasures for this year and have specially designated model counties for agricultural production increase, including 75 counties in Hebei Province, 52 counties in Shandong Province, 35 counties in Shanxi Province, and 20 counties in the Subei-Huai area. The key points of the measures are to set up model production increase farms in the model counties, establish production increase mutual promotion associations, compulsorily implement well-drilling plans, improve fertilization, use ammonium sulfate fertilizer, and implement seed disinfection. The main agricultural crops to be increased are wheat, rice, cotton, chestnuts, corn, and sweet potatoes. At the same time, the production of miscellaneous grains will be increased to ensure rural food supply.

### South China Economic Conference Scheduled to be Held

Guangzhou, 3rd, Zhonglai News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese authorities here announced on the 2nd that relevant Chinese agencies will also participate in the Second South China Economic Liaison Conference. The conference has been scheduled to be held continuously at the Guangzhou Japanese Consulate General from February 19 for four days. It has been decided to invite relevant officials from Nanjing and Qingdao to participate in this conference.

### Rumor that Chiang Kai-shek is in Washington, D.C.; Consulting with Various American Leaders; Demanding More Assistance

Guangzhou, 3rd, Domei News Agency Dispatch: This place yesterday received unverified news that Chiang Kai-shek is now in Washington. According to an Australian radio broadcast, Chiang is currently in Washington consulting with various leaders of the American government on the issue of the United States providing more Lend-Lease assistance, because American aid to Chongqing has not reached even 20% of what Washington had promised. Therefore, Chiang has made this trip to Washington. News from Chongqing also widely spread that Chiang is now in Washington, but it has not been confirmed by reliable sources. According to news from Chongqing, during Chiang's absence, He Yingqin is temporarily acting as Chairman of the Supreme National Defense Council, Kong Xiangxi is temporarily acting as President of the Executive Yuan, Chen Guofu is temporarily acting as Director-General of the Kuomintang, and He Yaozu is temporarily acting as Chairman of the National General Mobilization Council.

### Turkey Denies Joining the War; Maintains Neutrality and is Not Tempted by Anything; Churchill's Visit Only Has Propaganda Value

Istanbul, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: The Director of the Turkish Government Information Office, Safa, met with reporters after the Adana Conference and absolutely denied that British Prime Minister Churchill had asked Turkey to join the war, and announced that Turkey had not accepted this constraint.

Stockholm, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: A Swedish newspaper's correspondent in London cabled that London was surprised by the talks between Turkish President Ismet and British Prime Minister Churchill in Adana. Officials have not commented on this, only saying that what the British government is interested in is Turkey's continued neutrality. However, British newspapers generally believe that the meeting is related to future Mediterranean battles. This can be evidenced by the fact that important figures in the British military participated in the meeting. Some London newspapers even believe that the Adana Conference is a chain encircling Germany, and that the meeting between Ismet and Churchill must have been approved by Stalin in advance. The Soviet Union is also very concerned about the issue of the Dardanelles Strait. It is not known whether this issue was also discussed at the meeting. However, the main obstacle to the Allies transporting war materials to the Soviet Union through the Dardanelles Strait is not the Montreux Convention, but Germany's control of the Aegean Sea.

Ankara, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: After Ambassador Hugessen met with Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Vinogradov yesterday, he met with Turkish reporters and stated his impressions of the Adana Conference. It is said that what was discussed was how Turkey's military preparations were. If Turkey is attacked, the Allies will assist it. The possibility of supplying Turkey with military supplies was also discussed.

Ankara, 3rd, Haiying News Agency Dispatch: The Turkish government issued a statement on the Adana Conference the night before. Political and diplomatic circles here are discussing it enthusiastically, but the newspapers here have not yet discussed it. All parties are paying attention to three points in the statement: (1) The statement is a Turkish declaration, not a joint British-Turkish statement. (2) The statement does not mention the British-Turkish alliance of 1939. (3) The statement does not mention Soviet-Turkish relations either. People in Ankara say that although Churchill tried his best to explain to Turkey that the Soviet Union had no intentions towards Turkey, it probably did not succeed. They were surprised that British Foreign Secretary Eden made a report on the Adana Conference in the House of Commons. Eden stated that Churchill only explained to Turkey the United Kingdom's organization for various issues and did not agree on solutions. However, in reality, all issues were resolved in accordance with Turkey's neutral attitude.

Ankara, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: An American reporter here believes that Churchill's trip to Turkey is because Britain wants to drive the United States out of the Near East. It is also learned here that the American Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, was invited to attend the Adana Conference, but he refused. This is enough to prove that British and American opinions on the Near East issue are not consistent. In addition, there are also disagreements between Britain and the United States on the establishment of an Allied Supreme Commander in the Near East. But in fact, Britain has already gained an advantage. It is believed here that a British officer will take the position of Allied Supreme Commander in the Near East.

### Turkish Foreign Minister Meets German Ambassador

Ankara, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu met with German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen yesterday and, in accordance with the Turkish-German Friendship Treaty, informed the German Ambassador of the progress of the meeting between the Turkish President and the British Prime Minister in Adana.

### Axis Powers Have No Intention of Attacking Turkey

Madrid, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: "ABC" commented on the Adana Conference today, saying that Berlin and Rome remain calm after learning of Churchill's visit to Turkey, which shows that the Axis powers have no intention of attacking Turkey. In addition, Turkey's participation in the war must be after its borders are attacked. Therefore, the British-Turkish alliance concluded at the Adana Conference has no military significance.

### British Prime Minister Visited Cyprus

Berlin, 3rd, Haitong News Agency The British Prime Minister Churchill and the Turkish President Ismet held a meeting in Adana, probably due to Turkey's suggestion that the British and Americans hope to use Turkey's airports as a base for air raids on the Balkans. It is not known whether Churchill has made this wish. On his way back, he visited the island of Cyprus, which is the base for Britain's attack on the Dodecanese Islands and Crete. Recently, the Turkish newspaper "Ulus" stated that Turkey will strictly adhere to neutrality and will not be tempted by any promises, which clearly refers to the Allies' suggestion of sacrificing Syria. The newspaper declared that Turkey would not change its policy because German forces entered the Caucasus or British forces reached Tripoli, but if Turkey's territory is threatened, Turkey will resolutely fight. The victory of the Soviet army will not change Turkey's attitude. Turkey is well aware of the Soviet Union's ambitions for the Straits, which is why Ismet met with Churchill to discuss post-war issues.

### Valiant Winter Warfare Between Germany and the Soviet Union: The German Army's Elite Displays Its Military Might, the Red Army Tries to Counterattack Unsuccessfully

On the Eastern Front in winter, the German army has indeed launched a valiant battle. German and allied forces are fighting amidst wind and snow. The Soviets are besieging the German army around Stalingrad, while simultaneously dispatching large forces in three routes – south, north, and central – directly towards Rostov, with considerable momentum. The German army is holding its ground and resisting, but has been unable to stem the tide. In the fierce battles, there are many tragic and beautiful stories. According to reports from German propaganda units, frontline soldiers have shown many heroic actions, from which one can imagine that the German army has indeed performed earth-shattering and soul-stirring actions in defensive battles since the beginning of the war. The news of the fall of Tripoli has reached the front lines, certainly not creating a positive impression psychologically. However, compared to the importance of the situation on the Eastern Front, the fall of Tripoli is a minor issue. The German people are able to understand the meaning of total national involvement in the war, as explained by the government, and anxiously await the frontline soldiers to fight bravely, closely monitoring the movements on the Eastern Front. The following is a brief report on the important developments of the second German-Soviet winter campaign:

The Situation on the Eastern Front is Serious

On January 22, the German army suddenly announced to the nation that the situation on the Eastern Front was serious. Initially, the German people only knew that the Soviet army had launched a winter offensive since November of last year, with fierce battles raging on the Eastern Front daily, but the details of the battle were unclear. The authorities initially announced, "We have severely damaged the Red Army and repelled their attacks," but suddenly on January 22, they announced that the German forces defending Stalingrad, despite fighting bravely, were ultimately unable to stop the advance of the Red Army and had no choice but to shift their positions, retreating several kilometers. Acknowledging that the German army had retreated on the Eastern Caucasus front, the German people now realized that the German army in Stalingrad had been heavily besieged and felt that the situation was difficult to handle. Since the beginning of the war, German announcements had never been so unfavorable. On January 23, the German army made the following announcement: "The German forces in Stalingrad are fighting bravely in the midst of heavy enemy encirclement. The German forces in the North Caucasus are shifting to the rear, and the retreat is proceeding smoothly."

On January 24, they further stated:

"The winter campaign on the Eastern Front lifeline is becoming increasingly intense. The situation in Stalingrad has deteriorated further due to the Red Army's offensive from the west. Although the Red Army around Stalingrad is gradually shortening the encirclement, the German soldiers are still able to hold their positions. This spirit of courage and fighting prowess is truly a model for German soldiers."

Regarding the situation in the North Caucasus, they frankly announced, acknowledging that the situation was serious and difficult to handle, stating that "due to strategic necessity, the German army has reorganized and reduced the southern front, and the battlefield has shifted to the area of Kropotkin (transliteration)."

The Red Army Disregards Troop Losses

The retreat route for the German army in Stalingrad to the west was cut off several days ago, leading to isolation and encirclement. However, the German authorities' sudden announcement has hidden reasons. The news released by the German army in the past three days, along with the arguments starting to appear in German newspapers at the same time, corresponded to the "PK War Correspondent's Diary" from the front lines. When reading it, one can imagine the scene of the German army fighting bloody battles on a front line with heavy snow and frozen ground. In late November of last year, after the ground froze, the Soviet army used elite troops equipped and trained for winter warfare to launch a counterattack on the southern front. The German army had already gained valuable lessons in last year's winter campaign, and similarly, the Red Army had also undergone effective winter warfare training to deal with the German army, using a large amount of manpower and weapons to launch attacks. The Red Army broke through the German positions between the Volga River and the Don River from the north and south, aiming to recapture Rostov as the target of the Red Army's winter offensive and advance forward. After recapturing the strategic point of Rostov, the retreat route for the German army entering the Caucasus could be cut off. The Maikop oilfield area and the Kuban granary area were once seized from the German army. At the same time, capturing the German industrial area was also one of the Red Army's winter warfare objectives. The Red Army advanced towards Rostov in three routes:

The Central Army moved west along the east-west railway in the center of the Don River bend. The Northern Army broke through the weak points of the Axis forces near Migulinskaya and Kalitovskaya in the upper reaches of the Don River, advancing directly south towards Millerovo and Kamensk-Shakhtinsky. The Southern Army suddenly appeared in the Kalmyk steppe area, one team advancing west along the lower reaches of the Don River, and another team advancing west along the railway between Stalingrad and Krasnodar.

All three routes were spearheaded by a large number of tank units, breaking through the familiar snowy plains occupied by the German army. The German army resolutely resisted everywhere, but the central and northern fronts were insufficiently prepared for winter positional warfare, and the southern front was not prepared for defensive warfare at all. Under the Red Army's superior forces and reckless attacks, they had no choice but to make a "strategic retreat" to avoid losses, retreating to locations with fortified defensive positions in Rostov.

The German Troops in Stalingrad are Heroic

For weeks, the only way to supply the isolated troops in Stalingrad with food and ammunition has been through air transport. The plight of the German soldiers who did not pursue the retreating enemy after the fierce battles last summer deserves sympathy. However, the Red Army, harboring revenge for the German army's attack last summer, is tightening its encirclement day by day. The number of German troops inside the circle is certainly not small. In addition, there was a precedent in the winter of the previous year where isolated troops besieged for three months broke through the encirclement. However, the German troops in Stalingrad are fighting to their last bullet for their country. German newspapers cannot help but express their gratitude and offer words of encouragement, just like the scene of the battleship Bismarck fighting bravely. In view of the difficulty of replenishment from the supply depot, the Red Army's situation, the battlefield situation, and the isolated German troops, it is quite difficult to break out of the encirclement. Moreover, due to the constraints of the severe winter season, it is impossible to rescue these isolated troops. Therefore, the only option is to resist to the end, awaiting the start of the third German spring offensive. The realization of this miracle is the aspiration shared by the German people on the front lines and in the rear. The PK war correspondents from Germany, Osstenert and Zannkner, sent to their homeland's press from Stalingrad the tragic war situation, and their emotions of grief and excitement overflowed between the lines, more like a prose poem than news.

The trial by fire in the Stalingrad furnace has forged a type of German soldier. Soldiers deeply trapped in the hellish trap are worthy of their name. Even amidst the flames and explosions, the fighting spirit of our soldiers remains strong and undiminished. It is a pity that humans are not machines, and their energy is limited. On the Stalingrad front, there are still soldiers who participated in the Kharkov battle of the previous winter and the rapid attacks of last summer. New missions repeatedly fall on these soldiers, preventing them from alternating with new comrades. The number of soldiers in companies, battalions, and regiments decreases day by day. Although the communication route with the outside world has been cut off, their spirit never shrinks. The reason for this is only their instinctive self-awareness. Unaware of fatigue, unaware of spiritual destruction, these are the brave men of our city, enduring the most brutal trials with superhuman strength, even knowing that they cannot extricate themselves, they still resolutely fight for their country. The battle of Stalingrad is not only unprecedented, but may also be the last of its kind. The battles before our eyes are proceeding at their highest point, reaching white heat.

German Public Opinion Rises Up in Unison

The Red Army's fierce winter offensive is raging in all locations on the eastern front, including the central Caucasus, western Caucasus, the area near Velikiye Luki on the central front, and the area south of Lake Ilmen. The Axis forces suffered greatly in the winter of the previous year, but it was far less severe than this winter. The setbacks of the German army in the winter of the previous year can be attributed to the German army's lack of preparation for the cold attacks. The characteristic of this year's "winter formation" is that the Red Army is carrying an astonishing number of troops, a large force fully equipped for winter, constantly increasing from the rear, and behind this large force, there is a smooth transportation organization. This issue is very serious, and the resistance of the Red Army cannot be taken lightly. According to the figures published by the German army, a total of 6,291 Red Army tanks were destroyed in the winter campaign from November 20 of last year to January 24 of this year. However, even after losing this large number of tanks, the Red Army's offensive is still extremely fierce. Due to this fact, the German General Staff cannot fundamentally change its highest operational policy in the conduct of the war against the Soviet Union. The German "Ahkemer Nai Report" on the 23rd called it "the largest storm in Asia since Genghis Khan." The "Heirkichia Baiopai Hatai Report" on the 24th used a large headline: "Can the Soviet Union Win?" The acute expression of the crisis in the East conveyed to the people by the press is noteworthy.

### Allied Forces in Central Tunisia Driven Out of Newly Occupied Positions; German and Italian Aircraft Attack Bona Port in Batches at Night

Berlin, March 3, Huitong News Agency. Allied forces in central Tunisia were driven out of their most recently occupied positions yesterday by Axis forces. Small enemy units were completely annihilated. Enemy forces concentrated troops southeast of Al Ada in an attempt to attack, but were routed by Axis artillery. German dive bombers destroyed four enemy tanks and thirteen trucks southeast of Thebes. German and Italian aircraft carried out night raids on Bona Port in batches. Important facilities in the port were directly hit. In aerial combat, five Allied aircraft were shot down, including two four-engine bombers.

Stockholm, March 3, Huitong News Agency. According to the London correspondent of the "Swedish Daily News," well-informed sources in London are deeply disappointed with the situation in Tunisia. The Allied forces' major offensive in the area will be shelved again because several problems have not yet been resolved. The Axis forces' positions in northern Tunisia are very strong, making it easy to defend. The Allied forces' attempt to prevent the German and Italian armored vehicles retreating from Tripolitania from joining forces with General Arnim's troops has failed. The Axis forces have built impregnable fortresses on the high ground near Tunis. The first line of defense is equipped with machine gun nests, connected by tunnels. Behind the machine gun nests are grenade launchers with a range of two and a half kilometers, more powerful than the Allied grenade launchers. The Axis forces' third line of defense is equipped with large-caliber artillery with a diameter of eighty centimeters, powerful enough to repel any enemy advance. All of the German army's sixty-two-ton heavy tanks are incredibly powerful, and the troops guarding the high ground are all elite soldiers, each knowing how to fulfill their responsibilities.

### Rumor that Churchill Will Visit Portugal

Madrid, March 3, Central News Agency. According to Lisbon sources, there are rumors in the area that Churchill will visit Portugal on his way back to England. It is said that political and diplomatic circles attach great importance to this.

### Admiral Dönitz Arrives in the German Capital

Berlin, March 3, Huitong News Agency. Admiral Dönitz arrived in Berlin yesterday to take office as Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy.

### Japan-Bulgaria Association Elects Honorary Members

Sofia, March 3, Huitong News Agency. The recently established Tokyo Japan-Bulgaria Association has elected the Governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, Gornayev, and the Mayor of Sofia, Ivanov, as honorary members.

### Vietnam Restricts Automobile Traffic

Saigon, March 3, Huitong News Agency. Due to a shortage of alcohol, the Vietnamese government has ordered a reduction of one-third in the number of automobiles in operation. Alcohol will not be allocated unless absolutely necessary. It is said that the reason for the alcohol shortage is that the sulfuric acid used to refine alcohol cannot be imported.

### The Powerful Tojo Cabinet (3)

Director of the Valley Information Bureau and Director-General of the Moriyama Legislation Bureau

Director-General Moriyama of the Legislation Bureau was born in Hachiman-cho, Kuwana City, and graduated from the Eighth Higher Normal School, followed by the Faculty of Law at Tokyo University. He received a pure legal education from the Legislation Bureau, and is well-versed in the constitution, having served as an administrative examination commissioner. He is amiable and approachable, and possesses a sincere personality. In terms of gentleness, he is superior to Director of the Valley Information Bureau, but lacks Director Valley’s self-restraint. Moriyama is valued for his character. Therefore, he is an indispensable figure in the current cabinet for dealing with the Privy Council, and is deeply trusted by Prime Minister Tojo. Within the Legislation Bureau, he has no political ambitions. His straightforward nature, tempered by political experience, could make him a first-class politician. Subordinates and the general public have a high opinion of him. It can be said that his contribution is to ensure the smooth relationship between the Tojo cabinet and the Privy Council.

Many believed that Director of the Valley Information Bureau was not very suitable for the position of Foreign Minister. When the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry was shelved, the position of Foreign Minister was temporarily held concurrently by Prime Minister Tojo. The cause of Valley's appointment, to which various parties paid extraordinary attention, made the Tojo cabinet's "comrade cabinet" color more pronounced. Valley once served as the Director of the Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At that time, Joint Intelligence Minister Toshi Shiratori and young military officers promoted hard-line diplomacy, for which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was praised. Later, he separated from Shiratori and became the ambassador to France, refusing the French government's excessive hospitality and enduring unfortunate days. Also, when the Abe cabinet planned to establish a Ministry of Trade, Valley, then Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, opposed it along with Foreign Minister Nomura. All senior officials from the director to the lower levels of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted their resignations, and the mid-level and young members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also expressed their sympathy. Soon, things took a turn for the better. He was promoted by Tojo to be the Director of the Cabinet Information Bureau, and became one of the four senior officials of the cabinet. Perhaps his past good reputation led to his appointment as Foreign Minister.

After taking office as Foreign Minister, Valley used his own experience as a blueprint and appointed new executives such as Vice Minister Matsumoto. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has taken on a new look since the promotion of Vice Minister Matsumoto and Director of Political Affairs Kamimura. These new elites are determined to assist Valley, and therefore, Valley has now become very successful and a prominent figure. However, he remains humble and cautious, and is not satisfied with his current achievements. The positions of the four senior officials who bear the heavy responsibility for the country during wartime have been described above. Whether or not the right people are chosen for these positions is crucial to the future of the country. It goes without saying that all the cabinet staff members, under the influence of Prime Minister Tojo, should be united and establish a true wartime posture. The four senior officials should also be integrated as one, maintaining a serious attitude to live up to the country's trust.

Enduring Hardship Together and Sharing the Burden

Securing the future victory of the Greater East Asia War is full of thorns. The general public is well aware of the significance and difficulty of this teaching, and therefore, their determination to win has become even stronger.

Recently, the various measures taken to boost the morale of the people have not been foolproof. The leaders of the Information Bureau are serious about their own conduct and are working to strengthen the internal unity of the country.

It should be the same on the front lines as in the economic world. Mr. Fujiyama, the head of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, "Is it really the best and most effective method to guide the people with tactics that emphasize ingenuity rather than honesty?" This straightforward statement is indeed very reasonable. Of course, this is by no means criticizing the government's policies. The government's loud calls to awaken the people. Likewise, the economic world cannot but deeply reflect on itself now. Where should the government's administration start? Is it not the major issue that has become a problem these days? Spiritual mobilization means making people do their best in their own positions, regardless of success or failure. In the economic sector, should we not properly plan the fundamental policy of production expansion, and put all our efforts into it and resolutely implement it? Recently, during this war, discussions on abolishing corporate profits have been heard among the people. In this unprecedented situation, company management orders, wage control orders, and other control economic measures still have not abandoned the old concept of pursuing profits, and have prevented the expansion of production. If this is not the government's intention, then now is the best time for the government leaders to take decisive action. For the sake of the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War, the concept of profit should be abandoned, and all the people should share the burden with the spirit of being micro-employed. Now is the best opportunity to establish timely strategies. There should be straightforward and concrete expressions. Prompting the people to realize the importance of the situation. If someone loses courage due to the difficulties of the future, if someone uses this as a tool to criticize the political situation, if there are such people at this time, then the government leaders must seek a thorough strategy to eliminate non-nationals. The enemy, Britain, has arguments about stationing troops in six major cities after conquering Japan. Even if we did not know this argument, it is not difficult to imagine the scene if Japan were to be defeated in this war. We must not retreat a step, and even if we know the difficulties ahead, we must move forward on this difficult path. It is strange that the phrase "臥薪嘗膽" (sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall – enduring hardship to achieve revenge) has not yet appeared in newspapers.

Now is the time to devote the nation's strength to winning victory. Here, we have high expectations for the current central force, the four senior officials of the cabinet. Therefore, if there are any inappropriate words in this article, please forgive them with the magnanimity mentioned in the text. (End)

### Internal Opposition in the United States Severely Criticizes the Government; Roosevelt Met with Reporters Yesterday and Was Questioned About the North Africa Conference

Stockholm, March 3, Huitong News Agency. According to Washington sources, President Roosevelt has found that the opposition's momentum has rebounded after the Casablanca Conference. His failure to appoint Flynn as ambassador to Australia was a measure to avoid criticism. The strength of the isolationists has also increased. Wilkie's criticism of the government is particularly severe. However, British newspapers point out that the American public's opposition to Roosevelt is not an expression of anti-British sentiment. The Republican Party will continue the war even when it is in power.

Lisbon, March 3, Huitong News Agency. New York

The "New York Herald Tribune" on Friday called Secretary of State Hull "America's constitutional nanny." This is the most severe attack on Hull in his ten years in office. Any reporter who questioned Hull about the North African events was rebuked by Hull. Some newspapers have demanded that the State Department recall Murphy, because his character, training, and previous occupation and environment are not suitable for serving as General Eisenhower's political advisor.

Lisbon, March 3, Tongmeng News Agency. According to Washington, U.S. President Roosevelt met with reporters yesterday for an hour. The reporters criticized why Chongqing representatives were not invited to the Casablanca Conference. Roosevelt replied that Chongqing was geographically unable to launch an offensive, so this move was more appropriate. Some people thought that Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek could easily participate in the meeting, but these people have forgotten that the Soviet Union has not declared war on Japan, and although Chongqing has nominally declared war on Germany, it is actually hindered by the terrain. Someone asked if Stalin agreed to the plan decided at the meeting. Roosevelt did not answer, only saying that it was a matter of secrecy, and it was not appropriate to discuss whether he agreed or disagreed. As for what developments the Casablanca meeting would produce, Roosevelt was also unwilling to answer.

### Rumor That the Roosevelt-Churchill Conference Had Three Decisions

Vichy, March 3, Havas News Agency. According to Berlin sources, the main points decided at the Casablanca Conference by U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill are as follows: (1) This year, concentrate all efforts in the Mediterranean, first intensifying the bombing of Italy, and then attacking the Italian military positions on the Dodecanese Islands and the German-occupied Crete in the spring; (2) Temporarily do not reinforce the Soviet Union, and use the threat of submarine warfare as an excuse for not being able to reinforce the Soviet Union; (3) Increase pressure on Turkey to participate in the war within the year, and promise Syria and Lebanon as conditions for participating in the war.

### How Does a Solar Eclipse Occur?

How does a solar eclipse occur? The Earth revolves around the sun, and the moon revolves around the Earth. And the sun is constantly moving at an astonishing speed. During this orderly movement, when the sun, Earth, and moon are aligned in a straight line, the phenomenon of an "eclipse" occurs. At this time, if the moon is between the Earth and the sun, it becomes a solar eclipse. If the Earth is between the sun and the moon, blocking the light coming from the sun, so that no sunlight is reflected on the moon, it becomes a lunar eclipse. In other words, the phenomenon of a solar eclipse is the sun casting the moon's shadow on the Earth. When standing in its shadow and looking at the sun, the state of the moon overlapping with the sun is a total solar eclipse. However, even though the moon is between the Earth and the sun, if the sun seen from the Earth is larger in shape than the moon, a total solar eclipse will not occur, but an annular eclipse will occur. That is, at this time, around the dark moon, a golden and brilliant ring of the sun can be seen, which is quite a beautiful sight. However, like partial eclipses, annular eclipses are not a major problem from the perspective of astronomers.

Moreover, ordinary solar eclipses are by no means rare phenomena. Although there are limited periods of time in a year when they can occur, they are usually called solar eclipse seasons. Approximately every one hundred and seventy-three days, there is always a place on Earth where a solar eclipse can be seen. That is, there are always two, or occasionally three, solar eclipses visible on Earth in a year. According to calculations, after this solar eclipse, Japan will encounter total solar eclipses again on July 21, 2623 (translator's note: this year is Japanese year 2603) in eastern Hokkaido, on July 31, 2641 in central Sakhalin Island, on March 18, 2648 in the eastern sea of the Ogasawara Islands, and on July 22, 2669 in the Ryukyu Islands. However, all of these will be hindered by the sea and other locations and times, and have little value for observation. In the end, the black sun that visits the Noto Peninsula and the Kanto region will not appear until September 2, 2695! It is unlikely that there will be observations on the mainland of Japan.

That is, in the ninety-two years after the total eclipse on February 5 this year, there will be no more solar eclipses in Japan. Therefore, modern Japanese people will rarely see another solar eclipse in their lifetime after seeing this one. This is the reason why this solar eclipse is so important, and it also has the meaning of leaving the valuable data of present Japanese science to future generations. Also, although it is the same total solar eclipse, the moon's shadow cast on the Earth is sometimes large and sometimes small. This is because the distances between the sun, the moon, and the Earth are constantly changing. The moon's shadow cast on the Earth during a solar eclipse becomes a band due to the Earth's rotation, rushing across the surface of the Earth. Therefore, the time for which a total solar eclipse can be seen at a certain location within the solar eclipse circle on Earth is very short, but the larger the shadow, the longer the time. If the time is short, observation is naturally difficult. The total solar eclipse time on February 5 is "one minute and fifty-three seconds." This is only a few seconds shorter than the total solar eclipse seen in Hokkaido on June 19, Showa 11 (Republic of China 25), and is sufficient for thorough research. However, this one minute and fifty-three seconds is truly a precious time that scholars cannot buy for thousands of dollars. Therefore, the lively and busy observation at that time will cause more than fifty Japanese scholars related to astronomy to rack their brains and challenge the "black sun." (Translated by Ding from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on January 20)

### Explanation of the Solar Eclipse Diagram

The diagram illustrates the solar eclipse on February 5th, visible across Japan, Manchuria, Manchukuo, eastern China, the Philippines, eastern Siberia, eastern Alaska, and the west coast of the United States. The area where the total solar eclipse can be seen is limited to the 180-kilometer-wide strip in the center of the diagram, indicated by three lines. As shown in the diagram, this line starts from eastern Manchuria, passes through central Hokkaido in Japan, and reaches the coast of Alaska. The line on the left end of the diagram (Manchuria, mainland China) indicates sunrise and the end of the eclipse; the second line (Hokkaido) indicates the start of the eclipse after sunrise; the area east of the line on the right end, namely the mainland United States, indicates the start of the eclipse after sunset; the second line from the right indicates the end of the eclipse and sunset. In summary, Hokkaido is located in the total solar eclipse zone, with the boundary line passing through it. The solar eclipse starts after sunrise (i.e., 7:50 AM).

### Silver and Money Trades Announce Year-End Settlement Methods: Returned Checks Must Be Cleared on the Same Day; Four-Day Holiday Starts Tomorrow, Reopening on the 9th

Today is Lunar New Year's Eve, the deadline for year-end settlements for all trades. The Bankers' Joint Reserve Association and the Money Trade Joint Reserve Treasury have agreed on the settlement and clearing times for members. As for the external business hours of various banks and firms, they remain as usual from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, while internal hours are extended to handle settlements. All trades have been fully prepared for the year-end settlement. Overdrafts between banks and firms have been adjusted, and funds have been fully repaid to maintain commercial credit. Most of the previously extended customer accounts have been recovered. At a time of soaring prices for goods, it is expected that the settlement results will yield significant profits. As for the regulation of finance, it remains stable and consistent through the adjustment of the Central Reserve Bank and the Silver Association's treasury. The money supply is even looser than in previous years at the end of the national calendar year. The market's foreign exchange rate yesterday was one and four-tenths of a cent, so all trades have safely passed this year-end settlement period.

Silver Association Announces Settlement Methods

The Bankers' Joint Reserve Committee issued a notice to member banks stating, "Respectfully informing you that February 4th (Thursday) is the deadline for year-end settlements. The settlement time for members will be appropriately extended as usual. For the convenience of settlement for various clearing banks, the exchange times for this day have been specifically set as follows: (1) Exchange time: 5:00 PM; (2) Deadline for clearing banks entrusting the Association to deposit exchangeable instruments: 4:30 PM; (3) Deadline for the Association's corresponding members to deposit exchangeable instruments: 4:15 PM; (4) Deadline for depositing various collection instruments: as usual; (5) Deadline for correspondent accounts to replenish funds and the Association to transfer payment instruments: 8:00 PM; (6) Returned checks must be cleared on the same day. In addition to the announcement at the clearinghouse, a corresponding circular is hereby sent for your information and compliance."

### Discrepancies in the Date of Rice Distribution in the City: The Truth

Yesterday, we received a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipality Grain Bureau, stating, "Having read three comments in the 'Readers' Forum' of your newspaper on February 3rd regarding the distribution of rice based on household size, the main points are roughly about the lack of quantity, delays in dates, and incomplete flour allocations. As the responsible department, we hereby provide the following explanation based on facts. Due to personnel matters, this bureau is temporarily taking the period from late October of last year to the end of January of this year as one phase. Although the dates for distributing rice based on household size have not been fixed, resulting in discrepancies, the number of distributions has never been less. Counting from the end of October to the end of January, there have been a total of ten rice distributions (one in late January, which is the public sale on the 2nd of this month; the original draft was likely written on February 1st, hence the mention of one distribution still owed in January). We ask the commenting gentlemen, whether in Nanshi or Huxi, to carefully recall the number of periods to see if any are missing. However, the rice purchase certificates in Nanshi are continuous, starting from period 19 in late October to period 25 at the end of December, totaling seven periods. The middle two weeks in early and mid-October were skipped and not issued. If calculated cumulatively, it is often mistaken as two missed periods. This is a clear and obvious fact. The first period of February is also currently being shipped and will be publicly sold soon. Therefore, since late October of last year, we have been very regretful that the number of public sales periods has not been fixed, but we dare say that no periods have been missed. As for the lack of quantity, it is sometimes true. There are many reasons for this, but the quantity specified in the bureau's announcement shall prevail. As for other private deductions, it is difficult for the bureau to monitor all of them, and it is difficult to prevent petty theft. We hope that people from all walks of life will report them at any time. As for the incomplete flour allocation, we have agreed with the relevant parties to make up for it soon. In short, since the black market for rice was cut off, the rice distribution is the main source of food for the people. As the department in charge, we will do our best to improve it. (A table of public sales for each period is attached separately.) Respectfully, Shanghai Special Municipality Grain Bureau, February 3rd, 32nd year."

### On Guiding Idle Capital to Promote Production in Chinese-Owned Factories
— Li Quanshi

According to the Shanghai Economic Yearbook, there is approximately 8 billion yuan of idle capital existing in Shanghai society. In the past, this huge amount of idle capital was used in foreign exchange, scalping, cloth, foreign stocks, food, and real estate. Since the authorities have been actively cracking down on speculation, the scope of activities for idle capital has been narrowing. If this huge financial power is not guided into the right track of production, it will seek objects for its restless movement at any time and anywhere, disrupting the stability of Shanghai's economy. In recent years, due to the special environment and the ever-changing international political and economic situation, those who possess capital consider it more profitable to engage in speculation and seek exorbitant profits. Furthermore, due to the instability of the currency system and the high prices of goods, the income from deposit interest is not enough to offset the loss in the value of money. As a result, fixed-term deposits in banks have drastically decreased. Even if there are some current deposits, they are only temporary in nature, ready for speculative use at any time, thus becoming a type of idle capital that fuels the speculative market.

Currently, while the authorities are actively cracking down on speculation in a passive manner, they should also actively guide idle capital into production channels, turning speculation into investment to increase the supply of goods. However, based on the experience of earning profits over the past few years, those who possess idle capital believe that the use of funds will hardly arouse their interest unless the following three conditions are met: (1) a huge absorption capacity, (2) a high degree of variability, and (3) substantial profits. Currently, the only market in Shanghai that can meet the conditions for absorbing idle capital is the Chinese stock market. Therefore, after the authorities cracked down on speculation, the inflow of idle capital into the Chinese stock market is an inevitable trend. Under the premise of centralizing and strengthening the work of various production departments to adapt to the wartime economic system, the inflow of idle capital into the Chinese stock market, transforming the nature of harming society into funds for enhancing production, is a gratifying thing from the perspective of national financial and economic policies and the people's livelihood.

However, as a result of high prices and rampant speculation in recent years, the general public has somewhat of a fearful attitude towards market activities. Therefore, the inflow of idle capital into the Chinese stock market has stimulated a general rise in Chinese stock prices. Later, due to the unclear understanding of investment and speculation, it caused undue anxiety, leading to rumors of controlling Chinese stock price limits and cracking down on speculation, which were widespread. We know that cracking down on speculation and eliminating the black market are the consistent policies of the authorities to safeguard wartime finance and protect the people's livelihood. All citizens should always sincerely support this. Therefore, the inflow of idle capital into the Chinese stock market, turning speculation into investment, is also something that the industrial and commercial sectors have been seeking day and night. If the rise in Chinese stock prices is considered to be a sign of speculation, then abandoning eating for fear of choking is not the way to implement wartime economic policies, maintain production, and protect people's livelihood.

Guiding idle capital into production channels is something that the authorities and society eagerly hope for, and it is an important item in the process of implementing wartime economic policies. In principle, there is no problem. What should be discussed now is the method of transforming idle capital into production funds, that is, how can the two major sources of idle capital remaining in society be incorporated into production channels? We must realize that although there are as many as 8 billion yuan of idle capital in Shanghai, they are all scattered funds without a proper organization. Just look at the wandering of idle capital, sometimes engaging in foreign exchange and sometimes in cloth. Controlling and managing it will only cause idle capital to flow from one speculative market to another, and it cannot be thoroughly prevented and used for the benefit of the country. Therefore, guiding idle capital into production, building a capital market, and promoting Chinese stock trading seem to be simple and effective methods. Furthermore, establishing a trading place for Chinese commercial and industrial securities was publicly advocated before the war. The results of the trial implementation in recent years seem to be considerable. Moreover, Chinese stocks are suitable for the above-mentioned three conditions for stable investment. The prosperity of Chinese stock trading allows the poor and weak production sector in our country to obtain the necessary funds in the open market, directly increasing the productivity of the production sector, and indirectly increasing the materials needed for wartime. Therefore, the flourishing of Chinese stock trading is a phenomenon with more advantages than disadvantages in this extraordinary period. Even if it is not promoted, how can it be limited?

Some say that the current trading of Chinese stocks is speculation rather than investment. If that is the case, then starting a production business can also be regarded as speculation rather than investment. The nature of Chinese stocks is an investment security, not a speculative chip. The current rise in Chinese stock prices is a necessary reflection of the rise in prices of the materials represented by Chinese stocks. The increase in the value of factory assets leads to an increase in the value of Chinese stocks backed by materials, which is also an inevitable trend. Therefore, to prevent Chinese stock prices from rising, we must first seek to prevent the prices of general goods from rising. And the unchanging dividend does not affect the unchanging stock price. This phenomenon is not only true in our country, but all countries have this experience during wartime. For example, the International Economic Weekly reported the situation of the Japanese stock market in 1942 as shown in the table below:

The recent rise in Japanese stock prices is unprecedented. Although the margin deposit has been repeatedly increased, those who seek them are still not slack. The increase in stock value is a reflection of the increase in the value of industrial tools. Industrial development is an element of increasing materials. The increase in materials can show the fullness of national power and is a prerequisite for victory in the war. In the era of East Asian nations seeking liberation, striving for industrial development is an essential task. Then, how can stock trading, which promotes the flow of production funds, be restricted?

Some believe that the rise in stock market prices is enough to stimulate the rise in commodity prices. This is putting the cart before the horse, because stocks represent materials, and the rise in commodity prices causes stock prices to rise, not the rise in stock prices stimulating the rise in commodity prices. We should recognize this point so as not to mistake investment for speculation. If various restrictions are imposed on the trading of Chinese stocks, the resulting malpractices will be enough to force the huge amount of idle capital in society to escape or flow back to the channels of hoarding and speculation. It is not a way to enforce wartime economic policies and stabilize people's livelihoods, and the lack of funds, reduced production, and unemployment of workers in Chinese-owned factories, is this stabilizing society or disrupting society! Is it building a wartime economy or harming a wartime economy? This is a question that can be decided without discussion. Moreover, what percentage of this 8 billion yuan of idle capital has flowed into the Chinese stock market? There is no statistics yet. In this era of strained industrial funds, it is not a problem to have idle capital fully incorporated into production. We only need to look at the trend of the evolution of equity capital in Japan in the past five years to know the necessity of expanding production funds during wartime!

The total capital of Shanghai's industrial sector certainly cannot be compared with Japan, but if all 8 billion yuan are invested in the Chinese stock market, compared with Japan's industrial capital, it is still like a small witch seeing a great witch. In this era of East Asian nations competing with Britain and the United States for survival, we should take on a portion of the responsibility, develop production, enrich wartime materials, and enable us to achieve final victory in the Pacific War. Therefore, allowing the open trading of Chinese stocks, enabling the industrial sector to obtain the necessary funds to enhance production capacity, seems to be a wise measure. If a few entrepreneurs raise stock market prices without rectifying the content of their businesses, then we should also rise up to condemn them and impose public opinion sanctions.

### Enthusiastic Individuals from Chinese and Japanese Circles Encourage This Newspaper to Support Education; Mayor Chen Donates a Large Sum to Reward Needy Students; Mr. Taketoyo Ayatsuhiko Makes Generous Donations

Since the launch of the Fourth Annual Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, we have been honored with praise from all sectors of society. While we are moved and encouraged, we are also deeply ashamed. Yesterday, we were honored by Mayor Chen's generous donation and encouragement. Mr. Ayatsuhiko Ayatsu of Japan sent money from Tokyo, more than 11,000 yuan, to support our newspaper's education assistance movement. We are also deeply impressed by the enthusiastic donations from people from all walks of life to benefit students and cultivate youth. We hereby express our sincere gratitude on behalf of the aided students.

Mayor Chen's Letter

Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from Mayor Chen Gongbo, stating, "Recently, I have seen that your newspaper is raising scholarships to benefit needy students, which I deeply appreciate. At this difficult time, cultivating talent is particularly urgent. Gongbo respectfully expresses his enthusiasm and concern for this endeavor. I am enclosing 5,000 yuan in national currency for your review and acceptance, to be used for scholarships, and I hope you will work hard to promote it for greater achievement. Yours sincerely, Chen Gongbo, February 2nd."

Mr. Ayatsuhiko Ayatsu's Letter

Recently, Mr. Ryoichiro Kimura and Mr. Docha Hirao of the Shanghai branch of the Asahi Shimbun delivered a remittance of 11,111.20 yuan from Mr. Ayatsuhiko Ayatsu of Tokyo, to be donated as scholarships, and enclosed a letter stating, "Recently, the lives of poor people in China, who are suffering from hunger and cold, are everywhere. And young students who are deprived of education due to poverty are experiencing a great spiritual pain. Recognizing this, Shen Bao has launched social movements such as scholarship assistance and poverty relief. This benevolent and righteous act is admirable. The education of young men and women should not be neglected for a moment, because young students bear the important task of building a new order in East Asia, and to eliminate the evil influence of the United States and Britain in East Asia, the people of East Asia must endure all hardships and strive hard. Chinese young students are the future masters. We must not allow poor students who are unable to attend school to lose their education. Japan, which is closely related to China, expresses its concern about this situation. Now, Mr. Ayatsuhiko Ayatsu, residing in Kinnocho, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, has generously donated more than 10,000 yuan and entrusted it to us for transfer. According to Mr. Ayatsu's father, Mr. Koji Ayatsu, he was also one of the most sympathetic to the poor people of China in the past, a true friend of the Chinese people. This time, Mr. Ayatsuhiko Ayatsu generously donated a large sum to benefit the people. We hope that those who feel the same way will have a heart of compassion."

### Gratitude to the Lun Society

The Lun Society, organized by Shanghai's leading paper industry figures and business leaders, has always been generous and enthusiastic in supporting the scholarships organized by this newspaper in the past. They have repeatedly donated large sums of money. The promotion of this newspaper's scholarship movement owes a great deal to the efforts of the gentlemen of the Lun Society. To express our respect, we have specially presented the society with a plaque inscribed "Nurturing Talents in Yingcun Village." Today, the Scholarship Committee of this newspaper will select a commissioner to deliver the plaque to the society, accompanied by Mr. Lu Shoulun of the society. All expenses related to the plaque will be paid by this newspaper and no funds will be used from the scholarship fund.

Contributions from All Sides: Colleagues Are Deeply Grateful

Brief Comment

### Friends of China Donate Funds for Education - The Righteous Deed of Mr. Takehiko Yoshizu

The reader assistance fund of this newspaper has received contributions from all sectors of society in the past, especially this year. This proves that the positive significance of this initiative has been extremely approved by people from all walks of life. Yesterday, Mr. Takehiko Yoshizu, a Friend of China, remitted over 10,000 yuan from Tokyo, entrusting the Shanghai branch of the Asahi Shimbun to forward it to this newspaper. The main point of the original letter stated: "The young students of China are the masters of the future. How can we bear to let them drop out of school? Japan is closely related, and seeing this situation, we express our concern." Mr. Yoshizu's father was also a true friend of the Chinese people who sympathized with the poor in China. The main motive of this sincere enthusiasm is always to care for the future masters of China and not to let them drop out of school, expressing Japan's sympathy of sharing weal and woe. In addition to expressing our gratitude, this newspaper solemnly informs all young Chinese people that Mr. Yoshizu is the first to donate funds for education among friendly people, and we hope that more enthusiastic friendly people will follow suit and not let Mr. Yoshizu be the only one. At the same time, we hope that the young students who receive assistance will humbly accept the honor of being the future masters of China, study hard, and set this as their goal, in order to live up to the eager expectations of those who donate. We are also very grateful to Mr. Ryoichiro Kimura and Mr. Tocha Hirao, the heads of the Shanghai branch of the Asahi Shimbun, for promoting the reader assistance campaign of this newspaper in Japan, which has had a great impact. We also admire Mr. Hirao's kind assistance in expressing his opinion at the previous winter relief symposium convened by this newspaper, calling on friendly overseas Chinese to sympathize.

### Statement by Director Hirota of the Information Department

The Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office held a routine reception for the Chinese press corps of this city at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road yesterday (3rd) at 3:00 PM. More than ten reporters from various newspapers attended. From the embassy, Director Hirota of the Information Department, Trustee Guo Zongxian, and Mr. Mizoguchi Noboru were present. Lieutenant Kantei Tanaka of the Navy News Department also attended. First, Director Hirota of the Information Department made a statement, roughly saying that this time he returned to China to investigate the situation of the people in the country during the war, and he firmly believed that Japan would win the final victory in this Greater East Asia War. While I was in Tokyo, Roosevelt and Churchill of the United States and Britain held the so-called Roo-Chu Conference in Casablanca. The content was still that the United States and Britain stood on the same line, hoping to jointly resist the war against Japan, Germany, and Italy. And their so-called joint statement made people even more surprised. On the other hand, since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, it has repeatedly achieved unprecedented results, and the Japanese Navy has controlled the South Pacific and Solomon Islands, obtaining abundant resources. Recently, the Japanese Navy has quickly achieved unprecedented results in Solomon Islands, obtaining even greater victories. In short, this war is not simply a matter of purity. Therefore, our operations are based on the belief that we will never stop fighting until the final victory. China's participation in the war this time can further strengthen our beliefs and firm our will, and we will definitely win the final victory. Finally, we had a long discussion on important issues such as the National Government's order to implement the removal of the yellow symbols from the national flag on a regular basis and the recovery of the ancestral border, until 5:00 PM.

### Forgetting to Bring ID Card When Going Out – Fine of Five Yuan – Those with Damaged ID Cards – Fined Ten Yuan If Found

Shanghai News reports that the authorities of the French Concession have recently found that many citizens do not wear their ID cards, or their ID cards are damaged, and many citizens have lost their ID cards and have not applied for replacement at the police station.

Those with damaged IDs will be fined ten yuan as a warning. In addition, the Baojia authorities have found that the work of the police team members is often ineffective and negligent in their duties. In order to improve this situation, it is specially stipulated that police team members who are more than thirty minutes late for their posts will be fined five yuan, those who are negligent in their duties will be fined one thousand yuan, and those who lose their armbands will be fined twenty yuan.

### The Crowd Spending the Abolished New Year

— Xu Yuzhang

The leisurely years of 1942 have passed like a wisp of smoke. The scene before us is clearly another "year's beginning" coming, and a brand new "New Year's Day," with all the appearance of a so-called "New Year" repeating and filling the streets, entertainment venues, and restaurants.

These days are the most active days for young people, especially in this bustling city. Whether in theaters, dance halls, dim sum shops, or the gambling dens that are the source of all evils, there are young people crowding everywhere. Even students and shopkeepers who usually lead a serious life will bring the money given to them by their parents or bosses to gamble. But they have all forgotten the country in distress, which is expecting them to have the spirit of perseverance and diligence to face the current crisis in the future.

Cigarettes costing hundreds of gold per box and oranges costing tens of gold each will be bought up by countless high-class Chinese people, either for meaningless consumption or to curry favor with dignitaries. Banquets costing thousands of gold are held, and lucky money packets containing hundreds of gold are given out, which is also common. Their luxurious habits have completely forgotten that the vast majority of compatriots are immersed in deep water and hot fire.

There are also groups of so-called "hidden poor" people who have no chance to get rich and no leisure days. They carry the burden of their high cost of living every day and make a final struggle on the hunger line. They don't know that "New Year" is enjoyable, they don't know what all the fun is about, they only know how to work hard and seek a bright path. (Move compensation to help education)

### Musings on New Year's Eve

— Ru Ling

This year's New Year's Eve is different from previous years. With tight money supply, how many households can afford to eat their fill? In the midst of the urgent drumming of the New Year, the first thing that comes to my mind is collecting old debts. The business community regards the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and New Year's Eve as the three festivals, and collects debts according to the festivals, which is called the Three Festival Account. Before a festival passes, all night long, even after dawn, the roads are still crowded. Ordinary poor friends are forced to have no choice. The stupid ones seek death, and the smart ones evade debts. If not, there are still a few tattered cotton-padded jackets at home, which are taken to the Changsheng Pawnshop to pawn, to survive this remaining year with hunger and cold. Cai Tieweng's poem says: "There is no place to hide from the debt-collecting platform, debts accumulate throughout the year and are urged on one night, the shop door is closed to the pawnshop, and you still have to walk with a lantern." The so-called "Wang Xiaoer's New Year, is worse every year." The poor friends see that a certain mansion eats croaker dried fish costing one thousand yuan from Zhiweiguan, and buys a large vegetable plate costing seven hundred yuan from a certain company, and they still don't care. It is truly worth crying together. Huang Xingzhou's New Year's Eve poem says: "The first year is happy for the poor, and there has never been a debt collector." At this time and place, how many poor boys are not followed by debt collectors!

The ancient poems describing New Year's Eve mostly express more complaints than excitement. Bai Juyi's "Sick eyes sleep less, not keeping vigil, old heart feels more, facing spring again," and Song Zengqi's "New Year's wine gradually fades, homesickness is bitter, the night lamp faces, the traveler's sorrow is lonely," are either thinking of home in a foreign land, or suffering from poverty and old age. As for Huang Zhongze, the poet from Changzhou who thought that "scholars are useless"? But in "Accidental Two Poems on New Year's Eve of Gui Si," he complained a lot, saying: "I spend my time groaning this evening every year, the children laugh secretly in front of the lamp; How can you know that I regret myself, I wasted my energy to be a poet," although it is a feeling at the end of the pen, it reads with deep emotion. Alas, how sad is New Year's Eve under the pen of a scholar?

Winter ends and spring returns, the old goes and the new comes. The poor boy spends the New Year, and learns from Zheng Banqiao's two sentences: "White water in the bottle is offered to the ancestors, plum blossoms outside the window serve as breakfast."

### Fourth Place in Essay Contest - My Plan for This Year

— Huang Wei

I am a teacher in a small school, and my job is to educate elementary school students. My plan for this year is how to educate this group of elementary school students.

As a woman, I am working as an elementary school teacher in a small town. I dare not consider myself a thoughtful person at the moment, and I dare not take the revival of education as my responsibility. Since I started teaching, three years have passed in an instant. The hardship of the life of an elementary school teacher in recent years is a well-known fact; however, I have finally stayed. Nothing else, just for the children. "Save our children!" I have personally taught and comforted the children for three years, how can I easily abandon them?

The days were crawling slowly, only my children can make me feel it flying. One year has passed, and another year has passed. What has passed is time, and what is left is the trace. Thinking deeply at night: only the death of the heart is the most sad, and only the numbness is the most hopeless. For the sake of the children, for the sake of the future of the children, how can I not be diligent and encourage myself? The following is my new plan for this year:

The first thing I want to do this year - that is, the first part of my plan - is to step up the physical training of the children. Look, although they are all eleven or twelve years old, they look like adults when they put on the big gowns. It's not that cold, but they put on cotton robes; this situation is really too inferior compared to the elementary school students in the East and the West.

We are used to seeing the weak physique of Chinese children in general. Regarding this mystery, some people say that the Chinese race is too weak! The twilight energy passed down for thousands of years has a tendency to accumulate too much to return. Indeed, how arduous is our responsibility for the physical training of children today!

Secondly, regarding the intellectual education of children, I advocate that this year should be particularly innovated, that is, to read less dead books and to contact and recognize nature more. It is strange to say that although my small school is located in a rural social small city, because it is adjacent to Shanghai, it has been poisoned by modern urban civilization. Among the children, the vast majority do not recognize the five grains. I think this needs to be actively improved. The way to do this: reading a book on botany is not as good as letting them go to the countryside to learn how to farm once; drawing a map is not as good as traveling far away. Within the possible range, the intellectual training of children should try to replace the dead with the living, and replace the dull and boring books with lively and interesting knowledge and experiences. This is my suggestion.

The noise in the classroom is always like the buzzing of mosquitoes on a summer night, and it will never stop. The children are lovely, but they are so naughty. Just take the matter of private conversations in the classroom, the processing is troublesome enough. You can't pull a long face and shout loudly at them to listen quietly - this will make the children afraid of you, even hate you. If you think the children are afraid of you and hate you, can you still ask them to listen to you? If you don't listen to you, what do you teach? However, you can't just let them make trouble, just let them make trouble, what do you teach? Yes, teaching children is difficult, and to step up my training of them in the three aspects of awareness, physical education, and intellectual education this year, especially is it easy to talk about! Although, in order to ask for the perfection of the future results, we must not refuse the hard work of sowing today! (According to Ms. Huang, a native of Hai'ning, graduated from Beijing Normal University, and is currently a teacher at Xiashi Elementary School)

### The World's Teacher

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

(1) (2)

"A good fellow, Rivers," Chips would always say when telling Mrs. Wickett this story for the twelfth time. "In class—er—not the most outstanding of boys. I remember he could never understand—er—verbs. And now—er—I saw in the papers they've made him—er—a baronet. That's really something—er—that's really something."

One morning in 1908, Sir John and Chips walked arm in arm around the deserted cricket field, and said, "Chips, old boy, I hear you've been having some arguments with Ralston. I was sorry to hear the news for your sake—but I want you to know that the governors are all with you. We don't like that fellow very much. Very clever, very capable, but a bit too clever, if you ask me. Through activities on the stock exchange, he's said to have doubled the school's funds. He may well have done it, but a young fellow like him needs watching. So, if he tries any more of his tricks on you, you can tell him very politely that he can clear off. The governors don't want you to resign. Brookfield wouldn't be the same without you, they know that. We all know that. You can stay here until you're a hundred, if you like—indeed, we hope you will."

Whether at that time or later, Chips could not continue whenever he recalled this point.

He thus remained at Brookfield, trying as much as possible to avoid contact with Ralston. In 1911, Ralston left his post, 'to better himself'; he was appointed headmaster of a larger public school. The man who succeeded him here was named Chatteris, whom Chips liked; he was even younger than Ralston had been then—thirty-four years old. Everyone said that he had a good reputation; in any case, he was modern (an honors graduate in natural science), kind, and sympathetic. He recognized Brookfield's traditions in Chips and he politely, intelligently, accepted the situation without taking offense. (30)

### Anti-Anglo-American Association Generously Donates to Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund

Since its launch, the "Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund" initiated by this newspaper has received considerable support from all sectors of society. The fundraising goal is set at 200,000 yuan. First, Mr. Xu Guanqun generously donated 10,000 yuan worth of pharmaceuticals from the Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory, and our newspaper's colleagues donated 5,000 yuan from the saved spring banquet expenses. Yesterday, the Anti-Anglo-American Association donated 5,000 yuan (the association also contributed 5,000 yuan to this newspaper's Readers' Scholarship Fund), and Mr. Wu Qizhou generously donated 4,000 yuan, distributing rice porridge and benefiting poor teachers. Our newspaper colleagues are deeply grateful. In terms of funding, given time, it will not be difficult to achieve the expected goals. Therefore, relief work will be actively promoted. It is hoped that the authorities of various elementary schools in this city, together with the teaching staff, will provide the following reports as completely as possible and send them directly to this column.

(1) The number of teachers and staff in each elementary school, names, ages, genders, monthly salaries, and family size, and the monthly expenses of the entire family or individual.

(2) Health conditions in the last semester. (Such as the number of sick leaves per person per semester, ratios, types of illnesses suffered, amount of medical expenses paid, and how they were raised, etc.)
