### Further Discussion on the Way to National Prosperity and Decline

Yesterday's discussion on the way to national prosperity and decline led us to place our greatest expectations on the strengthening of the National Government and, even more so, on the political leaders setting an example to lead the entire nation in implementing sound national policies, gradually leading our country to prosperity. We believe that the establishment of national policies and the soundness of government institutions are of utmost importance. However, the fundamental issue is to eliminate the habit of "hypocrisy" and promote a spirit of practicality.

The two words "hypocrisy" are the greatest malady in personal cultivation because those accustomed to hypocrisy are full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, yet disregard honesty and trustworthiness when facing real situations, which will inevitably harm them in the long run. As for a government, if it merely announces dazzling political programs or policies or establishes fashionable and large institutions, but in fact does not do practical work, then it will not be able to gain the trust of the people internally and will inevitably be ridiculed by friendly nations externally. Therefore, Chinese political theorists throughout history, from Confucius and Mencius onwards, have always warned those in power about the importance of "sincerity." "Tang, with seventy miles of land, and King Wen, with a hundred miles," were eventually able to unify the entire country. The way to their prosperity lies in the single word "sincerity," which is also the spirit of diligent practice. Looking at modern times, Yuan Shikai was not without great talent and bold strategies, and Chiang Kai-shek was not without political opportunism, but the Hongxian Empire lasted only eighty-three days, and the "War of Resistance Regime" could only flee as far as "China's Kamchatka." The reason for this is that they failed to gain the trust of the people and proclaim justice to the world. Furthermore, the British betrayal of the Indian people and the hypocrisy of the Anglo-American Atlantic Charter have ignited a nationwide rebellion in India and changed the complexion of the entire Southwest Pacific. The reason why we cite so many historical facts today is simply to point out that when it comes to the way to national prosperity and decline, even under the ancient adage of "one who walks a hundred steps is halfway at ninety," we still cannot help but expect the government authorities to conduct self-examination and criticism.

Since our friendly nation, Japan, has voluntarily changed its policy towards China, it has added a strong guarantee for the strengthening of the National Government. The Chinese people have longed for this change in Japan's policy towards China for ten years. Now that it has finally been realized, the government should be humble and cautious, seize this precious and hard-won opportunity, and unleash the power of national politics. This is the most important task facing the government today. The constraints and fetters that may have existed in the past no longer exist. With the reins of power firmly in hand, it is necessary to find ways to steer the chariot so that we can advance at full speed. We feel that the current situation is indeed a critical turning point for China's revival and a historic opportunity for the National Government to demonstrate its achievements. Therefore, the government should adopt an attitude of carefully considering and prudently deliberating on policies and measures by widely soliciting public opinion, opening channels for honest advice, and eliminating hypocrisy.

In order to practice and implement national policies, especially to realize all the programs and policies for defending East Asia and building a new China, we oppose impractical official rhetoric, oppose nominal bureaucracy, and oppose inconsistencies between words and deeds, so that every measure taken by the government will yield satisfactory results. Any policy or decree, no matter how moving, should not be easily promulgated or implemented unless there is a certain degree of confidence in its success. This is the first step in practicing "streamlining government," and it is also the first step in strengthening the government's credibility. Otherwise, the people will inevitably complain about "inconsistencies between words and deeds," and the nation's politics will never be enlightened.

In defending East Asia and building a new China today, what the government hopes from the people is nothing more than sincere support and obedience to national policies and decrees, so as to concentrate the nation's human and material resources in the hands of the government. But conversely, from the people's point of view, they hope that the government itself will be sound, first of all, that all sound programs and policies will be effectively implemented, and that all political promises will be guaranteed to be honored. Especially today, within our country, in addition to the National Government, there is also the Chongqing Communist regime, which holds a part of the territory and people. We hope that the National Government will never repeat the crimes of hypocrisy and untrustworthiness committed by the Chongqing Communist regime. In this way, not only will the people in the peaceful areas be able to sincerely support the government, but also the people in the Communist areas will come over at the mere sight of its banner. A nation's transformation from danger and decline to prosperity invariably begins here.

However, people's inability to recognize their own faults is like being unable to see their own faces. Therefore, a mirror is indispensable, and the mirror is not just for reflecting one's own facial imperfections; it also has a positive significance, that is, to see the imperfections and correct them, so that the imperfections disappear completely. At the same time, if there are no imperfections, one can also compare with others and have a greater sense of self-awareness. In politics, such a mirror is even more indispensable. We hope that the government authorities will quickly prepare a fair and accurate mirror. This mirror is the administrative examination or supervisory body within the government and the public opinion organs outside the government. The former has already been established within the National Government. Currently, it only needs to be diligently dusted off so that it does not lose its luster and does not develop obstacles, and so that it can exert its effectiveness in faithfully and accurately reflecting the good and evil of politics, and then seek reform and promotion. The latter has not yet been established, and this is a major defect in our country's politics today. We sincerely hope that this defect will be remedied as soon as possible, so that our government and people can unite as one. Only when "power" and "ability" are properly and closely coordinated can the nation's politics get on the right track, and the nation can transform from decline to prosperity, from poverty to wealth, and from weakness to strength. At this time when the internal and external situation is undergoing profound changes and is favorable to our nation, we cannot but sincerely appeal to await the decision of those in power.

### Special Envoy Zhou Returns to Capital After Completing Mission to Manchuria; Concrete Decisions Made on Sino-Manchurian Economic Cooperation; Foundation for Joint Construction of Greater East Asia Steadily Consolidated

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): Since China declared war on Britain and the United States, the entire nation has embraced the greatest determination to closely cooperate with friendly nations and advance towards the path of completing the Greater East Asia War and the co-existence and co-prosperity of East Asian nations.

Special Envoy Chen completed his mission to Japan and returned to Nanjing on the 18th. Special Envoy Zhou and his party completed their mission to Manchuria on the 9th of this month and returned to China by plane from Dalian. After arriving in Beijing, in addition to exchanging general opinions with various local parties, they also inspected various universities and construction projects before flying back to the capital by plane at 10:00 a.m. on the 25th. Those who went to the airport to welcome them included Chen Chunpu, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan; Zhang Tao, President of the Supreme Court of the Capital; Gu Baoheng, Minister of Food; Deng Zuyu, Director-General of the Capital Police; Ji Ouyi, Commander of the Capital Garrison; He Bingxian, Director-General of the General Affairs Department; Zhou Xuechang, Mayor of Nanjing; Zhou Longyang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Yuan Yuqian, Vice Minister of Industry; Su Decheng, member of the Military Affairs Commission; Ma Xiaotian, Director-General of the Political Security Bureau; Chen Zhishuo, Vice Minister of Finance, leading senior officials of the ministry; Xia, Chief Secretary of the Central Reserve Bank, leading many senior bank staff; and Lu Ronghuan, Manchurian Ambassador to China, and Counselor Zhang, totaling more than 100 people.

Although Special Envoy Zhou looked travel-worn, he was full of energy and showed no signs of fatigue. After exchanging greetings with the welcomers, he returned to his residence by car to rest.

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): At a time when the national relations between China and Manchuria are becoming increasingly cordial and economic cooperation is becoming closer, our government specially appointed Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, as a special ambassador to visit Manchuria on the 8th of this month, and he returned to the capital on the 25th. According to political figures, Special Envoy Zhou's stay in Manchuria was short, only ten days, but it created a new era in the history of Sino-Manchurian relations. Since Special Envoy Zhou's visit to Manchuria, the solidarity and effectiveness of the two countries have become closer, and concrete decisions have been made on the currency issue of economic cooperation. From now on, the foundation for the full cooperation between the two countries in the construction of Greater East Asia will be further consolidated. Our people across the country are particularly encouraged by Special Envoy Zhou's successful completion of his mission, so they are full of boundless optimism for the friendly relations between China and Manchuria, the close unity of the East Asian axis, and the permanent construction of peace in Greater East Asia. During his visit to Manchuria, Special Envoy Zhou visited various political and economic centers of Manchuria, and he also visited the Manchurian Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Showa Iron Works, and the Fushun Coal Mine to inspect the cultivation of Manchuria's war power in great detail. This will be of great benefit to our country's economic construction in the future.

### Japanese Troops Continue to Advance on the Border Between Shanxi and Henan; Remnants of the Chongqing Army on the Verge of Collapse; More Important Officers Lead Their Troops to Surrender

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the front lines in Shanxi, the Japanese army's mopping-up operation against the Chongqing 24th Group Army has reached its most intense stage and is continuing to compress the encirclement, resulting in an increasing number of Chongqing soldiers surrendering. Sun Dianying, commander of the Chongqing New 5th Army, and many officers and generals have also returned to the fold. The Chongqing army in the border area between Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan is now completely collapsing. The comprehensive war situation of the Japanese army since the 24th is recorded as follows: (1) The Japanese army, which launched a fierce attack on Ma Fawu's unit of the Chongqing 40th Army, captured Major General Hou Ruyong, director of the military supplies department of the army, near Jianjiazhuang, 20 kilometers north of Linhong; another Japanese army unit also captured the Chongqing army brigade commander and many others near Huling Village, northwest of Linhong. According to statistics, the Japanese army on the southwest and north roads captured more than 3,000 Chongqing soldiers in total. (2) The Japanese army that broke through the provincial border and advanced eastward, with the cooperation of the army aviation unit, attacked the Chongqing 24th Group Army and the New 5th Army in the Tianjiajing area, annihilating them. In this battle, 300 Chongqing soldiers were captured, and the Japanese army seized one mountain gun, two mortars, and many other war trophies. (3) The Japanese army, which launched a mopping-up operation in the Linqi Plain area, is currently fiercely pursuing the remnants of the Chongqing 40th Army and has captured 220 Chongqing soldiers, seizing two mortars, seven light and heavy machine guns, and other war trophies. Another unit of the Japanese army in the area also launched a fierce attack on the remnants of the Chongqing 27th Army near Wujiawan, 27 kilometers northeast of Lingchuan, and Hu Changqing, commander of the 45th Division of the army, was killed in the battle.

(Another Telegram) A telegram from the front lines in the border area between Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces stated that the Chongqing 24th Group Army's New 5th Army, which had previously suffered a major blow from the encirclement and attack by various units of the Japanese army in the Linxian area, was further destroyed by the attack on Linhong by the North China Japanese Army. The main force of the army was in a state of annihilation. Sun Dianying, commander of the army, fled to Beijiacun, west of Linxian, but because the Japanese army gradually reduced the scope of the encirclement, there was no hope of escaping. He finally surrendered on the afternoon of the 24th. The Chongqing army was extremely agitated by this, and the infighting within the 24th Group Army became more intense. For example, Pang Bingxun, commander of the group army, was greatly alarmed after Lü Chaoyuan, commander of the Provisional 23rd Division, joined the peace camp the year before. Because of his suspicion of the officers and soldiers under his command, he had been holding the families of the officers of the army hostage since the beginning of last year. Also, because of the defection of Liu Yueting's unit under Sun Dianying during the battle in the border area between Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces last year, Sun Dianying was also placed under strict surveillance, which led to a deterioration of the relationship between Pang and Sun, resulting in chaotic military discipline and ineffective orders. The supply of weapons, ammunition, food, clothing, and other supplies to Sun Dianying's unit was also stopped.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the front lines in the southern Taihang Mountains, Liu Yueting, commander of the 24th Division of the Chongqing 24th Group Army, surrendered to the Japanese army on the 24th in Lijiazhai, eight kilometers west of Linhong. In addition, Wang Suiqing, commander of the "3rd Division," and Wang Yanying, commander of the 4th Division, under Sun Dianying, also appeared to be captured by the Japanese army in the mountainous area northwest of Linhong.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the front lines in Shanxi, the Chongqing "25th Group Army" is on the verge of annihilation due to the surrender of Sun Dianying, commander of the New 5th Army, and the death of Hu Changqing, commander of the 45th Division of the 27th Army. According to captured Chongqing soldiers, after the main force of the Chongqing "40th Army" suffered a fatal blow from the westward advancing troops of the Japanese army, Ma Fawu, commander of the army, barely escaped with a few guards to the mountainous area near Tianjiajing, ten kilometers west of Linhong.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the front lines in the border area between Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces on the 25th, the main force of the Chongqing 24th Group Army, about 40,000 men, was surrounded by the Japanese army in the area northwest of Linhong. Although they attempted to break through the encirclement and launch a desperate counterattack, they were eventually defeated by the Japanese army. At about 1:00 a.m. on the 24th, a unit of about 1,000 men from the 106th Division of the Chongqing army, intending to break through the Japanese army's encirclement, launched a counterattack near the area south of Lujiazhuang and Zhaijing under the cover of mortar fire. The Japanese army immediately took the opportunity to launch a surprise attack, inflicting heavy casualties. Another team of the Japanese army surrounded 2,000 Chongqing soldiers in confusion north of Lujiazhuang, and launched a fierce siege, completely annihilating them.

Taiyuan, 25th (Central News Agency): A telegram from a certain location on the front lines in Shanxi on the 24th stated that in order to annihilate the Chongqing "24th Group Army's New 5th Army," the Japanese army's northward advancing units launched a fierce attack along the Beijing-Hankou Railway on the night of the 20th, overcoming steep terrain and advancing all the way. They broke into Linqi, a stronghold of the Chongqing army, at noon on the 23rd, and encircled and annihilated the remaining Chongqing soldiers. On the 24th, Sun Dianying, commander of the Chongqing army, surrendered, and more than 3,000 Chongqing soldiers were captured. At this point, the Chongqing "New 5th Army" is now on the verge of collapse. A small number of remnants are hiding in various villages near Linhong. In order to wipe them out in one fell swoop, the Japanese army launched a mopping-up operation again on the night of the 24th, in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the front lines in southern Shanxi, the Japanese army unit surrounded about 10,000 Chongqing soldiers in the mountainous area on the provincial border near Nanping and Tianjiajing, northeast of Linhong, and launched an annihilation battle against them. By the middle of the night on the 24th, the fierce battle became more intense. Although the Chongqing army repeatedly launched counterattacks, after the fierce attack by the Japanese army, they completely lost their will to fight by the morning of the 25th, and surrenders emerged one after another. For example, after Major General Hou Ruyong, captain of the guerrilla detachment of the Chongqing 40th Army, and others surrendered on the 24th, two Chongqing brigade commander-level major generals (names unknown) and a large number of soldiers also surrendered in the northwest of Linhong. This is enough to prove that the command of the Chongqing army is chaotic and has collapsed, so the surrender of a large unit will be inevitable.

Brief Biography of Sun Dianying

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): Sun Dianying, commander of the New 5th Army of the Chongqing 24th Group Army, has announced his participation in the peace movement in the defense zone of the army, because he was inspired by the personality of Chairman Wang and realized that the war of resistance was not a good plan. According to reports, Sun is from Shandong Province. He was initially in the department of Zhang Zongchang and Chu Yupu, and was transferred from staff officer to commander of a certain brigade. Later, he joined the Northwest Army and served as a division commander under Song Zheyuan under Feng Yuxiang. In the 27th year, the Central Government accepted Feng Yuxiang's suggestion and appointed Sun as the director of the Qinghai Western District Reclamation. Since then, he has fought in Qinghai, Ningxia, Suiyuan and other provinces. In April of the 27th year, Sun left his military post, and his troops were reorganized by the Jin Army into five brigades, directly under the jurisdiction of the Beiping Military Branch. In May, the Beiping Military Branch appointed him as a senior adviser, and later as the commander of the Chabei Security Force. Most recently, he served as the commander of the New 5th Army of the 24th Group Army. He is known for his straightforwardness, bravery, and good fighting skills.

### Newly Appointed Ambassador to Japan, Cai Pei, Gives Talk in Beijing; To Assume Office in Japan Early Next Month

Beijing, 25th (Central News Agency): Cai Pei, the newly appointed Ambassador of the Republic of China to Japan, arrived here at 4:00 p.m. on the 23rd to inspect the situation in the north before taking office in Japan. At 4:00 p.m. on the 24th, he met with the press corps at the Beijing Hotel and gave a talk. He said in general that he had been ordered to serve as the ambassador to Japan. Before taking office, in order to have cordial talks with the authorities of various agencies in Beijing and the relevant Japanese parties, he specially came to Beijing. Although it has only been three months since China joined the war, the wartime system in the country has gradually been prepared, and is steadily moving towards completing the Greater East Asia War. Japan is also assisting China in various aspects, and obtaining independence and autonomy, such as returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. This is a true manifestation of the true spirit of Japan's moral diplomacy, so it is deeply appreciated. The status of various provinces and cities in northern China has become increasingly important since China joined the war, so its mission is also becoming increasingly important. Today, all of us in China must unite to overcome the current major situation. He, as the ambassador to Japan, will follow the guidance of Chairman Wang on the one hand, and is determined to strengthen the friendly relations between China and Japan on the other hand. The whole country has great expectations for the appointment of former Ambassador to China Shigemitsu as Foreign Minister. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu has been stationed in China for many years, and has made great efforts to adjust the friendly relations between China and Japan in the past.

### Tokyo Shimbun of Japan Publishes Article Analyzing Chongqing Organization; Inevitable Trend Towards Collapse

Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency): The Tokyo Shimbun here, in its "Current Affairs Column" on the 24th, entitled "Chongqing Abandoned by the World," pointed out that the collapse of Chongqing is inevitable. The full text is very detailed in its analysis and explanation. The gist is recorded as follows: "Chongqing is now in a very serious danger. Whether Jiang and others in Chongqing are aware of this or not, the reality is that they are moving towards collapse. We do not want to hope that the Chongqing side will reflect on its mistakes. We only hope that the 400 million people of China and the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia will grasp this accurate historical trend and not be mistaken. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing side has in fact become a vassal of Britain and the United States, but it is still attempting to hinder the expansion of the political power of the National Government. When the National Government announced its participation in the war, the situation made even greater progress. The new China, under the leadership of the state, is determined to destroy the Chongqing side in order to revive China. Recently, the National Government's abolition of extraterritorial rights and recovery of concessions has laid the first foundation for China's revival. In the future, with the progress of the Greater East Asia War, China's revival and construction will be gradually promoted, and the collapse of the Chongqing side will inevitably accelerate. The Chongqing side has not given up its war of resistance, and has been controlled by Britain and the United States. Therefore, its concept of war of resistance has no other way but to rely on Britain and the United States. For nearly a century, the people of East Asia have repeatedly taught Britain and the United States about freedom, humanity, and universal love. Now, in order to establish true justice, the Greater East Asia War has broken out. Leaving aside whether the Chongqing side's war of resistance can save China, its betrayal of the country and nation has become obvious. There are three points that can be made about its corrupted nature: First, the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are the main force in the anti-Axis camp. Therefore, the settlement of post-war issues will inevitably be decided by these three countries. Second, because Britain and the United States are determined to prioritize Europe, it can be clearly stated that they do not attach importance to the existence of the Chongqing side. Third, the world situation is now breeding great changes. In this great change of the future, no matter what, the Chongqing side's inevitable trend towards collapse is the most obvious matter of reason."

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders All Agencies to Cooperate in Establishing Public Security

### New Weapons in Japan's War Science (1)

Type 96 15cm Howitzer Shell

The Greater East Asia War is a scientific decisive battle. Cultivating the power to defeat Britain and the United States, not relaxing the offensive, adhering to the initiative in the war, and thereby grasping the key to victory, depends on the advancement of science, production, and technology, so that frontline soldiers have sophisticated and sufficient armaments. The second "Army Technical Achievement Award" was held on the 14th of this month, awarding meritorious service to those who have made contributions to the "war science and technology front." At this time of decisive battle, it has particularly important significance. The following is a selection of several items to report on, in order to see a glimpse of the whole. In the opening battles of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has already achieved the lightning warfare in Malaya, the capture of the Batang Peninsula, and the siege of the Singapore fortress, which are recorded in history. This naturally relies on the result of decades of dedicated research in army technology. One of the greatest weapons that enabled the Japanese army to achieve this great achievement is the "Type 96 15cm Howitzer," the most sophisticated of field heavy artillery. The power of this artillery is now becoming a threat to the world. In the mountain battles of Burma and the battles for control of the Southwest Pacific, the Japanese mechanized forces relied on this and were able to play their invincible songs of triumph. The inventor, Lieutenant Colonel Yaguchi of the 1st Army Technology Research Institute, was also awarded for his achievement. The following is an overview of the artillery from Lieutenant Colonel Yaguchi:

The design of the Type 96 15cm Howitzer began nine years ago in Showa 9 (1934). At that time, the world was around the time of Germany's declaration of rearmament, and the mechanization of the army was gradually becoming the center of discussion. With the development of automobiles, the action of artillery began to change from the era of being towed by horses to the era of self-propelled vehicles mounted on automobiles. At this time, each country was conducting fierce competition in secret regarding research on new weapons, without any reference or imitation. The Allied Germany, in the absence of any reference model, completely opened up a road full of thorns from an independent standpoint and conducted research.

Japanese artillery had already reached the world standard. Lieutenant General Arisaka's Type 31 field gun and General Ogata's Type 45 field gun, etc., are still used as field heavy artillery and have repeatedly achieved excellent results. We, in view of the importance of the mission to create weapons of a new era, did not dare to stop our thinking for a moment even in sleep. At that time, those who assisted me in the research also included my assistant, now Lieutenant Iizawa Kozo, a member of the First Technology Research Institute, Mr. Kimoto Torakichi, a former employee of the Research Institute, and Mr. Ichikawa Yukiji, a former engineer of the Osaka Army Arsenal. They all devoted their entire energies to research.

The first point of our research was the buffer (spring device) of the artillery mounted on the automobile. Automobiles traveling at high speed on uneven ground are different from the original situation of being towed by horses. The delicate parts of the artillery are easily damaged by bumping, so there is a device to prevent the artillery from jumping when traveling at high speed, and when it is necessary to quickly change the shooting posture, another extremely simple spring device must be prepared. The success of this buffer can be said to be the life of the artillery, and the hit efficiency of the artillery is also of great importance. No matter what speed the artillery is running at, the efficiency of hit is more important than everything else. Continuing the unfinished work of our predecessors, our research, although so simple, also encountered difficulties. What needs to be studied now is how to harmonize the weight and power of the artillery. The new artillery that we have created is a field heavy artillery, so its action must be light and fast. However, the greater the range, the faster the initial velocity of the projectile must be, and the larger the cannon, the stronger the force given to the projectile, so its weight must also be correspondingly heavy. Therefore, on the one hand, it is difficult to harmonize the requirement for light and fast action, and on the other hand, the requirement for a large and heavy cannon.

The weight of this 15cm howitzer is about four to five tons, the weight of the projectile is about 40 kilograms, and the range is usually from 12,000 to 15,000 meters. The performance of the artillery that we have completed is in no way inferior compared to this standard, and it is indeed a very perfect creation.

This was in the summer of Showa 12 (1937). After several trials, our efforts were finally blessed by heaven and rewarded, resulting in the crystallization of three years of research. In the summer of that year, the historical China Incident ignited the flames of war in North China. In view of the results of the tests, the military authorities had already decided to adopt this heavy artillery. Only [number missing] were made at that time. However, this was an excellent opportunity. In September of Showa 12 (1937), I brought the artillery that I had created to Dagu and stood on the front line. The battles of Zhuozhou and Baoding on September 14th, and the battle near Dou Dianzhen, were the days when this Type 96 15cm Howitzer first showed its skills. I will never forget the battle situation on that day. After several actual battles, it proved that it was extremely perfect and there was almost no need for further improvement. Although the history of this heavy artillery is short, it is in no way inferior compared to the enemy weapons captured in the Greater East Asia War. Recalling the scene when the research was completed, it seemed to be divinely assisted. I am deeply grateful for the unyielding efforts of my collaborators.

### British and American Forces Disregard Heavy Losses and Attempt to Fight German Forces to the Death; German New Type Tiger Tank Unit Achieves Success, Destroying 41 Anti-Axis Tanks

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – The German official news agency announced last night that after German-Italian forces successfully resisted the continuous fierce attacks by British forces in the southern part of Red Point, Tunisia, the center of the Tunisian battleground has shifted to the western region of the Axis bridgehead on Saturday and Sunday. The German-Italian allied forces also repelled the attacking British and American forces in the areas of Mejez el-Bab, Bou Arada, and El Aroussa. General Anderson, launching an attack from the west along a 150-kilometer battle line, disregarding the severity of the losses, deployed his powerful tank forces in an attempt to fight to the death. However, the intense artillery fire of the Axis defenders scattered the attacking tanks, and the Axis armored units followed up with a powerful counterattack. Within a few hours, 41 anti-Axis tanks were either burned or destroyed. Berlin claimed that the success of this tank battle was due to the use of the German new type "Tiger" tank unit. This giant Tiger tank has proven to be unmatched by anti-Axis tanks. In addition, Axis bombers braved dense anti-aircraft fire and destroyed 13 anti-Axis tanks behind the battle line. A Reuters reporter from General Eisenhower's headquarters said that on Friday morning, the battle extending from Enfidaville to Mejez el-Bab became even more intense. A part of the US Second Corps also joined the battle north and south of the highway from Pont du Fahs to Mateur. Axis infantry, assisted by artillery, launched a fierce counterattack, and the fierce battle continued in the north. The far left end of the anti-Axis line there is guarded by French rebel forces. Fierce battles are also taking place in the areas of "Longstop Hill" north of the Tunis highway in the Mejez el-Bab area and the "Banana Ridge" to the south. The intensity of the battle there is only seen after the anti-Axis forces were defeated in Djebel Bou Kouazi. The German News Agency said that in the southern section of the war zone, the New Zealand forces of the British Eighth Army only launched a weak assault on the Axis forward bases on Friday. A Reuters reporter acknowledged last night that the Axis forces in that area are still making very determined counterattacks. The German official news agency, reviewing the Tunisian battles of the past few days, said that on April 21, German troops launched an attack into the British positions in the western area, destroying five artillery pieces, capturing 400 people, and seizing 40 motorcycles loaded with military supplies. On April 23, British forces launched an offensive from the west along a 150-kilometer battle line, advancing to the northeast. However, they were resisted by German forces and turned to the southeast, where they are still fighting fiercely. On April 22 and 23, British forces attacked on the southern front. All of the British offensives in April were broken by the defenders, and the British suffered heavy losses. When the British forces attempted to cross the mountains blocking the coast here on April 23, a fierce hand-to-hand battle ensued, which is still ongoing. The German Air Force, in order to assist the land forces in combat, has been using fast bombers to continuously launch low-altitude attacks on anti-Axis artillery and anti-aircraft artillery day and night, and to disperse anti-Axis tanks and motorized transport teams, causing heavy losses to the anti-Axis attacking forces.

### British First Army Under Anderson Begins Large-Scale Offensive

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) – A military correspondent for the DNB news agency reports that there has been a new turn in the Tunisian War. The British First Army has now begun a large-scale attack on the western front of the Axis bridgehead. As expected, General Anderson is launching a major attack on the German hill positions behind Mejez el-Bab. However, in the area south of here, there are also strong British forces advancing east and southeast. Further south, the British forces are also being assisted by French rebel forces, who have repeatedly been frustrated in the Djebel Mansour area in the past few weeks. This force forms the right wing of General Anderson's force, and its target is Pont du Fahs, a transportation hub that is as important to the German-Italian forces as Mejez el-Bab is to the anti-Axis forces. Most of General Anderson's tank units are participating in the attack on Pont du Fahs. The British infantry is mainly fighting against the other hill positions facing Djebel Ang and Mejez el-Bab. The anti-Axis artillery is far superior in strength to the Axis forces and is evenly distributed on the battle line. Before each major attack, hundreds of artillery pieces continuously fire rapidly for several hours, so the anti-Axis forces have made slight progress in various places. Currently, the greatest success in anti-Axis military strategy is the progress west of Pont du Fahs and southeast of Mejez el-Bab. British troops have used a large number of tanks in combat there. After the first day of battle, the British tank units lost up to a quarter of the total number of tanks, which shows that the German resistance is strong and effective. The anti-Axis forces have suffered great manpower losses in various areas, but new troops are constantly being prepared to replenish them. On the whole, the British pressure increased further on Saturday morning. The fierce defensive battles along the entire western front are continuing and becoming more intense. Conversely, on the southern front, the enemy's attack has obviously weakened. In the coastal area, the right wing of General Montgomery is advancing northward, making slight progress, but it was soon thwarted by the crossfire of the Axis hill positions. The center and right wing of the British Eighth Army are now hesitant to advance. In the 24 hours before noon on Saturday, the anti-Axis forces desperately tried to break into the mountains held by the Axis forces. The pause after this main attack by the anti-Axis forces is generally only a short rest, so as to replenish ammunition and replace fatigued troops with new troops.

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London, the Daily Express military correspondent Lequet declared that the Tunisian War cannot be decided around May 1. The German resistance is constantly increasing, and the Axis positions in the Tunis and Bizerte areas are far superior to what was expected. The British occupation of Enfidaville is of no military importance. The German Africa Corps is fighting hard for every inch of land, so the nature of the battle next week is easy to predict.

### Soviet Sea and Land Reinforcements Repelled by German Artillery

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) – Colonel Hamma, a war correspondent for the German News Agency, reported on the 24th on the situation on the Eastern Front, saying that German forces are actively deploying operations in various parts of the Eastern Front. Because the Soviet forces have suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources in the past few months, they have had to reorganize their troops on the front and in the rear. Soviet forces attempted to send troops to Novorossiysk by sea, but were repelled by German coastal artillery. A Soviet 1,000-ton transport ship was sunk, and two others were damaged and fled.

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the German News Agency front-line correspondent on the 24th, the German military's active situation on the Eastern Front stated that the German Air Force bombed Soviet supply stations and their connecting roads on the 23rd. In the Kuban region, 25 Soviet locomotives were destroyed. German fighter squadrons shot down 35 Soviet aircraft. German Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers also bombed Murmansk on the 23rd, the Kandalaksha railway station and freight trains in the north, destroying a total of 25 vehicles. The German Air Force also attacked the Golovata railway station south of Katarinaska. Eleven trains and locomotives loaded with military supplies were severely damaged. On the 23rd alone, the Soviet army lost a total of 39 aircraft in various areas.

### Total US Casualties Reach Over 78,000

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – Washington – The US Office of War Information recently announced the number of US military casualties. From the start of the war until April 23, the total number of officers and soldiers killed, wounded, missing, and captured was 78,235. This figure includes 12,000 killed in action and more than 40,000 missing. At the same time, US Army Commander Huaring accused the government of concealing the exact number of US military losses in North Africa. Chairman Davis of the Office of War Information replied in a radio broadcast that the anti-Axis forces landed in North Africa in November last year, so the US military losses in North Africa did not exceed 12,000.

### Indian Muslim Leader Jinnah Urges Gandhi to Unite Against Britain

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from New Delhi, Jinnah, president of the All-India Muslim League, yesterday urged Gandhi to reconcile with the League in order to take joint action to resist British oppression. Jinnah said, why don't the people of the whole country declare solidarity and drive the British out of the country? Jinnah was re-elected as president at the annual meeting of the All-India Muslim League yesterday. He addressed 15,000 listeners for three hours, saying that regardless of the past, the League and the Indian National Congress will work together. Jinnah also said that the reason why Gandhi did not communicate directly with him was due to the British instigation to separate Muslims and Hindus. Jinnah finally mentioned the injustice of the South African land restriction bill, saying that Indians had been asked to make various contributions to the war effort, but now they are being repaid with this, and even Indians residing in Natal and Transvaal are prohibited from obtaining real estate.

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to news from Calcutta, officials there announced yesterday that the Governor of Bengal has appointed a new cabinet, with Sir Nazimuddin as Prime Minister. At the same time, the Governor has obtained the consent of the Viceroy of India to cancel his announcement of acting as administrator after the resignation of the previous cabinet in accordance with Section 93 of the Indian Government Act. The new government has 13 members, of whom seven are Muslims and the rest are Hindus. Sir Nazimuddin also serves as Minister of Home Affairs.

### Anti-Axis Commander Strongly Declares Australian Crisis

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - Australia is deeply threatened by the increasing strength of the Japanese air force in the Southwest Pacific and is making every effort to request increased support from the United States. According to a telegram from Sydney, Lieutenant General Sir Iven Mackay, Commander of the Anti-Axis Land Forces in the Southwest Pacific, gave a broadcast on the 24th, strongly stating the Australian crisis. He said that while he fully agreed with the idea of defeating Hitler, it would be inappropriate to sacrifice Australia. He stated that the Japanese military is constantly increasing its forces in northern Australia, causing the anti-Axis military base of Australia to be completely isolated. Therefore, Britain and the United States must continuously transport weapons, otherwise the anti-Axis forces will be unable to launch an offensive.

### British Conservative Party to Hold a Meeting

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to news from London today, the British Conservative Party will hold an important meeting in London in mid-May, lasting for two days. Prime Minister Churchill will attend and give a speech. This meeting is the first of its kind since 1937. It is being convened because Sir Brock and Lady Astor have established the Monarchist Improvement Committee. The scope of the meeting will be limited to domestic party issues, the Beveridge Plan, the establishment of a social security department, state-controlled industries, and other issues.

### Italian Newspaper Acknowledges British Defeat in Burma; Offense into Burma is a Pipe Dream; British Newspaper Also Acknowledges Difficulty for Anti-Axis Powers to Increase War Against Japan

Shaolin, 25th (Central News Agency) - Stefani Agency reports that yesterday's Stampa newspaper stated that the British Commander-in-Chief in India, General Wavell, is continuing to retreat on the Burmese border. All plans to recover Burma can be considered to have failed. The monsoon season is approaching, and any further actions will not be possible for another six months.

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London, The Times recently published an article discussing the situation in East Asia, stating that it is difficult for the anti-Axis powers to increase their war effort against Japan. This is because the key to anti-Axis operations in Europe and the Pacific is the availability of ships and transportation, which depend on the superiority of anti-Axis naval and air forces. The British and American troops stationed in North Africa require two million tons of shipping space to transport supplies after landing, and tens of millions of tons of space to maintain them. Therefore, under the current circumstances, it is impossible to transport the same number of troops to the Pacific because there is insufficient manpower and resources to conduct a war 8,000 miles from Britain, while the German forces are only 22 miles from the British coast.

### Berlin Magazine Publishes Article Discussing the Purpose of the War

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - German President Hitler has recently met with the heads of various European countries to discuss the construction of a new Europe. The recently published Berlin-Rome-Tokyo magazine published an article on the war aims of the Axis powers, expressing its determination to realize a new Europe. The main idea is that the aim of the Axis powers is to achieve social justice and a fair distribution of the world's wealth. From the perspective of European civilization, the meeting between President Hitler and the leaders of various European countries shows that this war is a revolutionary struggle to overthrow the old order. If we can eradicate the evil forces in the present society and succeed, there may not be any more wars in the future. We have been at war for four years, or even longer, and we will certainly force the enemy to submit. The Axis powers are fighting for justice and will surely achieve final victory, and a happy era will soon come.

### Norwegian Prime Minister Returns Home

Oslo, 25th (Central News Agency) - Norwegian Prime Minister Quisling previously visited the German President's headquarters and held talks with President Hitler. After the meeting, he returned home by plane on the 24th and telegraphed thanks to President Hitler, saying that he was deeply grateful for the President's kindness in holding meaningful talks at the President's headquarters. The entire Germanic people will unite under the President's leadership and strive to build a new Europe.

### Sweden Acknowledges that Severance of Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Finland is Inevitable

Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency) - The withdrawal of all staff from the US Embassy in Finland has caused a great shock to the European diplomatic community. Ever since the US Minister to Finland, Schoenfeld, returned to Washington, it has been widely rumored that the United States will sever diplomatic relations with Finland on the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, this withdrawal of personnel by the US government has considerable significance for US-Finnish relations. According to a telegram from Helsinki, US Embassy staff have been gradually moving to Sweden. As of the 23rd, only the Chargé d'Affaires remained as a qualified diplomat. Therefore, it is a fact that relations between the two countries have not been completely severed. However, diplomatic circles in Stockholm generally believe that the result of this measure by the US government is that severance of diplomatic relations between the two countries will be inevitable.

### Japan and Thailand Issue Joint Statement Reaffirming Belief in Victory

Bangkok, 25th (Central News Agency) - Japan and Thailand, at 8:00 AM today, issued a joint statement regarding the meeting between Japan's Minister for Greater East Asia, Aoki, and the Thai leadership, stating that Minister Aoki has held several meetings with Thai Prime Minister Pibul and Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon in Bangkok since April 23rd to review the overall world situation. As a result, they reaffirmed their belief in victory and the shared destiny of the two countries, united as one. The two sides have reached complete agreement on the policies adopted by the two countries to complete the war and build Greater East Asia.

Bangkok, 25th (Central News Agency) - Japan's Minister for Greater East Asia, Aoki, hosted a banquet for Thai Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon at 7:00 PM on the 24th. In his speech, Aoki said that although he had only been here for a short time, he had had several cordial talks with Prime Minister Pibul, and he was delighted that his views on the situation in East Asia and other matters were in complete agreement with the Foreign Minister. He added that this meeting had strengthened their belief in victory, and he was particularly pleased that they had a deep understanding of the policies that the two countries should adopt to complete the war and build Greater East Asia. Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon then gave a reply speech, saying that the Minister's visit to Thailand was a great event in the political history of the East and was of great significance. He added that the Minister had made full use of this short time to review important issues with his country, and the result was not only the promotion of the new good relations between Thailand and Japan, but also of great significance in the construction of Greater East Asia.

Bangkok, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Thai government and people unanimously welcomed the visit of Japan's Minister for Greater East Asia, Aoki. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Thailand has fought alongside Japan as an ally to defeat Britain and the United States and build a new order in East Asia. Minister Aoki's visit to Thailand explained Japan's determination to win the final victory and frankly expressed Japan's friendship with Thailand. This is generally welcomed here, as it is believed that the friendly relations between Japan and Thailand will be further consolidated as a result. At the same time, the cooperative relationship between the two countries will inevitably become closer. Minister Aoki reaffirmed, when he met with Thai Prime Minister Pibul and Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon, that Japan and Thailand share a common destiny of life and death and bear a common mission. The two sides also reached complete agreement on the policies to be adopted in the future by Japan and Thailand in close cooperation to complete the Greater East Asia War and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, Minister Aoki's visit to Thailand can be said to have been a great success. In addition, Minister Aoki has consulted with the Japanese Ambassador to Thailand, Tsubogami, and the local agencies of the Ministry of Greater East Asia on important matters, and held talks with local military authorities to smooth out the opinions of the central and local governments. Therefore, after Minister Aoki's visit to Thailand, the cooperative relationship between Japan and Thailand will inevitably become closer, which is deeply worthy of expectation.

### Leader of French Militia Assassinated

Vichy, 25th (German News Agency) - Garsovski, the leader of the French militia in the Rhone region, was assassinated in Marseille yesterday morning. He was shot and killed by a handgun when leaving his home. The report did not mention whether the murderer had been caught.

### War Zone Journal on the Burma-India Front (2)

April 2nd Today the slopes we are walking on are even more dangerous than yesterday. After walking about 1,000 meters, we arrived at the mountain artillery position of our army. Finding the heavy gun bodies and bringing them here on this mountain road that even packhorses cannot pass through, the hardships of the mountain artillery team cannot be fully described. From here, we can see the Bay of Bengal, and there is a road along the coast where enemy vehicles frequently travel, and we can see them very clearly. It is very easy to hit them when our mountain guns fire. Continuing forward, we finally reached a place from where we can look east towards the Malayan Peninsula. The XXXX unit is closing in on the enemy from the southeast, cutting off the enemy's retreat. The British-Indian troops of the enemy's 14th Indian Division are in a terrible state, abandoning their artillery and desperately seeking a retreat. Although the enemy's artillery shells are abundant, it is truly astonishing, perhaps because they think it is too inconvenient to carry too many shells when retreating, so they want to quickly fire them all before retreating, but in any case, they are firing and shooting randomly. The location of the unit headquarters is unknown. At this time, the enemy and our forces are mixed up, and the enemy's remnants are running rampant, putting our actions in absolute danger. Fortunately, we came across a team going to the unit headquarters, and we followed them. Just when we thought we were at the front line, the team suddenly fixed bayonets and charged forward. We couldn't keep up, so we had to The enemy's made a whooshing sound as they flew over our heads. The sound of machine guns was also frequent and continuous. We wandered around searching until 6:30 in the morning, but couldn't find the location of the headquarters. If we continued like this, it would be even more dangerous when it got light, so we had no choice but to retreat temporarily and find a small trench in a mountain to hide.

April 3rd We couldn't move during the day, so we had to spend it in the trench. But we can't cook here. We haven't eaten since breakfast yesterday morning, so we have been hungry until now, so we have to find a way to catch up with the headquarters. However, the total strength gathered here is less than thirty men, and most of them are signalmen. It is quite dangerous to advance unless it is night. Moreover, the phone line from here to the city, which was still connected yesterday, seems to have been cut off by the enemy soldiers, and it is impossible to attack. Therefore, the XXX unit from the unit headquarters on the side can only be connected by radio, so we cannot know the location of the XXX unit. The XXX is in a state of isolation and helplessness. At two in the afternoon, the side of the military seemed to have attacked. We were afraid that the enemy would come here, so we took out guards from this small number of troops and seriously guarded it. Probably because the figures of those guards were discovered by the enemy artillery observation post in the right front, the fierce mountain artillery fired at the small mountain where we were. At first, the shells landed far away, but gradually they became more accurate, and the shells landed in the trench. Shells fell all around, and pieces of shrapnel flew over our heads with a whooshing sound, hitting our eardrums. Although we felt safe hiding in the trench, we still couldn't feel at ease. Moreover, since we had been discovered by the enemy, it was dangerous to hide here for a long time. However, we couldn't retreat until night. In about three and a half hours, about one hundred and fifty shells were fired, but fortunately, none of us were injured. After a while, we found enemy remnants in front, and the officers' reconnaissance team immediately rushed over, and they did not return until dark, so our strength was even smaller. The signal team that went out during the day to lay a telegraph wire to contact the XX unit encountered enemy remnants, resulting in one death and one wounded. But even so, it was still impossible to retreat. Soon, the liaison soldiers sent by the general to the front line returned, and they joined other officers' reconnaissance soldiers, and the strength increased. Everyone decided to break through the formation together, so that even if they could not reach the unit headquarters, they could meet with our own powerful troops, so they went forward again. The "Indian" tribe had been captured, so we expected that there must be our troops on the high ground in front of it, so we continued to move forward. Suddenly, machine guns fired loudly, sweeping at us, and at the same time, the enemy artillery position in the rear also fired at us fiercely. The shells landed very accurately, which is rare in night shelling. The enemy seemed to be notifying our location by telephone or other means. We hid in a nearby depression to wait for the shelling to stop, but the shelling continued for a long time, about twenty rounds before it subsided. Because we were extremely angry, we cut off three enemy telephone lines under our feet and then hid in the valley of a small mountain on the left. At this time, we didn't know how, but we had become separated from the most powerful officers' reconnaissance team. They probably had broken into the enemy's position. The shelling had stopped, but the danger was not over. It was useless to rely on this small number of soldiers, so we had to retreat again. But the place where we had been stationed during the day had already been discovered by the enemy, so we had to retreat to a place about one and a half kilometers further back and stop in a dry riverbed. We spent the day, the Divine Martial Emperor's Day of the 18th year of Showa (32nd year of the Republic of China), under enemy artillery fire. (Ding: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 16)

### Dynamics of Anti-Axis Forces on the India-Burma Border

A certain neutral country correspondent who recently returned from India (whose name is withheld) sent the reporter a report on his inspection of the eastern border of India. Due to the strict inspection by the British military authorities, much of the information is omitted and not detailed. However, the movements of the Axis forces can be glimpsed from this article. The following is what is described in the inspection report:

Looking at the history of India, the eastern border has never been invaded by any foreign enemies, so it is regarded as absolutely safe and does not cause any military problems. After the outbreak of this war, the military value of this area suddenly changed and became the most important attack and defense base for the anti-Axis forces. Lieutenant General Irwin, commander of this area, will describe the situation on the Achaim-Burma border. In fact, Japanese and anti-Axis forces are indeed facing each other in this area, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

Irwin personally experienced the tactics of the Japanese army in the Burma campaign, so he conducted training to counter them. The first thing the reporter saw was a bridge defense exercise, in which motorized units, artillery units, and infantry units cooperated to defend against the destruction of bridges by disguised Japanese troops. The second thing he saw was jungle warfare. Jungle warfare is like a war in a house, where mechanized units have no room for activity, and infantry takes on the main task of combat. They break through the jungle at a very fast speed and rush to the mountains to observe and attack the enemy. They call this unit the "Lightning Team."

The reporter inspected the anti-aircraft gun position, which was deployed here three days after the Japanese army's air raid on Imphal. When the reporter visited this position, they were practicing shooting at targets. The Japanese air force later reappeared in the sky above this place, dropping leaflets instead of bombs, but these leaflets seemed to have a great impact on the residents. They caused the residents to revolt. Although there was suppression by the British garrison, they still attacked the Manipur Palace, and the anti-British atmosphere was very strong.

Although there were fighters stationed at the Calcutta airfield, fearing an attack by the Japanese air force, they were expanding their defensive facilities. There is an area called the outer defense zone in Calcutta, where British and Indian troops conduct training every day and are stationed there. An officer told the reporter: "In order to facilitate defensive operations, many roads have been built. In a few years, the local authorities will be deeply grateful to the military for building the roads, but before thanking the British army, they should first thank the Japanese army, because it was the Japanese invasion that prompted us to build the highways."

Recently, the cry of "recapturing Burma" by the anti-Axis forces in India has been very loud. According to what the reporter saw, the anti-Axis forces seemed to be putting more effort into the exercises than into a real attack. They are outwardly strong but inwardly timid, trembling day and night at the Japanese army's attack.

### Silver and Money Industry Tightens Lending; Determines Lending Principles; Limited to Legitimate Needs of Companies and Firms; Amount of Loans Flexible Depending on Usage; Statistics on Deposits and Loans of Various Banks and Pawnshops in this City

Member banks and pawnshops of the Silver and Money Industry Association will cautiously provide long-term credit loans under the principle of tightening. According to the person in charge of the silver and money industry: After joint decisions, banks and pawnshops will only provide credit loans to companies and firms. The amount should be carefully considered and the purpose limited. Loan applications from borrowers whose purpose is investigated and deemed to be conducive to hoarding and speculation will be rejected. Loan applications from companies and firms are limited to members of the respective industry association, who must hold a license issued by the competent authority. Borrowers must also explain that there is a genuine need, and must have a reliable guarantor and legally signed contracts. As for the term of credit loans, it should not exceed six months according to custom. Old loans that expire at the end of the quarter have been recovered, but some accommodation will be given to those with good credit. In addition, the Money Industry Association will hold a "Quarterly Inner Panel Meeting" at 3:00 PM today to publicly determine the inner panel exchange rate and discuss credit loans at the end of the quarter.

Total Deposits of 2.5 Billion Yuan

According to a recent survey by the financial sector, the total deposits of banks joining the Banking Association in this city have reached 1.9 billion yuan. Among them, the deposits of eleven banks, including Zhejiang Industrial, Continental, Salt Industry, Jincheng, China, Transportation, Zhongnan, and China Reclamation, account for a total of 700 to 800 million yuan. The total deposits of member pawnshops of the Money Industry Association are approximately 600 to 650 million yuan. The total of the two is 2.5 billion yuan.

### Authorities of the Two Concessions Thoroughly Investigate Hoarding of Dangerous Goods

It has long been prohibited by the authorities to store large quantities of dangerous goods, such as alcohol, cotton yarn, paper, cigarettes, and various acids and oils. Now, because the prices of the above items have risen sharply and it is easy to make huge profits in an instant, the number of people hoarding them privately within the concessions is increasing day by day. The concession authorities believe that hoarding materials is already illegal, and hoarding dangerous goods has a significant impact on social security. Several recent fire cases are directly or indirectly related to this issue. Therefore, profiting from dangerous goods not only disrupts the market, but also endangers the lives and property of citizens, and should be strictly prohibited as soon as possible. It is reported that the concession authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation of the hoarding of dangerous goods. Once evidence is found, in addition to the confiscation of all the goods, the hoarding households will be subject to the most severe punishment.

### Rationing of Grain in the Eleven Districts of the City to be Combined with Broad Beans; Sales Began Yesterday in the Nanshi District; Two Sheng of Rice per Person

Regarding the rationing of grain for the eleventh period in the urban area, the Municipal Food Bureau has allocated it according to the current population of each district, and is now ordering each public rice distribution office to pay the money and issue the rice. It is expected that it will be generally opened for distribution within the next week. Except for the Nanshi District, which started selling yesterday and is all japonica rice, the other districts are indica rice. The selling price has not changed, but the amount of grain rationed has been changed to two sheng per person, regardless of age, and miscellaneous grains will also be added. It is reported that broad beans will be distributed first.

### More Than 40,000 Loads of Garbage Piled Up in the Nanshi District

The total amount of garbage piled up in the entire Nanshi District for the past four months has reached more than 100,000 kilograms. Now that epidemic prevention work is being carried out, clearing garbage is the top priority. The municipal government has ordered the Nanshi Health Office to report the capacity of garbage piled up in the entire district in order to clear it thoroughly. After receiving the order, the office has completed the entire survey. It is estimated that there are 38 urgent areas that need to be cleared, totaling more than 37,800 loads. There are about 5,200 loads in less important areas. The total statistics require more than 42,500 loads. Regarding the implementation of the cleanup, an estimate is currently being actively sought, and the monthly cost is quite high.

### Police Department Reiterates Previous Order; Cracking Down on Non-Standard Measuring Instruments

The police departments of the two concessions have repeatedly sent personnel to thoroughly investigate companies and firms that use non-standard measuring instruments. Those found to have such incidents will be investigated and dealt with according to regulations, fined, and the measuring instruments used will be confiscated and turned over to the public. The authorities are aware that the use of non-standard measuring instruments by companies and businesses not only violates the law, but also hinders the authorities' various measures to suppress and stabilize prices and stabilize the market. Therefore, the previous order is reiterated, and in addition to continuing to send personnel to various jurisdictions, including small vegetable markets, companies, and businesses, to conduct strict investigations, detailed regulations have also been made on the measuring instruments used in various industries. If such incidents occur again in the future, anyone can report them directly to the nearest police station or patrol post for legal action.

### A Large Number of Cigarette Speculators Apprehended in Zhaofeng Park; 40 People Fined 1,000 Yuan Each; 8 Ring Leaders Sent to Court for Prosecution

The English-language Times reported that according to official sources, the Shanghai West area, in order to eliminate hoarding and illegal profiteering in the cigarette market, found several groups of Chinese engaged in speculation in Zhaofeng Park on April 17, and also apprehended 56 illegal wholesalers.

Originally Active in the French Concession

It is said that these speculators were originally engaged in illegal profiteering activities within the French Concession. However, due to the intervention of the French police, they resumed their activities in the French Park. As a result of the increase in black market prices of cigarettes, they were discovered and stopped by the French police department. These people then abandoned the French Concession as a black market site and instead operated in Zhaofeng Park in western Shanghai.

8 Ring Leaders Sent to Court

However, these merchants in western Shanghai were quickly discovered and arrested. It is reported that of the 56 Chinese arrested, 9 were released after investigation and found to be innocent, and 40 were fined 1,000 yuan each. At the same time, the remaining 8 people, because they were leaders, have been sent to the Nanshi Court for prosecution.

Black Market Broken Up for the Second Time

According to Shanghai West investigators, these speculators had been active in Zhaofeng Park for several weeks before being discovered, from 10:30 AM to 2:30 PM every day. It is also known that the arrest of Shanghai West cigarette black market merchants is the second time this has happened. The first time was last week, when retailers who resold price-controlled cigarettes on the black market were arrested.

### Cigarette Distribution: Third Batch Available for Pickup Today

Following the unified cigarette allocation by the China Central Tobacco Distribution Association, the second batch, consisting of products from Japanese-owned China Tobacco Company and Chinese manufacturers like Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and Fuxin & Great Eastern, was completely distributed from April 15th until yesterday. The third batch, consisting of products from the military-managed Central China Tobacco Company, can be picked up starting today upon presentation of the distribution notice and payment at designated distribution points and the Great Eastern Company. The quantities are divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D, reportedly valued at 10,000, 7,500, 5,000, and 2,500 yuan respectively. The association has stated that if any of the 300 wholesale dealers and over 5,000 retail dealers in Shanghai are found to be hoarding or refusing to sell allocated cigarettes, or engaging in black market activities, the association will not only dispatch inspectors to thoroughly investigate, but also encourages buyers to report such conduct at any time for further investigation.

### Banquets Held in the Nanshi Area Must Still Pay Tax; Those with Tax Receipts are Exempt

Since the Nanshi Tax Collection Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau was ordered to take over the banquet tax collection in the entire Nanshi area, restaurants, kitchens, and catering services within the area have been following regulations and paying taxes accordingly. Banquets moved from the concession area to Nanshi are also required to pay the banquet tax according to regulations to ensure fairness. However, those who already possess banquet tax receipts from the Finance Bureau are exempt to avoid double taxation and alleviate the burden on businesses. Mr. Jiang Bingquan, the director of the Tax Collection Office, yesterday specifically instructed all tax collectors to strictly adhere to these procedures to maintain order and demonstrate impartiality.

### The Science of Victory (2)

Automobile Alternative Fuel Device…Mr. Kichibei Miki…

The invention of automobile alternative fuel devices, especially charcoal gasification devices, has had a tremendous effect in today's gasoline shortage. Mr. Kichibei Miki (54 years old), former army engineer and current director of the Automobile Control Association, began research on automobile alternative fuels long ago, 25 years in the past, when the number of automobiles in the capital was still few. In this cradle age of automobiles, Mr. Miki, then an engineer at the Army Automobile School, considered that if Japan were ever isolated, all gasoline would have to be supplied to aircraft. Automobiles would have to use alternative fuels. So he started this research. It can truly be said that he had foresight. At first, he completed an alternative fuel device based on alcohol, and in 1919, it succeeded in a test drive between Setagaya Automobile School and Kumagaya. However, because this alcohol must rely on plant-based materials, it is always subject to considerable limitations each year, so he began further research into the use of materials with permanence. At that time, only England had a solid fuel device, so he traveled to Europe and America to study, and after much painstaking research, we were finally able to manufacture a unique solid alternative fuel device in our country.

At that time, gasoline was very abundant, and automobiles could be bought cheaply from abroad. At such a time, the engineer devoted himself to research on alternative fuels, and as a result, many people called it foolish worrying. Some even mocked him, saying that instead of researching alternative fuels, why not buy and store large quantities of gasoline from the private sector? But the engineer never gave up because of this, and continued to work hard without retort, so as to carry out his original intention. First, he invented the charcoal device, and then he invented the wood gasification device. In 1935, it was finally adopted by the government, thus laying the foundation for today's alternative fuel transformation. The engineer said:

"In terms of wood gasification devices, the most difficult thing to research was how to dispose of the tar from wood charcoal. At first, I prepared several buckets to try, but because I felt it was too boring, I let the charcoal burn halfway, and from here, I produced some combustible gas, and then I invented a special container. I have devoted almost half my life to the research of alternative fuel devices, but today, under the Greater East Asia War, seeing cars running on the streets using my invention, I always think in my heart: "It wasn't a waste of time."

Invention of plastic surgery after facial injuries... Army Surgeon General Tsutomu Saito...

As a result of the increased power of various weapons in modern warfare, the injuries to the human body are also becoming more brutal. Among them, there are indeed many cases of injuries to the face, resulting in extremely unsightly disfigurement. The suffering of these war-wounded is far greater than that of those wounded in other parts, because it causes great mental unpleasantness. At the same time, if it is thought that it is enough to simply cure the patient's face and send him back to his hometown with an unsightly scar, then this unsightly and ugly face will easily discourage the youth of the hometown, and thus will affect the morale of the Imperial Army. Now, ugly faces injured in war can be brought up as an important topic for research and discussion on how to find ways to cure them. However, the medical treatment of this aspect has always been backward in all countries. Army Surgeon General Tsutomu Saito (currently head of the Army Medical School) has spent many years of painstaking effort to help these war-wounded, and as a result, has invented plastic surgery to treat injured faces. In the past, medical methods never considered plastic surgery, leaving behind an extremely unsightly face, but now he can remodel the face to make it look good, which is truly a great honor for the Japanese military medical community. The Surgeon General was born in Shiga Prefecture, graduated from Kyoto University in 1921, and was sent by the government to study in Germany for two years after obtaining his degree. From 1930 to November of last year, he was always a teacher at the Army Medical School, concentrating on painstaking research in this area. After the outbreak of the China Incident, the number of such injured people suddenly increased, so he officially took up the scalpel to perform plastic surgery on injured faces. At the end of that year, the surgical method designed by the surgeon achieved initial success, and later he designed a variety of plastic surgery methods. To this day, he has performed plastic surgery on more than 350 severely wounded patients with facial injuries.

The ugly shape after facial injuries is caused by bullets with great destructive power, so after a deep and intense wound, it becomes an extremely deep scar. In order to fill the defective part, it is very difficult to transplant skin from other parts of the body. It is also difficult to succeed with the method of transplanting and cutting off skin. Therefore, it cannot be successful without using the blood circulation method (using the transplantation method) before transplantation. At the same time, facial plastic surgery is different from plastic surgery on other parts of the body, because the ear is the ear, and the nose is the nose. Each has its own special shape and position, and cannot be changed or altered at will. The difficulty lies in this. Saito has invented about 13 surgical methods for this point to this day. Whether it is individual local treatment and plastic surgery, or joint treatment and plastic surgery of various parts, now no matter how serious the injury is, no matter how ugly the face is, it can be treated into a good-looking appearance. Even patients who have suffered severe nerve trauma for the first time have been completely cured after surgery. Saito has superhuman courage and serves as an active industrial warrior in the rear.

### Economic Circle: Commentary: The Exchange of Funds Between Urban and Rural Areas

Urban finance and rural finance seem to be in a competitive position, but in fact there is a common need. Urban industry and commerce are developed, production and sales are circulated with abundant goods, guarantees are reliable, and they can afford higher interest rates, so the financing of funds is easier and the scope of use is also wide. However, the concentration of funds in urban areas, as far as the disadvantages are concerned, will lead to rampant speculation. At the same time, due to the flow of funds to urban areas, rural funds will feel exhausted, and rural areas will go bankrupt, and the people will be unable to live. The purchasing power of farmers is weak, and urban products are also unable to be sold, and rural raw materials have lost their patrons. As a result, urban and rural areas are embarrassed and create a widespread economic panic.

The financial turmoil and economic panic in Shanghai in 1934 originated from the bankruptcy of several villages, so it was felt that rescuing rural areas was a matter of urgency. Therefore, since 1934, we have begun to actively promote agricultural finance, but it is too late. The lessons of the past are the lessons of the future. Those who are now discussing wartime food administration countermeasures first advocate "increasing production in order to achieve abundant harvests and replenish storage," then we must actively pay attention to agricultural finance.

However, agricultural finance is relatively difficult to do. In addition to government advocacy, it also requires national protection and incentives, giving low-interest funds, guaranteeing the safety of loans, and improving farmers' knowledge and farming methods. The adjustment of the entire agricultural financial system and the establishment of a system organization are necessary strategies for handling agricultural finance. If the rural economy can be sound, then there is no need to worry about the sudden and rapid development of food production.

### The Ministry of Food Attaches Importance to People's Food Business; Three Provinces and Two Cities Organize a Federation; Shanghai is the Pivot; Unifying the Administration of Food in Southeast China; Industries such as Flour, Oil, and Sugar are All Subject to Restriction

The Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Venture Cooperative was ordered to prepare, and it is scheduled to completely complete the procedures for members to join the cooperative from tomorrow to the 28th. The following points have been ascertained: (1) The location of the preparatory office is Room 606, 6th Floor, Pudong Building, 150 Avenue Edward VII.

The Nature of the Joint Venture Cooperative

According to the head of the preparatory office, Lu Wenshao: This cooperative was ordered to prepare, and everything is in its infancy due to time constraints. However, the government is greatly concerned about the wartime rice and grain problem during this period of participation in the war. It hopes that all rice and grain merchants will express their combined efforts to support the government's promotion of national policy. Therefore, even though this cooperative is in a hurry, it should redouble its efforts and speed up its work in order to be established as soon as possible. However, the network nature of the rice and grain joint venture cooperative is completely different from other grain trade associations. The joint venture cooperative is organized according to special laws and is directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Food and other competent authorities for grain. Rice and grain merchants who do not join the joint venture cooperative shall not operate the business, and those without a government-approved business registration certificate or registration certificate cannot join the joint venture cooperative.

The Status of the Federation

Those who operate flour manufacturing and bran business are limited to register at these places on the 26th.

Oil and Sugar

The preparatory organization of the oil industry federation is the same as that of miscellaneous grains and flour. However, the Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Association is also responsible for the preparation of the federation's preparatory office. Huang Jiangquan is the head of the preparatory office for the sugar federation, and the deputy heads are Shi Yuchun and Zhu Chunbo. The sugar industry trade associations in the following districts must be organized and established within the month to join the federation.

The federation will send special commissioners to negotiate in other important districts. As for the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains Industry Trade Association, it is now scheduled to be established within the month. All those who operate miscellaneous grains business in Shanghai should join, and all are limited to register at the association before the 27th.

The matter concerns the rights of the same industry, so please do not wait and see. The preparatory office is located at No. 582 Fuxu Road, Shanghai.

### Soda and Beer Association Stipulates Penalties for Returning Bottles

The Shanghai Resale Soda and Beer Industry Trade Association recently issued a notice to its members, stating: The association has found that many members have returned empty bottles that are often greasy, obviously used for other purposes, and the bottle caps are also incomplete. As a result, the China Main Branch Beer Distribution Association has repeatedly criticized the association, and repeated negotiations have not only delayed time, but also caused the association to increase the burden of procedures. Therefore, it is specifically notified that if the above situation occurs in the future, the first offense will result in a one-time suspension of distribution, and the second offense will result in the immediate confiscation of the guarantee deposit and cancellation of membership. It is also stated that the association's income and expenses have been greatly affected by price increases. Therefore, the joint meeting of directors and supervisors has resolved that from May 1st, the membership fee will be increased to 40 Central Reserve Certificates per month to supplement the fund.

### Reader's Forum The Fundamental Solution to the Price Problem (3)

— Zhong Wei

From the above, it seems that two general departments should be established in the government: the Ministry of Supervision of Material Production and the Ministry of Supervision of Material Distribution. The ministries would be divided into several important material production and distribution departments. Due to this nationalistic organization of production and consumption, the issue of personnel becomes a prerequisite. The government should promptly finalize the "Regulations for the Punishment of Bribery and Corruption by Wartime Civil Servants." Regardless of rank, any official who violates the regulations should be punished. Those who engage in hoarding and those who protect hoarders, whether officials, merchants, or ordinary citizens, should be subject to the most severe penalties. "How can one govern others if one cannot govern oneself?" Cultivating self-governance should be the sole key to a strong nation. As for the various "investigation teams" and "secret investigation teams" organized by the government, they should be directly controlled by the central government and can be divided into mobile, plainclothes, and semi-militarized units. They should be mainly staffed by educated young people, with the goal of national and ethnic training and the standard of cultivating basic integrity.

However, on the other hand, the living conditions of law enforcement civil servants must also be considered. The current civil servant salaries are still based on the salary standards set in 1933, which, according to the current price index, are about eighty times higher than the pre-war average. Due to livelihood issues, civil servants have to seek "extra income" outside of their salaries: some hoard goods and engage in commerce on a large scale, while others accept bribes and engage in corruption on a smaller scale. Under these circumstances, how can politics get on the right track? The government should re-establish official salaries based on the price index and provide considerable subsidies for daily necessities. In Japan and Manchuria, officials have preferential special rations, which have been implemented for years and have achieved remarkable results. Our country has no way to support integrity among officials, and this is something we should urgently strive to catch up with. (The End)

### Translated Commentary The Current Task of Suppressing Prices

Looking back at the price trends of the past twenty-odd days, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, gold, and daily necessities, food, etc., have gradually decreased, and the black market for unified public bonds has also plummeted. In terms of price policy, this is a gratifying phenomenon, and ordinary consumers can also slightly ease their brows.

The tendency for prices to gradually fall is generally due to the following reasons. One is the exposure of hoarding and speculation in Shanghai, and the financial sector has a tendency to self-restraint. The second is the gradual recovery of material circulation between Shanghai and various places. Due to these two interrelated relationships, prices have been suppressed. Exposing hoarding and speculation is like pouring a bucket of cold water on the speculative heat. The financial sector's self-restraint has tightened speculative funds. Speculators with insufficient strength first release their own goods, and general hoarders follow suit. Financial institutions actively recover loans, making speculative funds difficult to circulate and raising borrowing interest rates, so there is not much profit from hoarding. These are all noteworthy phenomena.

Looking at the state of material circulation, since March 15, when the economic control power was transferred to the National Government, although the new control mechanism cannot be said to be perfect, the movement of materials has become quite active. The transportation of cotton cloth, medicines, machinery, and equipment to the interior, and the transportation of miscellaneous grains and other items to Shanghai, are quite considerable in quantity. Although the active movement of materials cannot be seen as the reason for the decline in prices, after circulation can be normalized, prices can of course be expected to be suppressed. Due to the convergence of various conditions, prices have had a downward trend.

The exposure of speculative hoarding will continue in the future. The self-restraint of financial institutions, of course, is to recover unreasonable loans, limit new loans, etc., which will inevitably help to promote the tendency of lower prices. Needless to say, the measures to suppress prices are easier to take effect when prices are falling than when they are rising. During this period, the National Government must actively work to suppress prices, which is what the people eagerly hope for. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance of the National Government will continue to investigate financial institutions and eliminate their illegal businesses, which should be encouraged and welcomed. It can be seen that the National Government has a strong determination on the issue of hoarding. It is expected that the authorities of the National Government will severely punish general hoarding behavior, and speculators will increasingly lose their speculative opportunities. This is the only point that the people are eagerly awaiting.

In order to lower prices and complete the suppression of prices, we must proceed from three aspects: cracking down on speculative hoarding, cleaning up the financial sector, and unblocking material circulation. Revitalizing production is, of course, a fundamental problem, but under urgent conditions, we must first implement the above-mentioned symptomatic treatment. Only with this comprehensive method can we suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. Repetitive emphasis is placed on the effective measures that must be implemented for prices now. And now is the right time to implement them. For the sake of economic recovery and the stability of people's livelihoods, there is no limit to what we expect from the National Government authorities.

### How to Create Good Works

— Tan Zi'an

The National Government has returned to the capital for three years. On the path of peaceful nation-building, political, economic, cultural, and other sectors are all advancing their respective work in parallel. However, in the cultural sector, good literary and artistic creations are still nowhere to be seen. This is a fact that no one can deny.

Last time, when the Japanese cultural envoy Tetsutaro Kawakami came to Shanghai, he said to a friend: The literary world in Tokyo is eager to see Chinese literary works, and if there are good works, they hope to introduce them as much as possible. This friend talked about this matter with several other friends in the cultural world, and as a result, they could not find any suitable works to introduce to the Japanese literary world. Although I do not think that works that can be introduced to the Japanese literary world are necessarily good works in China (because the situation of the Japanese literary world and its current stage are completely different from the current stage of Chinese literature, so the works that Tokyo likes are not necessarily good works in China. The works that China considers good are not necessarily liked or published in Tokyo), but from the domestic perspective alone, the situation is the same!

So, what is the reason for this? I think... literary writers, literary journal editors, and literary critics all have responsibilities, especially writers and editors have the greatest responsibilities.

So-called good creations are of course works that are contemporary, combative, and constructive. However, completing such works inevitably involves portraying the current situation of politics, economics, society, etc. Therefore, many writers and editors think it is dangerous and impossible. So writers dare not write, and editors dare not publish. This is the biggest reason why good works cannot be produced.

In fact, is it possible to describe reality? My view is this: the present is in the process of peaceful nation-building, in other words, peaceful nation-building is still unsuccessful, that is, everything has not yet been on the right track. Therefore, the dark sides in politics, economics, society, etc., are particularly numerous. However, these dark sides must be eliminated and cleaned up in the process of peaceful nation-building, and they cannot be allowed to exist. Of course, in addition to expecting the government to do this work, the people should also rise up to cooperate and promote it. The work of peaceful nation-building cannot be done by the government alone. The cooperation and promotion of the people has the greatest decisive power. Then, literary and artistic works that describe reality based on this understanding and attitude will never be opposed by the government, and there is no reason for opposition. I believe that our government is definitely not that dark.

Of course, I also admit that there are many things that cannot be revealed from the perspective of the overall situation because they involve various other things. However, this kind of problem is very rare in the literary and artistic creation sector. Moreover, the unique euphemistic style of literary and artistic creation can also overcome this kind of difficulty. At the same time, it is a special skill that other departments cannot achieve, but only literary and artistic creation can achieve.

Also, some people say that Japan's side must also be considered. That's right, Japan is now doing its best to help our nation-building work. Therefore, many places in the description of reality will also involve Japan's various aspects. Especially everything caused by Japan's attitude towards Chinese people is most likely to be mentioned in literary and artistic creation. But I also think that there is no problem with these. Because Japan's help to our country is sincere. China understands and welcomes it. Therefore, standing on the spirit of mutual assistance, if China criticizes Japan, it is definitely not so-called anti-Japanese or something. Moreover, Japan is absolutely aboveboard about this matter. In addition to Chief of Staff Kawabe's letter to Japanese soldiers, recently, there have often been remarks from the Japanese side admitting the crimes of their own residents. This is a fact that can be fully proven.

Based on the above reasons, the creation of reality is entirely possible. As long as the author is well-intentioned and absolutely supports peaceful nation-building.

Secondly, the editors of literary journals also need to recognize the above-mentioned objective situation and give them the opportunity to publish. Otherwise, even if there are good works, they will not be able to meet the world, and the creation world will inevitably decline day by day. I dare not believe that there are no good writers in the past few years when good works have not been produced. There must be writers, but it is because there is no opportunity to publish. If I am not mistaken in my thinking, then the decline of the creation world in recent years is largely the responsibility of the editors of literary journals.

There is also the responsibility of literary critics. Although the scope of activity of critics is naturally limited before works worth criticizing appear. However, critics should be more sensitive than anyone else to grasping the objective situation and judging the stage. Being able to publish comments from time to time to encourage writers is also a condition for helping to produce good works.

Recently, a friend said such a sentence, he said that in today's literary world, critics have become writers, and writers have become poets. This sentence is very interesting and worthy of chanting. Because writers are afraid of reality and dare not create, so they use abstract expression methods to write poems. And critics have no object to criticize—works—so they start creating themselves. This phenomenon is not good in any case, it is of no benefit and will not produce good works. Because poets, writers, and critics, unless they are geniuses, must never be done by one person.

Based on the above arguments, writers, editors, and critics must recognize the objective situation at this stage, and standing on this understanding, put down their courage to work hard, so that they can produce good works. Only then can they shoulder the great task of building a new Chinese literature.

### Memories Brought by the Spring Breeze

— Mu Fei

Spring Breeze,

Brings back memories:

A year ago when the peach blossoms were red and the willows were green,

A group of young people,

Along the rivers and mountains,

From distant cities,

Enduring the hardships of wind and dust and separation

Relying on a burning heart,

Towards, towards…

Finally,

The crystallization of blood and tears,

A quiet night,

We completed the arduous journey.

Before and after,

We were greeted and received by people,

The high-pitched singing in the celebration,

The crazy revelry at the reception,

Took away our depression.

Prospects,

Plans,

New life,

We are planning and looking forward to.

One day,

Two days,

It's the season of yellow plum rain again.

Everyone has forgotten us,

We are despised by everyone;

Our destination,

Only to win with the "wooden tablet" on the dilapidated ancestral hall,

Make our dreams of hope.

Cry,

Howl,

But people only repaid with ridicule.

Disappointment,

Disappointment,

Millions of disappointments,

Caressing the wounded heart,

Finally,

The road is opened up for us again.

Spring Breeze,

Brings back memories:

Let me bless

All those who are despised by people,

All those who are deceived by people.

### Snippets

— Zong Wen

Whenever doing something, one must understand the truth of the matter, and must not grope in the dark. The Bible says: "The truth can set people free," so we must grasp the truth and work hard. Then, individuals can succeed and difficulties can be solved.

When we encounter frustrating things, we must never be discouraged. We must still perk up and carefully examine the root causes of previous failures in order to come up with another good plan. The ancients said: "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, you suspect there is no road, but willows are dark and flowers are bright in another village." If you don't change your ways and don't perk up, you won't see the willows dark and the flowers bright.

### The Destroyed Life

— Shi Ting

Uncle, add a little more,

There are still two noodles scorched at the bottom of the pot;

Since I ate some corn in the morning,

I haven't eaten anything since!

Also, thank you,

For bringing it over to me,

Don't knock the pot too much!

My arms are already numb,

My head has been swelling all the time,

I'm a little dizzy!

Look, this rice bag is stronger than me, heavier than me!

How can my weak arms

Carry it;

All the way here,

Walk ten steps, rest three times,

But my feet are still swollen!

The previous two days,

I had to borrow a hundred yuan from the usurer;

He said to me:

Suffer a little,

Carry a few more *dou* of Du rice.

After paying the money back to people,

You can sit at home, take a break,

Eat a few meals of thin corn.

But ah! Carrying one trip,

You can't earn five or six yuan,

This hundred yuan of new banknotes,

You think, how many times do you have to run back and forth!

My little life,

Will be handed over to the little devil sent by the King of Hell sooner or later!

### Anesthetic

— Li Hanlian

In illness,

Except for the throbbing headache,

All the senses are numb.

The anesthetic makes my headache lose its sensation;

Then,

Everything is even more numb.

But people say I'm better;

Then; I fell into the abyss of bewilderment,

Never to have a sober day again.

### Self-Reflection

— Zhou Su

Recently, I watched three Japanese films in a row at the Dahua Theater: "New Happiness," "New Snow," and "Theater Fun History." I feel that I want to say a few words in my heart.

It's not: "Increase the ambition of others, destroy your own prestige." It's just frankly and frankly telling the truth: I think the level of Japanese films is much higher than that of domestic films.

In the many domestic films currently showing in Shanghai, it is really difficult to find a film that can satisfy people. The full house sign often hangs high at the entrance of the Da Guangming Theater, which does not mean that the films being shown are excellent and meaningful. It is just like "Autumn Begonia" was performed at the Carlton Theater for more than 100 days, and every performance was full, but it is still not enough to show that "Autumn Begonia" is "successful." However, the three Japanese films I have seen can all satisfy people (especially the film "New Snow"). I think: filmmakers should not only think about "business eyes," but also go to see other people's works, humbly learn from others, take the strengths of others, and strive for their own improvement.

In fact, before January 9—before British and American films were banned from being shown—a large number of viewers were "fans" of British and American films and were unwilling to watch domestic films once. This cannot be blamed solely on the audience's lack of love for domestic products. Those engaged in the production of domestic films should also reflect on why there is such a phenomenon. After January 9, those engaged in the production of domestic films should take this opportunity to strive for revitalization and strive for improvement to wipe out the "humiliation" of the past—if they are willing to admit that the phenomenon is a humiliation. However, until now, nearly three months have passed, and we have only seen a rapid increase in production capacity, but we have not seen much improvement in quality, which is very sad for those who care!

In the film "New Happiness," although there are also romantic interludes, they are not excessively exaggerated, and there is no "disgusting as interesting." It just increases the interest, and the theme of the whole film is still very obvious, and the subject matter is very meaningful. This is worthy of praise and worthy of emulation.

The film "New Snow" expresses the educational spirit of Japanese national schools completely and the performance is very unique and very vivid. This kind of powerful work has never been seen in domestic films.

The film "Theater Fun History" vividly presents the Japanese dance art and the situation of the theater to the audience. The plot is very funny and meaningful, and there is no "low taste" existence. This is another thing that domestic song and dance films cannot match!

In the newsreel, I also saw the "Great Tokyo Special" by "Shochiku Cinema Co., Ltd.", which is fascinating and sighing. This kind of profound and moving short film that promotes the culture of the country is also rarely seen in domestic films.

The many words above, some people may feel that the criticism of domestic films is too harsh and inappropriate; however, I originally wrote this article with the attitude of "Chunqiu blames the worthy," and what I said is what many people who have the same opinions as me want to say. We don't like to watch domestic films; however, we are not born to dislike watching domestic films. On the contrary, we love domestic films very much, so we have greater expectations for domestic films!

I remember Mr. Lu Xun said a sentence, the general meaning is: "We don't have to hide our diseases, hiding is useless, the best way is to cure the disease."——Therefore, I have talked about these words that may have the suspicion of "destroying our own prestige", I sincerely hope that domestic films will "not be happy too soon"!

### Older Brother

— Tian Ye

Older brother is coming home — it's Sunday.

Like every Sunday, his thin, long shadow quietly appears at the doorway, his blue cloth shirt and trousers stained with patches of machine oil, enveloping his bamboo-pole-like body, under his disheveled hair is still that pale, bloodless face, that face still wearing a forced bitter smile:

"Mom!"

A trace of a smile also appears on Mom's haggard face, but Mom's old heart is sobbing and weeping! — Older brother has become much thinner again!

Isn't that so? When older brother first entered the factory, wasn't he a strong and youthful man? However, ever since the day he entered the factory, every time older brother came home, Mom secretly sighed afterward; his rosy face gradually turned pale, his sturdy body gradually thinned down, thinner and thinner...

People who saw him all concluded that he was at least forty years old or so, but older brother is only twenty-four!

As soon as he entered the door, a mouthful of blood appeared on the ground.

Older brother sat down weakly, staring blankly at the ground.

"Older brother! You should go see a doctor!" we said, looking at him.

Older brother silently shook his head.

"Child!" Mom said gloomily, "Don't go tomorrow! Rest at home for a few days!"

Older brother silently shook his head.

"Can't you stop for a few days?" Mom said desperately: "If this goes on, your body..."

Silence. — Only older brother's rapid breathing.

"How can that be?" Older brother finally opened his mouth; "Mom! There's no need!... I just need to sleep well!... It's...it's okay!..."

Coughing, he stood up from the short stool, and from his blue cloth short shirt, he took out two ten-dollar bills and three five-dollar bills:

"Younger brother! Keep this to buy household...household rice! If...if there's any...left over...first...first pay back...pay back Aunt Chen next door...a few...dollars!...Buy...buy a small...small yellow croaker...for Mom...!"

After buying the household rice, I wanted to find a doctor for older brother, but as soon as I saw the banknotes in my hand, I stopped in front of the doctor's clinic. After hesitating for a while, I finally carried the rice bag back. — I didn't buy the small yellow croaker.

I went to Aunt Chen's next door.

"Child! You have to tell your older brother, when he gets his wages, to pay back a little more, everyone..."

Her face always looks like someone in the family has died.

Coming back, as soon as I entered the door, older brother's groans floated in the dim house.

I lit the oil lamp, and the pale yellow light shone on older brother's bloodless face and long, thin body lying on the bed. I suddenly panicked and trembled. Is this older brother? Is this a person? — A living, fleshy person?

I don't dare to take a deep sniff with my nose, because this...this many blood clots...Oh!...

There is no moon, no stars, just a pitch-black expanse.

But when the dawn barely breaks, older brother has to leave again.

### Under the Dim Yellow Light —Mourning Hua'er—

— Yun Yan

Under the dim yellow light,

I unfold the letter bringing the news of your death.

I read silently,

Each word, each sentence, clutching at my heartstrings;

My eyes are blurred,

The past surges up in my mind.

It was the chrysanthemum season the year before last,

Our family was suffering from economic hardship,

Living on sweet potatoes and corn,

Causing you indigestion and unbearable stomach pains;

You raised your sorrowful face:

"Mom! When can we eat white rice?"

Your mom said with tears in her eyes:

"When your dad earns more money!"

From then on, you were afraid of making Mom sad, so you didn't mention it anymore.

We struggled through the year with difficulty,

Your illness worsened with the passing of time,

You were in bed nine out of ten days,

The doctor was helpless,

Our whole family was anxious for you!

We managed to get some rationed rice,

But you repeatedly shook your head:

"Mom, I can't swallow it!"

Not long ago, when your older brother came to Shanghai to study,

You begged to be taken along;

Your older brother comforted you in every way:

"I'll take you with me when you get better!"

You didn't answer, just sobbed.

When I heard this news,

I wished I could go home immediately,

However, I don't have those conditions — money, time.

I had to harden my heart and wish you a speedy recovery from afar!

Who knew you couldn't withstand the suffering,

And so hastily ended your life that had just begun!

Under the dim yellow light,

I hold the letter bringing the news of your death,

Raise my head and sigh,

Standing woodenly, speechless:

"Heaven and earth will end, but this grief will be endless!"
