### Expectations for Youth Movement Leaders

The current state is that the Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage, nearing dawn and success. However, striving for dawn and success is not an easy task that can be achieved without effort, nor is it a matter of fatalism where success is guaranteed. Rather, it depends on the united power of our one billion people of Asia, working diligently to achieve it. This must not only be clearly understood but also thoroughly practiced. In this regard, without offering flattery, our ally Japan truly understands and practices this, and is making efforts from all aspects. As long as a department can play a partial role, no effort is spared to promote it equally, gathering each part to form the whole, and each force to create a total force. Not to mention distant examples, recent ones are sufficient to illustrate this. For example, the Greater East Asia Conference is the union of a large Asian group, discussing the common goal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Greater East Asia National Assembly unites all the people of Greater East Asia to rise up. The Greater East Asia Youth Leaders Conference, which will begin on the 12th, aims to awaken the unity and effort of youth throughout Asia. All of these events are centered around Japan, inviting various countries and ethnic groups to participate and discuss together.

China has sent representatives to each of these conferences. For the Greater East Asia Youth Leaders Conference, Mr. Lin Bosheng, Secretary-General of the New Citizen Movement Promotion Committee and Director-General of Youth Corps, and Mr. Xu Xiqing, Deputy Director of the Central Youth Cadre School, will attend. Mr. Lin is one of the responsible leaders for youth in China. He will surely gain something from this conference. In particular, Japan has a relatively solid foundation for youth movements, which can be used as a reference for us, and we can also examine and learn from it.

The youth era is the morning sun of life, with the courage of spring thunder and raging waves, and the sincere passion of innocence. Courage is easily impulsive, and passion is easily expressed. Therefore, things that are worth singing and weeping about, and things that are worthy of praise and lament, are most easily expressed. If correct guidance and appropriate training can be applied, a force that cannot be underestimated can be generated. However, precisely because of the fervent courage and passion unique to youth, it is most difficult to control. But due to the immaturity of life experience, the lack of firmness in will, and the incomplete understanding of the current situation, correct guidance can easily mold them. Therefore, leading the youth movement is the most difficult thing, difficult because youth have strong but immature courage and passion, which are not easily controlled. But training youth is the easiest thing, easy because youth have not yet been corrupted by the world and their nature is inherently good, making them easy to mold. Those engaged in the youth movement should grasp this point first. As for the main points of guidance, we would like to offer some humble suggestions:

First, leaders should prioritize the cultivation of healthy physical bodies for youth. The success of any learning or career, regardless of scale, is rooted in a strong physique. And a strong physique must be established in youth for future use. As the saying goes, "If you don't work hard when you're young, you'll regret it when you're old." Our predecessors used this to caution about learning and career, but we believe it is even more appropriate to use it for physical training. Because with a strong physique, even if you haven't worked hard on learning and career when you're young, you can still make up for it when you're old. However, if you don't cultivate your health when you're young, even if you have learning and career, you will inevitably be powerless and unable to contribute to the world when you're old.

Second, leaders must provide extremely accurate instructions on the international situation and the dynamics and policies of domestic politics and economy, so that youth have an extremely accurate understanding. This is the training of thought. Indeed, a sound body and a sound mind are the two most basic elements of life, and special emphasis should be placed on youth, who are entrusted with the fate of the nation and the transformation of society.

As for technical training, we will discuss it later. There is one more point that youth movement leaders should pay attention to: all words and actions of the leader must be consistent inside and out, serving as a model. The model shown should impact the perceptions of the youth. With this kind of youth guidance, success can be expected in the near future.

### President Wang's Broadcast in Japan: Expressing a Firm Belief, Striving to Carry Out the War and Complete Construction

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – Wang, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government of China, recently gave a broadcast speech to foreign countries on the significance of the Greater East Asia Conference and his feelings about attending the conference at the Tokyo Central Broadcasting Corporation. Regarding China's determination to complete the Greater East Asia War, he said the following: "I am deeply honored to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference, which has great significance in world history. During the meeting, I listened to Prime Minister Tojo's great theories and personally received the high opinions of representatives from various countries, which deepened my admiration. Looking back over the past hundred years, Britain and the United States have willfully pursued their policies of aggression and extortion, and their insatiable ambitions to devour the world. Britain's efforts began by extending to the Nanyang region, then to China, which led to the Opium War. The United States also invaded East Asia from the Pacific, joining forces with Britain to form a pincer attack. At that time, the nations of East Asia were on the verge of crisis. Fortunately, Japan rose up alone and was able to stop the ambitions of Britain and the United States. However, even after suffering this blow, Britain and the United States did not dare give up their ambitions, and devoted themselves to sowing discord among the nations of East Asia, causing them to fight each other almost daily. When the Greater East Asia War began, the power of Britain and the United States in East Asia collapsed. Britain and the United States' gains from aggression and extortion, and their attempts, were completely overturned by Japan. Therefore, all the nations of Greater East Asia cannot help but admire Japan's contributions to protecting East Asia. Furthermore, Japan believes that the harm done by Britain and the United States to East Asia is entirely due to their policies of aggression and extortion. Therefore, after militarily driving out the forces of Britain and the United States, it further sought to reduce their traditional policies, replacing aggression with co-existence, and replacing extortion with mutual enjoyment, allowing the nations of East Asia to be independent and autonomous, and to mutually support each other's independence and autonomy. In terms of culture, it promotes their creativity and creativity. In terms of economy, it implements mutual benefit, supplementing each other's strengths and weaknesses, and trading what they have for what they lack. This basic policy is the opposite of the traditional policies of Britain and the United States. This is the difference between the spirit of Eastern morality and the utilitarian thinking of the West. This Greater East Asia Conference was initiated by Japan, uniting the countries of East Asia, using the power of unity and promoting the spirit of morality. This great achievement is not only the foundation for the lasting friendship of the countries of Greater East Asia, but also the foundation for lasting peace in the world. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, truly said that Japan's Restoration is the turning point for Asia. This statement has been confirmed today. Dr. Sun's advocacy of Pan-Asianism, and his hope that Japan would assist China in abolishing unequal treaties, has also been materialized here. A few days ago, I signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with the Japanese Ambassador to China. Today, I represent the Republic of China in attending the Greater East Asia Conference and signing the Joint Declaration. I feel deeply honored. I firmly believe that the representatives of all countries participating in the conference share the same enthusiasm and belief. Therefore, I firmly believe that the purpose of the Greater East Asia War can be achieved, and the construction of Greater East Asia can be completed. However, completing the above objectives and tasks depends on the individual and collective efforts of the countries and nations of East Asia. Japan, as an advanced country, has exerted its greatest strength to protect East Asia, and only expects our newly emerging countries and countries hoping for revival to do their best and share the responsibility of carrying out the war and completing the construction. The bright and brilliant cause of Greater East Asia can only be completed through the separate and joint efforts of the countries and nations of Greater East Asia. The policies of aggression and extortion previously used by Britain and the United States have been defeated, and their policies of sowing discord have also vanished. In the future, no matter what policies they use, any sweet words or empty promises, or the spread of rumors, will not shake our beliefs. We will no longer be oppressed or deceived by them. We are confident that the separate and joint efforts of the countries of Greater East Asia will liberate Greater East Asia and make the brilliance of Greater East Asia shine on the world. Hereby, I would like to pay the greatest respect to our ally Japan and all friendly nations.

### Prime Minister Zhang Returned to Manchuria Yesterday Afternoon, Gave a Broadcast Speech in Tokyo Before Departure

Xinjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Information Office of the Manchurian government announced on the 8th that Prime Minister Zhang returned to Xinjing from Tokyo on the afternoon of the 8th, having completed his mission to attend the Greater East Asia Conference.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Zhang of Manchuria gave a broadcast speech at the Tokyo Central Broadcasting Corporation at 10:00 AM on the 8th, entitled "Striving for the Glory of Final Victory with Determined Unity." The following is a summary of his speech:

I am deeply honored to have attended the Greater East Asia Conference as a representative of Manchuria and to have signed the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Here, I would like to tell all my compatriots in Greater Asia that the countries of East Asia with brilliant cultures and traditions once entered the thorny path of humiliation and submission, suffering the aggression and exploitation of Britain and the United States, becoming their sacrifices and slaves. At this time, only Japan, carrying the great joy of the Meiji Restoration, resisted their oppression and maintained the honor of autonomous development. Looking back on the crimes committed by Britain and the United States in East Asia, they are too numerous to enumerate. To satisfy their material desires, they used all means to enslave the nations of East Asia under the beautiful name of civilization, implementing various policies of aggression in material and spiritual ways. At this time, the entire East Asian nation suffered the tyranny of Britain and the United States. Although the enlightened patriots truly fought for the revival of East Asia, shedding blood and sacrificing themselves, the countries of East Asia failed to break the feudal malpractices that had accumulated over the years, and failed to unite, eventually being taken advantage of by the aggression of Britain and the United States, who acted as they pleased. Our Manchuria rose suddenly amidst the chaos in East Asia. With the assistance of Japan and the support of 40 million people, we engaged in construction. After ten years of effort, Manchuria has become a modern nation, promoting a new order. Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, the power of Britain and the United States in East Asia has been swept away, and the East Asian regions that had been reduced to colonies have been restored to their original states. For example, the integrity of Chinese sovereignty, the adjustment of Thai territory, the independence of Burma, the independence of the Philippines, and the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, and the participation of indigenous people in the Dutch East Indies in politics, are all worthy of permanent commemoration in the history of East Asia and cannot be forgotten. I deeply believe that such a great construction, realized amidst the smoke and rain of heroic martyrs, is due to Japan's unwavering conviction and strong practical ability, and I express my deep respect. Furthermore, the nations and ethnic groups of East Asia have now been awakened by East Asian self-consciousness, filled with the fervent will of "returning to our East Asian essence," and I am even more delighted. This surge of the East Asian spirit, this creation of a new world, is an inevitable trend of natural law that cannot be hindered by anything. It is unlikely that anyone in East Asia is indifferent to this joy. Even those in the inner regions of Britain and the United States will surely feel a sense of resonance in their hearts. Even the 400 million people of India groaning under the tyrannical rule of Britain, looking up to this new world, cannot help but express great sympathy for their own fate. During this conference, I personally met with representatives of allied nations, sincerely revealed my heart, and discussed the mission of building East Asia. I was deeply moved by the determination to complete the war and the enthusiasm for construction. Our solemn declaration to the world is a great and righteous cause that does not shame us before heaven and earth. This is by no means the Atlantic Charter agreed upon by Britain and the United States, merely creating a beautiful name for peace and a hypocritical mask of humanity, while eagerly seeking to maintain their own interests.

### Burmese Deputy Prime Minister Declares: War Preparations Completed - Unsparingly Offering All Assistance to India -

Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) - Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Kin Maung Gyee issued a statement on the Greater East Asia Conference on the 6th, strongly stating that the Greater East Asia Conference was an unprecedented conference in East Asia and that the conference has fully demonstrated that the fate of the East Asian nations is completely in the hands of Greater Asia. The main points are as follows: This conference is truly a new page in the history of the new East Asia. The nations of East Asia have hereby established their national right to pioneer their own destiny. Furthermore, the conference has strengthened the solidarity of the East Asian countries in fighting their common enemy, and the Burmese people's trust in Japan has become even firmer. During the conference, the representatives of the various countries fully exchanged opinions on the war issue to determine a comprehensive and unified policy for all of East Asia. Therefore, there is absolutely no concept of an anti-Axis camp in East Asia, and the chaotic state of fighting will not occur. This is what the Burmese government firmly believes. This conference explains that the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has achieved a great success. After gaining independence, Burma is determined to make thorough efforts in the struggle to liberate East Asia. The reason why we have this determination is that we deeply know that we must unite, otherwise we will perish. Therefore, Burma, today, when the people of India hope for assistance, is unsparingly offering all assistance, standing up to challenge Britain and the United States. Burma has completed its various war preparations, and its national institutions have been strengthened to the extent that they can overcome any difficulties.

### Building East Asia's Process: Creating a New Era of Historical Facts, Konoe Praises the Grand Meeting of Six Nations

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Former Japanese Prime Minister Duke Fumimaro Konoe issued a statement on the 7th, praising the fundamental concept of Greater East Asian coexistence and co-prosperity, and commending the grand occasion of the Greater East Asia Conference. The gist of his statement is: Now, all the bases where Britain and the United States carried out their exploitation in Greater East Asia have been completely lost. Burma and the Philippines have successively declared their independence, and the Provisional Government of Free India, the glorious freedom of the Indonesian nation, has also been established. Greater East Asia has presented a magnificent spectacle unprecedented in history. Furthermore, the National Government of the Republic of China's return to Nanjing cannot but be said to be a pioneer in the liberation and revival of Greater East Asia. The National Government cherishes deep friendships with the various countries and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, especially with our country, sharing weal and woe and even being committed to living and dying together, and has also declared war on Britain and the United States. Now, witnessing its fate advance, completing the Greater East Asia War, we hereby express our sincere respect. The grand ideal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can only be fully realized and permanently developed if it is based on an enduring and undiminished victory and glory. We must work together in the greatest mission, which lies in trusting and supporting each other, strengthening our war efforts, and striving to defeat Britain and the United States as soon as possible. This six-nation conference can be called a new era in the process of building a new order in Greater East Asia. I pray for the future of Greater East Asia with fervent enthusiasm.

We will reject the sports philosophy of Britain and the United States, and exert all our efforts to strengthen the physique of our people. In order to achieve consistent results in national sports, the countries of Greater East Asia should establish a Greater East Asia sports organization under new guiding principles, and use this organization as the foundation for a future world sports organization.

### Chief of Intelligence Department Talks to Reporters, Expresses Thoughts on the Greater East Asia Conference

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Information Department of the Allied Japanese Embassy in China held a regular meeting with Chinese journalists at the Japanese Press Club in Nanjing at 4:00 PM on the 8th. The meeting was chaired by the Chief of the Intelligence Department, Mr. An, who expressed his thoughts on the Greater East Asia Conference. The Greater East Asia Conference has been successfully held in Tokyo. Representatives from all countries in East Asia participated in this conference. The results of the conference were extremely satisfactory, and the Greater East Asia Declaration was issued. The work of building Greater East Asia has now entered the right track, which is extremely gratifying. The representatives to this conference, such as the President of the Executive Yuan, Wang, and other representatives from East Asian countries, are all responsible leaders of their respective countries. This further proves the enthusiasm and importance that the governments and people of all countries attach to the construction of Greater East Asia. This conference further demonstrated the determination of East Asian countries to complete the Greater East Asia War and the enthusiasm of East Asian countries to cooperate with each other. This kind of determination and enthusiasm is the driving force to complete the Greater East Asia War. The conference ended successfully in an atmosphere of peace, and the unanimous adoption of the Greater East Asia Declaration further proves that the spirit and interests of the Greater East Asian countries are completely consistent. Compared with the meetings or conferences of the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, they try their best to seek unity in inconsistency because their interests are inconsistent, which is ridiculous and can be said to be sleeping in the same bed with different dreams. If there is a saying of sleeping in the same bed with the same dream, then the unity of East Asian countries is in line with this saying. The results of the conference have been seen in the five principles of the Common Declaration, namely: Greater East Asia's coexistence and co-prosperity; autonomy, independence, and amity; promoting East Asian culture; economic cooperation and prosperity; and contributing to world progress. These five principles are the common mission of the countries of Greater East Asia and can also be said to be the fundamental principles for promoting world peace. It can be asserted that due to the successful conclusion of the Greater East Asia Conference, the nations of Greater East Asia will become more united and complete the Greater East Asia Holy War. At the same time, the foundation for the construction of Greater East Asia has also been laid. Furthermore, due to the establishment of the five major principles, the common ideals of the Greater East Asian countries have been proclaimed to the universe. We firmly believe that the East Asian nations will definitely strive to move towards this common ideal and achieve their common goals.

### US Decides to Merge Chongqing Air Force

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Chongqing military spokesperson's announcement on the 5th, the Chongqing Air Force has decided to be incorporated into the US 14th Air Force stationed in Chongqing, under the command of its commander, General Chennault. Reportedly, when the US air force stationed in China was reorganized last July, the authorities of the US Air Force Command stationed in Chongqing had already applied to the United States, requesting the Chongqing side to incorporate its air force. Only recently did it succeed, and it was officially decided to incorporate the Chongqing Air Force into the US Air Force stationed in China. In the future, the Chongqing Air Force will be trained in the United States or by the 10th Air Force in India, and then will be incorporated into the 14th Air Force. Therefore, the ambition of the US Air Force to merge the Chongqing Air Force has been successful.

### Ministry of Industry Convenes Subordinates to Hold a Discussion Meeting

It is planned that Minister Chen, Vice Minister Jiang, and others from the Ministry will attend. After Minister Chen's instructions, the heads of each unit will report on the recent work situation and submit written reports on the current work situation and future work plans.

### National Government Declaration of War

At the beginning of the Great East Asia War on December 8th two years ago, the National Government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared that it would share weal and woe with its friendly neighbor, Japan. Since then, it has embarked on a new national movement, engaged in safeguarding security and improving people's livelihoods, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and others continue to use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and are becoming more and more outrageous, even colluding with elements of the Chongqing faction to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill East Asians. Recently, as their violence has been successively defeated by the friendly Japanese army, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have been lost, they have become even more cunning. They are jealous of the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the pro-National Government, and are constantly instigating elements of the Chongqing faction to harass them in order to hinder the progress of various constructions. Importantly, they use their own aircraft, based on the Chongqing faction, to bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The Chongqing faction elements, willingly accepting the instigation of Britain and the United States and acting as traitors to East Asia, are certainly shameful. However, Britain and the United States, with their deliberate efforts for East Asia, are doing their best to provoke and sow discord, in order to achieve their ambition of dominance. This is especially the enemy that the East Asian nation should hate. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States. It will do its utmost to cooperate with its friendly neighbor Japan to sweep away the violence of Britain and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. Both Manchuria and Thailand have long been friendly and share a common understanding of the East Asian situation. In the future, they should seek cooperation in order to jointly establish a new East Asian order based on morality. The friendly countries of Germany and Italy have been maneuvering against the forces of Britain and the United States in the West for many years and have repeatedly won victories. My country is now participating in the Great East Asia War and should echo them in order to contribute to the just new order of the entire world. All my countrymen should take this as a meeting of the times to realize the Great Asianism of the Father of the Nation, the revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of Greater East Asia, and the achievement of world peace. With one heart and one mind, and with the strength of war from beginning to end, they should implement this great mission of the era.

January 9th, Year 32 of the Republic of China Chairman: Wang Zhaoming

### Japanese Air Force Commander Talks About Air Battle Near Jiujiang

Around 12:00 noon on the 30th, eight elite US Air Force planes stationed in Chongqing came to attack the Jiujiang area of Central China, using machine guns to strafe ships anchored in the suburbs of Jiujiang and nearby. However, they were fiercely attacked by the elite Japanese fighter planes waiting at the front-line base, and a great victory was achieved by shooting down five of them. Regarding the fierce battle between the new elite fighter planes of the enemy and us that took place near Jiujiang, a certain commander spoke as follows:

Commanding from a Height

At 〇:〇 minutes, departing from the base and entering the airspace near Jiujiang at an altitude of one thousand meters, I saw twin-engine fighters, which are called "fast" in the US Air Force, formed into a line with two planes per row, intending to attack from a height of 〇 thousand meters. At this time, the Japanese fighter planes were all in an advantageous position at an altitude of 〇 thousand meters. Commanding from a height, we fired fiercely. Some burst into flames and fell after one shot, while others escaped from a low altitude, crashing into high mountains, with the fuselage bursting into flames, and the whole plane crashing. There were also those whose fuselage caught fire, and they parachuted into the lake or the Yangtze River. It was extremely gratifying.

Shooting Down Half

However, some of the enemy planes were also full of fighting spirit. Regardless of the artillery fire in front, they took a posture of bravely rising rapidly from below to counterattack. Such resistance from the enemy planes has not been seen before. However, the so-called new model plane, which the enemy boasted about, was eventually shot down by more than half of the attacking planes in an air battle of one or two minutes. The places of crash were: two planes on Chengmen Lake, one of which saw the pilot descending into the lake with a parachute; one plane near Ertao Kou; and one plane each in Ruichang and the mountains of Chaishan, one of which saw it falling while burning. We calmly watched from the plane and safely returned to the base. (翔: Translated from the November 2nd issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Diplomatic Relations Between Japan and Italy Restored; Italy Prepares to Hold Fascist Party Congress

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Badoglio regime of Italy betrayed the Axis powers, diplomatic relations between Japan and Italy were suspended. Later, after the establishment of the Italian Fascist Republican government, it dispatched Colonel East Lunzibini to Japan to handle the restoration of the Italian Embassy in Japan.

### Argentina Expresses Strict Neutrality

Buenos Aires, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Recently, due to the US government's measures to block funds from Argentine banks and other oppressive measures, various parties have paid close attention to the attitude of the Argentine government. Recently, the new Argentine Foreign Minister stated his foreign policy to a Chilean reporter, saying that the Argentine government's foreign policy is still strict neutrality. Argentina does not want to be an enemy of any country. There are also countries in Europe that adopt a neutral policy, so there is naturally nothing wrong with Argentina adopting a neutral policy suitable for the Argentine people. Argentina is willing to be friends with anyone, but those who hinder Argentina's prestige and infringe on its independence will be regarded as enemies. From the remarks of the new Argentine Foreign Minister, it can be seen that Argentina has always adhered to its neutral policy.

### Heavy Troops Gather in Kyiv, Becoming the Center of the Battle; Fierce Fighting in the Northeast of Kou Xu

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - As the situation on the Crimean Peninsula became serious, the German army retreated from Wofu, an important point on the upper reaches of the Homburg River, which caused the eastern front to become urgent. Now, the German military authorities explain the battle situation in various important theaters as follows: "Kyiv Area" The center of the battle on the eastern front is still in the Kyiv area. Currently, the Soviet army is about to launch a fierce attack on the German army with about sixteen infantry divisions and three tank groups north and northwest of the city. After fierce fighting between the German and Soviet armies, 73 of their tanks were destroyed and 71 of their planes were shot down. On the 5th, they retreated to the predetermined positions in the rear. On the 6th, the Soviet army continued to attack fiercely, advancing and retreating north and west of Kyiv, and the battle was extremely fierce. On the 6th, the Soviet army also launched a partial attack in the southeast of Kyiv, but it failed. "Kou Xu Area" The Soviet army used powerful troops to fiercely attack the German army in the hilly area northeast of the Kou Xu Isthmus, and the two armies fought fiercely. The Soviet army attempted to break through the German army's positions by passing through the swampy area, but as a result, they were severely damaged and retreated. "Bele Kop Area" The German army launched a counterattack at the Bele Ko Shan Isthmus, the throat of the Crimean Peninsula, defeating the Soviet army's attempt to break through. However, the Soviet army is still actively reinforcing troops, and tank and infantry units are attempting to continue to attack the German army. The Soviet army launched more than 20 fierce attacks on the German army from the direction of Bieleslavl, south of Kyiv, but the German army's positions remained unmoved.

Large Tank Battle in Nivil West

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency reported: The Soviet army won a full victory in defensive trade on the bend of the Nivil River on Saturday. The German Air Force also made a major contribution to this victory. West of the city, the Soviet army concentrated a powerful tank force and infantry force, intending to enter the German army's line and tear apart the German army's front line, and then launched a fierce tank battle. The German artillery detachment also participated in the battle. In a powerful counterattack, the German army finally defeated the Soviet army's offensive and inflicted extremely heavy losses on the enemy in terms of manpower and materials. By evening, 52 Soviet tanks had been destroyed on the battlefield. German fighter planes shot down 20 Soviet planes in the sky above the area. Therefore, the Soviet army lost a total of 91 planes on Saturday. The battles in the northern part of the eastern front are limited to the activities of the Shufeng south of Lake Ladoga. The Soviet infantry attacked twice under the cover of artificial fog, and both times collapsed in front of the defensive artillery fire of the German army's main line.

The Soviet Army Reinforces the Throat of Ke Dao

South of Kou Xu and north along the highlands along the Crimean coast, the German army engaged in fierce battles with the superior Soviet army. German bombers and Stoga planes participated in the battle and achieved great results, causing serious losses to the enemy army. At the northern exit of the Crimean Peninsula, smaller Soviet units were blocked or annihilated by the German army, or forced to retreat. The gap that the Soviet army broke through at Bele Ko Title Head the day before has been reduced by the German and Romanian armies, and attempts to make new breakthroughs have been suppressed. North of the lower reaches of the Humber River, the German armored infantry and tanks attacked an area occupied and heavily defended by the Soviet army, recovered a village, and captured 40 enemy medium and heavy artillery pieces, as well as many other weapons. One infantry division of the enemy was annihilated or captured. The Soviet army's offensive in the Niepa River was quite smooth. A large Soviet battalion was surrounded and annihilated.

All Soviet Iron Factories Become Ruins

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to the Moscow correspondent of the London Times: A group of Soviet technicians who recently returned from the Don River front spoke about the German army's destruction tactics, saying that almost no factory in the southern iron industry zone of European Soviet territory was spared from destruction by the German army. When the German army retreated, it destroyed all the machinery and equipment of the factories, such as iron smelting furnaces and cranes, and made it impossible to repair them again. Therefore, although the Soviet army has recovered various places, they are all nothing but ruins.

### The Three Great Powers, Rumored to be Meeting: Soviet Foreign Minister to Visit England

Stockholm, Central News Agency dispatch from the capital, dated the 8th. According to Washington sources: there are many symbolic indications regarding the plan for a Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin conference. The general opinion is that the date and location of the meeting have already been decided, and the meeting will be held in an unexpected location, but due to censorship, no preparatory news can be obtained. However, indications from various sources have led to the conclusion that the meeting will take place.

Stockholm, Central News Agency dispatch from the capital, dated the 8th. According to the Stockholm Daily News, citing London diplomatic sources: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is about to arrive in London to participate in the formal establishment of the Three-Power Commission.

Turkey's Attitude Toward the Situation: Maintaining a Cautious Stance; Cairo Talks Conclude

Ankara, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. According to Egyptian capital sources: the talks held in Cairo between British Foreign Secretary Eden and Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu concluded yesterday. British Foreign Secretary Eden traveled to Cairo specifically for these talks with the Turkish Foreign Minister after the Moscow talks.

Istanbul, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. Since the 5th, British Foreign Secretary Eden and Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu have begun talks in Cairo. On the 6th, they visited Egyptian King Farouk VIII one after the other. The talks are still being conducted in secret. There is only speculation about the content of the talks, but no definite news.

Ankara, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. According to the Reuter news agency: Turkish newspapers commenting on the talks between Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu and British Foreign Secretary Eden unanimously advocate a cautious approach, and that decisions should not be agreed upon hastily. As the "Evkaf Yurdu" newspaper put it, "There is no reason to participate in a war" that would only lead to bloodshed and sacrifice for the country.

Rumor of an Understanding Between Britain and Turkey

Stockholm, Central News Agency dispatch from the capital, dated the 8th. According to the "Stockholm Daily News," citing "Sunday Express" sources: the result of the diplomatic discussions between Britain and Turkey in Cairo has led to an understanding. Turkey will cede strong strategic locations to Britain, but the formal establishment of this cession understanding will be based on the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1939. Turkey has also proposed exchange conditions, including new loans and more wartime materials, with airfields being the main ceded areas. The report also stated that the Anglo-Turkish understanding also includes the passage of Allied troops through Turkey.

Turkey Desires Peace

Ankara, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. Political and diplomatic circles in the Turkish capital are currently anticipating the results of the ongoing Cairo conference between British Foreign Secretary Eden and Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu with nervous emotions. These individuals are paying particular attention to the news of the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, traveling from the United States to Cairo by special plane. Well-informed political circles believe that Turkey will be presented with the issue of entering the war, which has been repeatedly delayed since the outbreak of hostilities. Reuters' diplomatic correspondent clearly stated on Thursday evening that Turkey is prepared to make the greatest sacrifices regarding the outcome of the war. The theme hinted at by Reuters is sufficient to influence Turkish public opinion. According to Reuters, the purpose of the Cairo conference is noteworthy as it marks the first time the British side has publicly raised the possibility that Turkey will be asked to participate in the war. The Turkish side has lodged a serious protest against the British claim that Turkey has gradually transitioned from a non-belligerent state to active participation. The Turkish side has repeatedly stated that Turkey desires a rapid end to the war, but has no intention of joining the conflict. Since the beginning of the war, Britain has built various airfields throughout Turkey. Regarding this point, the Turkish side has consistently emphasized that this step is purely a defensive preparation made by Turkey based on its foreign policy of self-defense. Qualified political figures in Ankara, given Britain's attitude towards Portugal and the Azores, anticipate similar actions towards Turkey. British diplomacy intends to use the Azores Islands incident as a precedent to argue to Turkey that it does not need to completely abandon neutrality, but can cede naval and air bases to the Allies or allow the Soviet Union the right to transit troops. British diplomatic circles have declared that this is the minimum contribution that Turkey can make within the scope of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement. It is generally believed here that the Allies will make more specific demands on Turkey in the future.

### German Planes Heavily Attack Convoys in the Mediterranean; German Forces in Southern Italy Counterattack

Berlin, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. The German Führer's headquarters issued a special communiqué on the 7th, stating: The German Air Force inflicted another major blow on enemy transport ships and supply ships in the Western Mediterranean. German dive bombers, flying low over the North African coast, attacked an enemy convoy composed of 22 troop-laden transport ships and 8 destroyers, dropping powerful bombs and torpedoes, hitting 13 enemy ships totaling 140,000 tons, as well as 2 destroyers. The returning bomber crews witnessed several enemy transport ships burning and sinking, with thousands of young British and American soldiers and the destroyed ships simultaneously buried at the bottom of the sea.

Berlin, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. According to the German News Agency: German troops in southern Italy are intensifying their resistance against numerically superior British and American forces, completing an undeniable victory in defense. German forces launched a concentrated offensive at the Venafro airfield. After thorough artillery preparation, they launched a fierce attack on the British and American assault teams, resulting in the Allied forces being split between Santa Maria Oliveto and Rocca d'Evandro. German forces not only filled a gap from the previous day, but also engaged in fierce combat with enemy grenadiers within the enemy's deployment area. German detachments seized several strategically important high grounds, thereby preventing American reinforcements from reaching the front line and driving them back beyond their original positions. Seven American tanks were destroyed. West of the Volturno River basin, British and American attempts to break through at Vairano failed completely. On the nearby roads and in the mountains, German forces countered the enemy with devastating weapons. Four enemy offensives collapsed under the German barrage. General Clark's U.S. Fifth Army, seeing no chance of success with frontal assaults, attempted to infiltrate the German flanks with small units, but this plan was also thwarted by German forces.

Allied Forces Retreat Again in the Apennine Mountains

In the central Apennines, Canadian and British forces continue to display a cautious attitude. German rear guard units retreated from positions such as Frosinone, Avezzano, and Agnone without making contact with the enemy. In the east, near the Adriatic coast, British forces, under the cover of tanks, launched two strong offensives, but were stopped in front of the German lines. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in fierce fighting. In addition, seventeen British tanks were destroyed by anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft batteries. German fighter-bombers disrupted enemy supply lines east of the Trigno River, as well as British landing operations near Termoli. Two troop carriers were sunk, and three others were damaged. A large fleet of transport vehicles was scattered, and at least seven fully loaded trucks caught fire.

### Seventy-Eight High-Ranking Police Officials in North Africa Dismissed

Delhi, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. Algiers reports: Seventy-eight high-ranking police officials in French North Africa have been dismissed. These officials were stationed in police stations in Algiers, Oran, Philippeville, and other French North African cities. Among them are the Chief Commissioner of Algiers, Laffargue, and the Chief of Police of Oran, Poujade. It is understood that this move is a political decision by the Algiers Committee.

### Trends in Cultural Circles of China and Japan

Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. After the Greater East Asia Conference issued a joint declaration, it caused a great sensation in various East Asian countries. Regarding the "elucidation of cultural principles" contained therein, cultural groups in various countries will also launch corresponding movements separately. The trends of major cultural groups in Japan and literary circles in China are recorded as follows:

The Japan Literary Patriotic Association has hosted the Greater East Asian Writers Conference twice. It is planned to invite Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam and other countries to participate in the third conference next year. The International Music Committee attached to the Japan Music Culture Association plans to strengthen its internal structure and send performers and music culture critics to various parts of Greater East Asia to promote Japanese music and introduce the music of various countries to Japan. The Japan Art Patriotic Association is planning to formulate concrete plans in order to promote Japanese art and introduce the art works of China, Thailand and other countries to Japan.

On the Chinese side, in order to further promote the construction of Greater East Asian literature, a literary organization with the nature of a national writers association will soon emerge. This is a great development in the construction of Greater East Asian literature. It is understood that China has not yet had an organization that encompasses writers from across the country. Now, with the advancement of the times, it is necessary to unite writers from across the country to carry out organized and concrete activities. In response to this need, Zhou Zuoren, Qian Daosun, Shen Qijing, Liu Longguang, Liu Yusheng, Zhang Ziping and others are actively preparing, and it may be established within the year. It is planned that branches will be established in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong and other places. After the establishment of this new organization, in addition to seeking the development of Chinese literature, it will also establish close contact with the Japan Literary Patriotic Association to seek communication between Chinese and Japanese literature.

### Earthquake Recorded by Portuguese Observatory

Lisbon, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. The Lar Observatory announced: An earthquake occurred at 8:51 on Saturday. The earthquake was estimated to have occurred about 1,600 kilometers away.

### Italy Strengthens Cooperation with Germany

In the forty days since the German troops marched in, although the situation in Italy has been changing, the overall situation has become more stable, and both the front and the rear show phenomena favorable to the Axis powers.

From a broader perspective, the Anglo-American invasion of mainland Italy can be divided into two stages: the period from the landing in Calabria to the betrayal of the Badoglio regime, and the incursion into the Salerno area and the Termoli region, which led to a genuine conflict between the German and Anglo-American forces. At this time, from the perspective of the so-called Italian defensive warfare, the content of the current battle line is also completely different from the past. That is to say, the Italian army of the past no longer exists. They are now adopting genuine German-style combat and fully exploiting the true value of elastic defense to compensate for the inferiority of weapons and troops. After the battle on the Volturno River, the Apennine Mountains in central Italy have become increasingly treacherous, and it is conceivable that Anglo-American advances will become increasingly difficult in the future. Because rumors rapidly approached Rome with the flames of war, I stayed in Rome only to feel anxious, so I went directly to the battlefield for a pilgrimage. Only after stepping on the firing line did I realize that it was all unnecessary self-disturbance. The German soldiers who were accustomed to fighting and good at conquest, their spirits were excited, shattering our worries.

Some people may ask: So, what if the Anglo-American forces carry out a new landing operation in the rear of the German forces? According to the heads of front-line operations who have fought against the Anglo-American forces so far, this kind of thing will certainly not happen, so they are fighting fiercely with the superior Anglo-American forces.

Germany is of course studying comprehensive measures for this matter, and is preparing to launch a resolute counter-offensive blitzkrieg as soon as the time comes. Even if not, when there is an operational necessity, they are bound to succeed. The fact that the British 8th Army and a part of the US 5th Army were pushed back at once during the fierce battles in Salerno and Eboli in the half month from September 15th in the past is clear evidence.

The Badoglio Regime is Unstable

The eagerness of the British and Americans to open up the battlefield can be seen from the fact that they recognized the Badoglio regime and then declared war on Germany on October 13. The recognition of the Badoglio regime as a collaborator in the attack on Germany by the British, Americans, and Soviets is only a formality, not genuine sincerity. It is even more clear from the fact that the British and Americans brought out Sforza, a well-known exile politician against Badoglio. Although Sforza is now Badoglio's foreign minister, it is rumored that he will take over the post of prime minister and seize power. In short, Badoglio's own political stance is rapidly becoming unstable.

In any case, when Anglo-American aircraft scattered Badoglio's declaration of war against Germany in the sky, the citizens of Rome unanimously expressed their opposition based on the reason that they would be forced to engage in war again under the occupation of the British and Americans, believing that this was the more cruel act of betrayal than Badoglio's announcement of an armistice on September 8 and abandonment of the Triple Alliance. As a result, the Anglo-American-directed Badoglio declaration of war did not win popular support, but made the Badoglio who performed and the Anglo-American who directed greatly lose credibility.

British Use Indian Troops

Information obtained at the front line: The British 8th Army, which supports the Badoglio regime and advances north along the Adriatic coast, is said to have dispatched Indian troops to advance to Larino (30 kilometers northeast of Campobasso). Since the North African War, this Indian 4th Division has fought hard in the fierce battles of Tobruk, Tripoli, and the Mareth Line, and in the final act of the Tunisian War, the Battle of Catania. It is the strongest unit of the British 8th Army. The Sikhs and Gurkhas from Punjab are fearless combat troops. Whenever the headquarters of the 8th Army sends the Indian Division to spearhead an offensive, its meaning is that the battle situation has reached a point that is unfavorable to them.

Indian soldiers who should have fought for the independence of their homeland are actually expeditioning to Italy together with the enemy of their homeland. In this, there lies the cunning manipulation of the British military authorities. Originally, these Indian soldiers, raised on the sugarcane-protected strong liquor of Punjab, after drinking the British whiskey, would suddenly stand up, recklessly rush towards death for no reason, as for the spirit of independence and the love for their homeland, not to mention, they were all thrown into "Java". Their act of drawing their blades towards the German army this time was entirely for the British alcohol.

This is not entirely fabricated; there is evidence. When Rommel's army attacked El Alamein, it was a part of this Indian division that defended the Tobruk fortress until the last moment. After they were abandoned by the British army, because the green light of alcohol had run out, they agreed to the call of the Axis forces and immediately ceased fighting, so German troops were able to easily march into the city. In short, the current battle situation is very difficult, so the British 8th Army...

Rome Becomes a Non-Armed City

The atmosphere in the rear, which reflects this dynamic front, has also returned to absolute tranquility in these forty days. Rome, the holy city for 400 million Catholics worldwide, will also be transformed into an independent national organization administratively, and the plan for a so-called non-armed city is progressing day by day. This is because, at the same time as the German troops marched into Rome, they made clear Germany's respect for the attitude of non-armed cities, and neutral countries such as Spain, Argentina, Portugal, and Switzerland are also enthusiastically supporting this plan. The news that the Vatican authorities have already requested recognition from the warring countries is also believable. Although the content is not clear now, it is probably to make the status of the city of Rome closer to that of a free city, further developed from a non-armed city.

In addition, regarding the Vatican, the British are spreading the rumor that the Pope has become a German prisoner, claiming that they will attack Rome to rescue the Pope. This fabricated act has now caused great opposition. Using the sacred and inviolable Pope as war propaganda material has caused great indignation on the Vatican side, and the Vatican's dissatisfaction with the British side has gradually become difficult to conceal.

In short, as the war situation progresses, efforts are being made to keep Rome outside the war circle. Under the control of the German army, at least the peace and order that was "absent" during the Badoglio regime has been restored, and this fact is appreciated by the citizens of Rome. Dramas and music, which had been banned for a long time, have recently been unbanned. Today, a foggy atmosphere that makes people forget the war is gradually taking shape. However, everyone is deeply afraid that a new invader will come to destroy this peace. This is the real situation in Rome.

Whenever American soldiers landing in Italy get drunk and cause trouble in various places, molesting women and causing all kinds of entanglements, the strict discipline of the German army makes people agree even more. Since General Stahel, the commander of the Rome defense, shouted the first slogan, "Germany and Italy should let bygones be bygones and cooperate again!" the new system of cooperation between Germany and Italy has been strengthening and developing at all times. (Dispatch from Rome by Yoneito envoy on the 21st) (Note: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun of October 23)

### Deputy Director Su Discusses Issues of Improving Police Administration; Police Treatment Gradually Improved and Unified

Central News Agency: Since the official merger of the First, Third, and West Shanghai Police Bureaus into the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau, Shanghai's police administration has been consolidated. In order to understand the current measures of police administration and the police education issues in the future, this reporter visited Mr. Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the Bureau, yesterday and asked some questions, which were answered in detail. It has been more than two months since the return of the concessions. Under the direction of Mayor Chen and with the cooperation of Allied officials, the police administration has become increasingly sound. From the 1st of this month, the Third and Fourth Shanghai Police Bureaus have been merged, and District 1483 is also managed under the system of the First Police Bureau. The completion of the unification of the police administration can alleviate the infinite pain of the people. In the past, during the time of the two concessions, under the high pressure of British and American forces, the police administration could not be unified, and there were many restrictions. The suffering of the people was not uncommon. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the police administration has been unified, and the Chinese official system has been adopted. From now on, our five million citizens will be able to live and work in peace under a reasonable national police administration. At the same time, the police education issue is also very important, because the police have the most daily contact with the people and can alleviate the difficulties of the people. Therefore, the police should be given strict training in the future to increase their police knowledge, so that they can be loyal and faithful, contribute everything to the country, maintain good local police order, and increase the welfare of the citizens. As Deputy Director, I am in an executive position. I can only carry out the work under the leadership of Mayor Chen and in accordance with Mayor Chen's will, and strive for the improvement of police affairs. Now, I can only bury myself in hard work, obey the guidance of my superiors, work hard at my position, and hope that the advanced figures in society will give me frank guidance. Finally, the reporter asked Mr. Su about the issue of the treatment of staff after the merger of the bureaus. According to his statement, the treatment of police officers in the past was quite inconsistent in the various bureaus. Now that the merger has been completed, it should be improved and unified as much as possible. Moreover, the treatment of the police has a direct impact on the people, but the overall financial problem must also be considered comprehensively. Therefore, the treatment problem is gradually being improved and unified."

### Police Authorities Strictly Prohibit Price Gouging on Coal Balls; Rationing Authorities Have Notified Coal Ball Factories

Central News Agency: The black market for coal balls in this city is rampant. Even if citizens pay the black market price, they still cannot buy them, and there is a risk of running out of fuel. According to the Central News Agency reporter's investigation with the rationing authorities of the industry: the source of coal has not been interrupted, and the supply of raw materials to the 22 coal ball factories has not been interrupted, and the price of raw materials has not been raised. Therefore, the current black market is actually caused by general retail coal ball stores. The rationing authorities of the industry have notified the coal ball factories to supervise the retail coal ball stores and prohibit them from illegally raising selling prices privately, otherwise the rationing will be stopped. The general public also hopes that the municipal authorities will quickly issue appropriate measures to maintain the people's livelihood. It is reported that the police authorities have ordered the police to monitor the retail coal ball stores, prohibit private price increases, and crack down on illegal coal ball merchants selling in the middle of the road, and strictly supply citizens in limited quantities at the retail coal ball stores. It is hoped that citizens who are not in urgent need will not compete for storage.

News Release Time: 7:10 PM Yesterday

### Lieutenant Commander Shitada Broadcasted Yesterday on the Battle of Bogenzaal Great Achievements of the Japanese Naval and Air Forces

Central News Agency: The Japanese-American war in the South Pacific is becoming increasingly fierce, especially the strong trend of the battle line in the Solomon Islands, which is attracting worldwide attention. Lieutenant Commander Shitada of the Japanese Fleet Press Department broadcasted on the Shanghai Radio Station at 9:30 PM last night, explaining the battle situation on Bogenville Island. The main points of the broadcast are recorded as follows:

Enemy's Purpose

The enemy's operational purpose is not to give Japan "time." Since August of last year, the enemy has been using Australia as a base to launch the so-called "counter-offensive against Japan" from Guadalkanar, a forward base far away from us. In the middle of this year and three months, the enemy successively held the Quebec Conference, the Washington Conference, and the Moscow Conference, boasting that they would launch a major offensive against Japan, and sacrificing a huge amount of manpower, resources, and material resources. However, what they can obtain can only be achieved by drawing closer and closer to Bera Lapeira from Guadalkanaru Island, so our predetermined strategy of "bleeding tactics" has been effective.

Since the Quebec Conference, the enemy's policy of not giving Japan time in the war has been to strengthen its forces as soon as possible on the Pacific front and attack Japan. For example, "If we want to defeat the Japanese army by next year or the year after, we will have to shed an unlimited amount of blood. This point should be taken into consideration." It is emphasized that if Japan is given time, the war will be defeated, so the enemy's biggest fear is that Japan will become stronger and stronger every moment.

Fierce Operation

Since October 16, the enemy's counter-offensive operations in the South Pacific have become increasingly fierce. This is also an attempt to prevent Japan from having enough time. Therefore, the enemy has repeatedly sent 100 to 300 enemy planes to attack, and enemy troops landed on Sono Island on Bogenville Island on the 27th. In this situation, the enemy intends to concentrate the full force of the United States and Australia on New Guinea and Bogenville Island to break through the front line in one fell swoop and recapture our main front line locations, such as Buin and Rabaul, and use this as a base to disrupt our economic and military resources in various places. Therefore, it can be imagined that if the enemy does not abandon this counter-offensive strategy, the enemy will launch a counter-offensive at any cost in the future. The naval battle near Sono Island on the 27th and the naval battle of Bogenville Island announced on the 5th, and the air battle of Bogenville Island announced on the 6th, all show the enemy's anxious state. Long-term operations are extremely beneficial to us, who are currently developing resources in the southern storage area, while the enemy fears that the war will be prolonged.

Great Naval and Air Battle

The air and naval battles of Bogenville Island: This kind of enemy counter-offensive operation, which attempts to shorten the time, has been hit by our "bleeding tactics." Four cruisers were sunk near Mono Island, and in the naval battle of Bogenville Island, eight to nine cruisers and nine destroyers were sunk or destroyed. In addition, two aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and two destroyers of a powerful mobile unit, which attempted to assist these large transportation units and smash our forces in one fell swoop, were also sunk by our aircraft in the area between Mono Island and Truk Island. In this battle of Bogenville Island, we only lost 15 aircraft, and in the air battle, we lost 3 aircraft. The spirit of the Japanese army is bound to impress the world's military experts and British and American military commentators. MacArthur is dreaming of recapturing Rabaul. Since October 17, he has launched an unprecedentedly large-scale air force to continuously attack Bogenville Island and the Finche Sea and Rabaul of New Guinea Island. Among them, from the 22nd to the 26th, the enemy planes that attacked the three locations totaled 2,064. We intercepted them every time, smashed the enemy's combat power, and achieved great results. On the 31st, the enemy dispatched a powerful transport fleet to the north of New Georgia Island. Our naval air force immediately discovered it and launched an attack on the night of the 31st. By the morning of November 2, four transport ships and more than 40 boats were sunk or destroyed, and three cruisers and three destroyers escorting the transport fleet were sunk or destroyed. At the same time, our naval forces also launched a fierce night battle on the night of November 1. Five to six enemy ships were bombed or destroyed, and four destroyers were lost. In the chaos, one enemy destroyer was bombed by its own forces, which shows the enemy's embarrassing situation.

From the evening of the 31st to the morning of the 2nd, except for a part of the troops that landed, the rest were almost completely annihilated. However, MacArthur still ordered Halsey, the commander of the US fleet, to attack Rabaul with 200 planes on the 2nd, but 127 of them were shot down by our naval air force, 51 by the naval forces, and 23 by the ground forces, totaling 202, accounting for 90% of the enemy's planes.

Concealing Defeat

Before attacking Bogenville Island, MacArthur convened Fleet Commander Halsey, Land Forces Commander Harmon, Marine Corps Commander Grid, and others to discuss operational plans. At the meeting, MacArthur boasted with confidence: "Bogenville Island will be captured within a week to build a joint combat and bombing air base." However, MacArthur lost 10,000 men, countless ships and aircraft, and aircraft carriers from the 31st to the 2nd. He must have been extremely sad in his heart, and the American news telegrams did not know whether they had already known MacArthur's sadness or were instructed by him to report that the American fleet hoped to encounter the Japanese fleet, even if it suffered great damage. The production of American aircraft is increasing, "so that the people can turn their eyes away from the fact that the 'bleeding tactics' suffered by Japan are reducing American productivity and the losses on Bogenville Island." Although the United States should try to conceal the matter in its propaganda, it has been fully exposed in this naval battle.

Weaknesses Exposed

The battle situation on Bogenville Island and the Finche Sea of New Guinea shows that the enemy is difficult to use its maximum strength, but the operation is still not satisfactory. The reason is that the enemy's transportation and supply are insufficient. The further the forward east and the front line are, the easier it is to clear. Therefore, the enemy's supply route extends from Asia to Guadalkanar and Bogenville Island, which further magnifies the weakness of American combat power. Therefore, the closer the enemy is to our strategic circle, the more obvious the enemy's weaknesses become.

Judging from the losses of the naval battle of Bogenville Island, the air battle in which four enemy aircraft were lost for every one of ours and the fact that our three aircraft exchanged for the total annihilation of the enemy's entire mobile unit, this great achievement is unprecedented in history. All of this is due to the outstanding skills of our naval aircraft and the surpassing fighting spirit. The enemy is trying to "prevent Japan from having time," but our operation is progressing according to plan, and the development of the South is also proceeding smoothly. In this great achievement, it can be shown that Japan's productive capacity has been significantly enhanced.

Comments from the Economic Community

### Income Tax and Transaction Tax

A proper way for a nation to raise war funds is nothing more than increasing taxes and issuing public bonds. Issuing banknotes is the worst policy, not just bad, but a slow suicide policy of quenching thirst with poison. However, if the issuance of wartime public bonds fails to achieve satisfactory results, the outcome will be the further issuance of banknotes, which is still a poor policy and a slow suicide policy. Therefore, the best wartime financial policy remains to levy taxes to cover various military and administrative expenses.

According to the news disclosed yesterday by the Shanghai Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, since the recovery of the foreign concessions, the business profit income tax voluntarily declared by companies and enterprises within the first and eighth districts to the office has reached a substantial amount of 36 million yuan. This indicates that our country's wartime finance has clearly embarked on a path of relying on increased taxes to overcome difficulties. In addition, after the reopening of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange yesterday, it was ordered to auction Chinese merchant stocks and collect a transaction tax of six ten-thousandths on spot stock trading on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. The method is for the original brokers to collect half each from the buyer and seller and submit it to the exchange for collection. This is another clear example of our country's wartime finance moving towards increased taxation.

Originally, a country's expenditures should be borne more by those who have the ability to do so, especially during wartime. The payment of income tax by the aforementioned companies and enterprises and the collection of transaction tax on spot stock trading are two concrete manifestations of making those who have the ability to do so bear more of the national military and administrative expenses. It is hoped that the financial authorities, under the parallel and non-contradictory tasks of contracting currency, increasing revenue, suppressing prices, and stabilizing people's livelihoods, will seek rationality in the collection of taxes everywhere. As long as it meets the needs and avoids arbitrary levies, the people should have no objections.

### The Stock Exchange Officially Reopened Yesterday, Auctioning Chinese Stock Spot Goods, Telephone Lines Not Yet Fully Installed, Trading Sparse

The Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange officially reopened at 9:30 am yesterday in the Shanghai market. All 144 approved brokers, accompanied by an agent wearing a badge, arrived at the exchange. Representatives from relevant authorities and the Securities Supervision Committee were present to monitor, while all others were refused entry for viewing. Trading hours were until 12:00 noon, with the afternoon closed. However, due to the fact that the telephone lines within the exchange were not yet fully installed during the opening auction yesterday morning, the buying and selling of various stock firms could not be concentrated. In addition, the rain was continuous, resulting in sparse trading, with a total volume of 800,000 yuan. It is expected that 30 pairs of intercom telephones can be installed tonight, and the listing can be completed within this week, so there should be good progress in the future.

Trading Units

It is reported that the trading units for listed Chinese stocks on the exchange are divided into three types: 10 shares, 100 shares, and 500 shares.

Price Fluctuation Range

The price fluctuation range for each transaction is 10 yuan for prices above 1,000 yuan, 5 yuan for prices between 500 and 1,000 yuan, 2.5 yuan for prices between 200 and 500 yuan, 1 yuan for prices between 100 and 200 yuan, 0.5 yuan for prices between 50 and 100 yuan, 0.25 yuan for prices below 50 yuan, and 0.1 yuan for prices below 10 yuan.

Commission of Five Thousandths

The handling fees collected by the exchange have been stipulated as five thousandths each for brokers from both the buyer and seller. The exchange collects one and two-fifths thousandths from each broker, and the remaining three and seven-fifths thousandths are the handling fees earned by each broker. In addition, a transaction tax of six ten-thousandths must be collected.

Spot Trading

The stock trading on the exchange is set as spot trading, with two types: immediate delivery and seven-day delivery. Immediate delivery must be completed by 2:00 pm the next afternoon, and seven-day delivery must be completed by 2:00 pm every Monday afternoon. All delivery procedures are entrusted to the National Credit Bank.

### Authorities Strictly Prohibit Illegal Transactions

Violators Will Be Punished Without Leniency

Under the strict supervision of the competent authorities, the overall price issue in the city has shown a stable state. All speculative hoarding, manipulation, price gouging, and illegal transactions such as short selling are strictly prohibited. Anyone found to be engaged in any of the above-mentioned transactions will not be shown any leniency and will be punished according to the law. For any kind of goods that are to be circulated and traded in the market, a request must be submitted to the relevant authorities in advance for evaluation of standard price limits or approval before it can be traded. However, when submitting the request, a list should be provided stating:

Item, place of origin, trademark name, date of production, manufacturing cost, desired profit, etc. A reporter inquired from various industries yesterday and found that there were few changes in industry and commerce last week.

Industrial Aspect

Except for a small number of factories that have gradually obtained raw materials and are preparing to start production and shipment, most major commodity factories, such as textile printing and dyeing factories, rubber factories, etc., are still temporarily suspending work due to the difficulty in obtaining manufacturing raw materials. However, in order to cope with the current environment, these factories have voluntarily increased their capital.

Commercial Situation

The market prices of most minor commodities have not fluctuated much, and there is an abundance of spot goods, presumably due to the release of large quantities of goods. However, the prices of some major commodities, such as food, fuel, and wool, have rebounded slightly, either due to limited inventory and obstructed sources, or due to improved circulation. The authorities have paid close attention to this. As for newly established businesses, they are very few, and the number of reorganized or transferred existing businesses has increased instead. Therefore, the city's industry and commerce have shifted from abnormal to declining.

### Military Allocation Association Affairs Taken Over by the Trade Liaison Association

All affairs of the "Central China Military Internal Transaction Consignment Material Sales Allocation Association" (commonly known as the Military Allocation Association), which has been responsible for material control and allocation in the occupied areas for several years, will be taken over by the "Shanghai-China Japan Trade Liaison Association" from today. The Military Allocation Association has long held considerable power in the Central China region, such as the allocation rights of major materials such as machine oil. In late June of this year, 40 Japanese industrial and commercial companies, trading companies, banks, and factories in the Central China region, under the initiative of the Economic Department of the Japanese Embassy, formed the "Japan Trade Federation" to统括various Japanese allocation and transportation associations, and to mutually assist the Chinese Commercial Control Association. Although the establishment of the Federation has been long in the making, it has only recently been formally established. With the support of the Japanese government, it has successively taken over various Japanese industry groups. The powerful Military Allocation Association is naturally no exception. According to the Japanese Embassy, the Japan Trade Federation and the Chinese Commercial Control Association are

Sister Organizations

In the future, the Federation will provide the Commercial Control Association with the greatest possible assistance and cooperation, so that the latter will have no restrictions in various matters. Even the ultimate control rights of major materials such as essential oils will be归需within the system of the Commercial Control Association. The absorption of the military collaboration association by the trade federation is probably a preliminary image of clearly defining the material control authority in the central China region.

Dynamics of Various Industry Associations

After being listed as a major commodity, the Joint Association of the industry, under the leadership of the National General Chamber of Commerce, has established a preparatory office. It is reported that the preparatory work has been largely completed, and it is scheduled to convene the founding meeting on the 24th of this month at the Ningbo Fellow Association. All industry associations in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai must join as members of the Federation.

Hardware Factory Industry The Hardware Factory Industry Association, organized by Pan Youfeng, Zhi Guangwang Lifan, and others, submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry. It is reported that approval has been granted. The association is scheduled to start handling member registration matters at 5 Xintangjia Lane, Qipu Road, starting from the 8th, with a membership deadline of only two weeks.

### Brief News

Maofeng Money Shop in Sichuan Road opened on the 8th of this month. On the same day, it received more than 30 million yuan in deposits. Guests included Wen Lanting, and they were warmly received by Chairman Pan Bingchen and General Manager Wang Hongfa.

### Material Exchange Between Central China and Mengjiang Implemented, Transaction Items Already Determined

As for the exchange trade between Central China and Mengjiang, according to reporters, the transaction items have also been determined. (A) Products shipped from the Central China side: flour, raw silk, silk fabrics, cotton bags, paper products, soap, candles, face powder, toothbrushes, plastic products, cosmetics, industrial medicines, metal products, dyes, paints, stationery, tea, miscellaneous food, sugar, cement, machinery and accessories, kitchen knives, etc. (B) Products shipped from the Mengjiang side: coal, medicines, others.

### Stock Trends

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were formally traded on the stock exchange. However, the trading was for trial purposes and the trading volume did not pick up until near noon. Most of the stocks were traded by the individual stock shops. The stock prices first rose then fell. New and old stocks had different trends. Standard MSG had the highest increase due to speculative buying. National China Investment Company and Yong'an Stock Company cooperated with each other, resulting in investors selling off shares. The market saw an increase in the morning and decrease in the afternoon. Only a few colleagues did trading as usual. The summary of stock industry is recorded as follows:

Department Stores Yong'an Company opened high but quickly fell back. Both Yong'an and New New both experienced minor declines. Wing On department store was steady. Neiyi was up slightly. Lee An department store opened above par.

King Lun was at the same price, and the transaction also increased.

Pharmaceuticals China-France, Hsing Asia opened high and then fell back, and the result was a minor decline. Sincere was also weak. Five Continents, China West, and others remained flat. New Star Pharmaceutical Factory rose nearly twice the par value.

Nan Yang tobacco and Public Chinese Investment stock rose significantly due to the buying momentum. Kang Yuan Manufacturing finally returned to flat. Standard MSG rose and others remained flat.

### Market Summary

Public Bonds Yesterday, the market price remained flat. The stock exchange was only open for the first day and for trial purposes, so the bond market was still brewing and there was not much to show. Class C initially rose high, and then fell back to the same as at the end of last week, remaining the same. The Class A, B, D, and E bonds saw mixed gains and losses, but the numbers were small.

Call Loan Yesterday morning, the call loan interest rate of the money industry association was 15%, unchanged. The interest rate remained tight.

Rice and Grain Yesterday morning, the source of rice in the west was slightly less. Also due to the weather, the transaction was slow. The market first rose then declined, with Bo Po Yang Jian all within the target price. The price of Yin Yuan was unchanged. The situation of miscellaneous grains was sluggish. The price of each minor grain was lowered slightly.

Daily Necessities The allocation still has no definite date. Therefore, the asking price of soap and matches remained at the highest level, but the sales were narrow. Most colleagues have stopped trading.

Medicinal Materials Recently, due to the small number of retail sales in the city, the market momentum has slightly improved. Sichuan goods and Zhejiang and Huai goods have uniformly fallen. Tianjin and North goods are still flat.

Cigarettes Although speculations for the future came from all parties, sales of cigarettes actually showed a downward trend. Great Britain fell sharply, Quan Lu also declined slightly. Great Front Gate remained at a high level, and it was difficult for other levels to maintain their original prices.

Rayon Yesterday, the intention of the retail stores to purchase goods was weak, which led to sluggish market momentum and a downward trend.

### Alas! The Future of Colonial Empire Great Britain

— Qiufeng

Because of this war, Great Britain has no choice but to be reduced to a third-rate country. This has become common knowledge. The well-known civilization critic William Younger (born in 1860) published an article entitled "The Future of Great Britain." He predicted that Great Britain will be reduced to a small country with a population of about 20 million, like the Netherlands, in the 21st century. His views are as follows: Great Britain has become a world power because it has benefited from special temporary conditions. However, these favorable conditions have now disappeared, and countless physical resources and unlimited population will gradually decrease. Recently, the British government authorities regard this increase in population as a matter of urgency. However, increasing the population is completely impossible. However, it does not matter if Great Britain becomes a small country with only a small population. During the era of Bacon, Shakespeare, and Mill, Great Britain was still a small country. Even if Great Britain becomes a small country like the Netherlands again, but as long as it can produce such outstanding people and make real contributions to world culture, then why bother to be sad? This article can arouse our interest because Younger believes that the decline of Great Britain is due to inevitable forces. Therefore, he takes the premise of certain defeat as the basis for his argument. This also shows that the decline of Great Britain is irreversible. The original article was published in the May issue of the "Fortnightly Review" in London as the lead article. The following is its translation:

Agriculture on the Road to Decline

The initial decline was the bankruptcy of British agriculture, which was already clear around 1878. The issuance of currency also seemed to be at this time. The rapid increase in actual wages in the previous century had stopped in the fifteen years before the First World War. The post-war recovery was highly anticipated before encountering the depression in 1929, but this blow was too much for Great Britain to bear. Great Britain is no longer the world's factory. Workers receive high wages, but they do very limited work. We lend large amounts of capital to foreign countries to create factories. Indeed, the interest generated by these loans helps greatly in maintaining the level of settlement, but this capital has now been fully repaid. Great Britain cannot but export goods like equipment across the customs barriers of rival countries, and export irreplaceable minerals overseas in order to support the food of the now inflated population. Even if we set aside the economic nationalism of other countries, Great Britain's foreign trade is paralyzed due to the burden of high production costs and a large population. It will take a long time for previous customers to restore their purchasing power!

No Hope for Population Growth

The current population of Great Britain is due to special conditions. These conditions have disappeared, but can reducing the standard of living maintain this population? The increase in population is determined by economic laws. Cairnes Roberts, in his book "The Revival of the Atlantic," argues that the population of Great Britain should always increase or decrease according to the actual average income per person. I would like to quote the following passage from Cairnes' book:

Europe has become an unprecedentedly densely populated area in world history, and this population is accustomed to a relatively high standard of living. Europe cannot be self-sufficient, and there we now encounter the only danger: that the standard of living of Europeans will rapidly fall to a point that some people regard as actual starvation. Looking back at the tragedy in the history of human progress over the centuries, this is probably a reaction caused by a temporary favorable sample that allows the population to expand, or due to natural forces or human hands, that suddenly stops.

The Inevitability of Great Britain's Decline

The British Empire is a federation composed of many countries. Therefore, in the future, the British Empire may be able to be successfully established with blood and spirit, but perhaps not, and it is not yet known. It is not impossible for all English-speaking countries to form an alliance, but in this alliance, the United States will be the leader! The era of industrialism that we are calling for has obviously come to an end. Therefore, our status as a strong country in Europe has also been lost. In the next hundred years, we will return to Great Britain before the industrial revolution. We fear that we will become a country with a population of 20 million, living a self-sufficient life. In summary, I look to the future with many expectations. Of course, the transition period cannot but be painful. But if we cannot now restrain dishonest agitators, then democracy will be destroyed in its last refuge!

### Eradicating Evil Thoroughly

— Huang Yan

Ancient China, unable to withstand the century-long erosion and poisoning by the British and Americans, has fallen into a state of destruction and decline. Although the majority of its evil forces have been swept away since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the deepness of its poison has already penetrated the bone marrow. Therefore, there are still many accumulated malpractices and lingering poisons in the social and cultural aspects, which are not easy to wash away cleanly in a short time. At this time when China and Japan are advancing side by side with the goal of expelling the evil forces of Britain and America, as the saying goes: "Cultivating virtue requires perseverance, eradicating evil requires thoroughness." It is truly necessary to thoroughly eradicate these deeply rooted malpractices. Based on my limited views, I will briefly describe several points as follows:

Replacing English with Chinese

English, under the guise of "introducing science" as a cultural strategy: In recent times, it has almost usurped the host's position, tending to exclude China's own writing. Regardless of major institutions, banks, stores, etc., how is the level of the staff's native language? Most are neglected and not deeply investigated, but the requirements for English proficiency are taken very seriously; even the schools that shoulder the responsibility of education (not to mention the so-called "missionary schools") not only list English as one of the most important subjects, some even force English training on students in the third or fourth grade of elementary school. Does such a measure not mean that the Chinese people will be taught to be slaves of the British and Americans for generations to come? China has its own solid writing system. Indeed, it may have various shortcomings, but this can only be overcome through its internal abandonment, and it is definitely not allowed to be replaced by English. I have seen many "compatriots" with yellow faces and lowered heads who, when expressing their intentions to each other, often abandon the Chinese language and use English to replace it. For example, when two people are parting, they can clearly say "再見 (zài jiàn - goodbye)!", but they insist on saying "Good Bye!" etc. This kind of slavish psychology that overvalues English, I believe, must be corrected. In order to correct this mistaken psychology, I humbly believe that:

All institutions, banks, companies, and stores should use Chinese as the main language in their documents.

The authorities should explicitly prohibit Chinese people from using English for letters, conversations, or other expressions of meaning in daily use.

The time for teaching English in schools should be greatly reduced. (It is really unnecessary for students in lower-level schools to learn English; the English subject should be abolished; the time spent on English studies in general secondary schools and above should also be reduced as much as possible.) (I heard that in secondary schools and above in North China, the English course has been changed to an elective subject, which is gratifying.)

Textbooks should not be used in English versions. If there are valuable English versions in science and literature that have not been translated, the Ministry of Education should designate a certain number, select those that are most needed and most relevant for Chinese people, and hire experts to translate them into Chinese versions before they can be read.

The above points can also be generally applied to other foreign languages, depending on the needs of the situation, in principle.

Eradicating Ideological Toxins

For thousands of years, Chinese social culture has been centered on Confucianism. Regarding merchants' pursuit of profit, the words "righteousness" and "profit" have always been mutually coordinated and not contradictory. Originally, the Chinese people regarded those who were diligently pursuing profit as "small men" and did not value them. Confucius once said: "The superior man is conversant with righteousness; the mean man is conversant with profit." Yan Hui lived in a humble alley, eating a single basket of rice and drinking a gourd of water; Confucius praised him. Even if Zigong was good at accumulating wealth, it was not valued by the literati.

However, since the intrusion of the evils of mammonism and utilitarianism into China, it has greatly created the bad psychology in today's Chinese society, where people generally value money and disregard morality, and are selfish and self-serving. Such as the rampant speculation in recent years, the fratricide caused by the struggle for wealth, the discord between brothers... and the snobbery of valuing clothes and disregarding character, etc., directly or indirectly, it can be said that all are affected by the poison of this morbid psychology. Thus, the entire society values money, neglects morality, and falls into a precarious situation. If this continues, it will inevitably form a second Jewish people. This phenomenon cannot be ignored by us, and therefore, we should find ways to correct it. On the negative side, I think at least:

The various material enjoyments of the rich should be restricted, and their private lives should be strictly supervised.

The opening of all pleasure venues (commonly known as "gold-consuming caves") and the manufacture, sale, and use of luxury goods should be prohibited.

If the above two points cannot be achieved for the time being, at least the highest or special tax rates should be levied on their donations.

Restrict merchants' free trade and usury.

Strictly strengthen the material control and allocation policy. If there are any violations, in addition to fines, physical punishment should also be imposed.

Stipulate the clothing and living standards of people of all levels, including scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants... strive to keep their consumption to a very low level (especially the lifestyle of the merchant class and generally decadent public officials should be paid more attention to).

The above are only from the negative side, and on the positive side:

Actively promote the New National Movement. Not just persuasion, but also coercion.

Advocate for proper entertainment, and provide various conveniences, encouragement, rewards, or assistance when necessary.

The government should provide honorary and material rewards to those among the scholars, farmers, and workers who are honest, lonely, and hardworking in their positions and have achievements. Ensure that they are not forced to leave their posts due to hunger and cold. At the same time, it can avoid being despised by the wealthy.

All of the above are based on principles. In short, the use of money must be restricted, and the omnipotent effect of money must be sometimes exhausted so that the talent without money is better than the wealth with money. In the beginning, the motive and purpose of mammonists was only to accumulate money to satisfy all their desires. If this can be done, I think at least it can make "the poor have no envy and no extravagant thoughts; the rich have no arrogance and extravagance, and eliminate the sprouts of lust." From then on, the ideas of mammonism and utilitarianism may no longer have room for mischief in the hearts of the Chinese people!

Formal Reform

Reform of Western Suits and Abolition of Ties—Speaking of Western suits, everyone praises their convenience, but I have always thought that Western suit ties are a kind of tumor, a kind of "civilized shackle". For example, economically speaking, it is really not cost-effective to spend a few yuan or dozens of yuan to buy these things. And every day, in order to make it neat and tidy, it takes a lot of time. And in terms of practicality, it is not necessarily needed in clothing. Even in terms of aesthetics, it is not necessarily beautiful, because beauty and ugliness are relative. Who dares to say that having a tie is definitely more beautiful than not having one? Therefore, I think ties are really a superfluous thing in clothing. The acquisition of materials is so difficult, every thread should be doubly cherished, thinking about where it comes from is not easy. Instead of spending precious materials and labor to make such an unnecessary thing, it is better to transfer it to other uses, to increase the production of necessities and increase a bit of vitality for the country. Therefore, I think the ties of Western suits really need to be abolished.

After the ties are abolished, the style of Western suits should be changed accordingly. In terms of quality, it does not necessarily have to be British or American wool. In terms of style and convenience, the "Zhongshan suit" or "student uniform" set by the Premier is a good style of clothing that takes the advantages and discards the disadvantages. The authorities can also issue an order to designate it as the national service uniform of China so that the whole country can follow it. Confucius said: "If Guan Zhong had ruled the barbarians, we should have been wearing our hair unbound, and fastening our robes on the left side." The British and Americans are already our enemies, and Western suits are the common clothes of the British and Americans, why should we learn to wear the clothes of the enemy?

Abolition of High Heels—I think women's high heels are also a "civilized shackle." It is a foot binding that Europeans and Americans have infected us with. I have heard and seen many modern female compatriots struggling to fight for freedom. Since the ban on foot binding, it can be said that women's feet have been liberated. But since the popularity of high heels, many of the so-called modern female compatriots who strive for women's freedom have followed suit, and as a result, they have once again fallen into the abyss of pain and unfreedom. Really, is it difficult to say: "Modernity is just a little bit of style?" Can the freedom that is protected be said to be willingly abandoned again?

The above few points, I suppose, will not be "throwing away food because of choking"! I sincerely hope that everyone can work together to eradicate accumulated malpractices and wash away the remaining poisons. Infuse new blood so that the new China can recover and be built up sooner.

### A Record of Visiting the Tongren Charity Association's Model Training Institute

— Jun

A few days ago, I traveled through Nanshi, near Bijiayu Road, and saw a desolate scene of collapsed houses and rubble. Walking and walking, near the intersection of Minguo Road, I suddenly saw a temple standing on the roadside. Looking at it, it was the Fire God Temple. The temple looked old, with the words "Tongren Charity Association Model Factory and Training Institute" and "Civilian Obligation School" written on it in large characters, black ink on a white background, which were very clear. Entering it, the buildings were dilapidated, the pavilions were all furnaces, and two or three women were drawing water and washing clothes in the courtyard, chatting and laughing freely. In the back hall, I saw more than a hundred orphans divided into three places, taking classes. They were all cleanly dressed and had clean faces, and they acted generously, but they were light and thin, and wore single clothes. After inspecting it for a week, I felt that the regulations of the institute were commendable, but it still needed more arrangements.

Wandering around, I turned upstairs and saw a craft room on the opposite side with a mud workshop and a knot workshop, displaying products, of which the "Golden Rooster Standing Alone" commemorative product was the most outstanding. Passing the office, I entered the director's office. The director of Anhui Province received me and invited me to sit down. After offering tea, I asked for details. He replied that Mr. Xu Qianlin from Yuyao had set up a model factory for vagrants in Jiangwan, and hired Mr. Cai Chunfang to preside over it. The scale was grand, but it has now been disbanded, but the spirit of Tongren still exists. Mr. Cai, based on his foresight, established this institute here in March of this year, intending to revive the factory and continue his ambition. To date, it has not been a full year, and the number of orphans admitted has increased daily, but because the supply is huge and the source of funds is lacking, Director Cai has repeatedly felt that he cannot continue. He runs around all day, begging philanthropists from all walks of life to happily donate and help, but there is too much porridge for too many monks, so distribution is difficult. Now it is cool autumn, and when autumn goes, winter cold comes again, and quilts, cotton clothes, and shoes and socks are still needed. Recently, Director Cai has felt depressed every day. After finishing speaking, he seemed to be thinking. I said to him, "If Mr. Cai is here, construction will happen one day." I wanted to see him, but he said that he had gone out on business. I sat silently for a while, bid farewell, and went out. Looking up, I saw two scrolls of Yuyao scenery and landscape paintings on the wall, with Cai Jun's pictures printed on them. I thought they must have been painted by Director Cai, with clear depictions and elegant writing, and superb skills. After returning home, I expressed my feelings and wrote this to call for the orphans in the institute. I hope that philanthropists from all walks of life will generously show benevolence and righteousness, donate money if you have money, and generously sponsor, donate things if you have things, and help the orphans, in order to promote social welfare and benefit the promotion of the new Republic of China.

### Youth Light Corps Launches Social Service Work

Since its establishment, the Youth League of the Youth Association has worked hard in various social service undertakings. The Youth Light Free School, which was run this summer, has more than 300 graduates, with excellent results. Recently, the personnel of the group have been changed, and the new officers' inauguration ceremony will be held. More than 600 guests arrived, and Mr. Li Shoubao presided over the inauguration ceremony. After the meeting, there were wonderful performances, which aroused the interest of the guests. After this reorganization, the organization of the group became stronger. Recently, it will take a further step to launch various social service works.

### Poor Teacher Requests Winter Clothing

I have been serving in secondary school education for many years. I have always been honest and self-reliant, and I have never been lax in my work for a day. However, recently, prices have soared endlessly, and a meager salary of several hundred yuan is difficult to maintain even the lowest level of personal life, let alone other things. Now, due to an accident, all my clothes have been lost. The leaking house is exposed to the rain, and it is difficult to endure the cold weather in winter with only a few clothes. I have no choice but to ask to borrow a corner of your newspaper to call for help from those in society who sympathize with poor teachers, donate a few winter clothes and a cotton quilt so that I can avoid the cold and continue working.
