### Citizens Should Double Their Efforts – Mayor Chen’s Broadcast on the National Day of the 32nd Year of the Republic of China

Gentlemen:

Today is the Double Tenth National Day of the 32nd year of the Republic of China. The Republic of China, born from the Xinhai Revolution, is now in its prime. Having overcome many hardships and difficulties, we are able to enjoy freedom and independence today, which is something we should celebrate. However, our responsibilities are now greater, and our undertakings are expanding. I would like to quote a phrase from the Father of the Nation: "The revolution has not yet succeeded; comrades must continue to work hard."

Today's National Day is different from those of previous years. It is a major event unprecedented in history, which all of us citizens should thoroughly understand and strive to work even harder for in the future.

The Significance of This Participation in the War

The first major event is the participation of the Republic of China in the war. You all remember that China participated in the First World War as well. However, this participation in the Greater East Asia War is different from the previous participation. The first participation in the European ____ was merely a war among the great powers. In other words, it was simply following behind Britain and the United States in a war to seize their interests. Although there was Wilson's propaganda in the world at the time, and other pleasant-sounding articles on paper, claiming that the war was for justice and righteousness, and that nations could exercise self-determination after the war, China still could not exercise self-determination after the end of the European war, and small and weak nations around the world still could not exercise self-determination. All colonies... even India, which Britain had promised autonomy, still could not exercise self-determination. On the contrary, imperialism's shackles on East Asia became increasingly stronger, and its instigation of disputes among the countries of East Asia became more frequent. Therefore, China's previous participation in the war was no different from being an accomplice in the international arena, and no different from binding ourselves. The significance and reality of China's participation in the Greater East Asia War this time are completely different from the first participation. We are not only seeking liberation for ourselves, but also seeking liberation for all nations in East Asia. China is now independent and free, and the colonies of East Asia, Burma and the Philippines, are also independent and free. Even the people of Malaya and Java have gained the right to participate in politics. This ideal is very grand, and this ____ is very important. It is in line with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, and it is precisely in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will that we unite with the nations of the world that treat us as equals, and strive together to move forward.

Abolition of Unequal Treaties

The second major event is the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions to the Republic of China by Japan and other countries. Gentlemen, do we want to know the meaning of the abolition of unequal treaties, as proclaimed to us by the Father of the Nation? China's inability to be independent and free, and China's inability to become a modern nation, was entirely due to the shackles of unequal treaties. Now that extraterritoriality has been abolished and the concessions have been returned, the goal of liberation sought by the entire nation of China since the revolution has been achieved. This year, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo made a solemn statement to the Diet that he would revise the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty signed in the winter of the 29th year. The implementation of this statement is imminent. From now on, China will be a completely independent and free nation in the world, and a completely equal nation in the international arena. Our people across the country, after countless hardships and difficulties, have obtained today's liberation, which can be comforting to our ancestors. It can be comforting to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's forty years of dedication to the revolution, and it can be comforting to all the martyrs who established the republic since the Xinhai Revolution.

However, why did I just quote Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, "The revolution has not yet succeeded; comrades must continue to work hard," to encourage you all? It is because the Greater East Asia War is still underway, and comprehensive peace has not yet been achieved. Therefore, we must double our efforts.

Efforts in the Greater East Asia War

Regarding the unfolding of the Greater East Asia War, we should examine ourselves to see the extent of our cooperation. We also know that in this Greater East Asia War, we have made considerable contributions of materials, and the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have provided no small amount of assistance to Japan's restoration and construction of Southeast Asia. However, we must not be satisfied with this, and we are even more willing to make a step forward in cooperation. President Wang has proclaimed to us that we should live or die together with Japan. Therefore, we should not be content with sharing the joys and sorrows with the Japanese people in the rear, but should be willing to live or die together with the Japanese soldiers on the front lines. We must know that this Greater East Asia War is not a matter of the survival of a certain country in East Asia, but a matter of the survival of all nations in East Asia. China is not only seeking liberation for itself, but also seeking liberation for all nations in East Asia. Therefore, we must establish security in the rear, increase production, and even more so, organize the people and train soldiers. We hope that one day we will bring forth the spirit of the Chinese nation to seek righteousness and benevolence, and carry out the liberation of all Asian nations on the battlefield, and fight against the imperialists.

Seeking National Liberation

Speaking of this, I deeply wish to say a few words to Chongqing. The goal of the National Government is to seek comprehensive peace, and even more so to seek cooperation with Japan to defend East Asia and liberate East Asia. Perhaps our ideals are obscured by personal emotions and cannot be understood. However, the National Government has been in power for three and a half years, and our sincerity for peace, the purpose of our participation in the war, the success of the abolition of extraterritoriality and the recovery of the concessions, and the discussion of the revision of the Basic Treaty are all being realized before our eyes. You should all understand. China has gone from being unfree and dependent to being free and independent, and China has gone from being unliberated to being liberated. You should also know these facts. The significance of the Greater East Asia War is based on the spirit of Eastern morality, in order to realize the liberation of all nations. We should even more so rely on the spirit of Eastern morality to understand Japan and participate in the Greater East Asia War. Now the Sino-Japanese Incident has become a term of the past, and I hope that the people of the whole country will base themselves on the will of the Father of the Nation and the spirit of wisdom, benevolence, and courage of the Chinese nation, unify China, unify peace, and the whole country will join this war against imperialists to liberate East Asia, in order to complete a great undertaking in history.

My beloved citizens, today is truly a once-in-a-millennium opportunity, a good opportunity for us to revive China, and a good opportunity for us to defend East Asia. Since the Opium War, we have often been oppressed by others due to our weakness. From the late Qing Dynasty to the early Republic of China, we relied on the international balance of power to survive. Since the First World War, we have relied even more on the League of Nations... In short, we relied on the parallel movements of Britain and the United States to survive. From now on, we are a completely independent and free nation. We should rouse our spirits, exhaust our mental and physical strength, to strive for survival, seek liberation for ourselves, and also seek liberation for all of Asia. I respectfully wish the Republic of China a long life! Long live!

Economic Circle Commentary

### Increasing Agricultural and Industrial Production

For this year's National Day Commemorative Edition, our newspaper specially solicited articles, focusing on "How to Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production?" This issue is a major concern for the revival of the nation, and the wartime economic policies announced by the National Government also take increasing production as their central focus. Therefore, how to increase agricultural and industrial production is the most urgent, important, and worthy of research and discussion issue today.

We believe that the opinions contributed by people in society, especially economic leaders, regarding this issue are closely related to the future of China's economy as a whole. Standing from the perspective of the world, we deeply feel that under the resounding call of how to increase agricultural and industrial production, the issue of national rewards should be given special attention.

In order to speed up the steps of industrial production and promote the progress of agricultural and industrial production in both quality and quantity, we feel that the national reward method must include the following key points: Under appropriate price policies, ensure the income of agricultural and industrial producers to encourage their reproduction; Regarding the purchase of agricultural products, special encouragement should be given to farmers' reproduction; Regarding the protection of workers' lives, special attention should be paid to the promotion of welfare undertakings; Implement the method of "exchanging what you have for what you don't have" to promote the exchange of agricultural products and daily industrial products; Support legitimate private enterprises and groups, and give encouragement and incentives to factories they establish that are truly related to the necessities of people's daily life. Priority should be given to those who should be given priority, and preferential treatment should be given to those who should be given preferential prices.

All of these stable and prudent measures must be included in the government's plan to reward the increase of agricultural and industrial output so that the nation's human and material resources can be entirely concentrated in the various sectors of agricultural and industrial production, working together for the great cause of stabilizing people's livelihood in wartime. Wouldn't that be a great accomplishment?

### New Cloth Factory Businesses Request Relief Central Reserve Bank Agrees to Provide Loans Negotiating Methods with China Dyeing and Weaving Bank

The Cloth Factory Industry Association of this city stated that after purchasing yarn and cloth, the capital of each cloth factory was exhausted, and the livelihood of employees was insecure. The association sent a letter to the Cotton Products Federation to transfer it to the United Association to discuss with the Central Reserve Bank to allocate 20 million yuan in national currency to be transferred to member factories by the China Dyeing and Weaving Industry Bank. The Commercial United Association immediately transferred the letter to the Central Reserve Bank for verification and processing. It is recently learned that the Central Reserve Bank is deeply sympathetic to the request of the Cloth Factory Industry Association to allocate 20 million yuan in national currency for relief and has replied to the Commercial United Association in a letter, which briefly states: "Upon investigation, if the China Dyeing and Weaving Industry Bank, organized by the same industry, can provide sufficient collateral, it can directly negotiate with the Shanghai branch of this bank to discuss loan methods. In addition to informing the branch to negotiate and draft a plan at any time for review and approval, please check and inform [the applicant]," etc. The Commercial United Association has already forwarded the letter for notification after receiving it.

### Taxation Methods After the Stock Exchange Resumes Business

The Silver Industry Association informed member firms and bankers, saying: "By way of introduction, we recently received a letter from the Ministry of Finance, Qian Er Zi No. 188, stating: 'After the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange has been ordered by this ministry in conjunction with the Ministry of Industry to resume business, the relevant articles of the Stock Exchange Transaction Kissing Regulations on which the securities transaction tax is levied have also been submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation after amendment by this ministry in conjunction with the Ministry of Industry. In addition to distribution, we are forwarding the amended articles for the association to inform and pass on to all member banks for joint notification.'", and attached a copy of the amended articles on transaction tax. Accordingly, we have transferred them separately and attached a copy of the amended articles for your reference. Attached is the amended article of Article 2 of the Stock Exchange Transaction Tax Regulations. The National Government promulgated on September 30, 32, that marketable securities are taxed according to price. The amount per hundred yuan or less is calculated as one hundred yuan. Spot transactions are taxed at 6/10,000 of the transaction price, futures are taxed at 4/10,000 of the agreed price, and transactions in government-issued public bonds and treasury bills are calculated at one-quarter of the tax rate.

### Silver and Money Businesses Closed for Next Two Days Resume Business on the 12th

All silver and money businesses in this city, in accordance with the regulations of the Silver and Money Industry Association, will be closed for one day in commemoration of the Double Tenth National Day on October 10th. Because that day falls on a Sunday, a regular holiday, a compensatory holiday will be taken on the 11th (Monday). Business will resume on the 12th. All bills and receipts during the holiday period will be handled upon resumption of business. It is also heard that all market businesses will follow the holiday arrangements for the silver and money businesses, and all markets will be closed on the 10th and 11th.

### Ministry of Industry Approves Fur to be Listed as a Major Commodity

Recently, the Leather Industry Association and the Japanese Leather Industry Association of Central China requested that fur be listed as a major commodity. The Fur Industry Association should unanimously join the Central China Federation and send a letter to the Commercial United Association for verification. The Commercial United Association reported the situation to the Ministry of Industry for review and approval. Later, the Ministry of Industry sent a letter to the Materials Control Review Board for deliberation. According to recent inquiries, it has been learned that the 5th Standing Committee meeting of the Materials Control Review Board has decided to approve that fur should be included in the list of major commodities and has sent a letter to the Ministry of Industry for handling. The Commercial United Association has also received a reply from the Ministry of Industry and has separately forwarded it to the Leather Industry Association and the Japanese Leather Industry Association of Central China for their information and handling.

### Coal United Association to Manage Coal Merchants

The Shanghai Coal United Association, in view of the frequent illegal activities in the coal industry, has decided to strengthen the organization for the management of coal retailers and distributors in order to regulate the supply and demand in the market, which has a significant impact on people's livelihood. It has been decided that all coal retailers, whether old or new, must join the association.

Those located south of the Suzhou River must join the Shanghai Special Municipality Coal Retailers Association as members, and those located north of the Suzhou River must join the Coal Retailers Association as members.

The selling price of members must absolutely comply with the approved price limit and must not exceed or fall below it. It is absolutely forbidden to hoard goods and refuse to sell, or engage in black market transactions.

### Supervisory Bureau Cracks Down on Illegal Insurance Companies

The Insurance Supervisory Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in view of the great importance of the insurance industry to the social economy, stipulates that all institutions engaged in the insurance business must apply to the bureau for registration and a license. There are also qualification restrictions for insurance agents. The bureau recently found that in various parts of Jingzhou, there are those who claim to be insurance companies or agents of insurance businesses. These institutions have not obtained licenses from the bureau and are illegal. The bureau will now order such illegal businesses to cease operations and will also impose appropriate penalties. In the future, all economic insurance businesses must register and obtain licenses and must comply with the Insurance Industry Law for management.

### Match and Soap Inventory Registration

It is also stipulated that the inventory of soap and matches must be registered. The method is as follows: All matches exceeding one box (1,200 boxes, each box containing 90 sticks) and soap exceeding one box in stock at the close of business on October 9 of this year must be registered with the office by the storage or owner or any person with economic or management relationship to the matches so stored.

After filling it out, it should be sent to the office by the 18th of this month. Before other methods are announced, any changes in the storage location and (or) owner of matches or soap, as well as inventory landscape, must be registered with the office. If the above rules are violated, the stored matches or soap will be confiscated and appropriate punishment will be given. It is also learned that the distribution of matches and soap in the urban and inland areas will not be implemented at the same time and will be delayed.

Translation commentary:

### Adjustments to Trading Organizations

Central China is a link in the material exchange mechanism, and there is a gradual trend of improvement. We see that the recent frequent meetings of relevant authorities are a symbol of promoting trading organizations, which is truly fortunate.

There is no doubt that Central China is an important part of the material exchange of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The economic relationship between North China and Central China is even closer. Therefore, the material exchange between North China and Central China can be said to be the foundation of trade activities in the Chinese region. Reviewing the Provisional Regulations of the National Commercial System Association, one article stipulates that the Commercial System Association is responsible for handling the operation of material exchanges in various regions within the country. Therefore, the above tasks tend to develop with the branches of the Commercial System Association. It is sincerely hoped that it will be strengthened in the future.

The material exchange between Central China and Japan is also an important issue. The Japan Trading Group has been the China Trade Federation since its establishment on July 1 this year. Its basic constituents are allocation unions and military distribution groups. Since the reorganization, progress has been very rapid. Regarding the mission of this new organization, Mr. Nishiryo, the Director-General of the Military Distribution General Affairs Committee, said: "With the epoch-making progress in the political system of the current National Government, the China-Japan Trade Federation has new developments. Under this major situation, it has extremely important significance because it can promote the integrated cooperation between Japan and China and complete the holy war. Of course, to ensure the smooth operation of trade associations, all aspects, whether human or material, must be rectified, and only sincere cooperation can achieve the expected goals."

Here, we sincerely hope that the trade association supplementary agencies of the Commercial System Association will coordinate with each other and operate smoothly, so that the material exchange in Central China will be more active, and all matters related to goods, prices, and production will be improved accordingly. Under the current circumstances, there can be no further delays. This mutually beneficial economic operation is too important for the local decisive battle system to be ignored.

## Page 4

Continued from the eighth page of the National Day Special Issue; those who inherited the mantle of Wang Shigu included Yang Jin, Song Jun, Cai Jia, etc.; while Wu Yushan and Wang Lu were particularly outstanding. Yushan studied under Yan Ke, but drew more strength from Huang He. His work is rich and profound, the best among the six masters, and his style is superior to that of Shigu. He shares the same purpose with Nanshan but has a different approach. However, few of his works have been passed down. Lu often praised Yushan and criticized Shigu, and instructed his disciples, saying, "Among the painters of our time, only Yushan is worthy." Dai Wenjie also said that Wu Mo should be regarded as the best in the current era for his deep and profound works. Lu was particularly outstanding in imitating Da Chi and Qian Shou, his works being neither sweet nor astringent, light yet thick, solid yet clear, with a scholarly aura overflowing beyond the brush and ink. Later, Wang Chen, Wang Jiu, and Wang Yu, crowned with Lu, were also known as the "Little Four Wangs." Among Lu's four disciples, the one who best inherited his mantle was Huang. Shen Deqian's "愚文鈔" lists five people who were famous for their paintings in the contemporary era: Yun Shouping, Wu Li, Wang Yuanqi, Wang, and Huang Ding. They are called the Loudong School. Fang Shishu, Zhang Zongcang, and the Dong Bangda and Dong father and son, Qian Weiqiao and Wei Po brothers, are disciples who respect the ancient masters. They use dry ink to render the mountains and rocks, and accumulated charred ink to depict the trees, lush and shaded. Although they are said to belong to the Loudong School, their spirit and charm actually come from the revered ones. They have surpassed their predecessors and are breaking free from the confines of Loudong. Below Wang Shigu are Yang Jin, Gu Fang, Hu Jie and others, who are called the Yushan School. In addition to these schools, there are also the Xin'an School, the Songjiang School, the Jiangxi School, and the Jinling School. Hong Ren founded the Xin'an School. Dong Qichang initiated the Songjiang School, and Zhao Wendu was its leader. Luo Mu rose in Ningdu and traveled to Nanchang with his learning. His brushwork was ethereal, and his fame moved the officials. Many scholars followed him, and this was called the Jiangxi School. Jue Shijiao, Sun Yi, and Wang Zhirui, together with Jianjiang, were known as the Four Great Masters of Haiyang. The two families of Jiangzuo, father and son, are called Xiao and Sun, namely Xiao Yuncong and Sun Yi. Zheng Zheng, Fang Tingxian, and Gu Daquan were known at the time as the "Three Pillars" for their equal fame and substance. Gong Xian was the leader of the Jinling School, and Fan Qi, Gaocen, Zou Zhe, Wu Hong, Ye Xin, Hu Zheng, Xie Sun, etc., were called the "Eight Masters of Jinling." Their styles were bold, vigorous, deep, majestic, refined, and elegant, and their works were exquisite at the time.

From the early Qing Dynasty to the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, each school had its own strengths and was influenced by the Southern School. However, the Jinling masters still retained the style of the Northern School. In addition, the Ming loyalists Bada Shanren, Fang Yizhi, Xiang Shengmo, Hong Su, Wu Shantai, Zhang Feng, Chuanshan, Mei Qing, Da Chongguang, as well as Zhu Yizun and Weng Songnian, were all able to create their own unique styles and express the unrestrained spirit within their hearts. Bada Shanren became a monk after the fall of the Ming Dynasty. He was good at calligraphy and seal carving, and his paintings were exceptionally unique. He also painted figures, landscapes, flowers, and birds. Particularly outstanding were the two monks, one named Daoji and the other named Kun Can; they were known as Shi Tao. Shi Tao's style was uninhibited and unrestrained, while Shi Tao's was profound and powerful, and he excelled in austerity. The two were also called the "Two Shi." I once read the "Painting Talks of Monk Kua Gua," and it was as if I were gazing into the distant and mysterious, not knowing where his thoughts came from, suddenly enlightened, not knowing where his words came from! What was the scope and depth of Da Chongguang's paintings, which were highly praised by Shigu and Nantian? Hui Chong, Ju Ran, and these two Shi were collectively known as the "Four Buddhas of the Southern School." Qiu Shengsheng said, "The Two Shi have captured the essence of the Southern School," which is indeed true. After that, only a few people, such as Tang Yifen, Dai Xi, and Huang Shen, inherited the Southern School.

Tracing back to the Southern School from Wang Wei and Zhang Zao, it gradually became more subtle. At first, it was misty and blurry; then, the clouds and mountains became illusory. At first, the mountains were deep and the valleys secluded, striving for strange peaks and steep cliffs; then, the water became wide and the sky vast, focusing on ordinary scenery. Those who immerse themselves in it seem to doubt reality and illusion, transcending self and things. At the beginning of the transformation, the real is none other than the illusory, and the illusory is none other than the real; after the transformation, the illusory becomes even more illusory, and the real undergoes further changes. With each change of the real, I do not know where it ends; with each illusion of the illusory, I cannot know where it will ultimately lead. Reality, illusion, things, and self are all the same. Therefore, it is said that confronting reality means eliminating illusion; confronting oneself means forgetting oneself. Illusion upon illusion is the truest reality, which is also absolute beauty. It is like the wild horse and the dust, living beings breathing with each breath. Those who create art focus their intentions on things and their spirits on illusion, letting their brushes flow, unrestrained and free. Therefore, it is said that "xieyi" (意寫, freehand) is the pastime of scholars, while those who criticize it are not real connoisseurs. This is why practitioners are practitioners. Practitioners are not ignorant of the nature of things, but their minds are governed by the heart, and the heart is governed by action, which is probably the limit. Dong Qichang said, "The way of painting, what is meant by 'the universe is in hand' is that there is nothing but vitality before you, so those people often live long. Those who are meticulous and detailed and enslaved by things will lose vitality and will not live long. Ni Zan, Shen Zhou, and Wen Zhengming all lived to old age; Qiu Ying died young, at only sixty years old. Although Qiu and Zhao had different styles, they were both followers, not those who took painting as a refuge and joy." How could it not be so? How could it not be so! The evolution of painting has been rapid! A single thread becomes silk, a second change becomes thorns, a third change becomes Dong Yuan and Ju Ran, then Fan Kuan and the Two Mis, then the various masters of the Yuan Dynasty, and then the masters of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Tracing the path, at the beginning it is moist, very moist, at the beginning it is moist and rough, then it is moist and smooth. Chao Buzhi said, "Painting should write the outer form of things, requiring the shape of things not to be violated; poetry conveys the meaning beyond the painting, not only the state within the painting." Siweng said, "This is Song painting." Dongpo said, "Discussing painting only in terms of likeness is like being a neighbor to children; writing poetry in this way is definitely not knowing poetry." Siweng said, "This is Yuan painting." Yue Zheng said, "Scholars should express their feelings and not forget the source. The main thing is the intention, not the likeness; the emphasis is on rhyme, not skill. Skill leads to craft, likeness leads to vulgarity." I say, "This is Ming painting at its best." Reaching the famous masters of the Qing Dynasty, the form becomes more and more simplified, while the inner intention becomes more and more profound. As they say, "The extreme of splendor is plainness." What is particularly unique is that many famous masters after the Song Dynasty flourished in the Jiangnan region, and especially in Wu. Wang Qian said, "Since Yun Shouping and Monk Hongren, the paintings of Wu have been known for their ethereal, sparse, elegant, and exquisite qualities. Is it because the essence of the sea cliffs is biased towards the eastern land? Or is it the residual charm of the past, influencing later generations?" Alas! I understand! The thoughts of the people of Jiangnan flow like streams, their spirits erupt like springs, carefree and leisurely, unconsciously connecting with the marvelous, their thoughts entering the secluded. Therefore, their paintings are light but full of spirit, quiet but with flowing thoughts, scattered but with integrated emotions, simple but with rich interests, with limited form but endless meaning. This is why Southern painting is the world of humanity and why people of art and learning delve so deeply into it.

Among those who wrote flowers in the Qing Dynasty, in addition to the Southern School, there were Wang Wu and Jiang Tingxi, etc. Wang Wu and Yamada both mastered the "boneless" method of painting flowers, and scholars followed them. Jiang Yuan's paintings are few, and he also learned from Wang An. Among the painters of the Yongzheng and Qianlong periods, the "Ten Great Painters" were the most prominent, including the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, the Four Gentlemen, the Three Wonders of Zhexi, and the Four Wangs and Wu. Among the Ten Great Painters, Gao Qipei, Gao Fenghan, Yu Zhiding, Dai Chong, and Dong Bangda were the most famous. Gao Fenghan's left-handed paintings were particularly interesting. Dong Yuan and Beiyuan, Ni Zan, and Huang Gongwang were known as the "Two Dongs." The Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou included Luo Ping, Li Fangying, Li Shan, Jin Nong, Huang Shen, Zheng Xie, Wang Shishen, and Hua Yan. The Four Gentlemen were Gao Qipei, Gao Fenghan, Wang Shishen, and Zheng Xie, plus Cai Jia and Zhu Mian. The Three Wonders of Zhexi were Huang Yi, Jiang Sheng, and Wu Li. The painters of Zhexi were known for their skill, writing directly from life. Jin Nong and Huang Shen were the most prominent. Hua Yan, Fang Shishu, Qian Weicheng, Zhang Zongcang, Zhang Zongwan, Gu Qian, Fang Xun, Qu Dakun, Shen Zongqian, and Lu Huai were all famous for a time. Among the court painters at that time were the Italian priest Giuseppe Castiglione, Jibingzhen, Leng Mei, and Jiao Dai. In addition to Li Futang, Zou Yigui and Zhang Hua followed the style of Shaonan. Shen Quan was able to skillfully imitate Castiglione's outlining of flowers and leaves and his rendering of life. He traveled east, and his painting style influenced Japan. Yu Shoumin's painting of sugar cane and geese was also famous for a time. He Qi Pei was known for his landscapes, but his figure paintings were lively and could be compared with Qing Teng and Bai Yang.

Among the painters of the Daoguang period were Dong Gao, Wang Honghao, Zhang Si'ning, and Zhang Guangzao, with Dai Xi and Tang Yifen being the most distinctive. Dai and Tang were both loyal and pure, and their characters were noble, so their paintings naturally approached the extraordinary. At this time, there were two "yi pin" (逸品, unrestrained style) artists, Li Yongbin (Yunfu) and Yanghu Mengqin (Yitang). Yunfu's style was ancient and profound, similar to Qing Teng and Bai Yang, and his brushwork was elegant and light, like Du Fu's poems; Yitang's brushwork was ancient and profound, using thick green and blue to paint flowers, making the fresh paper look like ancient silk, clear springs harmonizing, calligraphy, painting, and seal carving being three perfections, seeking vitality in ancient thickness, also a genius of the time. Among the figure painters and calligraphers were Gai Qi and Zhang Shibo. During the Xianfeng, Tongzhi, and Guangxu periods, famous painters included the "Three Xiongs," Zhang Xiong, whose landscapes followed the Four Wangs; Zhu Xiong, whose flower paintings imitated Bai Yang; and Ren Xiong, whose figure paintings followed Chen Hongshou. Then there were Qian Du and Zhao Zhiqian. There were also the "Three Rens," Ren Wei (Weichang) and his brother Xun and cousin Yuan. Ren Xun was skilled in painting flowers and birds, and Yuan was good at painting figures, flowers, and birds. Then there were Wu Xizai, Wu Tao, Monk Guxi, Pu Hua, and Wu Shixian; He Weipu and Lu Hui were also followers of the Southern School. Wu Changshuo's paintings could combine the styles of Qing Teng, Bai Yang, and others, and incorporated the interest of bronze and stone inscriptions, so they were also outstanding, with a vibrant vitality. Qing Daoren wrote Buddhist images in the brushstrokes of bronze and stone inscriptions. Wu Changshuo said: "The paintings of Qing Daoren should be compared with the Lingguang Hall of Lu and the Wu Liang Shrine, seeking position, not knowing Tang and Song, let alone North and South." However, in his early years, he wrote landscapes, entering directly into the masters of Nantian, and in his later years he resembled Bada in his purity. The flowers and birds were in the style of Shitao. It was all due to the same qi. Chen Shizeng was excellent in both landscapes and flower paintings, but it is a pity that he died young, which is also the misfortune of modern art circles.

The decline of our country's painting art has reached its extreme today. It is not only a decline, but also about to be extinguished! Even in counties and towns, there are no known painters. The two or three remaining masters are copying the dregs of Wang and Yun's tasteless and worthless works. Whether done with a dry brush or with a meticulous brush, they are all like chewing wax. In this great world, how can one become a prisoner of painting and still boast about it, or copy and transmit, taking the crude and leaving the essence, spreading paper to paint plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums, or making a few strokes, lacking both rhyme and method, and yet be called a famous master? Is this not a grave injustice? Even those who can earnestly study often get lost in the theory of schools and are limited by their own views, so that the trend becomes increasingly lower and the customs become more and more humble, unable to break free. Some who have heard of it deeply criticize the Zhe school, and those who follow Loudong often criticize Wumen, blindly imitating and finding it difficult to distinguish. Alas! How can the subtleties of painting theory and the greatness of art and learning be confined to a single school or sect? The deeper the view of schools and sects, the more difficult it is to untie the shackles. Therefore, the artistic mind of recent painters has become increasingly narrow and easily exhausted, leaving nothing to admire, and those who are fragmented and broken are even more worthy of lamentation. If the ancestral style is not restored, how can one not feel sorrow?

### The Future Endeavors of Shen Bao - Commemorating the 60th Anniversary of This Newspaper -

This year marks the 60th anniversary of this newspaper. In order to embody the spirit of "growing stronger with age" and "self-improvement," and to seek the progress of this newspaper, new working guidelines were formulated and solemnly announced to the people of the country in the 60th Anniversary Declaration of this newspaper on September 1 of last year.

In this declaration, it was said: "In the new historical pages that will continue to unfold in the future, how should this newspaper shoulder the important responsibility of leading society and promoting the times? How can we lead society onto a rational path? How can we lead our nation to prosperity and prosperity? This is what our colleagues at this newspaper solemnly and deeply consider and dare not relax in the slightest after sixty years." It also said, "We will actively take action to improve this newspaper, work hard to fulfill our responsibilities, not shirk responsibility, not be afraid of shrinking, and do our best to contribute." At the same time, it also advocated the introduction of new scientific knowledge, the indication of the world economic turning point, the exploration of social problems, the representation of fair public opinion, the guidance and support of young people, the study of border issues, the promotion of immigration to the border, and the presentation of the situation of international politics as the goals of future efforts.

However, unfortunately, seventeen days after the publication of this declaration, the world-shaking September 18th Incident in Northeast China suddenly broke out. Subsequently, the January 28th Shanghai Battle followed. Facing the great disaster, the country was worried and fearful, and concentrated its efforts on resisting the enemy at hand. Therefore, the above-mentioned efforts were temporarily put aside and have not yet begun.

From last year to this year, the country has been in constant turmoil, and the national crisis remains "unchanged." The colleagues of this newspaper have realized that the way to overcome the national crisis is not in empty shouts, nor in unconscious blind action. The most important thing is to "do one's best" and to "do" in reality. In order to "do our best," this newspaper has decided to start from now on and gradually promote the realization of the plan announced to the people of the country last year with the spirit of "doing in reality."

1.  In terms of layout, efforts should be made to coordinate news and advertisements and strive for clarity and eye-catchingness.

2.  For foreign correspondences, such as Europe, the United States, the Soviet Union, and overseas Chinese, especially Japan, efforts should be made to publish as many systematic communications as possible.

3.  For domestic local communications, efforts should be made to be universal. Efforts should be made to systematically record the people's livelihood, hardships, and political and economic conditions in various places, with particular attention to the current situation in the lost land of the Northeast.

4.  Every Monday, a special economic publication will be compiled from the space for commercial news, detailing the economic changes at home and abroad during the week, and compiling various important statistics. Commercial news will also be gradually improved to make it readable to the public.

5.  Although "Free Talk" is only a supplement, it is very important for reconciling readers' interests. In the future, the published texts will be divided into long creative works, short translations of world-famous novels, science stories, world customs, essays for women and children, and humorous texts. Interesting public opinion polls or prize essay contests will be held from time to time, adhering to the principles of not violating the trend of the times and being popular.

6.  The "Reader Communication" column was temporarily suspended after the January 28th Incident due to the reduction of space. Now it has been restored and renamed "Reader Advisor." Experts will answer questions about politics, economics, law, occupation, marriage, family, education, rural areas, natural science, medicine, society and other issues.

7.  The local supplement will also add two columns: long novels and shop assistant communications. Every Sunday, an "Amateur Weekly" will be published from the supplement space to arouse the reading interest of general workers, shop assistants, and apprentices, instill various common sense, and improve their amateur life.

8.  A circulating library will be established in this city, selecting and purchasing various common-sense application books for the public. All citizens have the right to borrow books, and efforts will be made to facilitate the borrowing procedures. This will directly promote public education and indirectly promote the improvement of general amateur life.

9.  Various supplements will be added, such as movies, which have already been attached; economic, amateur, architectural, and health supplements, which will be published from December; and education, national goods, and science supplements, which will be published in order. They will all be distributed with this newspaper to other cities, or only limited to this city, so that readers can obtain the knowledge and information they need according to their preferences.

10. The "Shen Bao Monthly" has been founded for half a year. The contribution of the monthly is to state and judge the current political and economic situation at home and abroad, and to point out its trends, in order to supplement the deficiencies of the daily newspaper.

11. The "Shen Bao Yearbook" is being compiled and will meet with the public in March next year (reservations have already begun). The yearbook summarizes the main facts of our country's politics, economy, and society over the past year, and systematically describes them, with various important statistics attached. Each year, a large volume is published, which is tantamount to a faithful history of our country's national conditions year by year.

12. Since last year, this newspaper has hired experts to compile an unprecedentedly detailed map of our country. In fact, these materials have been collected and surveyed by experts over a long period of more than ten years, and are currently being printed and will be published next year. In addition, domestic statistical experts have been hired to compile and translate the latest German publication "World Social and Economic Statistical Charts," and reliable domestic materials have been collected to compile various important statistics on our country, with more than 100 statistical charts and dozens of explanations, which are currently being compiled and translated. The above twelve items are the efforts of this newspaper every issue after December 1. Naturally, this is only the beginning of the newspaper's efforts.

The colleagues of this newspaper believe that the news industry is the most powerful tool for promoting society. Especially this newspaper, with its 60-year history, has at least one million readers every day, which is tantamount to a great educational machine for society. How to use this machine? How to make this machine generate great power and great efficiency? Of course, it is absolutely not something that a few colleagues of this newspaper can do, but rather requires the great power of the public to promote it.

At the same time, on the other hand, the newspaper is tantamount to a sound machine of society, conveying fair public opinion and telling the suffering of the people, which is also the mission that the newspaper should earnestly shoulder. However, whether this mission can be faithfully shouldered, of course, depends not only on a few colleagues of this newspaper, but also especially on the government's love and support. Therefore, at the beginning of hard work, this newspaper humbly expects the public to support and guide it with twelve points of sincerity.

### A Respectful Word to the Chinese Friends of Shanghai

— Old Man Funatsu

There is a Chinese saying, "The people of Qi worry about the sky falling." Right now, the majority of Chinese people in Shanghai seem to be making unnecessary trouble for themselves. Because commodity prices are extremely high, life is very difficult for the millions of people in Shanghai. Originally, the reason for rising commodity prices is, in principle, because of a shortage of materials, where supply cannot meet demand. However, supplies are not necessarily scarce, and there are various reasons why prices are high. The most important are speculation and rumors. All kinds of rumors are used to drastically shake people's hearts and disrupt the market. Furthermore, many unscrupulous merchants take advantage of these rumors to manipulate prices and profit from them. As a result, the majority of the people suffer. So, why are the Chinese so easily misled? There is a reason for this. It's like how people with weak bodies are prone to illness. The Chinese people cannot clearly see the future situation, so as soon as they hear rumors, they become helpless and at a loss. I will further concretely analyze the mentality of the majority of Chinese people. They often hear rumors released by the Wang Jingwei regime and Chongqing, thinking that the final outcome of the Greater East Asia War might be the end of their political power. Even the Chinese intellectual class has this way of thinking. Since they already have doubts about Japan's future, they naturally have doubts about the future of the two National Governments. Since they harbor distrust towards the Nanjing government, they naturally also distrust the banknotes issued by the puppet regime. Naturally, people's hearts are shaken, commodity prices soar, and hoarding of goods occurs as a result. The people's suffering is thus doubled. All this is because the majority of Chinese people cannot clearly see the future situation and lack sufficient understanding of Japan's real strength. Therefore, I say this is worrying about things that are unlikely to happen, and also making unnecessary trouble for oneself.

A Glimpse of Actual Experience

Some Chinese people see that this time Italy surrendered, and fear that Japan will soon meet the same fate. When that happens, the Japanese side will definitely be greatly affected, and they fear that Japan will not be able to hold on. This kind of thinking is completely wrong. We believe that no matter how the situation in Europe changes, Japan's foundation will not waver. This Greater East Asia War cannot be ended in three years. At least five years, maybe even more than ten years. During such a long period, there may sometimes be local defeats, which are unavoidable. But we absolutely believe that the final victory will definitely be on the Japanese side. I am not just talking big or striking a high tone; it is based on past actual experience.

What is meant by past actual experience? More than six hundred years ago, the Mongols invaded Japan, and we completely won the war. Let's not mention that history for the moment. We also completely won the wars against the Great Qing Dynasty and Russia. When we went to war with the Great Qing Dynasty, if we compared the military strength of the two countries, we, from a subjective point of view, were of course confident. But from the point of view of a third party, the Qing Dynasty was such a large country, with 400 million people. The North China Fleet at that time (the Beiyang Fleet, which was equipped with battleships of over 7,000 tons), was so powerful. Japan's largest warship was only a little over three or four thousand tons. Those 7,500-ton battleships were like today's 750,000-ton battleships. They were the most dominant force in the world. Therefore, from the point of view of people in Europe and America, Japan would definitely not be able to defeat the Qing Dynasty. Moreover, at that time, British warships in the area were hindering Japan's operations in various ways, even secretly helping the Qing Dynasty. But after the Qing Dynasty was defeated, Japan's army and navy won the war, ultimately achieving a great victory. Britain then changed its attitude. In just a few years, Britain took a step further and signed a military alliance treaty with Japan.

More than ten years later, when we went to war with Russia, if we compared the military strength of the two countries, from the point of view of a third country, Japan's army and navy were no match for Russia. In particular, Japan's navy was far inferior to Russia's. Therefore, at that time, people in Europe and America viewed Japan and Russia fighting as if a child was fighting a strong man. Japan was bound to fail. Even we Japanese were not necessarily confident. So why did we take the risk and go to war with Russia? I will tell you the reason:

In the year of Gengzi (1900), among the various incidents involving the Boxer Rebellion, Russia, taking advantage of the situation, sent troops to Manchuria (Russia did not have many troops, but they occupied Manchuria). Manchuria was considered to be a part of China, so China repeatedly lodged protests. However, Russia ignored them and even considered Taiwan as part of its sphere of influence. At that time, China's material strength was helpless against Russia. Therefore, Japan had no choice but to come forward and ask Russia to withdraw its troops. After several years of effort and negotiation, there were no results. If we continued to endure in this way, although Japan would definitely not be destroyed, it would definitely fall into the ranks of third- or fourth-rate countries. That was exactly the situation of "losing whether we fight or don't fight." Therefore, Japan had no choice but to disregard success or failure and resolutely stake the fate of the country and declare war on Russia. After a full year of war, fortunately, we finally achieved a great victory. Older people probably still remember this.

Recognizing Japan's National Power

This time, Japan is confronting the two most powerful countries in the world, Britain and the United States. From the point of view of third countries, it is still considered an extremely reckless adventure. However, is Japan's national power really that weak? No, Japan is actually very strong. To resolve the Pacific issue with the hands of diplomacy, our diplomats spent a great deal of effort and pondered for a long time. We sent Ambassador Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura to the United States. Ambassador Kurusu was not a diplomat. He and Roosevelt were old friends. Ambassador Nomura was also a veteran. We hoped that they would be able to resolve the problem in the United States. (We once appointed Mr. Shigeno as Foreign Minister, which was for the same purpose.) However, the United States not only did not respond to our just demands, but we saw through their ambition to permanently make Asia our colony. Therefore, we had no choice but to declare war on Britain and the United States. However, our determination this time was carefully considered, and we were fully confident of victory before we began to act. The international situation is the same as when we went to war with Russia, but our national power is stronger than when we fought Russia that year. As expected, within a few months of the start of the war, we broke the strongholds of Britain and the United States in Asia, crushed their forces, and although we have already been fighting militarily for a long time, we are certainly more advantageous than Britain, and after we occupied various places, all military supplies were more abundant than before. We are now defending the land we have obtained, and although the enemy is putting up a desperate struggle, our position is much better than before the war. Britain and the United States are now desperately trying to recapture the land we have occupied, and are fighting hard in various places. However, we are using Sun Tzu's military strategy, that is, the strategy of "waiting for the enemy to tire," to defeat them. Now, the three important factors of timing, location, and popular support are all on our side. Of course, the reason for the final victory, besides battleships, airplanes, submarines, and cannons, is that we Japanese have a spirit of not fearing death and a spirit of hard work and endurance, which is stronger than that of any other country. With this spiritual power and this strategy, we are of course bound to win and never be defeated. I also have one more thing to say: the ancients said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation." I think that we Asians are all responsible for the rise and fall of Asia. If this Greater East Asia War fails (although this will absolutely not happen), we Asians will forever be slaves to others. Therefore, we Asians should unite and cooperate, those with money should contribute money, those with strength should contribute strength, those with knowledge should contribute knowledge, endure hardships together, live and die together, and necessarily achieve victory, to live up to our ancestors.

Achieving Comprehensive Peace

There is one thing I would like to say to my Chinese friends. China has already joined the Greater East Asia War and should have the obligation to assist Japan in fighting Britain and the United States together. However, it is said that the Chinese people do not need to send troops or armies to the front lines to fight. Currently, in China, doing one most important and beneficial thing is the issue of comprehensive peace that Chairman Wang is enthusiastically promoting. If this work of national peace can be accomplished, Japan can also withdraw its troops immediately, and the 400 million people of China can be saved from the depths of suffering. I hope that the 400 million people of China will work together to do this work quickly. Those who oppose or obstruct this work are enemies of the 400 million compatriots and should be expelled completely!

### How Should the Chinese Government and People Cooperate to Revive the Nation?

— Hakata Nami

The National Day anniversary comes once a year, and today marks the thirty-first anniversary. Reviewing past experiences, understanding current lessons, and planning for the future, I don't know how many women have made speeches. But for practical politics and the improvement of people's livelihoods, how many improvements have there been in government affairs? I guess there haven't been any!

This year's Chinese National Day is a coincidence, and I have been entrusted by the Shen Bao authorities to write an article on "How Should the Chinese Government and People Cooperate to Revive the Nation?" to contribute to the National Day special issue.

Recalling Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionary martyrs, why did they want to overthrow the Manchu Qing government and establish a republic? I think most people probably wanted to reform politics, believing that the autocratic regime had no hope, and that after changing to a republic, the nation's power could be revitalized and the country could be made strong and the people rich. Therefore, on October 10, 1911, the Wuchang Uprising broke out, and the whole country responded, and the Republic of China was quickly established. I remember that during the first National Day of the Republic, it was precisely when Mr. Sun took office as President. At this time, the atmosphere was renewed, the whole world celebrated, national flags flew, the whole country rejoiced, and the scenery of Zijin Mountain was not a small sight. It was truly a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity. Thinking back to today, the National Day celebrations of this golden age have gone and will never return. From Yuan Shikai's usurpation of power and proclaiming himself emperor in the third year of the Republic to the completion of the Northern Expedition by the National Revolutionary Army in the sixteenth year of the Republic, for more than ten years, wars continued, internal strife arose, and there was no peace. Even after the establishment of the National Government in Nanjing, during the Double Ten Festival of the sixteenth year of the Republic, the atmosphere seemed to be renewed, but suddenly the communist bandits launched disturbances, ravaging China, causing the people to live in misery. Since the military forces in the Southeast were unable to quell the rebellion, the National Day celebrations from the sixteenth to the twenty-fifth years of the Republic passed by in a rush.

On the National Day of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, it happened to be the beginning of the unfortunate war between China and Japan. Unexpectedly, the war has continued, and the people have suffered. Now it is the National Day of the thirty-second year of the Republic, and the war has not yet ended. So, although the Republic of China has been established for twelve years, what have the Chinese people actually gained? I think whether it is officials or common people, everyone will frown and sigh. Is this the original intention of creating the Republic? Therefore, it is the responsibility of the Chinese government and people. Therefore, I will study this issue and write this short article to ask for correction from the patriotic people of your country.

How the Government Should Cooperate

Now, let me explain the plan for the government's cooperation in reviving the nation in three points:

Strengthening East Asian Self-Awareness—Chairman Wang of the National Government once said, "The Republic of China has been born for more than thirty years, and it has still not been able to achieve a state of peace. The reason for this is that China lacks national self-awareness in East Asia." This is a sharp and insightful observation. Speaking of East Asian national self-awareness, one is reminded of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. That doctrine aims to establish the Chinese nation as a unit to stand in opposition to another unit. This kind of national thinking is the same as the "Elder Brother Doctrine" thought of Japan since ancient times. Unfortunately, in recent years, Mr. Sun's successors have lacked East Asian self-awareness, and have become slaves to British and American decadence and narrow nationalism. They completely fail to understand Japan, which seeks to establish close ties with China, and mistakenly believe that Japan is an Asian imperialist. This is due to British and American formulas. Therefore, since the Greater East Asia War broke out, followed by China's participation in the war, on the one hand, it is necessary to eliminate the remaining forces of Britain and the United States, which can be called domestic revolution. On the other hand, since China and Japan are now moving towards building a new order in East Asia together, it can also be called world revolution.

Sino-Japanese Cooperation Concept—Today, those who discuss Sino-Japanese relations cannot but consider that China's impression of Japan has been renewed. That is, China has many directions for understanding Japan. Furthermore, based on this understanding, they take cooperative action. As far as thorough cooperation between the two countries is concerned, China's weakness is equivalent to the instability of the foundation of cooperation. Therefore, in order to strengthen the foundation of Sino-Japanese cooperation, enriching China's strength is not only China's sole problem, but also Japan's problem. Therefore, the Japanese government has repeatedly stated that it is willing to thoroughly assist China's revival. I firmly believe that the day the Sino-Japanese problem is finally resolved is the day China's revival is completed.

Stability of People's Livelihood First—Stability of people's livelihood is the prerequisite for cultivating manpower. Cultivating sufficient manpower can give full play to the functions of power. Currently, the biggest obstacle to people's livelihood is the reliance of a small number of people on special backgrounds to engage in illegal corruption, manipulate the market, speculate, and hoard goods, especially in Shanghai. Although political leaders have expressed their determination to eliminate corruption, corrupt officials are outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant, and there has been no public action. For example, thoroughly investigating hoarding was initially carried out vigorously, but then disappeared without a trace. The situation in this regard is certainly not something outsiders can guess. Another example is the grain ration, which is "the people take food as their heaven." Since the recovery of the concessions, only the "postponement," "price increase," "reduction in quantity," and "poor quality with sand" of the rationed rice have been heard, which has led to the miserable cries of the people. I know that no one in the Chinese society feels satisfied with the rationed rice. If the people's food problem is so messed up, where is the space for governance? This cannot be dismissed with the clever excuses of those in charge. It must be known that the support of the people is the greatest touchstone for the success or failure of governance. Seeing that the government claims to suppress commodity prices, but commodity prices increase instead, and even when prices occasionally fall, they do not fall by even one-tenth of the amount, but the amount of increase is tens or hundreds of times more. I remember Han Yu said, "It's warm in winter, but the children cry of cold; it's a good harvest year, but the wives weep from hunger." May I ask, who caused this? Corrupt and exploitative officials, on the other hand, spend thousands of dollars every night without caring, indulging in extravagance and dancing and singing, unaware of the wartime situation. And the poor people, on the other hand, live a life of a hundred deaths and one survival, working hard all year round, and still cannot make ends meet. Is this the way to revive the nation? Therefore, I hope that the government authorities will make the stability of people's livelihood and the elimination of corruption the first principle, and thoroughly correct selfish thoughts and actions.

How the People Should Cooperate

The above is about the government. Now I will state three points for the people:

Understanding the Significance of the Era, and Supporting the Government—In this difficult and extraordinary period, in addition to absolute trust in and obedience to the government, the people must fully understand that the current great era is an era of absolute long-term war. Not only must we contribute everything, but we must also prepare to sacrifice everything for the long term, with a spirit of not fearing hardship and regarding death as returning home, in order to seek co-existence and co-prosperity. We must completely eliminate selfish thoughts, and speculation and hoarding are fundamentally not what the people should do at this time. On the one hand, we must strive to increase production, and on the other hand, we must practice extreme frugality. This is a critical moment of life and death, and also a crucial moment for the revival of China!

Changing to a New National Concept—After the end of this World War, East Asia and Europe will be rebuilt with a new order. Therefore, China's current participation in the war is not only a declaration of war against Britain and the United States, but also an expression of China's desire to occupy a place in the rebuilding of a new world order. Therefore, the old, narrow national concept is no longer suitable for the times. Only with the spirit of East Asia sharing life and death can we achieve the reality of East Asian co-existence and co-prosperity. Broadly speaking, the decision of victory or defeat in war mainly depends on whether the spirit of national sacrifice is strong or not. The so-called modern warfare is a war of national morality, which is why. Therefore, I hope that the Chinese people will all be determined to share life and death, work together to win the final victory, and then revive the Republic of China.

Raising Awareness of the Supremacy of the Nation—Due to the cultural aggression of Britain and the United States, the Chinese people have become victims of material civilization, misunderstand the liberalism and narrow nationalism, and their national consciousness has become extremely blurred. Therefore, China is now in the process of eliminating the inferior traits of the British and Americans in the past, and is standing on the same front with Japan with an independent and free position. It should be known that the Japanese people are all loyal believers in nationalism, that without a nation, there are no people. The people are willing to contribute all their property and even their lives to the nation, and the nation will never deceive its people, just like parents loving their children, being kind and protecting their citizens. I sincerely hope that the Chinese people will also have this concept and become the cornerstone of reviving the nation.

In short, the government and the people working together to revive the nation are related and not separate. Moreover, in the Republic of China, sovereignty rests with the people, and the government authorities are also part of the people. The people, deeply regretting the past thirty-one National Days, should deeply regret abandoning their responsibilities. For the present plan, we must stand firm, not fear hard work, take responsibility, and first seek the realization of peace, and then engage in the strategy of working together to revive the nation. In this way, we will not fail Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the martyrs. May a bright and glorious Republic of China shine in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere one day. This is my infinite hope.

### Accomplish China's Revival, Strive for Production and Construction

— Takenouchi Fumio

Every year on Double Ten Day, we who love China are often intoxicated by the dream of memories.

Deeply etched in my heart, President Li Yuanhong, a revolutionary with great merit, gave me a large plaque that reads: "Boundless radiance - Presented to Mr. Takenouchi, Li Yuanhong." It records the thirty-three years of overlapping dreams of the revolution, unsparingly painted as a panorama of the ever-changing, whirlwind-like history since the first revolution. That plump-faced Li Yuanhong, who always had the warm face of a loving father; that Father of the Nation Sun Wen, who went north to Beijing in the twelfth year of the Republic with hope for cooperation between Duan Qirui and Zhang Zuolin, the tense situation when welcoming him at Beijing Station; that Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek of the National Revolutionary Army in the sixteenth year of the Republic, who drove straight in with the momentum of a broken bamboo, swept across the Jiangnan area, and granted an audience from the top floor of a building in the French Concession of Shanghai, with a firm will - the May Thirtieth Incident that once turned Shanghai into a dead city, etc. The many revolutionary stories are all breathing and reviving in my mind. Thinking about it, it has been a long thirty-three years.

October 10th of the third year of Xuantong, the first revolution that broke out in Wuchang, was the start of the long-sleeping "Chinese monster" moving towards "New China". If it is said that this start towards New China is the essence of the first revolution, then I believe that the Greater East Asia War is precisely what promises the completion of this Chinese revolution. Why do I say this? The goal of the Chinese revolution, internally, lies in destroying the Manchus and reviving the Hans, and establishing a republican democracy. Externally, it lies in abolishing unequal treaties and restoring an independent sovereign state. Its internal goal was roughly completed in the first revolution, and its external goal, with the Greater East Asia War as an opportunity, and due to Japan's initiative and the exchange of diplomatic relations, is quickly entering the final period of success. Japan's policy towards China, announced on January 9 of this year, stipulated the abolition of the two major pillars of China's unequal treaties - extraterritoriality and the handover of concessions. Now the power of taxation has been recovered by China, and the concessions have also been completely handed over. Not only that, but Prime Minister Tojo has also stated that he will revise the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, and China's becoming a completely sovereign state is imminent. In this way, China's dawn will soon arrive, and Father Sun Wen's lament that "the revolution has not yet succeeded" will become a thing of the past, and we will move towards the historical and inevitable path of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity.

### The Way to Wealth and Military Strength

Speaking of "How Should the Chinese Government and People Cooperate to Revive the Nation", I am reminded of two things in my memory. One is "Five Urgent Tasks for Japan at Present" by Kanda Takahira, the pioneer of Western economics in Japan; the other is the far-sighted plans for the construction of the great air force of military Germany. Let me start with the former first.

Kanda Takahira and Fukuzawa Yukichi were both pioneers in introducing modern economics from abroad in Japan. Eight years before the Meiji Restoration (1868), that is, in the first year of Bunkyu, they had already advocated "Establishing the Country Through Commerce and Industry". In the first year of Meiji, he put forward "Five Urgent Tasks for Japan at Present", detailing them as follows. The five tasks are the essence of nation-building.

Japan should be a permanently independent country and should never be subordinate to other countries.

To make Japan independent, it is necessary to strengthen national power accordingly.

To strengthen national power, the country must be united.

To make the country united, the people should completely obey the government's politics.

To make the people obey the government's politics, the government should widely adopt domestic public opinion and should never be confined to one view.

Mr. Kanda Takahira put the essence of nation-building and the secret of national governance into the above five items, and from the beginning he advocated realizing these five requirements, which are the independence of the country, the enrichment of national power, national unity, the people's trust in politics, and respect for public opinion in politics. If these five items can be completed, then the country will reach the realm of "sufficient food, sufficient military, and the people trust it" as Confucius said, and the rulers will be able to reach the realm of "If the people are sufficient, who will the ruler be insufficient with? If the people are insufficient, who will the ruler be sufficient with?" And open up the world of "politics is correctness." With unity between the government and the people, the ideal country of wealth and military strength can be completed here.

When the author reviews the current situation in China today with these five items, he cannot help but feel a sense of "Not yet!" and cannot but sigh that today's obligations are greater than this. Liang Qichao, the "Chief of Chinese Journalism," has a section in his "Chinese Soul" that discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the Han people:

Weaknesses: Lack of public morality, lack of national thought, lack of a spirit of active enterprise, etc.

Strengths: Skilled in self-government, with a nature of adventure and independence, skilled in learning, and with a comprehensive way of thinking, etc.

The teachings are words that China and we cannot help but feel are relevant.

Eiichi Shibusawa, the highest leader in the Japanese business world during the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa periods, sighed about the decline of politics and pointed out: "Politics is neither power nor art. Politics clearly cannot be other than virtue. This is the foundation of politics." He advocated the unity of politics and virtue, considering it the utmost importance, and inheriting the true meaning of Confucius's saying "politics is correctness". However, politics is not passive or negative. Politics is often dynamic. That is often active and enterprising, and must have sufficient guidance to make the people unite. Furthermore, this guidance must be rational and enlightened.

Moreover, politics takes the people as its object. Therefore, the government's guidance is definitely not directed at one person only. On the government side, politics is the concrete manifestation of the policies that run in parallel with the virtue of gathering the hearts of the people. On the people's side, there must be a conscious obedience to politics and an induced spontaneous cooperation, and there must be a national organization and training with a state of vigorous vitality from the bottom up. Establishing a national organization through this kind of clear guidance of politics and the Baojia system, the New People's Movement, and youth training is the first task of China today, and it will become the dividing line between China's future rise and fall. Uniting China's 450 million people into a solid community cannot but be said to be the most important task in opening up China's current situation. And the center of this is the unity of China, Japan, and Manchuria. Moreover, what is to be demanded of the National Government at this time is that the government should match the psychology of the Chinese people. It goes without saying that they should clearly recognize that the guidance from the top down is greater than the demands from the bottom up. The National Government must stand on this understanding and sense of responsibility, grasp this grand worldview, listen to Mr. Wang Jingwei's leadership, mobilize all the Chinese people, and China and Japan must support each other and devote all their efforts to defeating Britain and the United States and establishing the great cause of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity.

### Understanding Industrial Revolution

Next, I will introduce a story about Germany's quick and decisive construction of a large air force. The great cause of Germany's construction of a large air force did not come from a boastful and arrogant nature, but from a sober reflection on the state of the country, and was based on Hitler's intelligent reason and decisive judgment. I will briefly describe a piece of history:

Hitler's German regime was established in 1933. After the establishment of the regime, Hitler immediately devoted himself to the great cause of building the nation through military strength, determined to create the world's number one air force.

### Continuing from Number One

At that time, Germany was restricted by the treaty and did not have the right to possess an air force. Therefore, aircraft manufacturing was still rudimentary, and the technology and materials were not abundant. Hitler sought resources from the United States, which was the most advanced in the world at the time, and recruited American technicians.

Before 1933, there were sporadic purchases from the United States, but it was not until 1933 that substantial purchases began. Engines were purchased from Pratt & Whitney in the United States, and propellers were bought from Hamilton Standard. Electrical instruments for aircraft were also purchased from the United States. In addition, to initiate large-scale aircraft production, study groups were sent, and American technicians were recruited. Consequently, these resources and technologies, combined with the tireless research and ingenious inspiration of German scholars and technicians, surpassed even the United States. This was demonstrated in the recent war, where advancements in quality and quantity were astonishing.

What lessons does this German experience offer to China? Probably many! The most important point should be self-awareness, humility, and rational handling of matters! As mentioned earlier, China, due to the First Revolution, began to "promote the construction of a New China," and the Greater East Asia War predetermined the "completion of a New China." However, this great undertaking of building a New China is not easily accomplished. It cannot be achieved through empty words, telegrams, self-deception, superficiality, or exaggeration. It requires unity between officials and the people, nationwide consensus, and a fully mobilized national system. With appropriate guidance from the government and the self-motivated efforts of the people, it is possible. Furthermore, since China's new construction prioritizes economic development, and after the economic blockade from heavily relied-upon Britain and the United States, the nation can only use European rationality, national strength, and a clear understanding that it is part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It must be aware of its responsibilities to ultimately achieve what some call a "conceptual industrial revolution." There is absolutely no other way.

Okubo Toshimichi, a great statesman of early Meiji Japan, said at the "Encouragement of Industry Exposition" in Meiji 7 (1874): "The strength of a nation depends on the wealth of its people, and the wealth of its people depends on the abundance of its products. The abundance of products originates from whether the people's industry is developed... After detailed study and consideration, in accordance with the people's temperament and the level of their knowledge, establish regulations, promote industry and increase production, so that no one is idle and no one suffers from poverty." With a strong intention to enrich the country and strengthen its military, boundless ambition, and the spirit of splitting mountains, he attempted to accomplish this. To realize the great cause of a conceptual industrial revolution in China, China should emulate Germany's accurate self-assessment in the aviation industry, pursuing construction alongside war.

The Buddhist saying goes, "This is a difficult task, so one should make a great vow." Amidst the difficult situation of constructing while waging war, to build a New China and complete its fundamental conceptual industrial revolution is truly a great undertaking, a grand endeavor that requires a great vow to succeed. The author believes that if the ruling and opposition parties of allied China realize the significance of the Chinese situation, recall the lessons of Japan's Meiji Restoration, and learn from Germany's construction of a great air force, then with accurate self-awareness, they should steadily advance on the path of building a New China. China's destiny holds the potential to soar like a dragon awaiting its moment in the sky.

In short, the key to the Chinese government and people working together to revive the nation lies in the government's self-awareness of the need for top-down guidance in building a New China, and in the people establishing a complete national organization. (Translated by Song)

### Striving for Victory in War

— Yoshiichi Oyama

To the question, "How should the Chinese government and people cooperate to revive the nation?" I dare to answer simply: with a firm mindset, the government and the people must unite and engage in the war with burning enthusiasm. Only in this way can the nation be restored, and the people prosper.

Since the outbreak of the war, it has already been ten months since the establishment of the New China. During this period, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, the wartime system has been gradually reorganized, which we have witnessed. However, in terms of both material and morale, we cannot yet say that a decisive battle system has been established.

Correcting National Thought

To speak frankly, the attitude of the people in this war still raises doubts.

For example, the hoarding incident. If people could truly recognize the difficult situation the nation is facing and consider the interests of the entire nation, then there would be no such selfish actions.

However, the occurrence of such unfortunate events is not solely the responsibility of the people. The government's responsibility in creating the opportunity for such events to occur must also be questioned.

After the recovery of the concessions, Chairman Wang emphasized the need to establish a central ideology. Everyone should have the will of the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Any psychological toxins from British and American ideologies should be thoroughly eliminated, and there should be an independent Chinese thought. Only with a firm ideology can the most important work that Chinese officials and people should be doing now be achieved.

We are currently at war. This war is for the people of East Asia, to protect East Asia. If we think that this war is for our own sake, then that is a big mistake. We must understand that this war is for the sake of our descendants, to establish a long-term plan for the East Asian people. We should think about what will happen to our descendants if we surrender now. In this regard, the destinies of China and Japan are inseparable. We must recognize the true spirit of shared life and death, and work together to strive for victory.

Establishing a Decisive Battle System

If this spirit can be conveyed to the people so that they can understand it, then feelings of discontent and dissatisfaction will naturally be resolved. To thoroughly instill this spirit, the government should implement all necessary measures. It should act with integrity and protect the people. If any unjust incidents occur, they should be investigated without hesitation to eliminate all bad elements. Only with this attitude can the government's authority be implemented, the people's hearts be won, and the nation's independence and autonomy be secured.

I believe that the method for both resisting foreign enemies and subduing internal enemies lies in this. If we can make the people in the peaceful areas understand the meaning of the war and establish a true decisive battle system, then I am certain that the people under the rule of Chongqing will naturally return, realize the folly of brothers fighting each other, and abandon the humiliating position of being British and American dogs. For the sake of the East Asian people, I believe they will rise up one day. To make that day come sooner, I sincerely hope that the officials and people under the rule of the National Government should establish a seamless system with no division. (Translated by Qi Qing)

### The Mission of New China

— Takaaki Yokota

There are roughly three ways in which the Chinese government and people should cooperate to revive the nation:

Abandon weapons and implement comprehensive peace.

At the time of the unfortunate Sino-Japanese War, both China and Japan had extremely deep misunderstandings. One misunderstanding led to another, causing both countries and peoples to embark on the wrong path, resulting in increased misfortune. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Chinese leaders believed that "Japan is relying on military force to invade Chinese territory and sovereignty," so they wanted to resist Japan.

On the other hand, Japan believed that "China is dependent on Britain and the United States, and is allied with them, attempting to obstruct the development of Japan's national destiny," so it took up arms. It resolutely punished Chiang Kai-shek, the former leader of China, for "acting on behalf of Britain and the United States against East Asia."

However, the six years of unfortunate war have shown that Japan has no intention of infringing upon Chinese territory and sovereignty. Japan is now returning the concessions to the National Government, abolishing extraterritorial rights, respecting China's sovereignty and responsibility, and striving for China's national independence and ethnic self-strengthening, which shows that Japan has no ambitions whatsoever.

Major General Tanihagi also clearly stated to Chongqing: "The purpose of resisting Japan has already been achieved. China's independence and autonomy have been secured. Let us turn hostility into friendship and resolve matters with joy." The reason for resisting Japan, which arose from misunderstanding, has long been eliminated. Therefore, the Chinese people should first know that there is no reason to resist Japan. There is nothing more meaningless than consuming national strength in a meaningless resistance. If we think about not only its meaninglessness but also its great danger, then this war should be stopped immediately. The Chinese and Japanese peoples are the two leading peoples of East Asia. Waging unreasonable war against each other and consuming our own strength is tantamount to leading all Asians to self-destruction, which is truly unacceptable and should be avoided.

Abandon Dependence on Britain and the United States

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, Chiang Kai-shek has relied on Britain and the United States to oppose Japan, accepting military and financial assistance. However, it must be recognized that Britain and the United States' aid to Chongqing harbors the sinister conspiracy to place China under their control. In other words, in order to eliminate Japan's invasion, China has instead led the wolves into the house, inviting the predatory hands of Britain and the United States, resulting in a situation where it cannot control its own destiny. In this war, if the Allied Powers win, Britain and the United States' control over China will inevitably increase, making China want to cry but unable to. Chiang Kai-shek's faction still claims that if the Allied Powers win this war, China's independence can be achieved and democratic politics can be realized. However, very few Chinese people believe this, and it is definitely not going to happen.

Why is this? Because Britain and the United States' goal in the war is to dominate the world, so it is absolutely impossible for them to unconditionally recognize China's independence and autonomy after the war. The surrender of the Italian fascist regime proves the sinister intentions of Britain and the United States. Once they seize the greatest power in the world, they will never consider China's demands and the ideals of the Chinese people. On the contrary, it can be determined that they will neglect and trample on them. Moreover, causing China to kneel before the power of Britain and the United States is not only a misfortune for China, but also the greatest misfortune for the entire nation of 400 million people in East Asia. We only need to think about what Britain and the United States have done in China for the past hundred years since the Opium War to understand this. No, not only China has been poisoned by them, but also India, Vietnam, Thailand, Java, and the Philippines have been bullied by Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. Thinking about this, we cannot help but shudder. And now China is about to repeat the same mistake. Only now must China break free from the delusion of dependence on Britain and the United States.

Support Japan

The East Asian peoples are, after all, East Asian peoples. No matter how close Chiang Kai-shek is to Churchill and Roosevelt, the Chinese people are, after all, East Asian peoples, and they cannot always coordinate with Britain and the United States. How can they combine with Britain and the United States? Because Britain and the United States claim that white people are a superior race and have the ambition to conquer the world, a comprehensive integration of Britain and the United States with the East Asian peoples is absolutely impossible. Even if Chiang Kai-shek's wish comes true in this World War and the Allied Powers win, the Chinese people will undoubtedly be conquered by Britain and the United States in the next stage. Therefore, the victory of Britain and the United States in this war cannot fundamentally solve the East Asian problem. The fundamental solution to the East Asian problem must be the unity of the East Asian peoples to liberate themselves and establish the status of the East Asian countries. To achieve this, there is no other way than to unite and work hard with Japan as the center. For six years, we have been dealing with the Sino-Japanese Incident, and since December 8th, we have been fighting a large-scale war against Britain and the United States. Especially at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, we achieved a world-shocking victory, and are currently securing a vast resource zone in the southwestern Pacific, continuing to advance the war. This proves how strong Japan's national power is. In terms of excellent weapons and scientific progress, it is by no means inferior to Britain and the United States. Doesn't this prove that it is superior in every aspect? The Chinese people can now naturally recognize that Japan's strength exceeds the world's standards. It is clear that Japan can guide the entire Asian people and has the strength to establish the status of the Asian countries in the world. Only now must China abandon the mistaken psychology of dependence on Britain and the United States, take Japan's strength as the center, and establish a genuine strategy for solving the Asian problem. In other words, China must devote all its efforts to supporting Japan so that Japan can win the final victory in this war. What Chairman Wang called shared life and death is the only way to strive for national revival. There is no other way for China to survive. (Translated by Qi Qing)

### The Great Path to China's Revival

— Toraji Kurimoto

The ancient Chinese sages said: "Cultivate oneself, regulate one's family, govern one's state, and bring peace to the world." The Japanese people take this as their most precious motto, reciting it morning and evening, and practicing its teachings diligently. Because the Japanese believe it to be a great and enduring classic. All nations seeking revival, their people must first cultivate themselves and regulate their families, and those in power must win the hearts of the masses and selflessly govern the state. In this way, the state will be well-governed and the world will be at peace. Therefore, the motto "cultivate oneself, regulate one's family, govern one's state, and bring peace to the world" can truly be said to be the foundation for China's national revival.

Therefore, officials who administer politics should be honest and just, and cherish their self-respect. The people should each be loyal to their duties, and the hearts of the officials and the people should be united, and they should be loyal to the nation. Moreover, officials and people alike should cultivate a spirit of respecting and valuing the nation, making it worthy of respect. Therefore, one should correctly recognize that even small matters can affect the nation and society. Consequently, everyone should ensure that in any situation, they do not forget the nation. If each person thinks that only they are doing this, it will not have a great impact, nor will there be great harm, and therefore, if everyone does not strive in their own position, then the society will probably be completely messed up. The nation's revival will be distant and hopeless, and the nation's power will decline day by day. Therefore, each person should constantly consider self-cultivation in every action, which is the greatest contribution to cooperating in the nation's revival.

We do not want to criticize the Chinese national character here, nor do we intend to point out the shortcomings of the Chinese people. Nor do we observe China subjectively from the position of Japan and the Japanese people. However, we want to honestly state our own achievements for cooperative reference.

The Application of Patriotism

It can be fully acknowledged that most Chinese people today are filled with ardent patriotism. However, upon detailed examination, their definition of patriotism is very different from ours, which leads to various questions. Although the politics of Chongqing verbally shout patriotism, are their actions not contrary to true patriotism? If they still believe that their actions are truly patriotic, then their so-called definition of patriotism, from the perspective of Eastern morality, cannot but be said to be a mistaken idea. If Chongqing's politics truly started from a genuine love of the country, the state of China would not be as it is today. Nor would it have reached the point where we have to loudly call for the revival of the nation! So, what is the reason for the flaws in Chongqing's politics? It is actually disguised patriotic politics. The actions of Chiang Kai-shek's faction all originate from private interests and desires, and can be said to be driven entirely by private desires.

Furthermore, if they venerate Chiang Kai-shek as a hero and great man, treating this as the expression of the Chinese people's patriotism, and believe that this is the patriotism produced after educating the youth, this is also extremely erroneous. It cannot but be said to be a low-key and inflammatory patriotic education. In this sense, the Chinese people must know what true patriotism is. Only then can it be said to be the first and foremost method for cooperating in the revival of the Chinese nation.

With the cultivation of correct patriotism, politics can become honest and just, and good politics will produce a good society. If a good society can be produced, there will be a good economy. If a good economy is in place, the people's hearts will be at ease, and it is believed that this can promote genuine national revival.

Improving Education Methods

The Chinese people are inherently different from other uncivilized people, being a people who teach, learn, and practice what they learn. This has been proven in history. The source of morality is truly in China. Therefore, today's Chinese politics should begin with correct patriotic education. To speak boldly, among the Chinese people seen in all situations in China today, although there are indeed respectable people, when observed from the perspective of the nation, the teachings of Confucius and Mencius have been swept away. This is undoubtedly due to the laxity of education. In the Chinese education world after the revolution, there is nothing to be admired in terms of tangible aspects, but in terms of intangible aspects, it can be said to be completely erroneous inflammatory education of patriotism. Most of the people in China today who hold the most sound ideas are probably those who have received the teachings of the sages. The private school education more than thirty years ago, where teachers were hired in families, was still superior. When we consider the past and look at the present, we cannot help but feel deeply moved. The promotion of correct education is currently an urgent task and one of the major strategies for cooperating in the nation's revival.

In the current Chinese political world, there are very few people who are familiar with the world situation. Therefore, the judgment of changes in the situation, whether in the government or among the people, seems to be very slow. As a result, their will is often wavering, and it is difficult to have a fixed belief. This becomes the reason for being misled by rumors, and there is a very strong tendency to actually enjoy believing these rumors. Especially after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, among the educated classes in China, many people were straddling Chongqing and Nanjing, taking a wait-and-see attitude. This attitude is because everyone lacks certainty, and as a result of lacking certainty, there is not only no driving force to promote the revival of the Chinese nation, but there is also a very negative tendency. Internally, even if the country can be managed well, if there is no strong assistance from friendly allied nations externally, it will be very difficult to achieve the goal of national revival. In today's world, it is meaningless to not maintain international relations. External relations should increasingly become harmonious and friendly. Any nation that engages in perfidy will only perish. Hasn't the recent perfidious behavior of the Italian fascist regime illustrated this? Trustworthiness is the great power of national revival. Therefore, internally, the unclear atmosphere of the political world should be clarified, the two-legged policy (in the stock exchange) of the intellectual class should be abandoned, and active support should be given to the Nanjing government. The Wang regime should be trusted, and more effort should be put into strengthening political power, and relations with allied nations should be further strengthened. Especially in Shanghai, at this time, a decisive step should be taken to build a foundation for the integration of politics and economics, which is an important matter for cooperating in the nation's revival.

The Purge of the Economic World

The purge of the economic world is a necessary condition for the revival of the Chinese nation. When a good economic world appears, it is the period when speculative bad elements become extinct. If this is taken lightly, then China's national revival will be impossible. Focusing all efforts on eliminating these bad elements will greatly contribute to the cause of national revival.

Most of the constituent elements of Chinese society are farmers. Agriculture can be said to be the foundation of the nation. Moreover, nothing is as easily influenced by natural conditions as agriculture. Although it may be said to be guaranteed, once it is hit by wind and rain, everything is taken away. The farmers who bravely cultivate the farmland without regarding this greatest danger as a danger can truly be said to be China's national treasure. However, the rampant exploitation of farmers through illegitimate means, and the use of agricultural products as objects of speculation by speculative elements, is an intolerable crime. It is a truly evil existence. Especially in the current situation of participating in the war in China, it is precisely the time when we must respect the rural economy, treat farmers favorably, and make them strive to increase production. The evil speculators and hoarders who exhaust and impoverish them must be completely eliminated. Moreover, businessmen should fulfill their true commercial mission, which is also a great help to the nation's revival.

To summarize what has been said above, if all the people of the nation do not have a spirit that transcends patriotism and the consciousness of a patriot, then the above-mentioned concrete methods of cooperation may not necessarily be able to achieve the nation's revival.

Today, participating China is eagerly awaiting such patriots.

The expansion of industrial production, the communication and exchange of commerce, the smooth adjustment of finance, the strengthening and soundness of finance, and the universal accessibility of good governance all depend on the spirit of patriotism. Therefore, the first step in reviving the nation lies in the cultivation of the people, and the last lies in the spirit of patriotism. (Translated by Xiang)

### On the Understanding of a Prerequisite for China's Rejuvenation

— Masao Kawasaki

The world war situation is now moving towards the final decisive stage, with increasingly fierce battles unfolding. When discussing the topic requested by the Shen Bao from readers, "How should the Chinese government and people cooperate to rejuvenate the nation?" I believe that considering the character of the Greater East Asia War within this world war, or the attitude China should adopt towards it, as irrelevant would make examination impossible. Therefore, before discussing how the government and people should cooperate to rejuvenate the nation, I will briefly outline my views on this prerequisite point.

Examining War from a Historical Perspective

First, in examining the character of this world war, we must trace the analysis of the problem back to the world economic crisis of 1929. Why do I say this? Because this was a turning point where the opposition between Anglo-American capitalist imperialism and rising nations like Japan, and China, which was in the process of forming a modern nation-state, became increasingly obvious, ultimately leading to the current war. The world economic crisis of 1929 led various countries seeking to escape the crisis towards economic nationalism. In July 1932, Britain held the British Empire Economic Conference in Ottawa, drastically strengthening economic ties within the British Empire and closing its doors to other countries. The United States, taking the Seventh Pan-American Conference in December 1933 as an opportunity, strengthened ties between North and South America and began implementing the Monroe Doctrine. In this way, with Britain and America as their pioneers, world economic blocs adopted extreme exclusionary policies. For example, the World Economic Conference held in London in July 1933 was originally intended to correct this direction of economic nationalism in the world, but due to opposition from the United States based on selfish interests, it ultimately closed without achieving anything, which is one example. At that time, Colonel House, who was active as President Wilson's confidant, advocated a "re-division of colonies," wanting to rationally re-divide the colonies monopolized by two or three countries and place them under a new world order. Also, the French statesman Briand advocated a "United States of Europe" theory, wanting to economically rebuild all European nations. These were all attempts to avoid the looming crisis of a world war and manifestations of a tendency to correct the status quo as a preventative measure. Anglo-American capitalist imperialism completely ignored this tendency and single-mindedly moved towards strengthening economic nationalism, regarding it as a process of economically dominating the world. Strictly speaking, this tendency was already contained in the Versailles peace mechanism, a legacy of the First European War, through which Britain, France, and America attempted to dominate the world and suppress emerging nations. It was the world economic crisis of 1929 that forced Britain and America, which verbally promoted idealism, to completely remove their masks and most blatantly reveal their ambitions to economically control the world. We emphasize the world economic crisis of 1929 for this reason. Since then, this tendency has intensified, ultimately leading to the outbreak of the current world war. A certain commentator once pointed out: "The countries maintaining the status quo, such as Britain, America, and France, whether at the International Disarmament Conference or in the form of the League of Nations at least in name, restricted the other countries, while forcibly demanding a world peace mechanism based on them, and at the same time strengthening their own economic groups, desperately trying to complete economic armament. The emergence of Britain's all-party coalition cabinet and its policies, President Roosevelt's inauguration in the United States and the implementation of the New Deal, the organization of France's European gold standard bloc, and the conclusion of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty, all fully illustrate this tendency. Therefore, in the international trends after the world economic crisis, internationalism was a superficial facade, while its true content was acute nationalism. If one wants to clarify the responsibility for the global war, it is this undercurrent of nationalism." We completely agree with this. The occurrence of the Manchurian Incident, the emergence of Nazi Germany and its withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference, the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, and that country's withdrawal from the League of Nations were all produced by the economic nationalism of Britain, France, and America. We view the accumulation of these events as the reason for the outbreak of the world war and the occurrence of the Greater East Asia War, its nature being the struggle of the demand for national survival rights against Anglo-American economic imperialism.

Analysis of the Greater East Asia War

If we analyze the nature of the Greater East Asia War in this way, then we cannot but discuss the basic issue under discussion in this article—Sino-Japanese relations. First, from Japan's standpoint, since the Meiji Restoration, through the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the First World War, Japan's national fortune has been rising steadily, and its population has been expanding rapidly. The popularization of domestic education and the rapid development of industry are facts that everyone already knows. In land-scarce Japan, this inevitably required securing enough food to maintain the expanding surplus population, obtaining the military resources needed to defend itself against Anglo-American domination of the world, and promoting trade, which was essential for the smooth import of these foods and resources. This demand was an absolute condition for Japan to maintain its survival. However, as mentioned above, Britain and America, which monopolized the world's resources and markets, closed their doors to Japan, a tendency that has been particularly pronounced since 1929. Therefore, in order to maintain its survival, Japan had no choice but to seek various methods. It has had an even deeper concern for China, which has a vast land and population and remains temporarily outside the Anglo-American economic group as its only market. Therefore, Japan's advance into China was a natural demand made for the sake of national survival and had no meaning of aggression. This is completely different from the capital imperialist behavior of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, which already possess many resources and colonies but, under the ambition to dominate the world, want to place China under their suppression. Many people in China have criticized Japan's China policy, but they have not considered that Japan's China policy is fundamentally not based on aggressive intentions but is implemented based on the real desire to find a way out for the nation.

Looking at the situation in China, the feudal political form with thousands of years of history is also in the process of collapsing due to the washing of the times. After the First, Second, and Great Revolutions, the formation of a nation-state has gradually progressed. Japan, which has been trapped under the oppression of Britain and the United States for a long time, welcomes the growth of the Chinese nation as a comrade in defending East Asia in principle. However, the process of forming a Chinese nation-state does not necessarily coincide with Japan's expectations. Especially when the first unified government in China, which can at least be said to have been established on a certain basis of national consciousness, that is, the Nanjing government, was established, it was regrettable that it compromised with Britain and the United States rather than coordinating with Japan, and the foundation of the government was based on this policy, taking a policy of distant friendship and close attack. Therefore, since the establishment of the former Nanjing government, Sino-Japanese relations have often been unsatisfactory, and Chiang Kai-shek also wanted to consolidate the foundation of his nation-state by arousing anti-Japanese feelings among the people. This explains the fact that since the increasingly fierce People's United Front since 1935, although he knew that the CCP was manipulating it behind the scenes and had to suppress it, he also promoted their anti-Japanese consciousness to consolidate his position, and he wandered between such contradictory policies. From our point of view, the occurrence of the Sino-Japanese Incident was the product of this anti-Japanese policy.

Now, when considering the basis of this anti-Japanese policy of the former Nanjing government, it seems that the capitalist imperialists, wearing the mask of liberalism, are playing many cunning tricks! There is a more fundamental point. The former Nanjing government could not understand that the essence of Japan's China policy was the demand for national survival, but instead, in collusion with Britain and the United States, regarded this exclusion as an act of aggression. Of course, Japan's previous China policy cannot be said to be without regrets, but there are many misunderstandings here, and that is also a fact! Moreover, the accumulation of these misunderstandings often leads to the use of force. However, what we can assert is that in the Sino-Japanese issue, no matter how many misunderstandings occur, as mentioned above, there is definitely no such thing as Japan's aggressive policy. Looking at it this way, China and Japan should have supported each other in the past, but it can be understood that unfortunate events occurred due to a lack of mutual understanding.

Now, because of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has liberated the vast lands and peoples of the Nanyang region, which were previously deeply closed and refused by the imperialist policies of Britain, America, and the Netherlands. In the future, Japan no longer needs to implement policies based on national demands against China. After the vast lands and peoples of Nanyang are liberated from Britain, America, and the Netherlands, the reasons for the previous misunderstandings between China and Japan no longer exist. The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, needless to say, is based on the far-reaching ideal of liberating the nations of East Asia from the shackles of Britain and the United States, and enabling each to find its place. Even from the above-mentioned Sino-Japanese relations, expelling Anglo-American imperialism from East Asia is an absolute task that China and Japan should undertake together.

We want to discuss the problem of cooperation with the National Government and the people under its rule, and the simple views on China's rejuvenation, but we are not afraid of verbose language to raise this prerequisite understanding because, from the current character of the National Government, if the people do not have a clear understanding of the above situation, there can be no complete cooperation, and it is meaningless.

Government's Reflection

The "peace, anti-communism, and national construction" put forward by the National Government when it returned to the capital, and which is still the basic slogan today, is something that no one disagrees with. However, the people in the peace zone cooperate with the National Government insufficiently, and are in fact handled by elements indifferent to politics. Moreover, even after the change in the new policy, the general public's impression of the government is not necessarily good. There are naturally many reasons for this, but generally speaking, it is all about the government officials' lack of integrity. At the end of September, half a year after Chairman Wang returned to the capital, he said in a speech to the Central Party Affairs Training Corps regarding the issue of integrity: "Originally, saying 'you must be honest' to an official is somewhat insulting. It is like saying to a newly married couple: You must be chaste. Isn't this too abrupt? Because without chastity, it cannot be done. Isn't dishonesty the same?" "Really, it is a great insult to say integrity to officials, but the reality is not necessarily the same as the ideal. We do not want to use the specific facts of how a certain official received gifts to explain our argument, but according to various rumors, the recent acceptance of bribes by officials is quite blatant, and there are even those who extort. Whether these things are true or false is another matter, but the credibility of such rumors in themselves is greatly related to the government. In fact, the reason why the current National Government does not receive good reviews seems to be due to this. The officialdom novel "A Record of the Appearance of Officials" in the late Qing Dynasty clearly stated the corruption of the Qing Dynasty's government. It is naturally impossible to compare the present with that time, but in today's stage of the Greater East Asia War entering the decisive stage, it is absolutely unacceptable if there are still remnants of "A Record of the Appearance of Officials." Chen Gongbo, the speaker of the Legislative Yuan, once said in his "On Honest Politics": "However, after thinking about it again, there is one more thing to do on top of the many things that need to be done urgently, that is, "establish honest politics," and I believe that honest politics is the basic condition for peace and national construction. If politics cannot be honest, peace can never be achieved, and national construction cannot be achieved," and also said: "Since the incident, many people in Chongqing have made many "national disaster fortunes" in the name of unification. People who read about these unfilial officials and unscrupulous merchants are all heartbroken. However, since we cannot bear to watch the people in Chongqing making a fortune from the national disaster there, how can we bear to stand by and watch the people under the National Government making a fortune from peace? I can't help but shout loudly to awaken our people with heart and ambition to pay attention." We also advocate, like Chen Gongbo, that the implementation of honest politics is a necessary condition for national construction. However, when examining the reasons for the corruption of these officials, it is definitely not just the simple reason of a lack of belief in peace, but also contains habitual reasons. Moreover, as the war stage progresses, life becomes more and more difficult, which is also one of the main reasons. What we hope from the government is the establishment of the strictest responsible political system. At least as far as we can see, not limited to the current National Government, in any era in China, sentiment is extremely powerful in the control of politics, which inevitably leads to the corruption of politics and thus cannot implement honest politics. Eliminating sentiment and making each official act in responsible politics cannot but be a major key to cooperation between officials and the people. Otherwise, even if the government sets up thousands of laws, it will have no effect on the improvement of politics.

Secondly, what should be proposed is that the government should strengthen its contact with the people. The goal of the reconstruction of the National Government is naturally peace and national construction, in other words, to save the Chinese nation from the ravages of war and stabilize it within the possible range. The interests of the government and the people are originally completely consistent, but when observing the situation from the National Government's return to the capital to the present day, is the cooperation between the government and the people in the peace zone seamless? We believe that this is not necessarily the case. All of the government's policies, even if they are appropriate subjectively and objectively, are they not often required to be mobilized by non-governmental organizations and express enthusiastic support when they are implemented? Regardless of whether it is a republican country or a totalitarian country, in any situation, the government can only smoothly implement its policies on the basis of popular cooperation. Otherwise, it is difficult to expect smooth implementation. In this regard, someone once said that even if the facts are temporarily admitted, the reality of the political and economic situation after the return to the capital is not much different from before. This is of course also a saying. However, now that the political power of the National Government is vigorously promoted after China's participation in the war, speaking of the means of cooperation with the people, and there has been no major change since the return to the capital, it is painful to realize that the National Government needs to actively consider the mobilization of the people. The New National Movement launched after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and the establishment of Chinese sovereignty due to the return of the Shanghai Public Concession, taking this as an opportunity, Chairman Wang directly exchanged opinions with Shanghai civil leaders, which is a significant manifestation of the National Government's mobilization of the people and the strengthening of civil ties. But we are not satisfied with this, and we cannot but hope for further concrete measures.

People's Reflection

Chinese people generally express an extremely negative attitude towards the emergence of new governments. This is because the form of control has changed repeatedly. Just looking at Shanghai, since the establishment of the Republic of China, there have been more than a dozen changes in the feudal forces backed by various warlords. The former Nanjing government was born under the color of anti-Japanese war, and the current National Government after the return to the capital takes cooperation with Japan as its basic policy. Therefore, from the perspective of defending themselves, rather than focusing on actively cooperating with the rulers of the times, it is extremely natural to live in the pursuit of profits. Regarding this point, it cannot but be attributed to the fact that the previous Chinese politics was not on track. At the same time, in the current situation where only three years have passed since the return to the capital, and the state of war in the country is still continuing due to the existence of the Chongqing regime's anti-Japanese policy, it is not inconceivable that the people do not immediately express active cooperation with the policies of the National Government after the return to the capital. From this point of view, we can say that the people's cooperation with the government must be given sufficient time to be most appropriate. However, from another perspective, that is, from the character of the Greater East Asia War and the state of war in which the war is being fought fiercely, this negative attitude of the Chinese people must be immediately liquidated. Without the completion of the Greater East Asia War, the independent country of China cannot exist. Therefore, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the cooperation of the current China does not allow any hesitation. The necessity of requiring the Chinese people to cooperate with the National Government is more urgent than ever before. However, when looking around our country, those civilian people who understand the spirit of this era and actively fulfill their duties as Chinese people are no more than just a futile criticism and have no effect on the regeneration of China.

China has been invaded by Britain and the United States for a hundred years and has become their colony. Most of its agricultural products are used as raw materials for Britain and the United States, and commercial activities have become subordinate to Anglo-American capital. However, because Anglo-American policies are extremely cunning, most Chinese people do not feel resentment towards Anglo-American economic aggression, but instead think that this is a normal phenomenon, even to this day. They rely on the economic support of Britain and the United States to China, and share some of the benefits, and feel that this is the most stable economic life. Therefore, no matter how the National Government proclaims peace and national construction, no matter how it explains the significance of the Greater East Asia War, those who speak earnestly are met with contempt, just like the east wind passing by the ear.

But recently, as a result of the progress of the Greater East Asia War, with Japan's assistance, China has recovered all the conduit concessions and public concessions, and Burma has already declared independence, the Philippines will soon be independent, and the nations of Nanyang are also allowed to participate in politics. Therefore, the construction of the Greater East Asia promoted by Japan has proved in fact that it is based on moral principles. In order to realize Pan-Asianism, it is necessary to first complete China's modern country. This is the path that China should take at that time. The Three People's Principles, with nationalism as the center, is for this reason. Wang Jingwei left the anti-Japanese regime in Chongqing and returned to the capital based on peace, anti-communism, and national construction. The mission of his government is also to build a modern national country. The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War is for the construction of the nation-state. At the same time, for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, China is required to cooperate actively. Here, the National Government sees the importance of joint responsibility in a sense different from Japan. At the same time, what becomes a problem, in order to form a nation-state. If the Chinese people understand this new trend in world history and abandon their previous negative attitude for the construction of a new China, then the integration of the government and the people will no longer be a problem, and the basic conditions for the construction of a completely independent China can be said to have been completed. When talking about the Chinese people, we are not just stubbornly adhering to the previous conservative attitude, but the people who are most obedient to the guidance of the government.

Conclusion

Speaking of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, those of us who live in countries that have long completed the modern state can understand its inevitability more easily. However, it is not without some difficulties for those in China who are on the way to completing the nation-state to understand it. Sun Yat-sen's ultimate goal, everyone admits, is the realization of Pan-Asianism. Sun Yat-sen's request is also the main topic, and it cannot but be the topic mainly based on the request to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. According to their views, needless to say, the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere should come first, and the National Government must first make full efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War. As mentioned earlier, the construction of an independent and autonomous new China can only be realized when it expels Britain and the United States, which attempt to dominate the world, from Greater East Asia, and establishes the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Even if the dream of the Chongqing regime, which is following the path of collusion with Britain and the United States, is realized, it is nothing more than treating Chongqing as one of the links in the world dominated by Britain and the United States. This is what people inside Chongqing have already admitted. Although they are competing in the progress of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere of Japan, they still do not change their anti-Japanese policy and the line of collusion with Britain and the United States because they are afraid of losing their political lives after doing so. But today, they are saying "anti-war and national construction," but they do not feel very attractive.

If the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere with the center can be built, then the formation of a Chinese nation-state is not a problem. The form of the United Nations of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is more important than the political concept of a country in the process of forming a nation-state. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that the formation of China's nation-state is further stimulated by the construction of the Greater East Asia. Therefore, what is required of China now is only that the government and the people work together as one and move towards the mission they are shouldering. The points mentioned in the previous "Government's Reflection" and "People's Reflection" are only one or two issues incidentally raised in completing this mission. (Translated by Yi)

### Understanding the Greater East Asia War for China's Rejuvenation — Kiyomasa Hidaka

The war that Japan is now launching in Greater East Asia, Chairman Wang has also said that it is a war of liberation for the nations of Greater East Asia. Chairman Wang, who bears the actual responsibility for the safety of the country, thinks this way, and I believe that the intellectual class in China must also think this way. However, the degree of belief varies, but the people who form Chinese public opinion must be able to believe it.

If someone determines that this Greater East Asia War is Japan's war of aggression, then I dare to determine that such a person has absolutely no judgment. Why? I think that such a person may not have seen the Emperor of Japan's declaration of war, and he does not understand the policies implemented by Japan towards the various countries and nations of Greater East Asia.

For this kind of person, I would like to offer a piece of advice:

"If you want to study Japan, please study the national polity of Japan before studying Japanese industry, Japanese cities, and Japanese geography. The so-called study of the Japanese national polity means that you study the tradition of the Japanese Empire for 2,600 years since its founding and the spirit of the Japanese people towards the Emperor. If you do not know the national polity of Japan, you cannot understand the Tengzheng Japan."

There are also experts in China who study the Japanese national polity. Although I have not heard of many, I also know that among the Chinese civilians, there is a Mr. Du Tianyi, who studies the Japanese national polity. As far as I know, ordinary foreigners study Japan, and they are finished as long as they have statistics and figures. Just imagine if you can understand Japan by relying solely on trade statistics and figures, wouldn't that be too simple?

The True Meaning of the Greater East Asia War

One hundred million Japanese people are convinced that this Greater East Asia War is the liberation war of Greater East Asia, and it is also the war in which the Japanese Empire is fulfilling its three thousand years of belief.

I hope that Chinese people can understand this point. If you do not understand this point clearly, then it will be difficult to understand the affairs of Greater East Asia in the future. The independence of Burma, the independence of the Philippines, the participation of Malays in politics, the participation of Javanese in politics, the assistance to the independence of India, and the implementation of the new policy towards China, I dare to determine that all these facts are ironclad evidence that the Greater East Asia War is the war of liberation of the nations of Greater East Asia.

The Anglo-American efforts in the war are inhuman and contradictory actions; I believe that there is absolutely no one in the world who regards the Anglo-American war against Japan as a war of liberation for Greater East Asia.

Friends and Enemies Must Be Distinguished

Therefore, Chongqing's cooperation with Britain and the United States in the war, in other words, is to hinder India's independence, deny Burma's independence, and want to place the various nations of Greater East Asia under the trampling of Britain, America, and the Netherlands. When the entire nation of Greater East Asia rises up to fight for liberation, only the Chongqing regime has become a traitor to East Asia. Is this the will of the military and political circles and the people of Chongqing who have knowledge and come from belief? I believe it is definitely not. Chongqing is clinging to old things and being emotional, so it is seeking its own worries.

The National Government, with Chairman Wang as its center, is now fighting alongside Japan. He is a powerful comrade-in-arms in the Greater East Asia War of Liberation. In order to fully exert the combat power of the new China, the government and the people should cooperate to rejuvenate the country. I think that the smart people in China are fully aware of these issues. (Translated by Qi Qing)

### Wuchang Uprising: The Cooperative Path Between Government and People

— Yoshida Toyosuke

Thirty-two years ago today, October 10, 1911, the Wuchang Uprising erupted. It, like the Toba-Fushimi War during the Meiji Restoration, holds tremendous significance in world history. Both were inevitable revolutions born from historical necessity. However, the fuse that ignited the Wuchang Uprising was an accidental, odd occurrence. On that day, in the Tongmenghui branch within the Russian concession in Hankou, members were desperately, secretly manufacturing bombs. One member accidentally dropped a bomb on the floor, causing it to explode with a loud bang. Everyone in the room panicked and fled. In their haste, they even forgot to take the list of revolutionary party members. If the list had fallen into the hands of the police, they would all have been arrested and sent to the guillotine. Rather than face death, they decided to strike first, launching a military mutiny. Revolutionary party members dragged Li Yuanhong, who was terrified and trembling under his bed because of the mutiny, and declared him the "Initiator of Righteousness," forcing him to issue a revolutionary declaration. This is the historical truth of the so-called "Wuchang Uprising." However, Edwin J. Dingle, in his "China's Revolution 1911-1912," published by the Shanghai Commercial Press in 1912, described Li Yuanhong as follows:

(The Chinese Revolution is one of the most appalling and epoch-making events in world history. If Li Yuanhong, who is currently known to everyone worldwide, had not been present at the time, the revolution might not have erupted. History proves that only Li Yuanhong is the greatest reformer in the Chinese world. His sound policies and incorruptible virtue towards the people have enabled the new China to rapidly ascend the political stage... He is now recognized by people around the world as the most talented and only reformer of this era.) (Page 24 of the book)

Even if I acknowledge that Li Yuanhong was a leader of the Wuchang Revolution, to assert that he, who panicked during the mutiny and hid under his bed, is "the greatest reformer in the Chinese world" is a blatant desecration of the true meaning of the Wuchang Uprising. The Wuchang Uprising was not led by an old-fashioned military man like Li Yuanhong, but by revolutionary party members who were nameless, penniless, and filled with patriotic fervor, hoping to transform China into a modern power. It was particularly guided by a group of students studying in Japan, residing in apartments around Kanda. However, the leader of these guides, and the one who directed the Wuchang Uprising on the path it should take, was of course Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Even those who judge Premier Sun to be an outsider to the Wuchang Uprising because he was in exile abroad at the time and did not get the "opportunity to hide under a bed" must acknowledge that it was Premier Sun who clearly directed the Wuchang Uprising towards its goals: opposing feudalism and opposing imperialism.

The Tide of the Chinese Revolution

Since then, no matter how the tide of the Chinese Revolution has ebbed and flowed, it has never deviated from the two lines of opposing feudalism and opposing imperialism. Just as a pendulum, no matter how it swings left or right, always returns to the vertical. No matter which direction the Chinese Revolution temporarily attempts to take, it will always return to this central task. Opposing feudalism and opposing imperialism can be summarized as China striving for the independence and autonomy of a modern nation-state. Since the Wuchang Uprising, the Republic of China has been established in name as a modern nation-state, but the degree of national independence and autonomy is still not complete. Therefore, Chinese politics has always revolved around the issue of independence and autonomy, and the political struggles of the masses have always focused on the goals of opposing feudalism and opposing imperialism. Therefore, it can be said that a cooperative path between the government and the people has been historically determined for the Republic of China. If the government does not advance towards anti-imperialist and anti-feudal policies and seeks the cooperation of the masses, it is like trying to catch fish in green water. When the government adopts policies that harm national sovereignty and national independence, the people refuse to cooperate. This direction, it can now be said, has become an unbreakable belief among the people as a revolutionary principle of the Republic of China.

Chinese politicians use this popular belief as the center for their political struggles. Politicians with ulterior motives often use this popular belief when attacking their political enemies. For example, they make grand pronouncements that so-and-so is colluding with foreign imperialists, betraying the interests of the Chinese nation, and is an old-fashioned traitor. Regarding national autonomy and ethnic independence,

Continued on page four

## Page 9

Continued from page three, people with extreme sensitivity to these things, to some extent, believe such arbitrary propaganda and come out against that person. If you think carefully about it, how many Chinese politicians have not been called traitors? Even when Premier Sun signed the Hanyeping loan agreement with Mitsui & Co., the whole country was in an uproar, denouncing him as a traitor.

The Significance of the Establishment of the National Government

The Nanjing government, due to the assistance it received from Japan during its establishment, has certainly been subject to much criticism. However, there is no need to engage in杞人憂天. As long as we believe in the inherent political instinct of the Chinese nation, as long as we move forward bravely towards the direction of national independence and autonomy, then we will have no shame before heaven. Naturally, without a unified national situation, that is, without a comprehensive state of peace, China's independence and autonomy cannot be realized. Therefore, the people naturally harbor immense concern for the issue of comprehensive peace. Chairman Wang's recent statement regarding comprehensive peace is precisely a response to this concern of the people. The people will certainly say from the bottom of their hearts that they are willing to cooperate with this trend of the government.

Furthermore, I firmly believe that as long as Japan's policy towards China respects the Chinese nation's demands for independence and autonomy, even if it encounters obstacles in the current situation, it will surely gain the sympathy of the Chinese people in the future. However, never forget that Chongqing is constantly propagating the "Japanese policy towards China is to give China nominal benefits while taking real benefits for itself" and using this method to stimulate the self-esteem of the general public who are sensitive to independence and autonomy. Therefore, in matters such as transportation and production, even though they have already been returned to the Nanjing government, if the real power is still in the hands of the Japanese, this will provide material for Chongqing's propaganda. As a result, the Chinese people will refuse to cooperate with the Nanjing government. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to this point. At the same time, Japan must not neglect to cooperate with the Nanjing government to make it a government of a modern nation-state. For example, regarding personnel matters, if, as in the old days of monarchical autocracy, appointments are not made based on talent but on blood relations and factional ties, then this should be eliminated as soon as possible with Japan's assistance. This is by no means a matter of interfering in internal affairs. In short, as long as Japan does not violate the revolutionary principles of China, it can strive to implement it without regard to anything else.

However, when implementing it, Japan should once again introspect whether China's independence and autonomy as a modern nation-state are conducive to Japan's development. If Japan itself consistently does not take a step out of the narrow scope of nationalism, then the strength of its neighbor will threaten its own strength. Therefore, the so-called respect for China's independence and autonomy is clearly a self-deception. It is impossible to practice political lies on the Chinese people, who have such sensitive political instincts. Some Japanese before the Greater East Asia War held narrow-minded nationalism, but now it cannot be said that it has been completely eliminated. This is the reason why the Chinese people do not trust the Japanese.

Sincere Cooperation Among Asian Nations

However, since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, especially as the war situation intensifies today, Japan deeply feels that it must have the sincere cooperation of all Asian nations in order to defeat the enemy in the Greater East Asia War. But if Japan consistently clings to narrow nationalism, it will absolutely not be able to obtain the sincere cooperation of all Asian nations. In order to confront countries as vast as Britain and the United States, Japan must, in any case, organize the entire Asia into one vast nation. The current world, where nationalism has become the driving force of the era, is fundamentally different from the era of the Great Emperor Genghis Khan. Now, without equality between nations, there will be no joint struggle against a common enemy with shared life and death. This simple and understandable reason is especially evident in Sino-Japanese relations. If Japan can thoroughly realize this idea in Sino-Japanese relations, then the political influence on the Asian nations will be very significant. Because, judging from China's political position among the Asian nations, if the Chinese nation reconciles with Japan and sincerely cooperates with Japan, then other nations will also rise up and follow the example of the Chinese nation. This point is especially obvious in the Indian national question. Needless to say, the Indian nation is opposed to British rule. However, the reason why they still cannot fully trust Japan to fight side by side until today is because they have not yet seen sufficient evidence that Japan will not become a second Britain. This is because the Sino-Japanese War has not been satisfactorily resolved, and the attitude of the entire Chinese nation is not yet clear. If the majority of the Chinese nation is willing to cooperate sincerely with Japan, then India will immediately change its current political hesitation and cooperate with Japan, attacking from both inside and outside, driving out Britain and the United States. If China is willing to cooperate with Japan, then once India breaks away from its colonial status, world issues will be decided by Asians. From this point of view, the key to the whole Asian problem, no, the key to the whole world problem, can be said to be entirely dependent on the success or failure of dealing with this Sino-Japanese relationship. This may not be an exaggeration. However, in order to deal with Sino-Japanese relations, Japan itself must first abandon the narrow national concept and sincerely rejoice in China's freedom and independence. There is no room for deception or self-deception on this point. A modernized and strengthened China is no longer a threat to Japan, but a good partner in the Greater East Asia War. At this time, it is unacceptable to jeopardize the great issue of the rise and fall of the Japanese nation due to the idea of "rights and interests" in China. This is the new awakening of the Japanese people. What is implemented based on this national self-awareness is the "new policy" towards China, which goes without saying.

Therefore, Japan's new policy is fully in line with China's revolutionary principles, and there should be no friction between them. At the same time, the path of cooperation between the Chinese government and the people, the path of full cooperation between Japan and China, and the path of full cooperation among all Asian nations are all in line with China's revolutionary principles and Japan's new policy. Of course, the ultimate goal is to strive for the independence and autonomy of all Asian nations through joint struggle.

What history has shown Japan in this regard is the Meiji Restoration, and what has shown China this direction is the Wuchang Revolution. There is no need to add more words to this! (Chinese Translation)

### How to Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production

— Tang Shoumin

In recent years, prices have soared, and the livelihoods of the people have been unstable. Many commentators attribute this to the monopolies held by hoarders. Indeed, hoarding and monopolies can lead to price explosions, but there is another even more important reason, which is insufficient production. Short-term solutions should absorb idle capital, crack down on hoarding, promote frugality, and balance supply and demand. Long-term solutions still require actively promoting production. The government is now implementing controls on various major commodities and gradually implementing a rationing system for various daily necessities. In the near future, this should gradually have an effect on stabilizing prices. But if the source of supply of materials is not sustained, the rationing method will still be difficult to maintain. Therefore, the matter of actively increasing production still awaits the concerted efforts of all sectors of society.

Our country has vast land, abundant resources, a large population, and a moderate climate, making for very superior production conditions. Logically, there should be no phenomenon of insufficient materials. However, in the past, some agricultural and industrial products were still dependent on imports. The reason for this is purely that the industrial, financial, and technical sectors failed to closely connect and cooperate. The industrial sector lacked available funds, the financial sector had funds but did not invest them in production, and technicians had no opportunity to use what they had learned. The most important thing to do in the future is to correct past mistakes, make the financial sector the center, and strive for close cooperation in the three aspects, so as to revive the national economy and achieve self-sufficiency in production as a common goal. At the same time, it is hoped that the government can provide incentives and support for all production-increasing work, so that the progress of the work can be seen quickly and smoothly.

Three Prerequisites for Increasing Production

The center of Chinese industry is in Shanghai. To revive Chinese industry and increase industrial products, we must first start with restoring Shanghai's industry. Since the incident, the reasons for the decline of Shanghai's industry and the reduction in output are: first, the lack of raw materials; second, the limitation of power; and third, the problem of food for workers. Many factories were unable to solve the above three points, so they either reduced or stopped work, leading to an abundance of idle capital, a rush to speculate and hoard, and an inevitable increase in the number of unemployed workers. This phenomenon not only affects people's livelihoods but also harms social order and tranquility. The government is now strictly cracking down on hoarding and speculation, so that general idle capital can return to production uses, which is a great opportunity for industrial revival. It is right to work together and move towards increasing production. Some people will definitely raise doubts: the three prerequisites for industrial revival have not been resolved, factories cannot even resume normal work, so how can we talk about increasing production? In my opinion, as long as all parties believe that increasing production is absolutely necessary for China and for the entire East Asia, then it is not difficult to solve these three prerequisite problems.

First, the problem of industrial raw materials. In the past, the lack of raw materials was not necessarily a real lack; there were also some man-made factors. For example, inappropriate procurement methods, excessively low purchase prices, and the inability of procurement agencies to obtain the cooperation of local farmers were all reasons for poor procurement results and a lack of raw materials. Since Japan implemented a new policy towards China, canceled the monopoly purchase of Japanese business groups, and eased restrictions on the circulation of materials in various places, the results of raw material purchases have been improving day by day. Take the current situation of the Wheat Flour Professional Committee's unified purchase of wheat and the start of work at various flour mills in Shanghai as an example; is this not a clear improvement in the supply of industrial raw materials? If each industry can follow the method of the wheat flour industry, borrow large low-interest loans from the financial industry, and purchase from various major production areas in a unified manner, then the problem of raw material supply will not be difficult to solve step by step. However, when purchasing, more consideration should be given to methods and prices, and by no means should mandatory methods be adopted to make farmers fearful. This will not only affect the current purchase but also affect future production. If we can use the psychology of farmers who value physical objects, and use as many barter methods as possible within the possible range, then more satisfactory purchase results can be expected.

Second, the problem of electricity restrictions. The total power generation of the power plants in Shanghai is about 200,000 KVA or more. The lines between these plants have long been connected to each other for mutual feeding and regulation, so it seems that there should not be a shortage of electricity for the city's current needs. As far as we know, there are indeed many factories whose power limits are too low to allow them to operate at full capacity. However, there are also not a few factories whose original limits are too wide and are now underutilizing or not using them at all. This phenomenon urgently needs to be corrected and adjusted so that industries that truly intend to produce can develop as much as possible. If, after this adjustment, there is still a shortage of industrial electricity, then we can strictly limit the consumption of general-purpose electricity to inject industrial electricity. Alternatively, we can stop the power distribution to some industries that are not related to people's livelihood to actively supplement the deficiencies in people's livelihood industries. This matter should be jointly decided by the local administrative authorities, industrial groups, and power companies to determine a principle, and then gradually implement it according to the principle. In this way, the power problem of Shanghai's industry does not seem difficult to solve.

Third, the problem of workers' food. Workers are productive elements. To increase production, we must first take care of the lives of workers. Especially since the procurement of industrial raw materials will mostly require barter methods in the future, we cannot but redouble our efforts for the increase in industrial products, that is, we cannot but solve the problem of workers' lives especially first. I personally advocate that workers engaged in people's livelihood industries should be given special rations in addition to ordinary rations. If the food supply is sufficient, special rations will of course not be a problem. Otherwise, we should disperse some unemployed vagrants and use the food saved for special rations. We must not be lenient and allow rent-seekers and producers to enjoy the same treatment.

The above are personal opinions on increasing industrial production. As for increasing agricultural production, it is even more important than industry. First, the problem of people's livelihood urgently needs to be solved. Second, all industries cannot operate without raw materials. China was originally an agricultural country, and more than 80% of the population is engaged in agriculture. In terms of land area and the number of farmers, it should at least be able to be self-sufficient. However, now there is a phenomenon of wide-scale food and raw material shortages. This is really a great shame for every Chinese citizen. To wash away this shame, we must achieve self-sufficiency in the shortest possible time. Regardless of whether it is after this world war, countries will have no surplus capacity to export for a while, and even if they can still export, relying on others is not a long-term solution for establishing a country. We should now exhaust all possible reasons for the lack of production in the past, and then remedy them one by one.

The Problem of Improving Agricultural Technology

According to experts, the reasons for the lack of agricultural production in our country are: due to the lack of water conservancy repairs, droughts and floods immediately become disasters. Due to the lack of research on farming methods, production decreases year by year. Due to the lack of seed improvement, the quality deteriorates day by day and affects production. Due to the lack of attention to preventing insect plagues, annual losses are significant. Due to the failure to utilize barren mountains, wasteland, lakes, swamps, and marshes, profits are abandoned on the ground. However, some people think that the above problems are secondary, and the most important thing is political integrity and social order, so that farmers can live and work in peace. Then we can talk about restoring normal production, and then we can talk about increasing production. We will now set aside the political issues and focus on agricultural technology issues. I deeply feel that the following issues need to be discussed immediately.

The problem of farmland water conservancy. In the Jiangnan area, rice is the main product. In Jiangbei and Subei and Huai, cotton and wheat account for a large proportion. The former needs irrigation, and the latter needs to be drained. We should set up pumping stations to facilitate irrigation, or dredge rivers to facilitate drainage, depending on local conditions. Before the incident, the Construction Committee used Qiyang electric power to set up irrigation stations in Suchang, and farmers actually benefited from them. In recent years, wages have become increasingly expensive, and farmers feel the need for electric irrigation more urgently. The establishment of the aforementioned irrigation stations urgently needs to be restored and expanded as soon as possible. As for the Jiangbei river dredging project, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has also been making every effort to handle it, and it should continue to be held so as not to abandon the previous achievements.

The problem of improving farming. There are three aspects of farming that should be improved: (1) improving farming methods, (2) abolishing old-fashioned agricultural tools and using new-style agricultural tools, and (3) studying fertilization methods. Chinese farmers only know to stick to old methods. Not only is it difficult to change their mindset suddenly, but also the rural economy is generally declining, and it is not easy to raise a sum of money for improvement. Therefore, the competent authorities should set up more model farms in various counties, enlighten them at any time, and the financial institutions should provide loans for agricultural tools and fertilizer purchases, so that farmers are aware of the benefits of improving farming and can use loans to implement improvements.

The problem of improving seeds. Improving seeds can not only improve the quality of products, but also increase the yield of products. For example, cotton and wheat have both achieved considerable results in promoting improved seeds and have gained the trust of farmers. Unfortunately, since the incident, this research and promotion work has been 中, resulting in 良种籽, no way to obtain it, urgently should be the full control agency to recruit experts, continue research, promotion. In addition to cotton, wheat and rice, other agricultural products related to people's livelihood should also be expanded for research. In addition, it is more appropriate to encourage and subsidize people to set up more farms to engage in improvement research, so that the supply of improved seeds can become more popular.

The problem of preventing insect disasters. The problem of insect disasters is extremely common in our country. For example, the rice stem borer for rice and the black smut for wheat are as harmful as floods. However, floods are not very common, and insect disasters are not annual. In agricultural publications of Jinling University, it is estimated that the losses from insect disasters in our country amount to more than two or three hundred million yuan per year. The impact on the wealth of the people can be imagined. At the present time, we are actively promoting the increase of agricultural products. Positive aspects, such as irrigation, drainage, improved farming, and seed aspects, should be given special attention. The negative aspect of preventing insect disasters is also prepared to be abandoned, otherwise the insect disasters will spread wider and the elimination will be difficult. The method of prevention, on the one hand, should be to restore agencies such as the Insect Bureau to continue to study prevention and elimination methods. On the other hand, it is more appropriate to promote the large-scale manufacture of insecticides and supply them to farmers at low prices.

The problem of utilizing wasteland. There are many barren mountains, wasteland, lakes, swamps, and marshes in our country. If they can be fully utilized according to local conditions, it can also be of great benefit to increasing agricultural products. However, the character of our people is mostly happy to watch success, and it is difficult to plan with them. The monopoly work is not 嗟 can obtain immediate benefits, so it should be handled by government agencies themselves, or encourage people to organize companies to handle, and by the government thousand with interest guarantees, as well as various conveniences in the work.

How to Raise Increased Production Funds

How to raise the funds needed for increased agricultural and industrial production is also an issue that should be discussed first in this article. The intent is that industrial funds, in addition to long-term funds that should first enrich individual capital or issue company bonds, the shorter-term, more active ones are those that Shanghai commercial banks are happy to undertake, and currently the money is gradually loosening, and it seems that it is no longer a problem. In the event of a unified purchase of raw materials, when huge funds are needed, you can also follow the industry loan loan precedent, by the financial sector to organize the bank pass, co-commitment, and the Chinese bank to national bank status, as its backing. As for agricultural lending, the nature is not the flexibility of industrial and commercial lending, and it is scattered in various places, and it is not welcomed by general commercial banks, especially the medium and long-term loans, the term is longer, and it is not willing to do what general commercial banks can do. However, agricultural needs for improvement funds are actually more urgent than industry, and at the same time, agricultural production is not only related to people's food, but also has a linked relationship with industrial production, because without agricultural products, there are no raw materials, and without raw materials, industry cannot produce. In addition to this situation, there are only two ways to raise funds: the first is to handle it by the National Bank itself, or by the National Bank to provide funds, and entrust other banks to handle it, the second is to encourage general commercial banks to handle it, by the National Bank to guarantee interest, and to give them the convenience of transferring mortgages at any time when necessary. Regardless of which method is adopted, rural financial institutions such as cooperatives must first be soundly established, otherwise the organization will be loose, and there will be simply no way to start.

Finally, there is one more point, that is, to require domestic agricultural and industrial experts to use what they have learned and participate in the work of national revitalization and economic construction in unison. At a minimum, they must be able to achieve a self-sufficient level in the shortest possible time. How can this mission be accomplished? It all depends on the joint efforts of all parties.

### Promoting Production and Construction

— Xu Guanqun

In this day and age, everyone seems to have awakened to the unreliability of speculation for quick profits and understands the urgency of striving for production. To meet the demands of the times and environment, on the National Day of the Republic of China's 32nd year, the Shen Bao newspaper asked me to write an article on the topic of "How to Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production." Considering my limited knowledge, I was deeply concerned that I would not be able to offer anything of substance. Therefore, I will briefly express my personal observations and limited views.

We all know that if China wants to achieve self-reliance, a drastic change is needed in its economic construction, transforming it from a consumer nation to a producer nation. The characteristic of China's past economy was that it could only consume and not produce, to the point that China is now called the world's largest consumer nation, which is disheartening to say. Whether in times of peace or war, no nation that only knows how to consume and not how to produce can survive in today's world. Fortunately, enlightened people in the economic world today deeply understand this principle and unanimously advocate increasing production to correct the mistake of neglecting production, which is a good sign.

However, simply talking about production is not enough. Regarding the question of how to increase production, we must first engage in thorough discussions and offer suggestions to get to the root of the problem. The topic for submissions announced by the Shen Bao newspaper focuses on the fundamental problem of China's production today, which lies in how to utilize China's two largest assets and resources: manpower and land. Therefore, the topic is "How to Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production."

Understanding Agricultural and Industrial Problems

When it comes to agricultural and industrial production, the emphasis is not on theory but on facts. From an economic theory perspective, the deep divide between the Physiocrats and the Mercantilists no longer exists in today's era. In other words, agricultural and industrial production are equally important. In ancient times, agriculture held a dominant position. In the autumn of the 17th century, the importance of commerce and industry increased. By the mid-18th century, agriculture regained importance. When the Industrial Revolution arose, industry surpassed all other sectors. Thus, there were times of emphasis on agriculture and times of emphasis on industry. However, the understanding of agricultural and industrial problems in the economic world today is somewhat different. Our common understanding is that the importance of agricultural and industrial production is equally significant, because both the industrial and commercial sectors must purchase raw materials from farmers, and farmers must also purchase tools and other manufactured goods from the industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, increased agricultural production can increase industrial production, and increased industrial production can also increase agricultural production.

However, regarding the current state of agricultural production in China, as Mr. Lin Kanghou wrote in the September issue of "Economic Herald," "As far as the current situation is concerned, the two major factors of production, manpower and land, do not seem to be a problem in our country. However, upon closer examination, there are hidden crises everywhere, which cannot help but make one frown with worry. Since the sharp rise in prices and the proliferation of black markets, the profits from black market transactions far exceed the rate of return from general legitimate businesses and are better than general wage and salary income. Since the price of rice on the black market has soared, rural farmers, regardless of age or gender, have abandoned their hoes and left their fields, spending their days carrying loads on their shoulders, traveling between urban and rural areas,贩运rice and grain, pursuing the exorbitant profits of smuggled rice. The impact on agricultural production is self-evident. Furthermore, since the price of cigarettes on the black market has sharply risen, long queues of people crowd in front of cigarette paper shops all day long, rushing to obtain rationed cigarettes for sale on the black market. This income is also much greater than ordinary wages. This phenomenon not only wastes manpower but also affects the psychology of workers, causing them to dislike production work and enjoy engaging in trafficking and smuggling. Therefore, can we not worry about the manpower and wage problems when increasing production?"

In view of such general crises and phenomena, I feel that there are several key issues regarding how to increase agricultural and industrial production that require our economic circles to address together. I will explain them as follows:

Regarding Increasing Agricultural Production:

Agricultural Finance Problems: Increasing agricultural production relies heavily on the regulation of agricultural finance. The agricultural loans offered by the Bank of Communications are a good example of regulating agricultural finance, because its agricultural finance business policy aims to improve the economic conditions of rural areas, increase agricultural production, assist in agricultural promotion and extension, guide farmers to establish their own financial systems and institutions with autonomy, self-management, and self-enjoyment, and support the establishment of self-cultivating farmers. I fully agree with these policies and believe that providing loans to rural areas should be expanded and promoted. The initial work should focus on rural credit and production cooperative loans, so that rural capital can circulate, improve the economic conditions of rural areas, and naturally increase agricultural production.

Agricultural Technology Problems: Increasing agricultural production also relies heavily on improving agricultural technology. Our country's land is not infertile, and its products are not scarce, but unfortunately, farming methods have always adhered to conventions without seeking improvement, and mechanized farming methods are still lacking. This results in the inability to increase production dramatically. In addition, there is the question of how to cultivate wasteland and how to develop low-lying marshlands. According to research, after the completion of the reclamation plan for Eastern Taihu Lake, 16,000 hectares of fertile land can be obtained, yielding 70 million dan of rice. These are all agricultural technology issues that have a significant impact on agricultural production.

Problems with Agricultural Product Prices: Increasing agricultural production also depends on increasing the prices of agricultural products. The farmers’ ability to repay their debts depends on the prices of their agricultural products. If the government lowers the prices when purchasing agricultural products, farmers will lose their ability to repay their debts, and the consequences will be unimaginable, and they may even abandon their farms. If agricultural product prices are reasonably increased, farmers' income can increase, and after deducting the minimum living expenses, they can invest the remaining money into the land, gradually making land rental and cultivation more economical. Then, agricultural products can naturally increase.

Regarding Increasing Industrial Production:

Industrial Raw Materials Problems: "A skilled cook cannot make a meal without rice" is an old Chinese saying that is also very logical. The lifeblood of industry is raw materials. Among the many reasons for the current sluggish industrial production, the lack or depletion of raw materials is the most fatal blow. Due to transportation difficulties or blockades, imported raw materials are naturally in short supply, but we should still try our best to ensure a continuous supply of domestic raw materials. In addition, we should adhere to the principle of using local raw materials as much as possible. It is true that we cannot produce flour without wheat or cloth without cotton, but all other industrial products also have local raw materials that can be used. For example, the raw materials for alcohol are sweet potatoes and sugarcane, and the raw materials for paper are wood and bamboo, which are abundant in our local products. The question is only how to use them as much as possible? How can those that are rationed be allocated as much as possible?

Industrial Finance Problems: Improving financial activities is closely related to increasing productivity. In the summer of the year before last, I discussed domestic industrial finance problems with Mr. Zhu Hengquan, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, and Mr. Yi Shengbai, and I deeply felt that the domestic financial environment was not able to meet the needs of the industrial sector. Subsequently, the China Industrial Bank was established, with the goal of providing legitimate production enterprises with the funds they need and providing reasonable support. At the same time, it aims to provide the industrial sector with a practical organization to increase production, handling industrial surveys, statistics, research, design, technology, and other matters to strive for industrial production. In addition, considering that small-scale industries still occupy an important position in China's overall production volume, I also strongly support organizing them. The rise of small-scale industries is a "many grains make a heap" approach to increasing production. Therefore, in the regulation of industrial finance, it is especially necessary to revitalize small-scale industries.

In conclusion, under our united banner of increasing agricultural and industrial production, the people, whether they are engaged in agriculture or industry, should sweep away the old habits of extravagance and jointly grasp the key to increasing agricultural and industrial production and work hard in their respective positions. Then, the 400 million people who were originally mostly consumers can easily be transformed into 400 million producers. China's economy must undergo this drastic change in order to speak of the emergence of a new China.

### Increasing Agricultural and Industrial Production: Striving in Our Respective Positions

— Shao Shuhua

Introduction

Our country is an agricultural producing country, and light and heavy industries are still in their infancy. Most of the people make a living from agriculture. It is estimated that out of the 450 million people in the country, about 300 million are farmers, accounting for 75% of the total population. From this, it can be seen that our country's production profession is heavily biased towards agriculture, so if we want to develop our country's economic undertakings, we should start with agriculture first. The increase in agricultural production will indirectly enable the country's economy to develop. Looking back at our country's industry, before the early 19th century, it was still a handicraft industry country. After the Opium War, China's closed-door sovereignty was broken by cannons. Due to the continuous arrival of foreign investment machines, our country's immature industry was still in its infancy. Since the war, our country's industry has suffered huge damage. Despite the continuous efforts of the Chinese people, the operation of machines and the progress of industry have also improved in terms of quality and quantity, but the future development of our country's industry still requires great efforts.

Restrictions on Land Use

In reviewing how to increase agricultural production, we must first recognize what is the object of agricultural production? It is well known that the object of agricultural production is agricultural land. Now, let's first briefly describe agricultural land. According to Zhang Xinyi's estimate, the total land area is 2,570,000 mu, which is equivalent to 12,000,000,000 mu. Among them, the cultivated land is about 1,240,000,000 mu, accounting for only 10.3% of the total area. However, according to the Land Commission's report, the cultivated land area accounts for 22.34% of the surveyed area, which is more than double the former. Now, let's put it aside and only look at our side. We can also see that the cultivated land area is small. However, the same agricultural land still has the distinction between cultivated land area and crop area. The former is the natural area, and the latter is the production area. To increase agricultural production, we must first increase the crop area. However, there are also limitations on the use of land. As far as arable land is concerned, there are also natural limitations and relative limitations. In other words, natural limitations and human limitations. If we want to increase agriculture, we must eliminate the above restrictions, then the increase in production can be achieved. The so-called natural limitations have the following four factors:

Climate affects the production of crops. For example, the high and low temperature can affect the maturity of crops. Also, the production of rain is directly proportional to the temperature between the frost season. All of these are to affect the production of crops.

The growth of plants not only requires abundant rainfall, but also requires even distribution in time. There are places with very large rainfall, because the distribution of water is different, half a year is sunny and half a year is rainy, which makes it impossible to fully utilize its land, which is enough to be an obstacle to agricultural production.

Terrain refers to the shape of the ground, such as the degree of inclination and its direction, the flatness or unevenness of the land, etc. The flat plains are most beneficial to crops. In today's agricultural mechanization, the value of plains is even more increased. Only if there are other obstacles, even if there is no inclined land, it will also affect production a lot.

Soil. Soil is directly distributed by rocks, which is called accumulation soil. There is also transport soil, which is formed by the accumulation of running water and sediment. The degree of decomposition is better. Only sandy soil with a loose structure and clay soil with a too dense structure are not suitable for cultivation.

As for man-made restrictions, taking China as an example, China's economy is still in a semi-development state. The existence of feudal forces often hinders the use of land and the reclamation of wasteland. For example, the fields of rich merchants in various parts of our country occupy a very wide area and are all excellent lands. Such occupation of thousands of hectares of fertile land hinders land cultivation and affects production. At the same time, our country's small-scale system has been followed to this day, which also indirectly hinders the mechanization of agriculture.

All of these are enough to prevent the full use of land and are sufficient to prevent the increase in production. It is necessary to eliminate the restrictions on land use and even increase the land (cultivability). In this way, production can be increased due to the change in the "fixity" of land supply.

Necessary Conditions for Agricultural Production

Agricultural production is restricted by the limitation of land use, and land use is limited by the limit of food production. Then, the increase in agricultural production must also seek the increase in food production. There are the following aspects to consider for the necessary conditions for increasing agricultural production:

The expansion of cultivated land. In countries with a long history, the expansion of cultivated land may not be able to increase the food production per capita. As a result of population growth, cultivation will be extended to more inferior land, so the output per capita may be reduced instead. However, the development of the New World in modern times has been considerable. These lands can be used as cultivated land, and because they have not been cultivated, they are more fertile than lands that have been cultivated for thousands of years. Therefore, this cultivated land must be expanded as much as possible, and then food production can be increased. In the past 46 years, the world's wheat cultivated land has increased by 69%, with an average annual increase of 1.5%, which is clear evidence.

The progress of biology. Agricultural methods related to crop varieties and pest control are all due to the research of biology. The progress of modern biology has helped the above-mentioned things. Its contribution cannot be denied. The expansion of cultivated land, if there is no seed to adapt to the climate of the increased land, then it cannot have good results. The progress of biology has helped a lot in pest control. Not only have pests been greatly reduced in civilized countries, but also locusts in Egypt have been greatly reduced. The breeding of livestock has also increased in quantity and quality due to the improvement of breeding technology. Therefore, the progress of biology is sufficient to promote the increase of agricultural production.

The development of chemistry. The development of chemistry can greatly improve food production, processing, and consumption. The most helpful to the increase in output is the use of artificial fertilizers. In recent years, the increase in yield per mu in friendly neighbor Japan has been unlimited, which is greatly related to the import of fertilizer. As for the improvement of food processing, it has made previously discarded foods or even become nutritionally essential foods. Therefore, the improvement of chemical technology can increase food production.

The mechanization of agriculture. The adoption of machinery in agriculture is no less than opening a new era in the history of agricultural production. After the Industrial Revolution, the agriculture of various countries has turned to mechanization. Cultivation tools use machines instead of manpower, so the output has greatly increased. Unfortunately, our country's small-scale production technology is still in a feudal atmosphere. Everything follows the old rules. The use of sickles, hoes, and plows is more common in various rural areas. Compared with mechanized production technology, there is a world of difference. It is difficult to increase output by this. However, since we understand the above-mentioned prerequisites for production, we can start from this and strive for improvement. If we can meet the industrial conditions mentioned above, the increase in agricultural production can be expected.

The Situation of Shanghai's Industry After the War

Shanghai is the center of our country's modern industry, so when our country's industry can be represented by Shanghai, the damage suffered by Shanghai's industry after the August 13th War was extremely huge, and its vitality was greatly damaged. According to the survey by the Social Bureau, there were 5,255 registered factories in Shanghai before the incident. After the incident, 4,998 factories were damaged, accounting for more than 95%. Among them, there were 65 textile factories in Shanghai before the war, and only a dozen were left after the incident. There were 44 silk factories in Shanghai before the war, and only a dozen were left after the incident. There were 14 flour factories in Shanghai before the war, and half of them were damaged. The losses of other industrial factories were also huge.

Since the 27th year of the Republic of China, the factories have resumed operation one after another, and new factories have started construction. In the past three years, Shanghai's industry has shown a prosperous appearance. However, since the world war situation expanded after the 30th year, the sources of raw materials and fuel for Shanghai factories have been lacking, and the production of products has been greatly restricted. The industrial sector suddenly felt heavy difficulties, resulting in the decline of the industrial sector in the 31st year. Since this year, although efforts have been made in various aspects to increase industrial production, the difficulties in raw materials and power sales have not been thoroughly resolved, and the results are still very effective. Therefore, revitalizing industry and increasing production are the most basic work in the current economic construction.

Necessary Steps to Increase Industrial Production

Since Shanghai's industry at this stage has the above-mentioned difficulties, it is impossible to increase production without remedying the reasons for the current decline of industry. It is believed that if the current industrial production can be restored to the state before the incident, it can be considered quite satisfactory for the time being. Therefore, the planning for increasing industrial production in this section is aimed at solving the current obstacle problems. As far as I can see, I will briefly describe them as follows:

Unblock the Source of Raw Materials: Raw materials are the lifeblood of production. To increase production, we must ensure the supply of raw materials. At present, various raw materials are subject to the centralized control of wartime materials, which makes the exchange less frequent than before. Stockpiling materials is something that countries must do during wartime, but we should provide convenience for the exchange and sales of raw materials needed for legitimate industrial production and increase the production of raw materials. Then, the increase in industrial production can be expected.

Improve Power Supply: Since the outbreak of the war, the Shanghai Electric Power Company has restricted the supply of electricity due to the difficulty in obtaining coal. Since March of the 30th year, the power consumption has been reduced repeatedly, which has a significant impact on industrial production. However, looking at the Shanghai Industrial Index in 1942, which was about 50% of that in 1936, it can be seen that the industrial sector has suffered a great blow. Although we cannot say that the decline of industry in 1942 was entirely due to the restriction of electricity use, the insufficient supply of electricity is undoubtedly a major reason. If we want to increase industrial production in the future, we must properly plan to unblock the source of coal and rationally supply electricity for factory use.

Set Reasonable Price Limits for Industrial Products: The government's control of prices and the setting of price limits are necessary measures during wartime, which are conducive to stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. However, excessively high price limits will affect people's livelihoods, while excessively low price limits will prevent industrial producers from obtaining legitimate profits, which is also unfair. Therefore, in the process of increasing production, we must carefully consider the setting of price limits and determine them by calculating their costs, supply and demand, and other factors.

The above-mentioned points are the most important ones. Other things, such as the supply of industrial capital and the appropriate encouragement of the government, are all necessary work to increase production.

Conclusion

Our country is a weak country, and the impact of the changes it has suffered in the past 100 years cannot be said to be small. People with insight are all striving for the prosperity and strength of the country, but if we want to be strong, we must first be rich, and if we want to be rich, we must first increase production. The current increase in production is especially important for agriculture and industry. Increasing agricultural and industrial production is the most important work in our country's economic construction at present. People should work hard in their respective positions.

### The Way to Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production

— Bai Ji

Our country is founded on agriculture, a tradition that has remained unchanged for thousands of years. The foundation of our society and economy is still based on agriculture. In recent years, it has been repeatedly affected by wars, and the productivity has gradually declined. Furthermore, industrial construction has lagged behind for a long time, failing to keep pace with advanced countries. Although light and heavy industries have recently developed rapidly, various productions have not yet fully met expectations. Moreover, the rise of military industries during the war has indirectly reduced general production. Therefore, increasing agricultural and industrial production is currently the most urgent task in our country's economic construction and should not be ignored.

Understanding Agricultural Production Increase

Our country is vast and rich in resources, dominating eastern Asia, with a total area of 1.3 million square miles and a population of over 450 million. With fertile fields stretching for thousands of miles, it is a historical agricultural nation. Farmers account for three-quarters of the total population. From this fact, it is clear that the focus of China's economic problems lies in the rural economy. If we want to study how to increase production, we must start with agriculture.

Regarding agricultural production, nothing is more important than food. Food crops account for more than 80% of the total crop acreage in China. In times of peace, international trade is unimpeded. A country only needs to have enough exchange goods to ensure the supply of food. A country's food supply does not necessarily have to focus on domestic production. However, from a national defense perspective, food resources must focus on domestic production. In countries without strong military power to maintain foreign trade, food self-sufficiency is even more important. Moreover, due to the unique economic structure of China's agricultural production, it should be self-sufficient even in peacetime. Otherwise, it will jeopardize the future of the national economy. About 70-80% of the Chinese people depend on agriculture for a living. Their purchasing power comes from agricultural products, and most of their expenses are for food. In a small-scale peasant economy, production is mainly for self-sufficiency. Surpluses are exchanged only after needs are met. Therefore, if food cannot be self-sufficient, there will be no surplus purchasing power. Even if people want to buy insufficient food, it is still impossible, let alone other things. Therefore, the inability to be self-sufficient in food production is a serious problem for China's agricultural production economy.

Difficulties in Increasing Agricultural Production

What are the difficulties in increasing agricultural production in our country?

Lack of large farms. Our country's farms are scattered like stars, with crisscrossing fields and paths. Each farm household's cultivated land is scattered in the east and west, unable to be concentrated in one place. Due to various reasons such as mortgages, sales, and division of property, the cultivated land area becomes smaller and smaller. The drawbacks of this small-scale farming system are as follows:

Waste of land—A lot of land is wasted on paths and field ridges, reducing the production area.

Waste of labor time—Farmers have to run around, wasting labor.

Obstacles to irrigation—Fields far from the water source have to pass through other people's fields for irrigation, leading to frequent disputes and disturbances, especially in drought years.

Inability to use machinery—It feels like a hero has no place to use his talents when trying to apply modern mechanized farm tools on extremely small cultivated land.

Blind selection of varieties—Most farmers blindly follow the experience inherited from their ancestors in selecting and breeding their varieties, without any scientific basis or improvement. It is difficult to increase production this way.

Use of simple farm tools—All farm tools, such as hoes, plows, rakes, waterwheels, winnowing fans, and stone mills, are still in use and are still widely used. Compared with the efficiency of machinery, the difference is immeasurable.

Lack of economic technology for irrigation and drainage—Our country has many natural rivers, so water conservancy projects have always been valued. Larger rivers are the best source of water for irrigation on the one hand, but on the other hand, it is also necessary to prevent floods. Therefore, the development of water conservancy projects has two aspects: the active aspect is irrigation, which increases agricultural production, and the passive aspect is flood prevention, which reduces the possibility of damage to agricultural production. However, until today, there are still various corrupt elements, making the benefits of water conservancy projects hard to see, which is deeply regrettable.

Strategies to Increase Agricultural Production

The following strategies should be implemented to increase agricultural production:

Reclaiming wasteland—Currently, some land in our country is barren due to war, and some has not yet been developed. These barren lands can be utilized for reclamation to achieve the goal of increasing production. However, the use of agricultural land in our country is restricted by the remnants of feudalism and the exploitation of bureaucratic landlords, which hinders the reclamation of wasteland. If farmers want to reclaim a piece of land that they do not own, their income, after compensating for labor costs, must also cover heavy taxes, miscellaneous levies, and rent. Farmers cannot reclaim land unless they can afford all of these expenses. Although our country has a vast territory, most of the wasteland is not suitable for cultivation. The area of wasteland in our country accounts for only 19.1% of the total land area, and only 6.4% of the wasteland is arable. Furthermore, while the total cultivated land in the country can be increased by reclaiming wasteland, it is also barren due to water and drought disasters. Therefore, the actual increase in wasteland is only 1%. Therefore, although wasteland can be reclaimed, it is limited. The increase in our country's agricultural production cannot be solved solely by reclaiming wasteland.

Application of new farm tools and machinery—The application of new farm tools and machinery to cultivation can save labor and promote increased production. According to a report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, one Chinese farmer can cultivate one to four acres, while one American farmer can cultivate more than fifty-seven acres. Chinese farm households can only cultivate an average of two acres of paddy fields, while American farmers can cultivate 200 to 400 acres. In the United States, it takes a total of 289 hours of labor to produce one hectare of cotton, while in China it takes 1,620 hours. From this, it can be seen that although the yield per acre of Chinese land is sometimes higher than that of the United States, the low production efficiency compared to the United States due to the excessive labor required is an undeniable fact.

Improving crop varieties—Superior seeds should be actively promoted, instead of sticking to old ways and blindly selecting varieties. Scientific knowledge such as soil analysis and variety selection should be actively instilled in the people, so that harvests will naturally increase.

Cultivating agricultural professionals—In order to achieve the purpose of promoting education for the people and instilling scientific knowledge to benefit production, it is necessary to cultivate professional agricultural talents with both learning and experience, so that farmers' cultivation methods will improve day by day, and increased production can be expected.

Opening up large farms—Opening up large farms is a practical strategy to increase production. As mentioned earlier, Chinese farms are small and scattered, with crisscrossing fields and paths that are not concentrated. This hinders large-scale production. Now, if we establish a well-organized large farm with scientific management, all kinds of difficulties can be easily solved. For example, the waste of land can be reduced accordingly. Paths and field ridges can be added to cultivation. Farmers' cultivation can also be concentrated, reducing the labor time spent on movement or transportation, and disputes over irrigation and the inability to use machinery can be eliminated.

Other measures, such as strictly implementing rotational cropping systems, promoting labor services, and developing urban and rural agriculture, are all strategies to promote production and can be implemented at any time according to actual needs.

Understanding Industrial Production Increase

Our country's industrial production is extremely backward. In the past, those who engaged in industry mostly aimed at high profits and low risks. They rarely considered whether their products had practical benefits for the country and the people. Looking at Shanghai, every time a new industry is established, imitators spring up like bamboo shoots after rain, pursuing huge profits without considering its nature, effectiveness, and degree of need. The error of this concept is obvious. During wartime, everything should be aimed at meeting wartime needs. Industrial production bears the important responsibility of completing war missions, so it must change its past goals and strive to produce essential goods. There are many kinds of industrial products. Considering their maximum effectiveness, with very few exceptions, they are all related to national defense and people's livelihood. However, the following items are particularly important:

National defense industry: Includes the production of all war equipment and weapons.

Electrical industry: Includes all electrical equipment, electrical machinery, and tools.

Machinery industry: Includes all motors, engines, and their accessories.

Chemical industry: Includes all medicines, alcohol, acids, and alkalis.

Textile industry: Includes all cotton, silk, wool, and their finished products.

Agricultural product manufacturing industry: Includes all food, vegetable oil, tea, sugar, etc.

Mining and iron smelting industry: Includes the mining and smelting of all metal and non-metal minerals such as gold, silver, steel, antimony, tin, aluminum, as well as coal, oil, gasoline, etc.

Other essential consumer goods industries: Such as leather, paper, cement, matches, rubber, glass, etc.

Currently, increasing industrial production should focus on the above-mentioned major essential industries, with national defense and people's livelihood as the premise, and abandon the selfish idea of profit as the sole purpose. Furthermore, the gradual decline in wartime corporate profits is an inevitable phenomenon.

The reasons for the decrease in profit rates can be summarized into the following six points:　Product prices are restricted.　Wage increases and expenditure increases sharply.　Increased expenses for labor welfare undertakings.　The cost of new construction and expansion is expensive.　The increase in taxes.　The increase in depreciation reserves. From this, it can be seen that during wartime, enterprises are not allowed to pursue profits alone. Therefore, when the time comes, all entrepreneurs must recognize that economic goals should prioritize the overall welfare of the nation and the country. Only then can the increase in production strengthen the nation and enrich the people, and gradually complete economic construction.

Ways to Increase Industrial Production

Increasing industrial production is necessary at this time. The methods are as follows:

Raising Industrial Funds. New-style industries require huge investments, and industrial investments usually take a long time to pay off. Ordinary short-term credit institutions (commercial banks)

## Page 11

Continued from page 5, they are unable to supply the required funds. Therefore, obtaining and coordinating industrial funds is an important issue in increasing production. The solution to this problem depends on one thing: communication between financial capital and industrial capital. Financial institutions are the central market for gold. Obtaining the large amount of funds needed by industry depends on the investment of financial institutions. However, currently, financial institutions are restricted in many transactions, and the use of funds is also difficult. Relatively long-term industrial investment is a good way to use funds. Therefore, promoting cooperation and communication between financial capital and industrial capital is necessary to increase production. Second, direct loans or assistance from the government. The rise and fall of industry is of great importance to the country, and large-scale enterprises have a particularly profound impact. Therefore, the government should provide as much assistance as possible to general essential industries, or provide loans in various ways to facilitate increased production.

Supplying Sufficient Industrial Raw Materials. The task of industry is to transform raw materials into finished products. There must be raw materials before there can be products. If the supply of raw materials is insufficient, it is impossible to increase production. Currently, due to the interruption of foreign trade, the supply of domestic industrial raw materials is lacking, and it is very difficult to obtain them. To increase industrial production, in addition to increasing the production of raw materials and unblocking their sources, proper distribution is also necessary. The most reasonable method is for industry associations and other institutions to investigate the actual needs of each factory, and then allocate them according to the required proportions, ensuring fairness and quantity, so as to facilitate production and eliminate the black market for raw materials. Moreover, with the advancement of science, there are many examples of countries replacing raw materials with substitutes during wartime due to the lack of raw materials. This should also be promoted, at least to solve part of the raw material problem.

Supplying Sufficient Industrial Power. Industrial production cannot be without appropriate power. In addition to fully utilizing natural hydropower, electricity is the most important source of power. The generation of electricity requires fuels such as coal or gasoline. Currently, during wartime, in order to save fuel, there are restrictions on the supply of electricity. Factories in Shanghai are also subject to electricity restrictions. However, restricting electricity directly affects industrial production, so it should be treated with importance. Electricity consumption that is purely for consumption should be restricted, while the electricity needed by industry should be increased for the sake of increasing wartime production. Not only should it not be reduced, but it should also be increased. At least, its actual needs should be investigated and fully supplied. At the same time, power plants are public utilities in nature and are different from profit-making enterprises. During wartime, the mission they bear is even more important. Therefore, the electricity used by industrial production should be charged at the lowest possible price, so as to reduce production costs and encourage increased production.

Regulating the Transportation and Sales of Products. The transportation and sales of products is an important issue in industrial development. Developing transportation and improving transportation to facilitate the transportation of products is a particularly urgent issue. Looking at the current difficulties in general transportation, if we only increase production, a large amount of products cannot be transported and circulated, and it will not be of much help to people's livelihood. Therefore, unblocking transportation routes and lowering transportation prices are necessary to promote transportation and sales. As for government taxes, under the principle of not hindering tax revenue, they should be reduced as much as possible as an incentive. Moreover, under a controlled economy, commodity prices should be limited by the government. The determination of price limits should be low to benefit people's livelihood, but it should also be in accordance with the circumstances such as regulating its production costs, so that on the other hand, it does not harm the legitimate interests of producers. This is also something that cannot be ignored in increasing production, because otherwise, the driving force for increasing production will be lost, and it will be difficult to increase production.

Improving Industrial Technology. Modern industry is changing rapidly and constantly progressing, and this progress depends on the research and improvement of industrial technology. To increase production, industrial technology must be improved at any time, so that production technology and equipment are suitable for the application of mass production. Therefore, cultivating technical talents, establishing research institutions, and publicizing industrial technology are all important ways to increase production.

### Review of Increasing Agricultural and Industrial Production

— Li Jiayin

1. How to Increase Agricultural Production

Our country has been founded on agriculture since ancient times, and this has been followed and never changed throughout the dynasties. From the Divine Farmer teaching the people to cultivate and harvest, to the Zhou dynasty establishing the well-field system, until today, it has been more than four thousand years. Eighty percent of the people in the country make a living by farming. The decline of agriculture in our country did not begin today. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, faint signs were already revealed, with the import of foreign rice and wheat increasing daily, and the export of agricultural products such as tea, silk, and miscellaneous items decreasing daily. Since the Republic of China, its decline has been even more rapid and alarming, among which the shortage of food is the most serious. According to the customs trade reports of the last thirty years, rice ranks first and wheat ranks second among the products imported each year. However, the above two are China's main food grains, together accounting for more than 45% of the national purchasing power, and their importance can be imagined.

There are many reasons for the decline of agriculture in our country, but I will briefly list the more important ones below, as a reference for those who seek to increase production in the future: (A) Political instability; (B) Natural disasters and disrepair of water conservancy; (C) Failure to fully utilize land resources and unequal land administration; (D) Lack of capital and inflexible rural finance; (E) Inconvenient transportation; (F) Backward production technology (including soil, fertilizer, seeds, pests and diseases, cultivation methods, etc.); (G) Outdated farm tools and insufficient draft cattle.

In addition to staple foods, cotton, and miscellaneous grains, which are in urgent need, the increase in agricultural special products such as tung oil, tea, silk, and agricultural raw materials related to light industry in our country should also not be ignored. The current National Government has recognized the importance of food during wartime and has incorporated wartime economic policies, formulating a food production increase plan. The planning is thorough, but unfortunately, its implementation is rarely seen.

Now, to increase agricultural production, based on my limited understanding, I will divide it into two aspects: short-term and long-term solutions:

A. Short-term Solutions

In terms of governance, since the Republic of China, internal strife and foreign aggression have been incessant, leading to rural bankruptcy and the inability of the people to live in peace. How can they be expected to work happily and increase production? Moreover, due to political instability, other economic, social, and agricultural improvement measures cannot be effective. Therefore, these four must complement each other to be effective. The most important task of governance is to quell unrest and secure the people, eliminate banditry, and have the government and the people work together with one heart and share weal and woe. Those in power must "worry about the world's worries before the world worries, and enjoy the world's joys after the world enjoys," which is a clear principle and needs no further elaboration.

In terms of economy, farmers must be able to obtain a reasonable return, reducing the danger of "tilling without clothing or food." According to the preliminary cost estimate report of agricultural crops in Pudong District, Shanghai, by the Chinese Economic Research Association in July of the thirty-second year of the Republic of China: "A total of thirty-four locations were surveyed. In terms of the types of agricultural products, only five types, namely cotton, wheat, rice, beans, and rapeseed, were considered... In terms of income, the most profitable crop is soybeans, because no fertilizer is needed for planting beans, the cost is relatively low, and the selling price is not as subject to control as cotton and rice. Therefore, the profit per mu is as high as more than 500 yuan, and the interest rate is the highest among the above agricultural products. However, planting cotton not only does not yield any profit, but also falls far short of the cost. According to the calculation of labor, wages, and raw material market prices in April of the thirty-second year of the Republic of China, planting one mu of cotton will result in a loss of about 460 yuan. Planting one mu of rice yields a profit of 218 yuan; wheat yields a profit of 207 yuan; and rapeseed yields a profit of 190 yuan." The price of cotton raw materials is subject to controlled prices, so farmers cannot make a profit and even suffer heavy losses. This has a serious impact on cotton production, which is declining day by day; the cotton textile industry will inevitably reduce production or even shut down. In addition to the above-mentioned economic measures, there are more advanced ones: Negative measures: (A) Reducing rent and taxes; (B) Reducing agricultural product transportation costs and facilitating operations; (C) Promoting agricultural loans and strictly prohibiting usury. Positive measures: (A) Establishing loan financial institutions to provide farmers with low-interest loans to purchase seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, and daily necessities, etc.; (B) Establishing production and sales cooperative organizations to prevent unscrupulous merchants from manipulating prices and making profits; (C) Stipulating reasonable prices for agricultural products (estimating costs and profits), which must comply with the goals of the controlled economy policy and increased production.

In terms of society, we should economize on consumption and promote the use of substitutes for rice and wheat. Therefore, in addition to rice and wheat, the government should advocate eating potatoes and coarse grains. We should popularize agricultural education and instill scientific knowledge, and cultivate agricultural improvement technicians to guide the people in applying fertilizers, selecting seeds, and cultivating suitable crops according to the weather and local conditions, using new farm tools, and implementing methods to increase production. We should also instill in farmers the scientific knowledge that "man can conquer nature" and not "leave everything to fate." We should strictly punish unscrupulous merchants who hoard goods and manipulate prices, both in their minds and in reality.

B. Long-term Solutions

Reclaiming Wasteland: There has never been accurate statistics on the cultivated land area in our country. According to the estimate of American Baker, China has about 700 million acres of arable land, that is, the arable land in our country can reach 29% of the total area, and the cultivated land accounts for about 26% of the arable land, that is, 180 million acres. If Baker's statistics are reliable, then our country should have more than 460 million mu of arable land. There are still 340 million mu of arable land that can be cultivated but has not been cultivated. If the government can fully assist the people in revitalizing reclamation, the arable land in our country can be greatly increased, and the agricultural output will also increase accordingly.

Repairing Water Conservancy: Water conservancy and cultivation are closely related and cannot be neglected. The floods of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River are well known to the people of the country, and the droughts in the northwest are also well known to the people. The evils involved have a great impact on agriculture and people's livelihood. In this case, if we do not seek to increase agricultural production, then how can we ignore the importance of repairing water conservancy? Moreover, water conservancy projects are huge undertakings and are a major plan for the country and the nation for thousands of years, which cannot be undertaken by the people alone.

Selecting Seeds: Agricultural experts from all over the world, under the guidance of the government and academic institutions, are devoting their lives to improving agriculture, enriching food, improving varieties, and increasing production. Therefore, they sow the seed before the seedling appears, and plant the seedling before it flowers, so that it will bear fruit. This is the result of applying scientific methods, which we should not ignore or imitate.

Improving Soil and Fertilizer: The analysis and improvement of soil is indeed an urgent task. During the Warring States period, Prime Minister Yan Ying of Qi, when he was sent to Chu, said to the King of Chu: "Oranges grow south of the Huai River, while trifoliate oranges grow north of the Huai River." The species is the same, but the fruit differs due to the different locations. Why? If we analyze it from a scientific standpoint, it is because the soil quality and climate south and north of the Huai River are different. This work must be carried out by government experimental institutions that establish technical research institutes, provide assistance and guidance. In recent years, the demand for chemical fertilizers for agricultural cultivation in our country has increased day by day. Due to the lack of fertilizer and high prices, farmers are unable to purchase it, and the government agencies urgently need to lend or allocate it to farmers at low prices to facilitate increased production.

Improving Farm Tools: The farm tools in our country are simple and crude, and there has been little improvement. If new-style farming machinery can be adopted, its efficiency will definitely increase. As for the application of engine-powered agricultural machinery (such as in agricultural countries in the United States), it may not be allowed by the facts. However, if the government, agricultural cooperatives, or promotion associations can rent out simple modern equipment such as pumps, tillage equipment, and threshing machines, and send personnel to provide guidance, the effect on increasing production will be considerable.

Preventing and Controlling Pests: Insect pests, especially locust plagues, are the most serious. According to entomologists, the national loss is estimated to be 120,000 million yuan every year. The fundamental solutions are: strengthening prevention; clearing weeds; consolidating dried-up marshes and barren mountains; and universally implementing winter plowing.

Improving Cultivation Methods: Our country has a vast territory, and the climate and geology vary from place to place. We need to conduct on-site research and apply different cultivation methods: (A) Applying a transplanting system; (B) Improving dryland farming methods; (C) Researching intercropping in paddy fields; (D) Verifying which crops are suitable for planting (such as cotton, forests, miscellaneous crops, vegetables, etc.) and applying appropriate fertilizers; (E) Studying the rotation of crops and the timing. The depth of irrigation and other issues.

2. How to Increase Industrial Production

Modern industry in our country began in 1862 when Zeng Guofan founded the Anqing Arsenal, and Li Hongzhang founded the Manufacturing Bureau in Shanghai and Suzhou. It has been around for seventy to eighty years. In terms of its nature: it has shifted from military industry to civilian industry. In terms of the organization of its operation: it has shifted from government-run to government-private joint venture to government-supervised private operation to private operation. In terms of the process of development: the initial stage was the creation period, the early Republic of China was the prosperous period (the golden age of light industry), the period after the eleventh year of the Republic of China was the period of decline, and the period after the twenty-first year of the Republic of China was the period of revival. After the outbreak of the war in the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, it was a period of destruction. State-owned and private light industry has been severely damaged, which cannot be quantified by numbers. In terms of its characteristics: two-thirds of China's industry is handicraft production, and one-third is modern light industry. In other words, the modernization of China's industry has not yet been completed. In China's modern industry, most of the major industrial sectors are controlled by foreigners, while Chinese national capital industries are mostly in a subordinate position. For example, in the production of machinery, only 23.5% is manufactured by Chinese, and 76.5% is dependent on foreign supply. Most of China's modern industries are located in coastal or riverside cities, especially in the concessions, so they are easily constrained by foreign political and economic forces. Transportation and financial institutions are mostly operated by foreign capital, which makes domestic resources subject to foreign control and prevents the development of our own light and heavy industries. Chinese national capital is in great need of capital and high-interest loans. In terms of types, the most important industries in the country are: textile industry, food industry, chemical industry, paper industry, power industry, leather industry, oil industry, rubber industry, match industry, tobacco industry, pharmaceutical industry, and cultural industry. All of the above industries are private industries.

The author believes that for the current increase in industrial production, the prior questions are: How to formulate an economic construction plan? How to rebuild modern industry? What were the reasons for the failure and inability to increase production of modern industry in the past? What are the immediate causes of the current inability to increase production of modern industry?

Based on my humble opinion and referring to the opinions of various countries, I will briefly answer as follows:

1. Economic construction is a planned economy for the revival of a nation-state. The economic construction plan of the Soviet Union is the most obvious example in modern history. Although our country also had a four-year or five-year economic construction plan in the past, it was unfortunately not implemented. "It depends on people," which is the most important thing. Therefore, political construction and reform are still the most urgent tasks. The government must gain the trust of the people in order to effectively implement its plans. "A government without credibility cannot stand," which is a famous saying both at home and abroad. The political and economic structure of "politics belonging to officials and economy belonging to the people" can no longer exist in a modern country. In short, economic construction must be carefully planned by the government and have a thorough strategy. If the government and the people work together with one heart and go all out, it will surely be successful.

2. According to the current human, material, and financial resources of our country and the development process of modern industry, we should promote the development of light industry, especially the processing and manufacturing of local agricultural products, so that agriculture and industry can coordinate and increase production, and be generally rationalized.

3. The reasons for the failure and inability to increase production of industry in our country in the past are quite complex. I will briefly list the more important ones below: oppression by foreign economic aggression; political instability; unsound finance; capital shortage; lack of raw materials; backward technology; poor factory management; the government has no practical measures to encourage and support industry; inconvenient transportation; exorbitant taxes; and the financial community and the industrial community cannot achieve cooperation.

4. The immediate causes of the current inability to increase production or even stagnation of industry are: lack of raw materials; high cost of manufactured goods, while their prices (after price limits) are low, with no profit to be made, and there is a risk of loss, which will inevitably lead to stagnation; insufficient power, limited electricity and fuel, and production cannot be expanded; difficulty in selling manufactured goods, and weakening local purchasing power; government agencies and entrepreneurs cannot cooperate and assist; the number of technicians is decreasing day by day because factories are either shrinking or shutting down, and wages cannot keep up with the rising cost of living, which will inevitably lead to a change of profession; and insufficient food rations and rising wages for workers. The above seven points are indeed the most painful problems for manufacturers, and have a very important impact on industrial production. It is hoped that the authorities will try to find ways to remedy the situation.

For the sake of future industrial production, the author puts forward the following urgent suggestions for remedial measures. I hope readers will give their opinions on whether they are appropriate.

1. The government and financial institutions should find ways to encourage or support industries. For private light industries that are closely related to military and civilian needs, the government and financial institutions should provide financial assistance and supervise their use of domestic agricultural products in coordination with increased production. For example: cotton textile industry, chemical fertilizer industry, agricultural product processing industry, daily chemical industry, paper industry, etc. The methods of encouraging or assisting increased production are:

Financial assistance: For starting an industry, the most important thing is sufficient capital. The methods of government and financial institutions to subsidize capital are: (A) Loans: The government or financial institutions provide or lend low-interest funds, and stipulate that the loan be repaid within a certain period of time or after making a profit. (B) Guaranteeing interest or providing subsidies: The government designates certain military or civilian industries and gives interest on their capital so that those engaged in the industry do not have to worry about capital and interest expenses. In addition, the government can adopt a subsidy method to make up for the losses.

Supply of raw materials: Raw materials are the main supplies for industrial manufacturing, and most of them rely on imports from other places. If the government collects and allocates them, the prices of raw materials can be unified, transportation costs can be reduced, and all kinds of transportation troubles can be avoided, so the cost of raw materials will be lower. As a result, the products also have a fixed price, so manufacturers can also manufacture with peace of mind and obtain legitimate profits.

Technical guidance: The government should send personnel to supervise the actual situation of increased production in various factories at any time and provide guidance on the points that should be improved in technology. Secondly, the government should organize technical research institutions to invite foreign technical experts to China for research and guidance, and train technical personnel to assist various factories.

Supply of power: All modern industrial sectors need considerable power, such as electricity and fuel. The government or power supply agencies should provide sufficient power and fuel to various factories at low prices in order to reduce the cost of manufactured goods.

Transportation and Sales of Manufactured Goods: Simply having a large increase in production without being able to transport and sell it will inevitably lead to a drop in prices or create a crisis of hoarding by unscrupulous merchants. It should be purchased by the control agencies at a reasonable price. If the purchase price is lower than the cost, the result of the controlled economy will be the shutdown of industry.

2. Improving Management: The failure and low efficiency of modern industry in our country in the past were due to poor management methods. Domestic entrepreneurs only pay attention to the two departments of sales and manufacturing, and ignore the importance of management. Now, from the internal organization of various industrial sectors, scientific management methods must be implemented to improve administrative and productive efficiency. Such as the allocation of workers' working hours, the improvement of raw material procurement and operating methods, the consideration of manufacturing procedures and equipment, the layout of factory safety and health facilities, the planning and use of capital funds, the improvement of product quality and quantity, and the budget and audit of product costs are all within the scope of management.

3. Technical Improvement and Rationalization: Each factory should formulate a concrete plan and rationally coordinate the allocation of its manufacturing resources, power, and manufacturing methods to increase production. Technical improvement is a gradual process, and technical personnel must be used. Secondly, the distribution of labor, the adoption of a rotational operation system, and the coordinated production of various industrial sectors - the division of labor and cooperation system, etc. - are all closely related to increasing production.

3. Conclusion

According to the current situation of agriculture and industry in our country, it is necessary to revive and increase production. The solution to these two problems requires both short-term and long-term solutions. Therefore, the political construction and economic construction are very important and must complement each other to be successful.

Although agriculture and industry are different, they each have their own independence; however, in essence, they are mutually causal, that is, they each have their own interdependence, and neither can be overemphasized. Therefore, the increase in agricultural and industrial production urgently needs to be coordinated and coordinated with each other under a complete economic construction plan to achieve the rationalization and modernization of production.

At present, the most important thing for increasing agricultural production in our country is food. The most important thing for increasing industrial production is light industry for civilian needs. The common difficulties in increasing production in both are: the government, financial institutions, and producers cannot cooperate with each other; the national economy is in crisis; there is a lack of scientific knowledge, technology, and guidance institutions; the controlled economic structure is not perfect; the coordination of agricultural and industrial production has not reached rationalization and universalization; and transportation is difficult.

If the above problems can be remedied as soon as possible, and the government and the people work together with one heart and concentrate human, material, and financial resources and go all out, then the great cause of economic construction will be promising!

### My Views on Increasing Agricultural and Industrial Production

— Tianji

Today, if we want to suppress and stabilize prices, eliminate hoarding, stabilize people's livelihoods domestically, and assist in the construction of Greater East Asia externally, it all comes down to increasing agricultural and industrial production. Based on my observations, the following areas offer potential for increased production:

Regarding Agriculture

1. Implementing Winter Cultivation: Currently, rice prices are high. Many people in Lou County try planting wheat after the autumn harvest and set aside small vegetable plots to use as seedling beds the following year. After the wheat is harvested, they use it. In the eastern Zhejiang area, winter wheat planting is practiced, and the result is that rice yields are not reduced, and a wheat harvest is also obtained. According to scientific research, crop rotation can indeed replenish soil fertility, thus increasing harvests.

2. Utilizing Wasteland: Our country has a vast amount of wasteland, estimated at over 140 million acres. Since the Incident (likely referring to the outbreak of war), many damaged roads could now be utilized. Good farmland everywhere is overgrown with weeds. Local governments should order people to cultivate it, ensuring that no land is left uncultivated.

3. Procurement Issues: Government rice purchases are often unreasonable. Tenant farmers often sell their rice at low prices and then have to buy what they need from the market at high prices. Furthermore, large landowners often hoard their grain in warehouses, waiting for favorable prices. In the future, it is hoped that those in charge of procurement will first make a minimum provision for tenant farmers—at least enough food for a tenant farmer's family for a year. The laws must be strictly enforced against large landowners without showing favoritism. The purchase price must also consider costs, the standard of living of farmers, and profits.

4. Farm Tools and Fertilizers: China largely has a small-farm system, with land divided and cultivated. Machinery is not well-suited to this system, and rural areas are bankrupt and unable to purchase it. Therefore, very few farmers use machinery. Currently, a single ox costs as much as ten thousand gold coins, which small farmers cannot afford. They are forced to use old or weak animals or supplement their labor with human power. When tools are not efficient, how can work be done well? The urgent task is for the government to fully protect working cattle and find ways to increase their reproduction. Currently, imported fertilizers are cut off. It is essential to manufacture insecticides and chemical fertilizers and then sell them to farmers at or below cost. Water conservancy and irrigation should also be emphasized; otherwise, empty talk of increasing production will be of little use if farmers' hearts are willing but their strength is insufficient.

Regarding Industry

1. Currently, there are three major contradictory phenomena in Chinese industry:

Many factories primarily focus on profiting from stock shortages and price increases, considering product sales as a long-term prospect, even limiting production to wait for favorable prices. So-called capital increases are often used to improve the market value of the company's own stock, benefiting development. This is the first contradiction.

Recently, the government's purchase of cotton cloth has severely impacted hoarders. However, even though the purchase has been underway for a month, the distribution has been delayed. Furthermore, in Shanghai alone, many small-scale hand-weaving industries, which usually rely on black market cotton yarn for production, cannot buy it anywhere and have been forced to shut down, creating a serious social problem. This is the second contradiction.

The government promotes conservation, and electricity restrictions are very strict. Since the implementation of these restrictions, improper entertainment venues continue to operate late into the night, while industries that rely on electricity suffer greatly and cannot fully utilize machinery. Under these electricity restrictions, seeking an increase in industrial production is akin to climbing a tree to catch fish. This is the third contradiction.

The above three points are obvious. The government should quickly provide guidance, relief, and adjustments so that industry can get back on the right track. This would be fortunate for the country.

2. Reviving Handicraft Industries: While modern industry in our country has developed, rural handicraft industries still hold a dominant position. Their collapse is a recent phenomenon. Since the Incident, two-thirds of China's industry has been destroyed or relocated. In this situation, it is necessary to encourage the revival of traditional handicraft industries. There are three advantages to utilizing handicraft industries at present: (1) The development of heavy industry requires machinery, but the source of machinery has been cut off, and development cannot be completed overnight. Traditional industrial machinery is easy to manufacture, and the Chinese people can manufacture it themselves. (2) Traditional industries have not completely collapsed. They still have a presence in rural areas, making revival easy. (3) Handicraft products are simple and durable, which is very suitable for promoting thrift. Therefore, it is necessary to promote them now.

3. Focus on the Production of Essential Goods: Many Chinese entrepreneurs tend to concentrate on businesses with high profits and no risks, resulting in uneven production. In the future, the production of all industries related to the national economy and people's livelihoods should be increased. Conversely, non-essential goods, such as liquor production, foil manufacturing, cosmetics, and luxury goods, should be drastically reduced under the wartime economic system to save manpower and resources and use them for legitimate purposes.

4. Labor Issues: Labor is one of the elements of production. However, its impact on production varies depending on the workers' interest, ability, and spirit. Currently, most workers are listless, which significantly affects production. Even with joint efforts, factories still suffer losses.

## Page 12

Continued from Page Six

5. Technology: Our industrial technology is very backward. For example, in the textile industry, before the Incident, Japanese-funded yarn factories used only 240 workers per 10,000 spindles to spin 20-count yarn, while Chinese-funded yarn factories required 350-750 workers. Recently, Japanese industry has made rapid progress, while Chinese industry has regressed with little improvement. This point requires the practical guidance of technical experts from friendly nations.

6. Sufficient Supply of Raw Materials: Currently, imported raw materials have long been unavailable. The authorities should try their best to smooth the flow of domestic raw materials. The method of control should also prioritize the convenience of manufacturers in obtaining raw materials so that the industrial sector can still use its existing equipment to supply various necessities.

7. Application of the Continuous Work Week System: If fuel and raw material problems can be solved, the continuous work week system can be implemented to increase production. This method originated in Soviet Russia. Its characteristic is that workers' lives can be adequately adjusted, and factories can still produce continuously. Work is done on a five-day week basis. Within the five days of the week, workers work four days and rest one day. The government should formulate individual work week systems based on the conditions of various industries, allowing workers to take shifts and have different days off. China's industry can consider trying this method.

8. Eliminating Elaborate Decorations: Adding decorations to a finished product can certainly increase its value, but this type of work is clearly unsuitable in the current situation. Furthermore, decorated items are not as strong and durable as those that are not.

9. Incentivizing: The Japanese government recently implemented a price incentive system to promote production and increase output. The system is divided into two types: special and general. The former applies when increasing the production of specific essential materials, while the latter applies when forming individual prices based on unified cost accounting. The former is further divided into two types. One is that when the output of factories, mines, etc., exceeds the standard output, for example, when the increased output reaches 20 percent, the government will purchase the increased portion at a high price, and the price will be calculated incrementally. The other is implemented when the production time is reduced. For example, in the shipbuilding industry, the construction period for a ship is strictly set at three months. If the construction period is reduced to two months or two and a half months, and the production time is shortened, the government will also purchase the ship at a high price. This is a major measure to incentivize production. The latter is also divided into two types. One is that if a specific factory or business reduces its production costs compared to the previous period and the efficiency rate improves, an incentive system is used. The other is that if a factory's production costs are lower than the standard costs of other factories in the same industry, incentives are given based on the lower cost components. In addition, there are special incentives for various inventions, such as the invention of substitutes, the improvement of armaments, etc. As the saying goes, "Stones from other mountains can be used to polish jade." The above can also serve as a reference for us.

10. Sufficient Assistance from the Financial Sector: In peacetime, the development of a country's industry originally relies on the support of the financial sector, and this is especially true in wartime. During wartime, under unstable conditions, factory deposits are often withdrawn entirely, and external loans cannot be recovered, leading to financial difficulties. The financial sector should urgently provide loans to support the factories and fulfill their responsibilities.

In conclusion, China's agriculture and industry are still immature, and their future depends on the guidance and support of the government. It is hoped that the wise authorities can stabilize people's livelihoods domestically, suppress and stabilize prices, achieve independence and self-reliance externally, relieve the people from distress, and secure the nation's foundation. This is what I sincerely hope for.

### How to Improve the Health of the People

— Shen Siliang

On the Double Tenth Festival of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the editor of Shen Bao invited submissions on the topic of "How to Improve the Health of the People." Although I have dabbled in the sports world for years, I am limited in knowledge and experience. I will address the topic based on physical education and present my views in two points for reference.

The Impact of Physical Education

In the past, the habits of our people were often characterized by a preference for stillness and an aversion to labor. Therefore, they did not attach importance to physical education. Later, seeing that various countries around the world were becoming increasingly strong and the development of physical education was becoming more intense, while the strength of the people was becoming more prominent, they realized the importance of physical education. Thus, they made great efforts to promote it and quickly catch up. Although we are still far behind in comparison to the progress of other countries, it can be said that everyone is aware of it. Originally, the basic principle of physical education is to strengthen the body. Its impact on the body is not only to increase weight and promote muscle growth but also to develop various organs and enrich people's thoughts and spirit. For example, a person who sits at a desk all day long and does not engage in any physical activity will eventually develop a hunched back. At this time, if there is no gymnastic exercise to remedy this, the back will be weak, oxygen cannot penetrate deeply, and the tiny blood vessels at the tip of the lungs will not circulate easily, creating factors for future lung disease. Or the stomach and intestines may be subjected to compression, causing indigestion symptoms. If mental weakness and slow thinking occur, these ailments will also develop simultaneously. These occurrences, often found in our population, are truly dangerous. Therefore, during our childhood, the muscles attached to the spine should always maintain a straight posture. If such undesirable phenomenon is discovered, it should immediately be remedied with gymnastic exercise to recover. Therefore, people who advocate physical education possess endurance and persistence in their work, because after long-term exercise, they can accelerate the circulation of blood throughout the body and make the muscles contract firmly. According to reports from physiologists, athletes do not have more blood cells and platelets in their bodies than ordinary people, but the blood in athletes' bodies can accelerate and continuously transport air to the muscles. Therefore, the endurance of the muscles is almost unlimited. When people are engaged in strenuous work, they are consuming the stickiness in the muscles. When the stickiness decreases, the action of the muscles becomes sluggish, and fatigue is felt. But when athletes exercise, their muscles are constantly consuming and replenishing, circulating endlessly and have become accustomed to it. Therefore, people who exercise often feel happy at work, which is what health provides. In summary, the impact of physical education is to develop the body, and its purpose is to: 1. Strengthen various organs, 2. Strengthen muscles, 3. Improve agility.

Stages of Strengthening the Body

There are stages to strengthening the body. The appropriate exercise for youth may not be suitable for children, and the appropriate exercise for adults may not be suitable for youth. Each has the correct use for adapting to the body and cannot be forced to be the same. For example, children from six to ten years old are in the early development stage. During this period, physical education should be the goal of teaching, that is, to cultivate a lively and healthy body and mind, and to develop the inherent playfulness of children. Therefore, teaching materials should focus on games and natural activities, allowing them to develop freely, and the teaching curriculum should be a secondary subject. From the age of ten to fourteen, formal physical education courses should be given, and two hours of extracurricular exercise should be forced every day. Their physical education goal is to train the activities and skills necessary for human life, such as jumping, throwing, climbing, hanging, and running. Because at this time, their physical development is stronger than at any other time. In addition, it is best to practice swimming to help their muscles develop. A youth aged fourteen to eighteen is gradually turning towards struggle and competition, so attention should be paid to cultivating their martial spirit. The exercise goal should focus on gymnastics, track and field, ball games, competitions, and martial arts. In addition to formal physical education classes, school authorities should provide about three hours of extracurricular activities. During adolescence, outdoor activities, camping, and rural travel should also be promoted to regulate their lives. Because this period can also be said to be a dangerous period for youth, if there is no proper entertainment, they may easily go astray, which should be noted. After the age of eighteen, they should engage in military training or labor service to strengthen their muscles and bones. Before the war, Germany specially established youth camps, implemented military labor services, and forced young people to participate. There was a special department responsible for management. In addition to labor service, there were also regular exercises, normal entertainment, and gathering countless young people in one camp to cultivate national consciousness. The opportunity to exercise young people was used to carry out various construction projects, such as water conservancy projects, reclaiming wasteland, building roads, and improving agricultural products. These are the benefits of the country exercising young people, killing two birds with one stone. We can emulate this. In addition, social physical education facilities should be set up to encourage the public to learn from each other, such as public gymnasiums, swimming pools, and fitness rooms, which should be established in every city so that everyone can have the opportunity and environment to exercise. It must be known that strengthening the body is not something that can be accomplished overnight, and only by continuous effort can true health be obtained. From now on, I hope that our people will make physical education their only important task, engage in exercise, avoid sporadic and inconsistent efforts, and have the determination to persevere, so that the future of national health will be promising.

### The National Health Problem

— Qiu Wenke

Today is the 32nd National Day of the Republic of China. On this happy day, it is extremely meaningful to discuss how to improve the health of the people.

National Health and Sound Politics

Now, it is undeniable that China is filled with decadence. The people and the government are separated by a wide gap, and each is seeking their own survival. In China in its 32nd year, I ask, "Participation in the war" and "construction" cannot begin. A wise government, in order to revive the motherland, must first become one with the people, and only then can it have an effect. Therefore, before discussing the issue of improving national health, we sincerely petition the government to establish a public opinion organ so that the people can exert their full strength and make political adjustments as soon as possible. Why do we mention "improving politics" again in the discussion of improving national health? Because national health and sound politics are closely related. For example, if the people of a country are all healthy, but the politics above are very corrupt, and the people and the government do not communicate with each other, and the people do not help the government, the government is not trying their best to benefit them, how can this country survive? Therefore, while we are discussing the "national health" problem out of self-love, we also very much hope that the government will deeply reflect on itself.

Examining the Reasons for National Weakness

There is no need to mention the past, but observing the present, eight out of ten people in the country have become ill. The most common diseases are stomach disease and lung disease. Why are there so many people suffering from these two diseases? Because there are those who eat too much and those who do not eat enough. It is just like what Mr. Yoshida Tosuke said in his Shen Bao Weekly Review on September 19, "On Chinese Meals": "...In this family where there are few middle class people, there is a class that specializes in eating Chinese meals (referring to four cold dishes, four hot dishes, ten main courses, dim sum, and one soup - note by the author). At the same time, there is a beggar class that survives by eating their leftovers. There are particularly more of these people than in any other country...While the Chinese boast that Chinese meals are the best in the world in terms of quantity and variety, the number of beggars who survive by eating leftovers cannot be considered the best in the world..." Therefore, the stomachs of the upper class are overstuffed, and the stomachs of the beggar class are too lacking in nourishment. Both have lost their normal function and become stomach diseases. The people who suffer from lung diseases have the same reasons as those who suffer from stomach diseases. Middle-class people are engrossed in smoking and drinking all night long, their lives are irregular, and their mental and physical strength is exhausted, and they become ill over time. The people of the beggar class not only suffer from severe malnutrition but also gather and live in small alleys and slums, their characters are degraded, the air is dirty, and they suffer from various forms of oppression, which leads to mental fatigue and lack of strength. These are the biggest causes of tuberculosis. In short, national weakness is caused by too unequal a phenomenon.

Promptly Implementing a "Self-Love" Movement

The two most common causes of illness mentioned above can only be quickly cured by the power of the government. For example, banning smoking and gambling, forcing frugality, encouraging sports, rewarding production, increasing household food and rations of daily necessities are all good medicines for the disease. Unfortunately, the government is not actively doing these things and lets the disease spread freely. Because we recognize that the national health problem is urgent and must be resolved quickly, we can only passively advocate the "self-love" movement and persuade the people to abstain from smoking and gambling and focus on nourishing their bodies. If this movement can be promoted, at least it can maintain some of the country's vitality.

How to Improve the Health of Young People

I am young and have limited experience, so I can only discuss the topic from a small perspective and focus on modern young people, regardless of their wealth, as the subject of discussion. Young friends, before discussing the topic, we should grasp the two words "self-love" tightly as the basis for discussing the topic. Because if we do not do this, this topic cannot be discussed. Now that we are talking about how to improve our health for the sake of self-love, we should immediately reflect on ourselves whether we are standing on the path of depravity or stepping on the path of advancement. If we belong to the former, we should suddenly turn around, repent sincerely, and implement our "self-love" movement; if we belong to the latter, we should work harder, be brave and diligent, and always stand in the position of the vanguard of the "self-love" movement.

The Specific Method of Implementing the Self-Love Movement Here we have one kind of negative health preservation and one kind of active fitness.

Negative Health Preservation

Because we are all standing under the creed of "self-love," the rules of health preservation are very strict: 1. Do not smoke (smoking is harmful to the heart, trachea, and brain nerves). 2. Do not drink alcohol (alcohol is harmful to the central nervous system, eyesight, stomach, and heart. However, some people say that drinking a little alcohol can harmonize the blood and keep warm, but young people are often sharp and competitive and drink boldly as a glorious thing, which ultimately harms their bodies, so young people should not drink alcohol). 3. Do not dance (music can cultivate temperament, but there are many people flowing in and out of the dance hall, and the good and bad are mixed. Pure young people are lured by material enjoyment or impulsed by sexual desire and lose their minds, so dancing is harmful to thrift and body and mind). 4. Do not gamble (those who like to gamble cannot talk about self-love at all because gambling makes people stimulate their nerves to the extreme day and night, and eventually their spirits are injured and their ambitions are abandoned, so gamblers are irrational animals). 5. Eat only until you are not hungry for three meals a day. Even with this one scoop of rice and one drink, we should be content and happy to receive it to avoid material distress and sadness. Drink at least four large glasses of water every day, especially before going to bed, you must drink a glass of boiled water to ensure that the bowels are open the next morning. Eight hours of sleep is the most standard. When sleeping, all thoughts are abandoned and no reverie is allowed to avoid insomnia. Walk for half an hour in the setting sun to exercise your muscles and bones and feel refreshed. If you can follow the above five rules without fail, not only will you not get sick all year round, but you can also extend your life for many years.

Active Fitness

If you want to train your body into a bronze muscle iron bone, you must first practice the above five rules; otherwise, if you do not maintain your health properly, you will have wasted your efforts in exercising. Secondly, exercising the body depends on perseverance, diligence, and unremitting efforts to succeed. There are many kinds of fitness methods, among which the easiest to achieve quickly and the most interesting are physical exercises. However, in Shanghai, only the YMCA Fitness Room, the Times Gymnasium, the Shanghai Fitness Academy, and the Jingwu Athletic Association have perfect equipment for this exercise. The number is too small, and the venues are small, so this exercise has not been popularized to this day. However, we can buy one or two pairs of 5-pound and 10-pound dumbbells and use them for stretching exercises at one o'clock every morning. This has unexpected magical effects on enhancing arm strength and developing the chest. In this way, after training for a year or so, we can partner with four or five "bodybuilding" comrades, organize a small fitness club, add equipment, and encourage each other. In this way, physical exercises can become popular.

The Health of Young People and the Vitality of the Country

As the saying goes, "Young people are full of vitality." This vitality is the concrete manifestation of young people's "activity." A strong youth must be matched with a strong will to express that lively energy. However, a strong will should be based on a correct outlook on life and society to be used to its fullest extent. A correct outlook on life and society is to find justice in humanity. The Founding Father (Sun Yat-sen) was able to revolutionize for forty years without being discouraged because he based his strong will on a correct outlook on life. Therefore, we young people, in addition to fighting in the contradictory life to maintain and enhance our vitality, should actively use our vitality in this turbulent era to fight for freedom, equality, and fraternity to the end. Only then can our China eliminate decadence and establish vitality.

### Overview of the Origins and Development of Chinese Painting

— Liu Haisu

Introduction

Mr. Liu Haisu studies Western painting, and is particularly skilled in Chinese painting, his painting skills are superb, and his reputation is world-renowned. In the past, he collected masterpieces of Chinese painting from various dynasties, photographed them, and made printing plates, which were compiled into a giant volume according to the chronological order of his family's birth, which was quite impressive, but unfortunately it was hindered for some reason and was not immediately published. Recently, this newspaper has bound it into a book, named "A Mirror of Famous Paintings of Pu Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties", and it is scheduled to be published today on National Day. At the beginning of this book, Mr. Liu wrote an article summarizing the origins and development of Chinese painting, totaling eight thousand words, covering the history of Chinese painting from beginning to end, without leaving anything out. It is not only suitable for those who aspire to painting, but also for those who care about national essence. Therefore, we will publish the entire article, just to add a touch of color to this National Day celebration.

Our country's painting began with hieroglyphs, where writing and painting were not separated. Through the Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, painting was established as separate from the "Four Arts" [琴棋書畫 - music, chess, calligraphy, and painting]. Zhang Heng and Cai Yong of the Han dynasty were both famous for their paintings, and although we have not seen their broad works, their names are already evident in historical records. By the time of the Wei, Jin, and Six Dynasties, Buddhism was introduced into China, and Chinese culture ushered in a new era. At that time, Buddhist paintings flowed into China, and we were quite able to absorb their strengths, and the so-called new art was produced. Famous artists emerged at this time, with elegant styles and divine inspiration, and the style of painting changed greatly. The most notable were Cao Buxing of Wu, Wei Xie of Jin, Gu Kaizhi, Lu Tanwei of Song, Xie He of the Southern Qi, Zhang Sengyao of Liang, Zhan Ziqian and Dong Boren of Sui, and Zheng Fashi, all of whom were talented and learned, and could use objects without being used by them. Lu, Zhang, and Zhan were notably called the Four Ancestors of painting.

Wei and Jin Dynasties

The paintings of the Wei, Jin, Southern, and Northern Dynasties gained nourishment from foreign thoughts and formats combined with the inherent spirit of the people. They suddenly presented an extremely healthy and full development, until the flourishing Tang Dynasty. The country was prosperous, the politics enlightened, and the articles and poems became the essence of the country; painting also advanced to the highest and most perfect realm. Su Shi inscribed on Wu Daozi's painting: "The wise create things, and the capable describe them, which cannot be done by one person alone. The gentleman in learning, and the craftsmen in art, from the Three Dynasties through the Han to the Tang, are complete. Therefore, poetry reached Du Zimei, writing reached Han Tuizhi, and painting reached Wu Daozi. The changes of ancient and modern times, and the abilities of the world, are exhausted." Su Shi had such a vision and review of Chinese culture, which was insightful. Tang paintings inherited from the Wei, Jin, and Six Dynasties, and opened up the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties; ghosts and gods, Taoism and Buddhism, figures, palaces, mountains and rivers, dragons and fish, livestock and beasts, flowers and birds, nothing was not complete, and nothing was not beautiful. Wu Daoxuan's figures are absolutely unsurpassed for a hundred generations; landscapes, trees, and rocks also opened up the Southern Song. The Yan brothers, "establishing virtue and establishing oneself," were the leaders of the time. Others such as Zhang Xuan's noble sons, Gu Hongzhong's ladies, Cao Ba and Han Gan's horses, Dai Song's oxen, Xue Ji's cranes, and Wei Yan's pine and rocks, were all specialized and reached their peaks. The division of landscapes into Northern and Southern Schools was rare in the early Tang Dynasty, and only became popular in the later period. Li Sixun and Wang Wei began to advocate pure landscape painting. Li Sixun's school emphasized fine and strong brushwork, opening up the method of blue-green color painting. Wang Wei's school emphasized unrestrained brushwork, creating the style of ink wash rendering. The trend of the times led to the development of their own unique spirits, and Chinese landscape painting thus had the division of the Northern and Southern Schools. Li Sixun was the head of the Northern School, and Wang Wei was the ancestor of the Southern School. Dong Qichang of the Ming Dynasty said: "The Chan sect has two schools, North and South, which began to be divided in the Tang Dynasty. The North and South Schools of painting were also divided in the Tang Dynasty. However, the people are not from the North and South. The Northern School is represented by Li Sixun and his son, who paint colored landscapes, which were passed down to Zhao Gan, Zhao Boju, and Zhao Bofu of the Song Dynasty. As for Ma Yuan, Xia Gui and others, the Southern School is represented by Wang Wei, who first used rendering to change the method of hooking and cutting, which was passed down to Zhang Zao, Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Guo Zhongshu, the Mi family father and son, and the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty..." The Northern School embodies changes in rigor, the brush is solid and the spirit is condensed, and the aura is particularly thick. The Southern School gradually gets rid of traces, the brush is unrestrained, and the aura is elegant and free. Li Sixun was a member of the Tang Dynasty clan and once served as General of the Wuwei, so he was called General Li. His son Zhaodao was meticulous in drawing boundaries, and the world called him Little Li. Wang Wei lived in Wangchuan, and wrote secret formulas for painting, saying: "In the way of painting, ink is the best, creating the nature of nature and achieving the function of creation." His artistic view can be seen in general. Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty said: "Tasting Wang Wei's poems, there is painting in the poems, and looking at Wang Wei's paintings, there is poetry in the paintings." He can be said to be a keen appraiser. Those who were influenced by Wang Wei include Lu Hong and Zheng Qian. Lu Hong lived in seclusion in Mount Song, and was known as a hermit of Mount Song. Zheng Qian was a poetry friend of Li Bai and Du Fu; Du Fu's poem said that "Lord Zheng's building scattered silk, and after drinking, he often called himself an old painter". Wang Qia's splashed ink landscapes also had a unique style. Xiang Rong and Bi Hong's pine breeze and spring stones were also great achievements in the art world.

At the end of the Tang Dynasty and the Five Dynasties, disasters followed each other, and the years were quite long. The painting academy was not as prosperous as in the Tang Dynasty, but there were also many masters who surpassed the past and present. Jing Hao and Guan Tong's landscapes, Xu Xi, Xu Chongsi, Huang Quan, Huang Jucai, Zhou Wenju, Zhao Chang, Yi Yuanji's flowers and birds, and Guan Xiu's Buddhist images and strange beasts, were all unsurpassed for a hundred generations and were masters of painting.

Two Songs

Painting reached the Five Dynasties, inheriting the simplicity of the Tang Dynasty, and newly opening up the body of transcendence, elegance, and exquisiteness. When the people of the Song Dynasty came out, they gathered their great achievements. Therefore, painting in the Song Dynasty was more prosperous than in the Tang Dynasty, and it was indeed the golden age in the history of Chinese art. In 976 AD, Emperor Taizong of the Song Dynasty ordered the world to search for famous works, and set up a secret pavilion in the Chongwen Academy to treasure famous paintings of ancient and modern times. By the time of Emperor Huizong, he ordered the compilation of the Xuanhe Painting Manual, collecting the paintings in the palace, totaling 6,396 scrolls, and analyzing them into ten categories according to the types of paintings. The Song Dynasty paid attention to painting, and it lasted for three hundred years without decline. There were many geniuses, and schools arose.

The landscape paintings of the Song Dynasty surpassed those of the Tang Dynasty. Talents emerged, and they became unique in ancient and modern times, and were most representative of the art of China's prosperous era. Tracing back to the landscape paintings of the early Tang Dynasty, they were only detached from the background of ancient figures and became independent, and their art had not yet reached its peak. Since Wang Wei, Zhang Zao, Bi Hong, and Zheng Qian and others came out, they deeply studied their principles; in the Five Dynasties, Jing Hao and Guan Tong also came up with new ideas and washed away the old habits. By the time of Dong Yuan, Li Cheng, and Fan Kuan of the Song Dynasty, the three families stood side by side, opening up the forms and bone methods that the Tang people did not have, and their painting style influenced later generations and has not been abandoned to this day. Dong Qichang said: "Song paintings reached the point of painting giant landscapes, completely getting rid of the habit of being trivial and detailed, and all using ink to dye the clouds, with the momentum of swallowing and changing. Jing Hao and Guan Tong have both brush and ink; Dong Yuan and Ju Ran have both brush and ink, but it is as if there is no brush and no ink. Li Cheng of Yingqiu and Fan Kuan of Huayuan stand between Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran. At that time, it was said that Dong Yuan got the spirit of the mountains, Li Cheng got the marrow appearance, and Fan Kuan got the bone method, exhausting the changes. The Southern School reached this point, and it was almost divine. Guan Tong's disciple Wang Duan, and Yingqiu's disciples Song Di, Xu Daoning, and Guo Xi all got one of his styles, and they were already outstanding masters. Gao Keming did not reach the level of Dong Yuan and Li Cheng, but he was also called a worthy talent. Guo Zhongshu's several peaks were outside the sky, and they were formed by washing ink, which was even more strange than Wang Qia's splashed ink. Mi Fu's source came from Dong Yuan, and he did not fall into stereotypes. He claimed that he did not have a bit of Wu Daozi's habits." His words can best clarify the position and value of Song Dynasty landscape paintings. The highest ideals of the Song people for nature and life were all realized in landscape paintings.

Dong Yuan's color followed Li Sixun, and his ink was similar to Wang Wei, but he came out of his own mind, with varied rendering and dripping ink, and was indeed the ancestor of Mi Fu's paintings. Those who passed on his method include Ju Ran, Jiang Can, Xiao Zhao, Liu Daoshi, and others. Huang Gongwang, Ni Zan, and Wang Meng of the Yuan Dynasty also distantly followed the spirit of Beiyuan. Li Cheng combined blue and green ink into one, and Guo Xi also liked to do so. The painters of the painting academy competed to follow his method. His school was not only followed by Xu Daoning, Song Di, Guo Xi, Gao Keming, Yan Wengui, and others, but its origin flowed to the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. Fan Kuan first studied Li Cheng, and then studied Jing Hao. Then he sighed and said, "It is better to learn from nature than to learn from people." Therefore, he lived in the mountains of Zhongnan and Taishi for ten years, witnessing the changes of clouds and smoke, shade and sunshine, and then got rid of his old habits and gained the natural interest alone; he was especially good at snow mountains, which made people shiver when they saw them. In his later years, he used heavy ink, and he liked to make dense forests on the top of the mountain. Those who passed on his painting school include Guo Zhongshu and Tian Zongyuan.

Commentators say that the landscape paintings of the Song Dynasty surpassed those of the Tang Dynasty, and there are the above three schools. The leaders of the schools all had their own unique talents, which could not be concealed by the ancients. When Mi Fu and his son Youren came out, they created their own techniques, painting cloud mountains with magical changes, and their names shook the times. He once said: "After Bo Shi's right hand was sick, I began to paint. Li Gonglin often took Wu Daozi as his teacher, but he could not get rid of his habits. I then took the ancients, and did not allow a single stroke to enter Wu Daozi." He also said that the landscapes of ancient and modern times were similar to each other, and there were few transcendent styles, so he did it with a brush, mostly with smoke and clouds, and the gods of great air fluctuations. Dong Qichang said: "Poetry reached Du Fu, calligraphy reached Yan Zhenqing, and painting reached the two Mis. The changes of ancient and modern times, and the abilities of the world, are exhausted." How true are these words!

The academy style was created in the Five Dynasties, with fine workmanship and elegance, and meticulous rules. At the end of the Northern Song Dynasty and the beginning of the Gaozong era, the brothers Zhao Boju and Bofu inherited the legacy of the Northern Song Dynasty and carried it forward. Their brushwork was as fine as cow hair, extremely delicate, ingenious, and neat, thus establishing a new banner for the Southern Song Dynasty painting academy. Li Tang, Liu Songnian, Ma Yuan, and Xia Gui were called the Four Masters of the Southern Crossing. Commentators say that their workmanship is too skillful, and they do not pay much attention to them.

The Taoist and Buddhist figure paintings of the two Songs were influenced by the academy paintings, and their style became increasingly refined. Famous artists such as Sun Mengqing, Sun Zhiwei, Chen Yongzhi, Feng Qing, and Li Derou were able to get rid of the constraints of Indian paintings and form their own school in their Buddhist paintings. The most peculiar was the monk Muqi, who was good at light ink Guanyin, dragons and tigers, flowers and birds, and was capable of everything. His ink was as colorful as paint. Jia Shigu learned the neat and skillful style of Li Gonglin, which was passed down to Liang Kai. Liang Kai also created a new style of reduced-brush painting, creating landscapes, figures, Buddhist and Taoist gods, apes and other pictures. His use of ink was ancient and could not be reached.

It is difficult to combine all six principles of painting. After Wu Daozi, only Li Gonglin was able to combine them. Gonglin's Buddhist images directly approached Wu Daozi, and his landscapes were clear and beautiful, and were the true biography of Wang Wei. His colored landscapes were also like Li Sixun, and he especially liked to paint galloping horses and flying dragons, and he was indeed able to gather the great achievements of various schools.

Since the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan and Xu Xi have each established new banners for flower and bird paintings, which flourished in the Song Dynasty. Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty was a genius, with clear and strong outlines, and ancient and beautiful colors. As for the ink plays of literati, they mostly created withered trees, plum blossoms, orchids, bamboos, and chrysanthemums, and their brushstrokes were unrestrained in the desolate and uninhabited realm, and Wen Tong and Su Shi were the most famous.

Yuan Dynasty

The Yuan Dynasty, as a foreign race, ruled China. Although there was no painting academy, painting was very prosperous. It inherited the legacy of the previous dynasties, and opened up the new style of painting in the Ming, Qing, and modern times; it especially advocated a light, leisurely, and detached style. If we analyze the history of Chinese painting by ancient, middle, and modern times, and seek the path of its artistic development and evolution, and examine its relics, then we should separate the period before the Han Dynasty as ancient, the Six Dynasties to the Tang, Song, and Yuan as middle, and the Ming and Qing as modern. The paintings before the Tang Dynasty are not easy to see; therefore, those who talk about ancient paintings always say Song and Yuan. Although the Hu people destroyed the Song Dynasty, and the Manchus destroyed the Ming Dynasty, they only gained political power for a while, and there was no obstacle to the development of culture and art. Therefore, the Yuan Dynasty inherited the style of the Song Dynasty, and the Qing Dynasty led the style of the Ming Dynasty. Han culture continued to advance, and the Hu and Man people were instead assimilated. Is not the power of the Han people to interact with people so great! As for the paintings of the Yuan Dynasty, the most famous of the works passed down today are Zhao Mengfu, Gao Kegong, Qian Xuan, and Wang Ruoshui. Zhao Mengfu was proficient in both calligraphy and painting, and invented the theory that calligraphy and painting have the same origin. His ancient and subtle figures, horses, landscapes, and bamboo and stones deeply captured the interest of the Jin and Tang Dynasties. Dong Qichang said: "Zhao Mengfu's painting style has the charm of the Tang people, removing its delicacy; and has the magnificence of the Northern Song Dynasty, removing its roughness." His wife Guan Daosheng, son Zhongmu, brother Zhongguang, and Zhongmu's sons Yunwen and Yanwei were all famous for a time, and it was a beautiful story in the art world. Gao Kegong inherited the style of Mi Fu in the Northern Song Dynasty, and was good at light ink landscapes; Qian Xuan and Wang Yuan were the masters of flowers and birds. Qian Xuan admired the style of Zhao Chang and Yi Yuanji, and was a master of Xu Xi's style; Wang Yuan specialized in the elegance of Huang Quan's style. If they can inherit the works of their predecessors, and show future generations the classics. As for the orchids and bamboos of Li Xizhai and Ke Jiusi after Zhao Mengfu, they are also branches of Su Shi and Wen Tong.

When the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty Huang Gongwang, Wang Meng, Ni Zan, and Wu Zhen came out, they used their lofty and unrestrained brushstrokes to express the mountains and valleys in their hearts, remotely following the methods of Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran, and closely taking the meaning of Yingqiu and Huayuan; thus, they became the ultimate expression of landscape painting in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Huang Gongwang had two painting styles in his life: one that was made with light ochre, with mountains mostly made of stones, and the brushstrokes were vigorous and thick; and one that was made with ink, with extremely sparse wrinkles. In Huang Gongwang's quiet, simple, and distant strokes, he felt the joy of life. The predecessors also said: "Entrusting happiness to painting began with Huang Gongwang." Wu Zhen created the method of wet dot moss, gaining the essence of the Song people; therefore, his brushstrokes were bold and free, without a bit of worldly air. Wang Meng was the nephew of Zhao Mengfu, and his painting style was very similar to that of his uncle. He was also influenced by Wang Wei, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran's ink methods; his brushwork also evolved from Guo Xi's rolled cloud wrinkles, with bright and pleasant colors. His works mostly have overlapping peaks, winding paths, and misty clouds, which fully express the secluded charm. Ni Zan said that his brush strength could lift a tripod, and there has been no such person in five hundred years, which is believable. Among the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty, Ni Zan's works have the highest quality and can be called the most extreme literati paintings. He once said: "What I call painting is nothing more than casual brushstrokes, not seeking to resemble, just to entertain myself." He is the only one after Mi Fu who is ancient, plain, and innocent. Looking at his paintings is like passing through gardens, forests, and valleys, and ascending to the fairyland of Penglai. Today's people only focus on the complexity or simplicity of imitating Ni Zan, which is superficial.

Ming Dynasty

The Zhu Ming Dynasty unified the world after the Hu Yuan, and continued the legacy of the Zhao Song Dynasty. The imperial court re-established the painting academy, and Bian Wenjin, Fan Huan, and others used flowers and birds, and Guo Chun used landscapes, and were summoned to serve in the Yongle Inner Hall. The Xuande Painting Academy was the most prosperous period of the Ming Dynasty, echoing the Xuanhe and Shaoxing periods of the Song Dynasty. The talents of the painting academy included Xie Huan, Shang Xi, Dai Jin, Li Zai, and Zhou Wenjing, who all served directly in the Renzhi Hall. Dai Jin's unique skills can be called the famous hand of the Ming Dynasty. Lin Liang and Lin Chun's father and son were masters of the freehand school in the painting academy. During the Chenghua period, Wu Wei, Lu Ji, and Lu Wenying all served directly in the Renzhi Hall. Wu Wei was praised for his paintings and was awarded the title of Jinyi Hundred Household and the title of Number One Scholar in Painting. Lu Ji and Lu Wenying were called Big Lu and Little Lu; Zhang Yi was also famous in the Hongzhi Painting Academy. During the Zhengde period, there were Wang E and Zhu Duan, who both served directly in the Renzhi Hall. Wang E was called Ma Yuan of the time. At the beginning of the Wanli period, Wang Yance entered the painting academy, and Gu Bing served in the Inner Hall. The influence of the Ming Dynasty painting academy was no less than that of the Song Dynasty, but its painting style was no longer that of the Song and Yuan Dynasties.

The landscape paintings of the Ming Dynasty collected the styles of Wang Wei and others, Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Yingqiu, the two Mis, Zhao Mengfu, Gao Kegong, and even the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty. Those who have the typical literati style are called the Wu School. Since Dong Qichang and Shen Hao, this school has been called the Southern School, and it is regarded as the painting of literati and scholar-officials. The Zhejiang School, Dai Jin, and the academy style Zhou Chen are named the Northern School. And it is said that the academy style has strange and steep bones, dry and hard strokes, and has the Zen of wild foxes, which is not what we should learn. This is the view of the school, not a definite argument. The division of paintings into North and South Schools probably started with Dong Qichang. However, since the Tang Dynasty, how can the landscape paintings of the past dynasties be exhausted by this one or two changes! The two major systems divided by Dong Qichang may not have seen this. Even if ink is said to be the characteristic of the Southern School, how can the Northern School, Ma Yuan and Xia Gui, not specialize in ink; the plain and unrestrained composition and coloring are the beauty of both the North and South Schools. The world calls Li Sixun the general, and he is also a scholar-official painter. Looking at the Northern School painters of the past, they are all literati; the Southern School painters, who take painting as a career, are also often seen. Therefore, the difference and evaluation of the North and South Schools are the result of the infighting between the Wu School and the Zhejiang School in the Ming Dynasty. It is really the view of the school in the Han and Song Dynasties, and the literati despise each other, which has been the case since ancient times. Literati commented on paintings, favoring the South and degrading the North, and the trend was extremely prosperous for a time. Shen Zhou and Wen Zhengming were highly regarded in the art world, so there were few who called the Wu School; because most of the great masters of this school were from Wu. After the Jiajing period, Dong Qichang and Chen Jiru and others came out, inheriting the legacy of Shen Zhou and Wen Zhengming, and carrying it forward with all their strength, thus forming a major trend of thought in the history of Chinese painting, and the Zhejiang School had almost no foothold. After the Wanli period, Dong Qichang unified the painting world, and the influence was continuous throughout the Qing Dynasty, and its momentum can be seen in general. Shen Zhou's talent was outstanding, and he obtained it from nature, so he was able to exhaust the mysteries of famous artists from the Tang and Song Dynasties for thousands of years. Wang Chideng praised Shen Zhou and said: "Stop! How brilliant! Mr. Shen's works gather great achievements, and are they the ones who gather the sounds of metal and jade!" Wen Zhengming also came out of Shen Zhou's school, and his landscapes combined the strengths of Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Zhao Mengfu, and Ni Zan, and his spirit and charm were superior. Although he was very similar to Zhao Mengfu, he had a kind of clear, harmonious, and leisurely interest. Commentators said that this was due to his noble character. Wen Zhengming was friendly with Wu Kuan, Zhu Yunming, and Tang Yin, and they were like one day for thirty years; his sons Pengjia and Zibo Ren, were all excellent in calligraphy and painting, and the family learning was inherited, which can be said to be prosperous.

Zhou Chen was a transition from the academy style to the Wu School of painting style. The figures were ancient and strange, and the landscape was steep, directly chasing Li Tang; Tang Yin and Qiu Ying were both from his school. Tang Yin's landscapes and figures were all wonderful, and he obtained the methods of Liu Songnian and Li Xigu. His brushstrokes were delicate and meticulous, and he had a charm. He was able to follow the rules and principles, and sharply come out of the natural mechanism. Since those who learn from the Northern School have a writer's habit, Tang Yin alone contains the essence, and his childlike innocence fills the paper. He is actually a follower of the Northern School with the appearance of the Southern School. In addition, there are Wang Mian and Wang Yi, who are literati and scholars who are good at artistic affairs. Wang Mian's paintings of plum blossoms and bamboos are clear, beautiful, ancient, and lofty. Wang Yi's landscapes followed the style of Huang He, and his distant mountains on the Yangtze River, strange stones, and cliffs were called the first at the time. Next to him was Xia Chang, the Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, who was famous for his ink bamboo, and his literary name was well-known. During the Jiajing and Wanli periods, there were Qian Gu, Xiang Yuanbian, Sun Kehong, Mo Shilong, Xu Wei, Zhou Tianqiu, Xie Shichen, Lu Zhi, Zhao Diguang, Wang Siqian, Zhang Ruitu, Li Shida, Li Liufang, Mi Wanzhong, Sheng Maoye, Wu Bin, and others, who were too many to count. Qian Shubao's poems, books, and paintings were all instructed by Wen Zhengming, and his strokes and moss dots were calm and meticulous. Xiang Molin was erudite and knowledgeable, and was good at appreciation and rich in collections. His landscapes, orchids, and bamboos were light and elegant, and had an unrestrained interest. Mo Yunqing and Gao Jie were otherworldly. Sun Xueju's landscapes, flowers, and plants were all wonderful. Xu Tianchi splashed ink dripping, and his brushstrokes were unrestrained. Zhou Tianqiu wrote poems and had the air of a painting scroll. Xie Shichen's method of painting stones was varied and varied. Li Changheng's landscapes had a clear and elegant atmosphere, and his unrestrained spirit was flying; he was called the Four Gentlemen of Jiading together with Tang Shisheng, Lou Jian, and Cheng Jiasui. Wu Wenzhong's brushstrokes were meticulous, and his strength was elegant. His character was high, so his art was naturally free of vulgarity. There are very few landscapes handed down, so they are very precious. Mi Wanzhong and Zhang Ruitu's Cangrun, Lu Baoshan's Qiqiao, and Li Shida's Puhou were all able to establish their own styles and separate from Wen Zhengming. Others such as Jiang Song and Zhang Lu's learning of the Song and Yuan Dynasties was inevitably wild, and was not admired by the world, so the Huating School followed. The leader of the Huating School was Dong Qichang. Dong Qichang was a high-ranking official in the Ministry of Rites, and his posthumous title was Wenzhen. At that time, his books and paintings were all called unsurpassed, surpassing Zhao Mengfu, so his strokes had a chic and outstanding outline. His paintings were neither Song nor Yuan, and he reversed the times. He was better than the Yuan sages Zhu Derun and Tang Zi. Hua was better than Cao Yunxi and Qian Xuan, with a vast and ancient style, and his bones were beautiful and developed. His ink method was especially unique. He was good at rhythm. He once said: "Charm cannot be learned, it is known by birth, and it is naturally endowed; however, there is also a place to learn, read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles, get rid of dust and turbidity in the chest, and naturally build mountains and valleys, and immediately become rugged, and write it out at hand, all for landscape painting." Those who imitated Dong Qichang, from Zhao Wendu down, there were dozens of families, all at the same time as Dong. Dong Qichang was called the Four Masters of the Ming Dynasty along with Shen Zhou, Wen Zhengming, and Tang Yin. From the Wanli period to the Chongzhen period, there were Chen Jiru, Cheng Jiasui, Ni Yuanlu, Yun Xiang, Huang Daozhou, Yang Wencong, Qi Biaojia, Song Xu, Shen Shichong, Gu Zhengyi, Bian Wenyu, Shao Mi, Wang Jianzhang, and others. Chen Meigong was unrestrained and elegant, his brushstrokes were vast and simple, and he did not eat human fireworks. Cheng Mengyang was erudite and had a high character, and his landscapes followed the style of Huang Gongwang, and he was known for his plumpness. Ni Yuanlu and Huang Daozhou were both known in the world for their poems, books, and calligraphy, and their landscapes, pine trees, and rocks were ancient and unconventional, and did not eat human fireworks. "The river flows outside the heavens and the earth, and the colors of the mountains are in the midst of nothingness." Only those who understand this poem can appreciate the paintings of Ni Yuanlu and Huang Daozhou. Yang Wencong was also known for his landscapes, bamboos, and rocks. The three families were all martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country in the late Ming Dynasty, and their integrity and articles were shining in the world, so their handwriting was especially valued by the world, and only with a great personality can there be great art. Yun Xiang's landscapes came from Dong Yuan and formed their own family. Qi Biaojia learned poetry and books from Dong Qichang, and his paintings were quite neat. Zhao Wendu followed the style of Song Xu. Shen Shichong came from Zhao Wendu's school, and his calligraphy and painting had the interest of smoke and clouds changing. The above families who have trained in the Su Song School, Gu Zhengyi and others, are called the Huating School, and all have the style of Dong Qichang. Bian Wenyu's landscapes, trees, and rocks have an ancient meaning, and Shao Gua Chou and Wang Jianzhang are both good at calligraphy and painting. Dong Xuanzai was ranked first in Wu Meicun's Song of Nine Friends in Painting, and Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Li Liufang, Yang Wencong, Cheng Jiasui, Zhang Xuehui, Bian Wenyu, Shao Mi and others all belonged to it. From this, there is another distinction between the Yunjian School and the Loudong School in the Wu School. Wang Lutai said: "Most of the painters in the late Ming Dynasty were unrestrained and elegant, and established their own halls, changing the appearance of the Song and Yuan Dynasties." Is it not true!

In addition to the freehand ink painting schools of Bian Wenjin and Lu Ji, and Lin Liang's father and son, there are Shen Zhou, Chen Chun, Lu Zhi, and Zhou Zhimian in the Ming Dynasty. Shen Zhou's flowers and plants are light and boneless, and the colors and ink are all complete, forming a separate style, which is the beginning of the literati school of flowers and plants in the Ming Dynasty. Chen Baiyang, Lu Baoshan, and Zhou Zhimian all came from Shen Zhou. Xu Wei, mentioned earlier, also created many flowers and plants, and was as magical as Chen Chun, and was unrestrained and elegant.

In figure painting, there were Jiang Zicheng before, and then there was Ruan Fu. During the Wanli period, there were Ding Yunpeng, Wu Bin, and Wu Tingyu. Ding NanYu was erudite and capable, and was good at the white drawing of Buddhist images and Arhats. Wu Wenzhong was also good at white drawing Arhats, so the twenty-five round diagrams collected by the palace are simple, primitive, and exquisite, and they are lifelike. The first great master of figure painting in the Ming Dynasty was Qiu Ying. Qiu Ying was the most skilled in ladies and genre paintings, and his arrangements were appropriate, and the scenes were lifelike, which was a new style in figure painting. As for buildings, flags, chariots, saddles, horses, and the like, they were also extremely precise and vivid, not inferior to Zhao Mengfu. There are not many who can pass on Qiu Ying's paintings, except for his daughter Du Lingneishi. You Qiu, Cheng Huan, and Shi Rui were all influenced by him. By the end of the Ming Dynasty, Cui Zizhong and Chen Hongshou came out and created a new style of figure painting. They were called Southern Chen and Northern Cui at the time, and they were the great masters of figure painting after Qiu Ying, and they opened a new era of figure painting in the Qing Dynasty. The famous person for portraiture was Zeng Jing, who caused a sensation for a while. In the tenth year of Wanli, the Italian priest Matteo Ricci came to the dynasty and was able to paint the image of the Virgin Mary. Zeng Jing then reconciled his method and created portraits, which is the so-called Bocen school of portraiture.

Qing Dynasty

When the Manchus entered the pass and ruled China, the system and culture mostly followed the old Ming Dynasty, and the artistic trend of thought also continued the legacy of the previous generations. Since Shen Zhou and Wen Zhengming in the Ming Dynasty, the Wu School flourished. Dong Qichang and Chen Jiru rose up, and their great reputation suppressed the art world. The theory of painting still favored the South and degraded the North, which was popular for a while. Therefore, in the Qing Dynasty, the art world was dominated by the Southern School for almost three hundred years, which was not without reason. Only in the late Ming Dynasty and early Qing Dynasty, the Zhejiang School's inheritance was carried on, and the crudeness of Jiang Song and others was washed away, opening up the beautiful style of vigor, solidity, precision, and research in Qing Dynasty landscape painting. The one who was the driving force of the Zhejiang School and emerged prominently was Lan Ying. His son Lan Tao, Lan Meng, and Yu Zhiding all passed on his painting style. In addition to the Zhejiang School, there is also the Yuan School, which specializes in the painting of buildings, namely Yuan Jiang and Yuan Yao, Yuan Xue, who were court painters during the Yongzheng period. After the three families, it has become a thing of the past.

The Zhejiang School has declined and declined, and the Wu School has reached the extreme of change in the early Qing Dynasty, so the Southern School is unified. The most famous in the Qing Dynasty painting world are the Six Great Masters of the early Qing Dynasty. Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Yuanzhao, and Wang Hui all inherited Dong Qichang. Wang Shimin exhausted the mysteries of Huang Gongwang, and the world said that he had obtained the true Dharma Eye Store of Huang Gongwang. Wang Yuanzhao was calm, ancient, and unrestrained, and strove to follow the Yuan people. Wang Hui, Wu Li, and Wang Yuanzhao came out of Wang Shimin's school, integrating the North and South, and did not fall into clichés; although their qualities were different, their charm was the same. Wang Yuanqi said: "Wu Li's achievements are not below Wang Shimin." It is not a false statement. However, one is famous throughout the world, and is honored as the ancient and modern painting saint, while the other is unknown, and later there are even those who do not know who Wu Li is. Is it not lamentable! Yun Shouping and Yun Ge breathed the spirit of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, and their charm was transcendent. In order to avoid Wang Hui, he did boneless sketching. Wang Yuanqi also followed the Song and Yuan Dynasties, and directly chased Huang Gongwang. The four Wangs and Wu Li cast the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties into a single body, and their flow has spread to this day, occupying a special position in the history of painting. The leader of the six families is Wang Shimin, and his paintings have a special purpose. He was praised by Dong Qichang and Chen Jiru at the time. His landscapes are outlined and brushed, and they are ethereal and divine. His random dots and dyes, and his hills are natural, deep, quiet, and his tenderness is like gold. Only Wang Shimin has this achievement in the art world. Those who passed on Wang Sh

### A Concrete Method

— Song Guobin

The meaning of health has two aspects: one is the passive aspect of not easily contracting diseases; the other is the active aspect of being able to endure hardship. The relationship between citizens and the country is like that between cells and the body. The foundation of the nation lies in its people, and the foundation of the people lies in their well-being. There has never been a case where a nation can sustain itself if its citizens are unhealthy, nor a case where a body can continue to live if its cells deteriorate. Only with healthy citizens can there be a healthy nation. How can people be healthy? This question cannot be solved with empty words. There must be cooperation between the government and the people, with the government promoting from above and private doctors assisting from below, taking practical steps to implement effective measures. I have now formulated a concrete method and written it below:

Belonging to the Government

The government's responsibilities are twofold: one is to eliminate factors that threaten health; the other is to build a broad path to promote health. There are three major enemies that threaten health: one is disease, the second is opium, and the third is war.

(A) Passive Measures

(I) Regarding Disease

The greatest enemy of health is disease. Therefore, the more unhealthy a nation is, the more diseases it will have and the higher its mortality rate will be. Why is this? It is simply because the people lack knowledge of hygiene, resulting in the succession of infectious diseases. When they are not sick, they have no preparations for prevention, and when they are sick, they often die needlessly due to the underdevelopment of medical services, such as the insufficient number of doctors and the scarcity of hospitals. A nation like this will naturally decline day by day. The remedies are as follows:

Epidemic Prevention Vaccination: Any widespread epidemic is called "yi" (epidemic). However, cholera and smallpox are found more frequently in China every year, so the term "fangyi" (epidemic prevention) seems to specifically refer to these two diseases. Cholera is more common in summer and autumn, while smallpox is more prevalent in spring and winter. In recent years, due to widespread vaccination, the severity of the epidemic has not been as rampant as before. However, compulsory vaccination may not be without contraindications. Many conditions, such as progressive pulmonary tuberculosis, myocarditis, nephritis, diabetes, gastric ulcers, and old age and weakness, are not suitable for injection. Such patients may experience severe reactions after vaccination, leading to the aggravation of the underlying disease, or even death. Among millions of people undergoing universal vaccination, there are inevitably some sacrifices. Although there are no statistics, such incidents are occasionally heard and seen. Therefore, prior examination is essential, and blind vaccination is not advisable. Also, smallpox is more common in children, and rarely seen in adults. Compulsory vaccination may be justifiable for children, but seems unnecessary for adults.

Traveler Quarantine: Epidemics are often spread from one place to another, or from one country to another, by travelers carrying pathogens. Many diseases did not exist in China originally but came from foreign countries. Therefore, travelers arriving by sea, land, or air should be quarantined, especially ships arriving from overseas, which should be subject to strict inspection to prevent the spread of foreign diseases into China.

Anti-Tuberculosis Movement: The mortality rate from tuberculosis is the highest in China, at least in Shanghai, and the economic losses to the country are also the greatest. The government should establish sanatoriums in scenic areas to isolate these patients. However, the most fundamental and effective method of preventing tuberculosis is BCG vaccination. This method is easy to implement, and the effect of lifelong immunity can be obtained by vaccinating newborns three times within ten days after birth (this vaccine can be obtained from the Pasteur Institute on Jin Shenfu Road in Shanghai, free of charge). It is a good and beautiful method, but unfortunately unknown to most people.

Prostitute Inspection: Venereal diseases, especially syphilis, are the most widespread and harmful, causing harm to oneself and disaster to future generations. The number of miscarriages in women or infant deaths due to this cause is immeasurable. Prostitutes are the source of venereal diseases. Banning prostitution is a fundamental solution, but it is difficult to achieve in reality. A better approach is to inspect prostitutes regularly. If they are found to be potentially infectious, their services should be temporarily suspended. Meanwhile, venereal disease clinics should be established to treat them. Although this may not eradicate venereal diseases, it can reduce their spread.

Improving the Lives of the Poor: In the past twenty years, the dissemination of hygienic knowledge in China seems to have achieved considerable success. However, only the middle and upper classes are aware of hygiene, while the countless poor people do not even have enough food and clothing, let alone hygiene. The middle and upper classes, despite guarding their bastions of hygiene, thinking that all infectious diseases can be avoided, are constantly being exposed to germs produced by the poor, who keep spreading the germs to them because of their overproduction. The solution to this situation is to improve the environment and improve the lives of this majority of the poor. Demolish their dark, prison-like dwellings and build the most economical and hygienic housing and dining places to solve their housing and food problems. For their diseases, establish free clinics and public hospitals to provide them with medical care.

Banning Quack Medicine: In general, all those who attempt to confuse the false with the genuine can be called "jianghu" (itinerant or unorthodox). Confucius said: "Words that are plausible but without substance, and actions that are deceptive but resolute, are only due to the lack of sincerity. Therefore, they can sway the ears of the world and gain the belief of society." Therefore, "jianghu" refers to those who rely on tricks rather than learning, and those who have the name but not the substance. Medicine also has its "jianghu," which often attracts attention with exaggerated advertisements and lures people to seek treatment. Although they may reap both fame and fortune, they also add some wrongly accused ghosts to the city of the unjustly dead. Therefore, the threat of "jianghu" medicine to health is no less than the havoc wreaked by germs.

(II) Regarding Opium

Since the Opium War, this disaster has spread to our country, causing the people's will to decline day by day and their bodies to weaken. In recent years, although the government has issued several bans on opium, addicts continue to consume, growers continue to cultivate, and transporters continue to transport. It has not achieved any significant effect. Now, the situation has worsened. Smoking dens are everywhere. In addition to opium, there are also morphine, heroin, red pills, and other toxic substances from the north. Their threat to health is self-evident. If the government does not resolve to eradicate them in the future, but only seeks temporary revenue, I fear that within a hundred years, there will be no people left to feed and the nation will be extinct.

(III) Regarding War

"War is dangerous and fraught with peril" is an ancient saying. To use flesh and blood against the intensity of artillery fire, it is rare for soldiers not to be crushed to pieces. Moreover, after a major war, there is bound to be a major epidemic, which is the greatest threat to health. We constantly seek an early victory and the early arrival of the god of peace, which would be a great blessing.

(B) Active Measures

Training the National Physique: The above are passive measures. Focusing solely on passive hygiene will still fail to achieve the goal of health. The active approach to hygiene is to promote exercise, train the body, and use the innate ability – resistance – to adapt to the environment and overcome it. Resistance is strengthened through use and weakened through disuse. By training the body, not only will health be improved, but heredity can also be altered. Many hereditary diseases that persist for generations can be prevented through exercise.

Promoting Eugenics: As the saying goes, "To have a strong country, one must first have a strong race." To actively improve the health of the people, the fundamental approach is to start with prudent marriages between young men and women. Before marriage, the bodies of both parties must be examined by a doctor to obtain a health certificate. Ideally, both parties should be strong. Alternatively, one strong and one weak is also acceptable. However, if both parties are weak, especially if they share the same weakness, then they should absolutely not marry.

Formulating Prohibition of Marriage Regulations: Prohibitions of marriage can be temporary or permanent. Temporary prohibitions of marriage apply to diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis, which should be absolutely prohibited before they are cured. Permanent prohibitions of marriage apply to congenital eunuchs or incurable terminal illnesses such as epilepsy and leprosy. In this way, weak genes will not be passed on, achieving the goal of eugenics.

Establishing Health Insurance: In recent years, the cost of living has risen sharply, and medical expenses have soared. The number of poor and sick people is increasing day by day. At this time, the so-called health care industry has emerged. Health care systems have a long history in Europe and the United States. Germany was the first to establish such a system, which was then adopted by other countries. France, after ten years of discussion, finally passed it through the parliament in 1930. The regulations formulated were no less than hundreds of articles. This type of system has a huge impact on the country and its people, so its creation required thorough consideration and strict regulations. The purpose of health care is solely to provide relief to the poor and sick and to protect the health of those living on low wages, rather than to engage in commercial profit-making. Therefore, this type of organization should be established by the state rather than by private individuals, with half of the funding provided by the government and the other half contributed by labor and capital. This is the most reasonable approach.

Lowering Grain and Commodity Prices: A shortage of grain and high commodity prices are detrimental to health. Guanzi said, "When the granaries are full, people will know etiquette." Today, each person only has one "sheng" (a unit of volume) of rice for every ten days, which is often not enough. As a result, everyone has a sallow complexion and cries out in hunger. How can one seek health without adequate nutrition? Is this not like heading north while pointing the carriage northward?

Belonging to Physicians

The above are all things that the government should do. Private physicians should play an assistive role, with their main function being to guide the people so that the government can effectively implement its policies.

Accurate Dissemination of Medical and Health Knowledge: Disseminating medical knowledge is a common saying in the medical community. However, at a time when official physicians have not yet implemented effective policies, quack doctors have already made extensive use of it. A few years ago, the supplements of various newspapers contained advertisements for quack medicine. These doctors published pseudo-scientific papers to steal fame and seek profit. How many people in society truly understand medicine and are not tempted by their advertisements and writings? Therefore, the dissemination of medical and health knowledge should focus on accuracy. Otherwise, whether one knows or does not know can make all the difference, and one must be cautious when it comes to the health of the nation!

Guidance on Marriage, Pregnancy, and Child Rearing: Physicians are responsible not only for curing diseases and treating individuals but also for providing guidance on health-related matters. The issues of marriage, pregnancy, and child rearing are of great importance to national health and should be addressed with guidance. Here are a few examples to illustrate the rest:

Today, many women advocate artificial contraception to avoid the pain of childbirth. Doctors should educate them with righteousness, telling them that pregnancy is a necessary process for women, which is beneficial and harmless to the body, and that many neurotic symptoms can be reduced by pregnancy.

Women who are afraid of the labor of breastfeeding hire wet nurses to replace them or feed their children cow's milk or formula. The drawbacks of this are innumerable, and doctors should also provide proper guidance.

Children are often spoiled after birth, leading to illness, or overfed with milk, leading to obesity. Doctors should often correct these misunderstandings. The Chinese proverb that "To keep a child healthy, always let him be three parts hungry and three parts cold" is not necessarily without reason. All these efforts are aimed at reducing infant mortality and achieving the goal that a strong country must first have a strong race.

Assistance in Implementing Health Policies: Physicians can directly assist in the implementation of the disease prevention work and anti-drug campaigns mentioned above, such as administering vaccinations, reporting infectious diseases, examining smokers, helping smokers quit, and reporting smokers.

In summary, although these are common platitudes, they are concrete measures to improve the health of the nation. Medical colleagues and I have repeatedly mentioned them over the past twenty years, but they have not yet been put into practice. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the Shen Bao's Double Ten Essay Competition, I have reorganized them, categorized them, and presented them for the reference of those concerned about medical and health affairs.
