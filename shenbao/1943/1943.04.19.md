### China Must Rapidly Industrialize

"A country is wealthy and powerful when its industry is developed." This statement has become the guiding principle for establishing a nation in recent centuries. Our country, claiming to be based on agriculture, has never had industrial scale to speak of. It was not until the late Qing Dynasty that Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang introduced machine industries. Although this has been going on for several decades, the development has been slow due to conservatism and a lack of pursuit of excellence. It is like a race where others are sprinting ahead, while we are moving slowly like oxen. Others are riding airplanes, while we are sitting in wheelbarrows. It is inevitable that we will lag far behind, and the poverty and weakness of the nation have their inevitable causes. We must learn from our painful experiences and catch up quickly to complete the "Industrialization of China" as the central goal of building a new China.

"Vast land, abundant resources, and a large population" are indeed the great advantages bestowed upon China. Why have we become so poor and weak despite having such favorable conditions? Simply put, it is because we do not know how to utilize our land, resources, and manpower. As a result, we have buried our "naturally blessed" advantages in an atmosphere of complacency and self-deprecation, and we have been called a "sleeping lion." In the world arena where the fittest survive, we need to wake up quickly, catch up, and promote the industrialization of the new China.

Some say that we are currently cooperating with the Allied nations in the war, and we should concentrate all our efforts on the war. To advocate for the industrialization of China now is an untimely high-sounding tune. Indeed, winning the war depends on overall strength, and economic power occupies an important position in that overall strength. While participating in the war, we also need to develop our industries and build our country. Therefore, promoting the industrialization of China is not just a high-sounding tune, but an urgent task.

However, for a backward agricultural country to urgently transform into an industrial country, the problem is not simple, and the work is very heavy. We might as well offer some preliminary opinions:

First, we need to formulate a detailed plan with a national foundation, adapting to the specific products, climate, and other resources and natural conditions of each region to determine industrial categories. The relationship between heavy and light industries should be appropriately arranged, taking into account the convenience of transportation. At the same time, we should set a deadline for gradual implementation and complete it as quickly as possible. This plan should be formulated by a committee organized by the government, inviting experts from various departments, as well as representatives from various industrial sectors, to discuss and formulate it, in order to combine theory and practical experience and achieve smooth implementation. After drafting the plan, select the parts that can be made public, publish them, and solicit opinions from the public to gather wisdom and achieve the most reasonable and perfect outcome. Once it is finalized, we must overcome all difficulties and implement it thoroughly.

Second, we must clearly define the scope of state-owned and private enterprises. Those that cannot generate profits but have strong capital should be state-owned. Generally, heavy industry and basic industry should be state-owned. The government should not take back private industries that already have a foundation unless absolutely necessary. The government should not aim for profits and compete with the people for profit.

Third, state-owned industries must have a rational organizational structure, make full use of production equipment, improve production efficiency, value specialized technical personnel, and adjust management positions. Those who only know how to be officials and do not know how to work should never be allowed to set foot in the industrial sector and become a blight on the community.

Fourth, the central government should establish a special department in charge of industry. The focus of its work should be to implement the entire industrialization plan, oversee state-owned industries, and supervise and guide private industries. For private industries, it should pay attention to their technological improvements, increased production efficiency, loan of funds, and convenience of product transportation.

Fifth, we should cultivate industrial specialists. The education sector should focus on industrial technology departments, reduce the number of liberal arts and law programs in universities, raise the standards of mathematics and science subjects in middle schools, and encourage students to study practical subjects, taking pride in becoming engineers. Vocational training classes should be established in greater numbers. All orphanages, refuges for children in distress, and other children without guardians should be taught skills as much as possible to cultivate a large number of skilled workers.

Sixth, we should improve the treatment of workers, protect their livelihoods, develop their own organizations, and give them the opportunity to participate in production management. At the same time, we should reasonably shorten working hours, increase work intensity, increase the number of shifts, and adopt work competitions to stimulate a competitive spirit and improve work efficiency.

In summary, although completing industrialization is a complex task with many details and heavy responsibilities, if we can grasp the key points, proceed step by step, persevere, and be determined, one day success will come naturally. As the saying goes, "Where there is a will, there is a way." Let us also look at our friendly nation, Japan. Its strength today is due to the development of its industry, which is the result of only a few decades of hard work. Success depends on human effort, and I would like to encourage my fellow countrymen to strive for it together.

### Another Painful Defeat for British Indian Troops

According to the announcement by the Imperial Headquarters on the 8th: Since occupying the area north of Azangbu near the Indian-Burmese border, Japanese army units have repelled the offensive of two British Indian divisions since late December of last year. In early March of this year, a major encirclement operation was launched, capturing and annihilating the main force of the enemy on the banks of the Ma Yu River. At present, they are still mopping up the remaining enemies.

Looking back, shortly after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army began to attack Burma. In just over four months, they completely defeated the British and Indian Allied forces from Burma, leaving the enemy at a loss. No one will remember this lesson more deeply than the enemy themselves. However, the enemy does not regret it and still shouts "Recapture Burma," even driving its troops, based on the 14th Division, which is known as the strongest in the British Indian army, across the Indian border and acting foolishly in front of the Japanese army. This strongest unit in the British Indian army has suffered another devastating blow due to the Japanese army's skillful strategy and bravery. The strategic loss to the enemy in this campaign is undoubtedly enormous. At the same time, the psychological impact on the enemy's soldiers, and even more so on the Indian people, must be extremely profound, which is not difficult to imagine.

Since October of last year, the enemy, Britain, has frequently publicized its imminent launch of an active offensive to "recapture Burma," making boastful statements, claiming that "the Japanese army is busy fighting in the Pacific and New Guinea... now is the perfect opportunity to attack the Japanese army in Burma." Therefore, the enemy's move to cross the Indian border, based on the unit touted as the strongest in the British Indian army, can be seen as based on the above observations. However, the Japanese army's lineup in Burma is actually a highly skilled and strong force. In addition, the entire Burmese people fully understand Japan's true intentions, and their cooperation with the Japanese army's operations is unwavering, leaving the enemy with no opportunity to exploit.

On the other hand, regarding the enemy's combat actions, as stated by Army Press Chief Tanihagi: "The British army usually uses Indian soldiers as shields in the front, while they often stay in the rear to supervise the battle. If the battle situation is unfavorable, they always retreat first." The enemy, Britain, has never ceased its exploitation and oppression of the Indian people for over two hundred years. Now, even though Britain is on the verge of destruction, they still chain the Indian people, using them as shields for British soldiers, continuing their desperate war. It is only natural that many Indian soldiers, realizing the foolishness of fighting the Japanese army, surrender to the Japanese army. The Indian people should fully recognize the cruelty of the British army and avoid becoming shields for the British army. India and Burma are connected, and if the Indian people are determined to avoid becoming sacrifices for the British army, then their bright future is at hand.

Furthermore, the fact that the Japanese army in Burma has once again achieved such brilliant results is due to the skillful strategy and bravery of the Japanese army's small forward units, who have continued for two months to block the enemy's large forces, as well as the agile naval mobility of the subsequent support forces, and have overcome unimaginable difficulties such as crossing the steep Arakan Mountains at an altitude of two to three thousand meters. The one hundred million people in the rear of Japan do not know how to express their gratitude and appreciation for the hard work of these loyal and courageous soldiers.

Regarding the request from Chongqing for increased transportation of supplies, the United States and Britain use the recapture of Burma as a prerequisite and the only excuse to alleviate Chongqing's anxiety and suffering. At the same time, the United States and Britain themselves are well aware of the importance of the "recapture of Burma" in terms of both political and military strategy. However, at the same time, they are now probably aware that their call to "recapture Burma" is strategically completely impossible. However, US Secretary of the Army Stimson and the British military leadership are still using such words to deceive: "Due to the arrival of the rainy season and the difficulty of transporting the British army, it is almost impossible to recapture Burma this spring." In many senses, Burma is now a firmly fortified link in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and it forms a huge Japanese army stronghold for the adjacent Indian army and Yunnan Chongqing army, capable of inflicting a painful blow on the enemy.

### Special Envoy Chen Gongbo Returns to Nanjing After Completing Mission to Japan - Paid Respects to Chairman Wang Yesterday to Report on Visit to Japan - Cordial Talks with Japanese Authorities Result in Satisfactory Outcome

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) Since our National Government joined the war, friendly nations have returned special administrative concessions in various places, the area of the Beijing Legation, and abolished restrictions on the movement of waste materials, providing various assistance to our country in completing independence and establishing a wartime system. In order to express gratitude and to have frank and cordial talks with the Japanese authorities on the issue of completing the war, the National Government specially appointed Legislative Yuan President Chen Gongbo as a special envoy to visit Japan. After receiving the order to visit Japan, Special Envoy Chen, accompanied by his entourage, Sun Lifu, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Shen Guanzhun, Counselor of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, Huang Pusheng, Counselor of the Propaganda Department, and Lin Ji, Senior Secretary of the Legislative Yuan, departed from Beijing at 10:30 AM on the 6th of this month to go to Japan. While in Japan, Chen visited Minister Tani and held various cordial talks. On the 8th, he met with the Japanese Emperor and was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun. On the 11th, Special Envoy Chen, having completed his mission, immediately went to the Imperial Palace to bid farewell and returned to the country, briefly stopping in Beijing. He took a flight back to the capital yesterday (the 18th) at 2:35 PM, accompanied by his entourage. Those who went to the airport to welcome him included Peng Yiming, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, Lin Baisheng, Minister of Propaganda, Chen Junhui, Minister of Construction, He Bingxian, Director-General of the Economic Management Office, Zhou Longxiang, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Deng Zuyu, Director-General of the Capital Police Department, Cai Peixin, the newly appointed Ambassador to Japan, Zhao Yusong, Minister of Personnel, Liu Yangshan, Deputy Director of Education of the Central Youth Cadre School, Mai Lanxi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Tao, President of the Capital Supreme Court, Li Changjiang, Commander-in-Chief of the First Army, Wu Tunan (representative) of the Legislative Yuan, and all colleagues from the Legislative Yuan. After disembarking, Special Envoy Chen looked vigorous and nodded to the welcomers. Chen then took a car directly to the Chairman's residence to pay respects to the Chairman and report on his visit to Japan.

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) Chen Gongbo, President of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government and Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality, visited Japan this month as the National Government's Special Ambassador to Japan. During his week-long stay in Japan, he exchanged opinions frankly with Prime Minister Tojo and other Japanese government leaders, and the results were very satisfactory. On his way back, he made a brief stop in Beijing. He took a flight back to Beijing today and immediately paid respects to Chairman Wang, reporting in detail on the results of his trip. This was the first time the National Government sent Chen to Japan after China joined the war. Therefore, not only has he widely publicized the new situation in China to the Japanese government and public, enabling them to gain a new understanding, but it has also enabled the Sino-Japanese relationship after the National Government's participation in the war to enter a new stage. As a central figure in the National Government, Chen was dispatched to Japan to have sincere and frank talks with Japanese government leaders on issues such as the joint completion of the war and future Sino-Japanese relations. He will certainly achieve considerable results. Therefore, in the future, China and Japan will jointly embark on a new situation of completing the joint war, and Special Envoy Chen can contribute his valuable experience of inspecting Japan's highly wartime system to the National Government's wartime policies. It is especially hoped that he will vigorously promote new facilities in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects.

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) After Special Envoy Chen Gongbo arrived in Beijing after completing his visit to Japan, this reporter specifically asked Huang Pusheng, Counselor of the Propaganda Department, who accompanied him, about the current situation in Japan under the wartime system. He expressed his feelings as follows: "This time, accompanying Special Envoy Gongbo to Japan, we received a grand welcome from Japan, which shows the close relationship between China and Japan today. The relationship is as close as brothers, which cannot be described in words. Since our country participated in the Greater East Asia War, Japan has regarded our country not only as a friend, but as a brother. This time, the return of concessions and the abolition of unequal treaties have shown their sincere moral feelings and determination to help China become an independent and autonomous country. It goes without saying that during the current war, all Japanese citizens are enduring hardships and working hard, uniting as one to complete the Greater East Asia War. I went to Fukuoka and Tokyo and saw that the general Japanese public was enthusiastically carrying out air defense exercises, and the women were all wearing air defense uniforms. I admired them greatly. Wherever Special Envoy Chen went, the citizens of each street stood at attention and saluted, which shows the Japanese people's enthusiasm for China, which we cannot help but be grateful for."

### Meeting with Reporters in Beijing

Beijing, 18th (Central News Agency) Chen Gongbo, Special Envoy of the National Government to Japan, met with reporters at Qin Zheng Dian in Zhongnanhai here at 4:30 PM on the 17th and answered various questions raised by the group. He emphasized that after China joined the war, the Central Government had high expectations for the four provinces and three municipalities in the North. The following is a summary of the questions and answers: Question: What are your impressions of Japan under wartime conditions? Answer: The Japanese people, from top to bottom, are united in their belief in victory, and their tense situation is deeply moving. Japan's rationing system is very complete, so the people across the nation have no sense of unease in their lives. This is especially admirable to me. Question: What are the solutions to the food problem in North China? Answer: China's food production in the past could not meet its own needs. This is not only the case in the northern provinces and cities. In the past, China imported an average of 16 million dan of rice and over 9 million dan of flour and wheat per year. Now, because imports are not as smooth as in the past, we are seeking countermeasures such as increasing production and other methods. First of all, we should strive to unblock the exchange of goods between the North and the South in order to alleviate the difficult food situation. Question: What are the Central Government's expectations for the northern provinces and cities? Answer: In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the northern provinces and cities bear the extremely important and great mission of being a logistics base. Therefore, the Central Government has high expectations for the northern provinces and cities. Some people believe that China has three parts, North, South, and Central, which is a huge mistake. We must never say that the northern provinces and cities have any special circumstances. Historically speaking in China, we do not dare to say that there are special circumstances. In short, after joining the war, the whole country of China has already united as one, determined to concentrate its strength and strive to complete the war.

Beijing, 18th (Central News Agency) Chen Gongbo, Special Envoy of the National Government to Japan, before returning home after completing his mission to Japan, visited Japanese Minister Shiiozawa and General Okamura, Supreme Commander of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army, on the 19th to express his gratitude for the Japanese government's and people's kindness and to express his determination to complete the war. On the 16th, he also held cordial talks with Su Tiren and Wang Yintai, supervisors of the Education and Industry General Offices of the North China Political Affairs Commission, and Vice President Yu of the New People's Society. On the 17th, he exchanged views separately with Zhu Shijing, supervisor of the Finance General Office, and Qi Xieyuan, supervisor of the Security and Internal Affairs General Office. Then, he met with a group of reporters. After completing all the events, he took a flight back to Nanjing at 11:00 AM today.

### German Government Appoints Wellmann as New Ambassador to China - Welcomed by All Sectors in Our Country

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) At the end of last year, the German government transferred its Ambassador to China, Stahmer, to become Ambassador to Japan. The vacancy for Ambassador to China was officially announced on the 17th to be filled by Wellmann, the Director of the Political Affairs Bureau of the German Foreign Ministry. Wellmann has extremely flexible diplomatic skills and is one of the most talented people in the German Foreign Ministry. His appointment as Ambassador to China proves the German government's emphasis on the National Government and Sino-Japanese relations. After Stahmer was transferred to be Ambassador to Japan, Germany temporarily appointed Gode as Acting Ambassador to China, but since China's participation in the war, the situation in various aspects of China has undergone rapid changes, and the position of Ambassador cannot be vacant for a long time. At the same time, the National Government also hopes that the German government will send a new ambassador as soon as possible. Therefore, the decision to appoint Wellmann as Ambassador to China will enable him to work with Ambassador Stahmer in Japan to strengthen Axis relations after he takes office. From the perspective of the Greater East Asia wartime situation, Germany's preparations for expanding its diplomatic lineup in China and Japan have significant implications. Therefore, the National Government welcomes the German government's appointment of Wellmann as the new Ambassador to China.

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) Since the German Ambassador to China, Stahmer, was appointed as Ambassador to Japan, the vacancy has lasted for three months. The selection of his successor has been of great concern to all sectors of our country. The German Foreign Ministry has officially announced that Dr. Wellmann, Deputy Secretary of State and Director of the Political Department of the Foreign Ministry, will be Ambassador to China. All sectors of our country have welcomed Wellmann's appointment to our country, and it can be predicted that Sino-German relations will become more cordial in the future.

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) The German government's appointment of Dr. Wellmann as its new ambassador to our country was approved by our government in advance. Dr. Wellmann has served in the diplomatic field for many years. His presence in our country will make the relations between China and Germany closer. It is truly gratifying. It is reported that the new ambassador will come to China to take office soon. A brief biography of the new ambassador is provided below: Ambassador Wellmann is 61 years old this year. He was originally a prominent figure in the Hamburg shipping industry. He participated in the German delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. From 1936 to 1938, he served as Minister to the UK, and then returned to the German Foreign Ministry. He is an expert on British issues and has many years of history in the diplomatic field. Most recently, he served as Director of the Political Department of the German Foreign Ministry before being transferred to his current position.

We must unite as one, share weal and woe with the allied countries, and strive to build a new China. We deeply hope that our compatriots who are groaning under the shackles of Chongqing and Yan'an will rise up quickly, abandon the past anti-Japanese ideas, join the peace camp, and jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of building a new China. This is the only correct way to save China."

This special vaporization device also has various benefits: (1) It can drive a car using alcohol only. (2) It can also be driven by mixing gasoline and vegetable oil. (3) Because it is equipped with a special motor, the initial start is also very fast. In order to make it clear to all sectors, Morita held a public test presided over by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry here on the 17th, and the results were well received.

### The Second East Asia Medical Association Concludes Successfully: Foreign Minister Chu Gives a Speech on the Effectiveness of Tai Chi Exercises

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Second East Asia Medical Association conference, after two days of special and general lectures by dozens of individuals, achieved significant results and has now concluded successfully. The details of today (18th) are recorded as follows: The meeting commenced at 8:00 AM. The first speaker was Chinese Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, who brought various instruments and, along with an assistant, lectured and demonstrated for an hour. Mr. Chu spoke about "Tai Chi Exercises," which he has been promoting and researching for thirteen years. This exercise is the most profound of Chinese national arts, and many researchers throughout history have studied it. Mr. Chu has gained particular insights, making his lecture highly engaging for the audience. The afternoon session opened with Mr. Chu presiding. Following him was Professor Ogata Ihiro of Manchukuo Medical University, who gave a special lecture titled "The Impact of Manchukuo's Climate, Especially Cold Weather, on the Body's Temperature Regulation." He presented his academic research, making significant contributions to medicine. The general lectures included a presentation by Dr. Uchibayashi Koji of the Tokyo University Medical Department, titled "Opium and Narcotic Drug Addiction: An Important Problem in East Asia." He presented a report based on experiments conducted at the Beijing "Drug Rehabilitation Center" and strongly emphasized that the opium problem is a crucial issue for East Asia and an urgent task for East Asian medical scholars. Subsequently, Ohira Tokuzo, a health technical supervisor from the Ministry of People's Livelihood of Manchukuo, provided a thorough explanation of the opium problem in Manchukuo and called upon medical scholars to pay attention to the opium issues in China and Manchukuo. Following presentations of personal research findings by Chinese medical scholars such as Chen Taiyi, the conference concluded successfully. At 5:00 PM, all attendees went to Shimonotsuke Seiyo-ken for a dinner hosted by Dr. Hayashi Haruo, President of the East Asia Medical Association, and planned to visit the Temporary Army First Hospital for observation on the 19th.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The 18th was the second day of the Second East Asia Medical Association. Foreign Minister Chu Minyi brought twelve types of instruments, including pressure gauges, lifting force gauges, and pressing force gauges, to explain the effectiveness of Tai Chi exercises, stating, "The active maintenance and enhancement of health lie in the cultivation of the body and mind. However, the methods for cultivating the body and mind should not be overly difficult, so that anyone can practice them at any time is valuable." At this point, Dr. Chu used the instruments on the table to explain various methods for measuring physical strength. He then explained Tai Chi exercises, saying that they originated from the Chuan Zhang of the Wudang School in the Chinese martial arts world during the Song Dynasty. He further applied modern medical principles for improvement and supplementation, making them different from European and American exercise methods. While the two may appear similar at first glance, their operational principles are clearly different. Dr. Chu then called out an assistant, first having him demonstrate Tai Chi exercises, and then tossing eggs and pebbles into the air to explain the principles of its soft movements. Subsequently, using the assistant as a demonstrator, he practically demonstrated the movements of Tai Chi exercises, dividing them into hand, waist, and leg sections, with ten movements in detail. He then screened a film of Tai Chi exercises, introducing their actual state for ten minutes. Finally, Dr. Chu explained the advantages of Tai Chi exercises, which are that they do not take time, do not require effort, and do not cost money. The attending representatives from various countries listened attentively and recognized this as a purely Chinese style of exercise, praising it unanimously.

### Axis Forces Rely on Favorable Terrain to Launch Counteroffensive in Northern Tunisia, Concentrating Forces in an Attempt to Retake Jebel Ang, with Heavily Mined and Machine-Gunned Fortifications Impregnable

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Reports indicate that in the Tunisian theater, the Axis forces, within the anti-Axis crescent-shaped encirclement from near Enfidaville in the south to Sedjenane in the north, and extending westward to Bou Arada, have relied on favorable terrain to repel the anti-Axis offensive and are seizing the opportunity to counterattack. Fierce battles are currently underway in various locations against the anti-Axis forces. However, according to dispatches from Algiers, anti-Axis Commander Eisenhower, in a reception for reporters on the 17th, discussed the situation in Tunisia, pointing out that the prospects are not optimistic. He stated, "The anti-Axis forces still need to go through this great battle to drive the Axis forces out of North Africa. The only difficulty for the anti-Axis forces in future operations is the excellent quality of the German army. The mines laid by the Axis forces are also one of the difficulties for anti-Axis operations." According to dispatches from Washington, D.C., U.S. wartime intelligence director Davis, in reporting on the war situation, touched on the Tunisian theater, stating, "The Tunisian campaign has entered its final stage. Although Rommel's army has retreated to the north, its base has become a solid fortress, approximately 100 miles long and 30 miles wide." According to news from North Africa, fierce battles occurred in the northern region on the 16th. The war situation in various locations is noted as follows: (1) After a recent fierce battle between the anti-Axis forces and the Axis forces, they occupied Jebel Ang. However, the Axis forces in that area seem to be trying to counterattack. According to a dispatch from the United Press correspondent, British reconnaissance pilots reported that General Arnim has assembled Axis forces, preparing to retake Jebel Ang. (2) The French rebel forces southeast of Bou Arada suffered a major blow from the Axis forces from the 14th to the 15th, and suffered another heavy blow, so they had to temporarily halt their offensive. There was nothing to report on the situation in that area on the 16th. (3) In the southern region, British reconnaissance teams and assault teams had local skirmishes with small units of the Axis forces near Enfidaville.

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – There is no change in the Tunisian front. Messages from the US military and French rebel forces also acknowledged last night that the Axis forces in the northeast bridgehead are continuing to put up a resolute resistance and are counterattacking in several places, using mines and other methods to hinder anti-Axis operations. According to the United Press of America, the current fighting on the northern front is the most intense in the entire African war. General Anderson's British First Army and its support units encountered fierce resistance as they advanced beyond Jebel Ang. It was previously reported that Jebel Ang had fallen into the hands of the anti-Axis forces. British reconnaissance planes said that General Arnim was seen concentrating troops, estimating that these troops were preparing to retake Jebel Ang. Anti-Axis reconnaissance teams operating north of Enfidaville against Axis transportation lines have discovered many mined areas and machine gun positions, so the anti-Axis side expects not to begin an attack until a sufficient heavy artillery force has been moved to the front. This will probably take several days, as the terrain is rugged and there are no roads, making it difficult to move the necessary artillery into position.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to the Transocean News Agency military correspondent, there were intense battles of a local nature in northwestern Tunisia on Friday, especially in the northern part of the western front. General Anderson has tried repeatedly with the greatest perseverance to capture the overlooking heights northeast of Béja and north and northwest of Méjez el-Bab. In the Béja area, attacking British and French troops engaged in fierce battles with counterattacking German troops. Although only a portion of the troops was used on both sides, the fighting was extremely fierce. Several peaks changed hands several times within a day, so it is currently difficult to obtain an accurate picture of the situation there. But what is known is that the claim spread by the anti-Axis side that the anti-Axis army has broken through the entire German front north of Méjez el-Bab does not correspond to the facts. Even if British troops have indeed broken through the Axis positions in a few locations, they have been repelled to their original locations by German counterattacks. The anti-Axis forces have a large number of reserve troops available. Therefore, the fighting in this area will not only continue unabated, but will become even more intense. Conversely, the area southeast of Bou Arada was quieter on Friday. Most of the French rebel forces under Giraud are fighting in this area. After suffering serious blows from the Axis forces on Wednesday and Thursday, they are currently apparently still recovering. There have been several small-scale engagements on the southern front. British reconnaissance teams and assault teams attempted to break through the ring of barriers laid by the Axis forces around their Enfidaville positions, but failed. At times, both sides exchanged long-range artillery fire. It is currently difficult to predict when General Montgomery's British Eighth Army will begin its large-scale attack.

### Germany's "Atlantic Wall" Completed: Hopes for Anglo-American Opening of Second Front Dashed

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – A special correspondent for the German News Agency reports that the construction of the "Atlantic Wall," ordered by German Führer Hitler, has been completed in less than a year. Standing on the site where U.S. forces first set foot on French soil during World War I, one can overlook this great defensive engineering project that will endure for centuries. High-altitude anti-aircraft artillery, artillery guns, machine gun positions, tank defense engineering, and munitions storage areas are all clearly visible. The cement walls are over three feet thick. The coastline is covered with solid defensive points, especially at river mouths, harbors, and submarine bases. The construction of this project was largely carried out by foreign workers. Behind the wall, German divisions stand watch diligently, and any enemy attempting to land will be immediately bombarded. The British army suffered a severe blow in Dieppe last summer, at which time there were only temporary defense lines. The completed "Atlantic Wall" is many times more robust than before.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to General Steel-Fleet, a military commentator for the Transocean News Agency, there was considerable fighting in Tunisia between April 10 and 16. Field Marshal Rommel's forces, seeking to shorten the front line, have withdrawn from Kairouan and Sousse. North of these two locations, new fighting has begun. The anti-Axis forces are also increasing pressure from the west, but all attacks have been repelled. The German Air Force is also effectively assisting ground troops, concentrating attacks on enemy supply bases and rear transportation lines. Fighting in this area will generally continue. On the Eastern Front, there was only limited significant fighting during that week. The Soviet army regards the Kupyansk bridgehead as a thorn in its side, and has attacked it repeatedly. The commentator also said that the recently announced "Atlantic Wall" should not be ignored. The wall stretches from the Pyrenees to the German border, a distance of over 2,700 kilometers. The principle of its construction is very different from the famous Western Wall, which is only 850 kilometers long. In 1939, Britain and France were extremely wary of this wall and did not dare to take any risks. The assistance promised to the Netherlands included inland fortresses around submarine bases and naval strongholds to prevent paratroopers from attacking from the rear and to prevent the enemy from attempting to land. Therefore, the strongest fortifications are set up around ports and river mouths. However, relying solely on defensive fortifications cannot guarantee a country's immunity from invasion, so manpower is still needed to defend them, as demonstrated by the Maginot Line and the Metaxas Line. The Atlantic Wall is defended by elite troops, making it unbreakable. These troops are not as complacent as the French troops on the Maginot Line. If the enemy attempts to land, these troops will attack from all sides, as in the Dieppe raid. This extensible line of defense also has roads for quickly transferring motorized reserves to critical locations. There is little hope that the enemy will be able to establish a second front in Western Europe.

### British Planes Night Raid German Industrial Areas, Losing Over 100 Aircraft

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to German military authorities, British air force units carried out another large-scale bombing raid on German industrial areas on the 16th night, but returned after suffering heavy losses. Experts criticized this fairly large-scale air raid, saying that Britain is now launching large-scale night attacks again, but it must be understood that it is almost impossible to accurately bomb specific targets at night in front of Germany's powerful air defense positions. This bombing by British planes is really no different from scattering a large number of bombs over a wide area. Therefore, although citizens near factories have suffered damage, the factories have not suffered much damage. Although Britain has made extensive publicity about the bombing effect, we really don't understand what the purpose of Britain's bombing is this time. The British planes bombed continuously from the 16th to the 17th afternoon. In such a large-scale air raid lasting 24 hours, the British raiding team suffered unprecedentedly heavy losses. More than 100 British aircraft were shot down, mostly large bombers with four engines. Checking the wreckage of enemy aircraft, with an average of ten bodies per aircraft, the loss of airmen must be over a thousand. This glorious great victory cannot but be grateful to the brave men of the anti-aircraft artillery units and night fighter squadrons.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Officials here said today that when U.S. aircraft attacked Bremen yesterday, 20 four-engine bombers were shot down by the Germans, and the Germans only lost two fighter planes. In this battle, residential areas were hit, and many people were injured or killed. At the same time, British aircraft lost seven aircraft in the western region and over the sea yesterday.

### German and British Ships Engage in Fierce Battle Near Brighton

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports that in the early hours of April 16, a British destroyer, protected by two motor torpedo boats, engaged in a fierce battle with the German coastal fleet near the coast north of Brighton. Although the enemy's firepower was superior, the German ships responded properly, and finally destroyed one of the enemy's motor torpedo boats, and the large one was lost. During the enemy's second attack, one of the German ships suffered considerable damage. The British destroyer captain believed that this was a good opportunity to capture the German ship, so he gradually approached it, intending to send sailors to climb onto the German ship. The German crew waited for them to approach, and used hand grenades as weapons to resist. Finally, a damaged machine gun was suddenly repaired by a German sailor, and fired at the British sailors who were preparing to board the ship. The British were caught off guard, and suffered many casualties. The ship then fled in a panic, and all the German ships returned to defense safely.

### Muddy Season on Eastern Front Coming to an End: German Army Completes Preparations for Major Battle, Soviet Offensives in Kupyansk Area Repelled

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to the Transocean News Agency military correspondent, the southern section of the Eastern Front has entered a true summer climate, with the temperature exceeding 20 degrees Celsius. In the central and northern sections, the temperature has also risen to 10 degrees, so the muddy season should end by the end of April, and the current lull in fighting may also end. However, the development of the situation does not depend entirely on the climate; the decisions of the armies of both sides account for the largest component. The German defense lines have been prepared to deal with any eventuality, all the German troops who participated in the winter fighting have been rested, and fresh troops are arriving at the front from the country in a steady stream. Munitions and fuel supplies have also been prepared in abundance. We should note that since the end of the winter campaign, the German army has occupied positions that are advantageous for both offense and defense. Therefore, once the spring muddy season ends, the German army will be able to move completely freely.

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – The German official news agency announced last night that the German army again fought fierce defensive battles on the left and repelled the Soviet army attacking the Kupyansk bridgehead and the upper reaches of the Donets River. The Soviet army used a large number of tanks to assist in a concentrated attack on the southeast of the Kupyansk bridgehead, but failed to gain a foothold anywhere. It is said that the Soviet army lost 28 tanks, and three infantry regiments were completely wiped out. After a long period of silence, the Soviet army in the upper reaches of the Donets River attacked in two places, but the German army was prepared to repel them. At another location, powerful German troops isolated and surrounded a Soviet unit. A Reuters correspondent in Moscow said that a few major roads in the Kupyansk area are gradually drying out, and both sides are preparing for the final battle to seize the bridgehead.

### Major Changes in German Diplomatic Personnel

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – It was announced here last night that Dr. Wellman, the German Foreign Office Assistant Undersecretary and former head of the Political Department of the Foreign Office, has been formally appointed as Ambassador to China. According to a communiqué from the German Führer's headquarters, former German Ambassador to China Steimar was transferred to the post of Ambassador to Japan several months ago, and Wellman is now his successor. Former Ambassador to the United States Dickhoff was appointed as Ambassador to Spain; Foreign Office Undersecretary Weizsäcker was appointed as Ambassador to the Holy See. In addition, the communiqué also announced several important personnel changes in the German Foreign Office, including the appointment of First Secretary Maultandt as Undersecretary of State, succeeding Weizsäcker; Hans Hank, counselor at the German Embassy in Spain, was promoted to Undersecretary of State and Director of the Political Department of the Foreign Office, succeeding Wellman; and the famous diplomats Dr. Gauss, Lintron, and Schwiell were all promoted to the rank of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary.

### Chinese, American, and German Overseas Chinese Return Home, Arriving in Portugal

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Four hundred and four German Overseas Chinese, mostly women and children, who were repatriated from the Central American countries of Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Honduras, arrived here yesterday aboard the Spanish ship "Comillas". They will continue their voyage home next Wednesday.

### Japanese Army in Burma Reaps War Gains, Annihilating a British Brigade – Captured Captain Recounts the Experience

Bay of Bengal, 18th (Central News Agency) – Japanese troops crushed the British Second Division Sixth Brigade at a key position on April 6th. At that time, the British-Indian mixed army 47th Brigade, which was guarding near Udongbeku in southern Maungdaw Peninsula, collapsed at the first blow of the Japanese army and fled north. But the retreat route had already been cut off by the Japanese army, so it was almost completely wiped out by the Japanese army ambushing in India. In this battle, Indian Army Captain Singh, staff officer of the British Brigade Headquarters, was captured. According to him, the British-Indian army's intrusion into the Arakan region was still an action started to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road. Now the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road is hopeless, especially the fighting near India can be said to have ended in a great victory for the Japanese army. At first, I was stationed behind Laubek, and soon the Japanese army attacked from the central Mayu Mountains to the rear of Laubek, which was really unexpected. I came into contact with the Japanese army for the first time. What impressed me most was that I learned that the Japanese army were brave and good at fighting. Someone asked me why Indians, who longed for independence to be realized soon, were so indirectly supporting Britain's control of India and fighting for the British. I can answer that if the British want to prevent the collapse of the British Empire, they will try their best to lure Indians into the army to fight, regardless of the quality or race of the troops. Although Japan has repeatedly issued statements to India, Britain has always tried its best to prevent the purpose of Japan's statements from deeply affecting India. I also only now know about the Japanese government's statement that it will permit Burma to be independent within the year. I firmly believe that Burma's independence will definitely have a profound and far-reaching impact on the minds of our Indians.

### Japanese Greater East Asia Minister Aoki Visits Vietnam, Vietnamese Express Welcome

Saigon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki's visit to the South this time is of great significance. The people of Vietnam, both high and low, are extremely excited after hearing the news that Mr. Aoki will arrive in Vietnam soon to hold a cordial conversation with Vietnamese leaders. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Vietnam had already deeply understood Japan's position in East Asia. As early as June of the 29th year of the Republic of China, it was the first to recognize Japan's dispatch of a monitoring team to Vietnam to assist in blocking the supply route to Chongqing. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in December of the following year, the relationship between Japan and Vietnam became even closer. During the battles of Malaya and Burma, Vietnam further expressed its active cooperation in the Greater East Asia War and concluded various agreements with Japan. The progress of the relationship between Japan and Vietnam can be said to be extremely rapid and smooth. Therefore, Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia is very eager to visit Vietnam as soon as possible during his inspection of the South, in order to quickly learn about the real situation in Vietnam, which is cooperating in the Greater East Asia War, and to hold cordial conversations with the Vietnamese authorities. Officials and civilians in Vietnam are all very welcoming of Mr. Aoki's visit.

### Burma Selects People's Representatives to Visit Japan in Batches

Rangoon, 17th (Central News Agency) – Since Burmese Governor Ba Maw visited Japan, it has aroused the nationwide desire of the Burmese people to visit Japan. In particular, young men and women here all deeply wish to be able to visit Japan. In order to adapt to this kind of Japan fever among the Burmese, the Military Administration Department decided to select fifty representatives from all walks of life in Burma, including politics, industry, and education, to send to Japan for visits and inspections. The selection of candidates has now begun. The first batch of eighteen people is scheduled to depart next month, and the second and third batches of sixteen people each are also scheduled to depart in May and June. It is planned that they will all stay in Japan for three months.

### Historical Materials on Columbus's Voyages Found in Seville

Madrid, Spain, 18th (Central News Agency) – In the archives of a notary office in Seville, historical materials concerning Columbus's voyage to the Americas were found, containing interesting details about the hiring of ships, crew members, and wages.

### US Huge Shipbuilding Program Deeply Concerned by Britain

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency naval commentator, the British shipping industry is deeply concerned about the new shipbuilding plan set by the United States. The plan includes the construction of thousands of docks, requiring a huge amount of 560 million US dollars. Harrysen, President of the British Shipbuilding Engineering Association, recently wrote in the Financial Times, saying that "the danger of Britain losing its global shipbuilding leadership position has changed from fantasy to reality." He also said that the United States' huge shipbuilding plan of 960 million yuan is very noteworthy. Rear Admiral Maurer, Chief of the US Navy Bureau of Ships, has made repeated statements. Navy Secretary Knox also mentioned the US plan to build docks at a press conference on April 2nd. In the view of the British aviation industry, it is a mobile dock for repairing American merchant ships, but it must follow the future ocean fleet so that it can be repaired at any time when warships are damaged. However, this plan will definitely fail. If this kind of living dock has to closely follow the warship, its huge size and the large scale of the enemy air force are the best target for enemy bombs. Once this mobile dock is completed, it can be operated smoothly in places lacking ship repair docks, such as South America or the coast of South Africa, and British naval experts will suffer from it.

### Number of US Army and Navy Casualties Since the War

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to dispatches from Washington, the US Army authorities announced on the 16th the number of US Army soldiers lost since the war as follows: Since the start of the war, the US Army has lost 76,452 soldiers on the world's battlefields. Among them, more than 11,000 were killed in action, and more than 13,000 were injured.

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Washington telegrams reported that, according to the injury and death toll issued by the US Navy so far, the total number of casualties of the US Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard since the attack on Pearl Harbor is 24,819 officers and soldiers. In addition, the US Navy also continued to fear the casualties of the previous week, a total of 105 people, including 19 deaths, and 81 injured and missing.

### British Eighth Army Commander Arrives in Algiers

Madrid, 18th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a German news agency dispatch citing Moroccan radio, General Montgomery, commander of the British Eighth Army in Tunisia, has arrived in Algiers by plane. It is reported that Montgomery conferred with Giraud and US Fifth Army Commander Patton.

### Giraud Rejects Tagore's Request

Tangier, 18th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to reliable sources, Giraud's written statement delivered to London by Jadrou states his rejection of Tagore's request to establish a provisional government in French North Africa and to restore the parliamentary system in France after the war. Regarding these two points, Giraud reportedly stated: "I do not wish to interfere in the matter of a provisional government. My mission is to represent French sovereignty and interests outside the French homeland and to create an army composed of men who are willing and able to fight. Regarding the parliamentary system, I do not wish to see the system that plunged us into the disasters of the 1930s restored." It is understood that the full text of the statement will be released simultaneously in Algiers, London, and Washington on Monday.

### Secretary-General of Italian Fascist Party Replaced

Rome, 18th (Central News Agency telegram) – Italian Prime Minister Mussolini convened a meeting of the heads of the Fascist Party on the 17th and approved the resignation of the party's Secretary-General, Vizzini. He will be replaced by the current Deputy Secretary-General, Scorza. Vizzini previously served in the Spanish Civil War as a volunteer, fighting on the side of the revolutionaries, during which time he was wounded. He has now requested to resign due to health reasons and inability to endure strenuous work. He will now devote himself to assisting the families of soldiers serving in the military.

Both leaders reaffirmed their firm resolve to fight alongside the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States until final victory.

### Special Edition on the India-Burma Campaign: Failure of the Burma Counteroffensive Deepens Anglo-American-Chongqing Depression

Since the Japanese side announced a major victory in the India-Burma border region, where two divisions of counterattacking British troops were captured and annihilated, the Anglo-American press has remained silent. However, from the perspective that the counteroffensive in Burma was a prerequisite for large-scale air raids on the Japanese mainland, this campaign has given a significant shock to the United States, which had even greater expectations than Britain. How enthusiastic were the Anglo-American-Chongqing forces about retaking Burma? And how has their depression deepened after their attempt was crushed by the fierce Japanese counterattack? Here, we present a comprehensive introduction based on information from various sources:

The Relationship Between Air Raids on Japan and the Burma Road

The thing that the United States is now focusing on and planning most is to conduct continuous large-scale air raids on Japan from the Chinese mainland, in addition to surprise air raids using Pacific bases and aircraft carriers. Therefore, the United States is making maximum use of the so-called China-India airlift route and the northern air route. Among these two air routes, the China-India air route is receiving the most attention, with continuous day and night efforts to expand and construct bases in India and China. However, the true air raid operations against Japan that the United States is attempting are not surprise attacks or intermittent raids, but rather continuous strong attacks using 200 to 300 aircraft. During his recent inspection of Chongqing, US Air Force Commander Arnold, in response to Soong Mei-ling's request for urgent assistance, cited the lack of aircraft, the danger of airlift, and the lack of gasoline, affirming the difficulty of large-scale preparations. Furthermore, the Washington dispatch of the Herald Tribune of February 28 also reported the following:

"Washington officials believe that if sufficient gasoline cannot be transported, then sending the 500 military aircraft requested by Chongqing is meaningless. On the one hand, because the economic situation under Chongqing's rule is extremely difficult, the United States must not only provide military assistance but also transport daily necessities to make up for the flaws in Chongqing's finances. This fact makes the transportation of gasoline doubly difficult."

In order for the United States to break through this situation and carry out its so-called plan to turn Japan into a wasteland, it must, in any case, secure a solid inland road. However, the current China-India routes are merely a few caravan roads traversing central Asia, so retaking the Burma Road is the only crucial task at hand.

The argument for retaking the Burma Road, related to large-scale air raids on the Japanese mainland, has recently generated a rapid reflection in American public opinion. The New York Times editorial stated: "The premise for large-scale air raids on the Japanese mainland is, in the minds of most military experts, none other than retaking Burma first in order to reopen the Burma Road." The Herald Tribune stated: "American strategists are burying themselves in maps to consider ways to strengthen the air force in China. Although the specific plan cannot be discussed due to military secrecy, it goes without saying that reopening the Burma Road is a prerequisite." Furthermore, Major GF Eliot also has this argument: "Whether the American air force in China can be fully equipped depends entirely on whether the China-India airlift organization can be strengthened or the Burma Road can be retaken. If the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods are compared, it is naturally the latter, that is, the reopening of the Burma Road, that is a policy that achieves twice the result with half the effort; moreover, the retaking of the Burma Road is by no means impossible."

What is the Large-Scale Counteroffensive Like?

As mentioned above, the United States is treating the counteroffensive in Burma as a prerequisite for large-scale air raid operations on the Japanese mainland, and many operational arguments have been raised clamorously. The Herald Tribune exaggerated the fact stated in the report by Franklin Ray, Minister of Arms and Lease-Lend in China, that "the large amount of lease-lend supplies transported to India are still being stored there in preparation for the Burma campaign," and said that it would not be impossible to launch a large-scale counteroffensive in Burma right now. However, informed Washington military sources say this:

"The large-scale counteroffensive operation in Burma probably won't begin until the end of the monsoon season in October. From mid-June, the monsoon begins to strike Burma, and the coastal areas to the tropical jungles of Burma are completely becoming breeding grounds for plague and malaria. Therefore, although the central region is relatively dry, large-scale counteroffensives cannot be launched until at least the end of the rainy season."

However, the most fundamental problem is still the transportation of troops and materials, which has become a common problem for the counteroffensive. It is simply impossible to realize the large-scale counteroffensive that the United States hopes for with the 500,000 troops currently in eastern India (not a single soldier or piece of armor has been dispatched from western and southern India). As a result, it must rely on the United States to transport large numbers of troops and munitions. However, it is 11,500 nautical miles from New York to Bombay via the Cape of Good Hope, and submarines pose a threat everywhere along this route. At the same time, the question of whether 10 million to 20 million tons of shipping capacity can be spared is also a problem. Therefore, the large-scale counteroffensive in Burma, like the European second front, is just talk.

So, what exactly can be done? The New York Times editorial of February 28 has the following answer to this question:

"Based on reality, the anti-Axis forces must fight on two major fronts - west from Morocco and Iceland, east to Guadalcanal and Wake Island. Whether the United States retakes Burma or strengthens the US Air Force in China, neither can be achieved as easily as Soong Mei-ling says. The so-called concentrated operations doctrine must be adopted."

Furthermore, the Herald Tribune's Washington dispatch, unwilling to give up, states the views of informed Washington sources:

"The Anglo-Americans are pursuing a strategy with defeating Hitler as the top priority. Therefore, a large-scale operation in East Asia must at least wait until the Axis forces are driven out of Tunisia. The US government's current strategy for East Asia is, on the one hand, to actively prepare for the counteroffensive in Burma; on the other hand, to strengthen the US Air Force in Chongqing. The large-scale counteroffensive in Burma will not be realized until autumn!"

But not a word was said about the specific plan for how to counterattack Burma.

America's Dilemma

As a result, the United States, adhering to the so-called "Europe First" doctrine, must wait until it has dealt with Europe before turning its attention to the East Asian front - especially the large-scale counteroffensive in Burma. Needless to say, the United States considers 1943 to be the "year of counteroffensive," and it is based on the premise of large-scale air raids from China to Japan. Therefore, retaking the Burma Road must be a prerequisite. As mentioned above, its ability is at least incapable of simultaneously launching two major operations spanning Eurasia. Therefore, the United States is deeply experiencing a dilemma. Thus, the United States has no choice but to maximize the strengthening and equipping of the air force in China by utilizing the China-India air route, and to decide to carry out air raids on the Japanese mainland within the possible scale; and, on the other hand, to urge the British army to counterattack Burma as much as possible. For this purpose, the British army has launched an attack on the Burmese border since February of this year, but within a month, it has been utterly defeated by the Japanese army. This common tactic of the United States of "using others as pawns" has aroused dissatisfaction and vigilance within the British Indian Army. The Reuters Karachi dispatch reported the following rather strong argument:

"Before the war situation improves, the British Indian Army only needs to adopt a passive defense posture against the Japanese army's threat to India. Given the unrest in India and the overwhelming superiority of the Japanese army, it is not the time to take an offensive against Japan. It is impossible to carry out a large-scale operation to retake Burma with 50,000 or 100,000 troops. We cannot bleed for the benefit of the United States itself."

In short, after half a year of deadly fighting on Guadalcanal, the United States' attempt to advance on the Japanese mainland from the southwestern Pacific has been thwarted. Now it is continuing its desperate efforts to carry out its counteroffensive against Japan from the northern Aleutian Islands and western Burma. Therefore, its future trends should be even more closely guarded. - A Special Correspondent in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Ding: Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, April 10)

### The Arien Unit Achieves Extraordinary Feats

(Dispatched by Oono and Inatomi, Special Correspondents on the Burma Front) The enemy clamored to retake the Burma Road to aid Chiang Kai-shek. This time, the British army first advanced towards the Japanese air base at Akyab. The Japanese army fought bravely to meet the enemy and launched a major annihilation battle in the Irrawaddy River Valley. In this campaign, the Arien Unit, which outflanked the enemy's rear, fought valiantly and made extraordinary contributions. With its small number of determined troops, it broke through the center of the enemy's formation. The indescribable hardships and the spirit of courageous advance can be said to be the blossoming flowers in this major annihilation battle. Without drinking or eating for 70 days, they advanced into roadless territory, broke through the severe terrain of the Arakan Mountains, and completed a 2,300-kilometer march.

In late December of last year, the concealed Arien Unit began to advance secretly northward to Mandalay with its small number of troops. At that time, the Japanese army was trying to destroy the enemy's stubborn counterattack in one fell swoop, and was secretly gathering its forces in the Akyab area. Akyab, which had become a Japanese air base, was blocked on the right by the Arakan Mountains and the Irrawaddy River Valley. It was almost impossible to replenish supplies from the rear.

In order to overcome this difficulty, reconnaissance was dispatched to find a land bypass, which was the initial mission of the Arien Unit. At that time, the enemy army had already taken advantage of the gaps in the Japanese defense line and launched a large army mainly composed of British soldiers from the Burma-India border towards the Maungdaw-Rathedaung line, carrying dozens of tanks and more than a hundred cannons, attempting to carry out a joint counteroffensive. As a result, the area around the Arakan Mountains suddenly appeared to be the center of the enemy army. The Arien Unit was assigned only 000 soldiers under the command of the unit commander, but they dared to break into the center of the enemy army with this small number of troops and carry out a large-scale reconnaissance of the rear of Akyab. Each of the unit commander and his subordinates swore an oath upon departure that they would accomplish their determined mission.

The Arakan Mountains, which stretched far across the Burma-India border, were already as hot as high summer, and the upper part of the mountains extended into the cottony clouds, reflecting a purplish mountain color. The Arien Unit silently entered the dense forest from the main road and proceeded. Before they knew it, large leeches had drilled into the soldiers' uniforms or puttees. During a brief rest in the wilderness, the soldiers looked down and saw the blood flowing down. They immediately untied their puttees and saw five or six leeches gorged with blood and their bodies swollen red, falling to the ground. The unique rotten wood and fallen leaves peculiar to the dense forest had been rotting for many years, emitting a unique stench that rushed into the nose, making people unable to suppress the urge to vomit. Just when they thought they had entered the great dense forest, a high mountain suddenly appeared in front of them, blocking their way, or they were blocked by a torrent as deep as their necks, often delaying the march for several hours. Sometimes they suddenly advanced to the front of the enemy's formation, and sometimes they bypassed the enemy's formation. Relying on the skillful combination of combat and stratagem, the unit was able to continue advancing west and then west again, week after week, and had now broken into the center of the enemy's formation. However, communication with the rear base was completely cut off at that time. Needless to say, there was no supply of food, and the food they were carrying was gone in just ten days. Therefore, they had no choice but to dig up tree roots, eat grass, and drink muddy water, but they still advanced with all their hearts.

After crossing the upper reaches of the Kaladan River, the Arakan Mountains gradually revealed a dangerous appearance, sometimes facing deep valleys, and sometimes steep peaks and cliffs, standing tall in the clouds. The food had already run out, and the future was an uncharted, desolate place. It was truly a time of hardship at the crossroads of life and death. Therefore, they could only advance four or five kilometers a day. However, they still ignored the impossibility and silently continued westward.

At this time, the 00 base finally believed that the Arien Unit would inevitably be completely destroyed in the enemy's formation, and they almost despaired of their survival. It had been seventy days since they departed from the base. Without drinking or eating, they continued their determined march like ants, and had broken through 2,300 kilometers. The extremely dangerous Arakan Mountains were gradually being conquered. On the dawn of February 21, the Irrawaddy River Valley suddenly appeared before their eyes. They had unknowingly reached the enemy's rear, which was advancing from Maungdaw towards Akyab. The Arien Unit then cheered and, in order to encircle the counterattacking enemy army from the rear, continued to advance along the Irrawaddy delta towards Apaukwa.

Coincidentally, a reconnaissance plane from their own side landed on the ground and discovered the Arien Unit, which was greatly surprised because everyone at the base thought that the Arien Unit must have been completely destroyed in the enemy's formation. Who knew that after seventy days, they would have bypassed to the enemy's rear in the Irrawaddy River Valley, which was beyond expectation.

The main force on their own side was originally scheduled to start the joint attack on March 10. Now that the Arien Unit, which had been thought to be completely destroyed, had unexpectedly arrived at the enemy's rear and was about to start attacking from the enemy's rear, they naturally had to take them into consideration. Therefore, the scheduled plan was advanced. The 00 Unit then bravely launched an attack from the south to respond to the Arien Unit, pressing towards the enemy's British army. Thus, the Arien Unit's seventy days of near-death hardship could finally be rewarded. On March 8, the Arien Unit, which arrived on the right bank of the Kaladan River, immediately carried out a surprise attack on 1,200 enemy troops in the Apaukwa area, annihilating them without leaving a single soldier or soldier. Then, they went to respond to the 00 Unit that had come from the south to attack together. Thus, the seventy days of hardship they endured in the Irrawaddy River Valley developed into a major annihilation battle. Ding (...Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, April 9)

### Record of Annihilation Battle in Burma

With the progress of the war situation, the Hong Kong route and the Vietnam route, which were the Anglo-American blood transfusion routes to aid Chiang Kai-shek, were successively cut off. Finally, the Burma route, on which Chongqing relied as its only lifeline, was completely cut off. The anti-Japanese Chiang regime became an "orphan of East Asia," and the poverty in Chongqing deepened with each passing day. Hong Kong and Vietnam were already in the hands of the Japanese army, and the development of the Northwest Route could not proceed smoothly. Therefore, they are now calling for the retaking of Burma in order to reopen the Burma route, and are counterattacking the India-Burma border, but they are ultimately repelled by the Japanese army. The Japanese army has repeatedly cooperated closely between the air force and the ground attack units, overcoming difficult terrain and achieving brilliant results. Before the rainy season, the British Indian Army's two divisions launched a large-scale counteroffensive in the Akyab area of northern Burma, but were wiped out by the Japanese army's three-dimensional mobile operations on the banks of the Mayu River, thus breaking the enemy's attempt to attack.

Roosevelt's policy of strengthening supplies to Chongqing was activated after meetings between Wavell, commander of the British Indian Expeditionary Force, He Yingqin, and Luo Zhuoying. Their operational intentions became active. From around the end of December last year, a part of the British Indian Army advanced southward along the coastal road towards Akyab and Donbaik, while another part carried tanks and artillery towards the Rathedaung front in preparation for a southward advance. In response, the Japanese army also deployed troops in the Rakhaingku area, the Donbaik area, the Rathedaung front, and various areas of Akyab. Supply to Akyab depended solely on maritime transport, and enemy ships in the Bay of Bengal were constantly moving around, and enemy gunboats were also moving back and forth in the Mayu River, so the situation was indeed very dangerous. However, the Japanese army finally overcame these dangers and completed the concentration of forces in the planned schedule by the end of February.

During this period, the enemy often launched counterattacks. In late December and early January, there were very strong offensives, but they were all dealt heavy blows and retreated. Nothing was accomplished.

Operations of the Arien Unit

Coordinating with the concentration of forces in the Akyab area, the Arien Unit, which launched a surprise attack on the enemy from behind, advanced towards its destination through the arduous Arakan Mountains.

The Arakan Mountains are steep mountains with a height of 3,000 meters and untouched by humans. The soldiers of this army used gunpowder to blow up rocks and open roads along the way, traveling only four or five kilometers a day. In the seventy days since the departure, they broke through 300 kilometers and finally reached the plains on March 21. From the departure to cross the mountains, to the Kaladan River, and then to the plains, the supply of food was completely cut off. Even with aircraft reconnaissance, the unit's tracks were often not found.

Advance of the Main Force

The main force predicted the speed of the Arien Unit's advance and scheduled the date for its offensive to be around March 10. Since the unit's arrival was earlier than expected, the scheduled plan was changed, and on March 8, the two units joined forces to launch a surprise attack from behind on the enemy at Apaukwa (right bank of the Kaladan River), annihilating 1,200 captured enemies, and then turning around to defeat the enemy at Kangyokung (southwest of Apaukwa) and advanced to the banks of the Mayu River. One unit of this unit continued north, confronting the enemy in a certain area that had increased southward, while another unit advanced towards the Saingdaung area. In the battles up to March 19, a total of two enemy regiments were annihilated on the left bank of the Mayu River, and they continued north, gathering near Taungmyaung, and began preparing to cross the Mayu River.

At that time, there were 100 enemy gunboats and boats in the Mayu River, preventing the Japanese army from crossing the river. On the night of the 24th, the brave soldiers of this unit used civilian boats to cross the river completely unnoticed by the enemy. By the evening of the 25th, they had advanced to Ataungtana. The deadly battle of the Mayu Peninsula unit, after the brilliant achievements of the Arien Units, supported the arduous battle with a small number of troops against a large number, luring the enemy towards the Donbaik area and blocking their offensive, making extremely great contributions. The enemy was also astonished by the display of its highest level of defensive capability. The unit braved unexpected enemy air raids and heavy artillery bombardment day and night. During their defense, the main force was able to advance towards Indin on the coast. The use of enemy car routes made it extremely advantageous for the Japanese army to employ mobile tactics. In this way, the enemy's attempt to attack was crushed on the banks of the Mayu River.

Significance of this Strategy

Originally, from a geographical point of view, it was extremely difficult to attack the Akyab area from the south because of the steep ridges and crisscrossing rivers, and land transport was extremely difficult. From the direction of Rangoon, it was almost an isolated island. On the other hand, from the direction of India, it was extremely convenient to advance because there were car routes. Moreover, there was an aviation force gathered at the Akyab airfield, and under its cover, it was not impossible to land on the Burmese coast and retake Burma. The enemy was constantly carrying out counteroffensives based on this judgment. This battle turned the enemy's attempt to retake Akyab into a dream. Moreover, the enemy troops attacking in this area in this battle were the British Indian Army's most elite 14th Division, plus another division. All were annihilated before the Japanese army's brave combat and indomitable spirit. This was a great blow to the enemy's combat strength. (Sho: From the Western Asahi Shimbun, April 9)

### The Commerce Control Association Requests Instructions on Six Issues for the Convenience of Work; Directors and Supervisors Telegraph the Ministry of Industry for Instructions to Follow; Handling of Materials Movement Permits Begins Today

The National Association for the Control of Commerce, in order to facilitate its work, requires suggestions and instructions from the government. It held a meeting of directors and supervisors a few days ago and resolved on six key points for suggestions and instructions. A formal telegram has been prepared to request the Ministry of Industry to review and provide instructions for compliance. Details are as follows:

Issue of Announcing Regulations on Major Commodities

(1) Regarding the "major commodities" mentioned in the Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Associations, the detailed categories are said to have been largely determined. It is requested that they be announced as soon as possible.

Issue of Designating Organizations for Industry Associations

(2) It is requested that it be clearly stipulated which major commodities fall within the scope of control, so that industry associations can be organized separately by industry in accordance with the Association's Provisional Regulations and join the Association as members. Currently, the various industry associations are in the process of adjusting themselves in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Associations, and they must wait until after the adjustments before they can join the industry associations as members. If the lower-level organizations are not completed, the Association will not be able to carry out its work of supervision, guidance, purchase, and allocation. It is requested that the Ministry quickly designate all industry associations that should be organized and complete the organization within this month, so that the Association's work can be promoted.

Issue of Procurement Quantity of Materials from Other Ports

(3) Before the establishment of the Association, most of the materials in various counties in other ports were issued permits by the local Japanese Liaison Officer and allocated and sold through the various China Branch allocation combinations or sales negotiation associations. These materials were mostly daily necessities such as soap, matches, candles, and cloth. Now, the various combinations have been ordered to stop working, so the counties have not been able to obtain allocations since March 15th, and they have been requesting relief. At present, the Association's lower-level organizations have not yet been fully organized. During this transitional period, may we be responsible for ordering the chambers of commerce in each county to submit applications for permits to the Association for verification and issuance, based on the quantity of allocated materials obtained in February, so that they can be approved to come to Shanghai to procure and transport them back for distribution to avoid causing panic? It is requested that this be approved. Furthermore, the baseline quantity for the export of various major items in April has been decided by the review committee to be temporarily based on the quantity in March. Now that it is late April, it is requested that the baseline quantity for export in May be decided within this month.

Issue of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Movement Permits

(4) It has been many days since cotton yarn and cotton cloth were ordered to be temporarily suspended from movement. Now, various manufacturers are complaining that raw materials are exhausted and are requesting that the registered yarn and cloth be approved for movement to avoid production stagnation and worker unemployment. What they say is indeed true. May we temporarily allow the industry associations to be responsible for providing proof, which is submitted to the agencies designated by the Ministry for review and approval, so that they can be approved for movement to facilitate production and alleviate the difficulties of merchants? Respectfully request instructions.

Issue of Free Movement of Specific Materials

(5) According to the regulations, specific materials can be moved freely within the Shanghai area and between the areas of the three provinces and two cities. Previously, because the laws and regulations were newly promulgated and the notification was not widespread, misunderstandings and obstructions were inevitable. A letter was submitted to the Ministry, and the Ministry replied that the Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau had been notified to handle it accordingly, and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council had also been notified to handle it accordingly. Recently, various industries have come to the Association to complain that various materials, regardless of whether they are controlled or not, are still being obstructed when moving them. This matter concerns the progress of the Association's work. Please reiterate the previous order and thoroughly notify the relevant parties to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and comply with the laws.

Issue of Overall Planning for Increased Cotton Production

The Association's work involves both the control of consumption and the increase in the production of materials. Issues such as increasing cotton production are of great importance to the adjustment of prices. Agricultural products are seasonal. If we do not proceed in a timely manner, we are afraid that the opportunity will be lost and we will have to wait another year, which will not only affect production but also affect prices. It is requested that the Ministry plan overall and approve the implementation as soon as possible.

### Materials Movement Permits to Be Handled Directly from Today

Since the establishment of the National Association for the Control of Commerce, the two Shanghai offices of the Ministry of Industry were specially requested to take over and assist in handling matters related to materials movement permits. Now that the Association's administrative departments have been organized, it specially dispatched the heads of the audit section's movement group and the general affairs section's visa group yesterday to take over the work. All previous material movement application documents, permits, and other documents have been transferred by personnel from the Ministry of Industry's Shanghai office. Starting today, all matters related to applications for material movement permits will be the responsibility of the Association for the Control of Commerce.

### Tenth Round of Grain Distribution in the Urban Area; Mass Distribution to Begin Within Days

Regarding the tenth round of grain distribution in the urban area, the Municipal Grain Bureau has completed the allocation based on the actual population in the Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, and Pudong districts, and has ordered the public rice distribution offices in each district to pay the fees and distribute the rice. This time, each person, regardless of age, will receive 2.5 liters of grain at a price of 7.5 yuan. Once the rice distribution procedures in each district are completed, the distribution will begin widely. Nanshi District began distribution yesterday. It is said that the rice in that district is whole grain and there is no mixing. The rice tickets for April have also been distributed by the Grain Bureau. However, citizens holding tickets to purchase rice must indicate the number of households in the Baojia system on the back of the rice ticket and have the household head affix a seal to prevent abuses and make the distribution of grain to factories more thorough.

### Japanese Consul General Yano Makes a Statement: No Fear of Air Raids on Shanghai

Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Yano Seiki, said when interviewed by the Continental New Daily yesterday: "From the fact that American pilots attempted to bomb the Japanese mainland on this day one year ago (April 18th) and failed to achieve anything, it can be seen that the American attempt to bomb Shanghai will surely fail." "On this day last year, I happened to be in Tokyo and witnessed American planes indiscriminately bombing schools and hospitals, and using machine guns to strafe fleeing university students. This was extremely inhumane. Compared with Japanese pilots who only bomb military targets with the lowest degree of shooting range, the way of heaven is cyclical, and the failure of American air raids on Shanghai is inevitable." "Citizens of Shanghai must be cautious in case of emergencies. When American planes attacked Tokyo, Japanese citizens had already made considerable preparations. However, in view of the good results of the past few air defense exercises, Shanghai citizens have nothing to fear from American air raids." Yano concluded that although this is the case, the citizens of Shanghai should continue to study air defense techniques, because terror and chaos are even more harmful than actual bombing.

### Police Bureau Assists in Collecting Urban Area Land Tax

After the Incident, land tax in the urban area was completely suspended. Later, when the National Government returned to the capital, all policies were put back on track and the administration was renewed daily. The Municipal Government considered land tax revenue to be a normal national tax revenue and had repeatedly and actively rectified and resumed collection. However, a small number of citizens were found to be unaware of the laws and attempted to evade taxes, which was not right. In order to effectively rectify the situation, the Municipal Government unanimously decided at the district administration meeting that the Municipal Police Bureau would dispatch police to assist in the collection of land tax in the future, in order to increase the national treasury and stop the practice of tax evasion. The Municipal Police Bureau has now received the government order and has immediately instructed the subordinate district branches to assist in order to strengthen the national treasury.

### Meat Stall Fined for Using Short Weights

A notice from the Information Office of the Public Concession states: "Sun Xingcai, the meat stall vendor at No. 45 Xinzha English Field, was found to be using short weights in violation of regulations. After being discovered by the Bureau's Health Department on the 9th of this month, the court sentenced him to a fine of 300 yuan the next day, and the weighing instruments were confiscated as a warning."

### Reform of the Japanese Embassy in China Has Great Significance; To Adapt to the New Situation After the National Government's Entry into the War; Efforts to Promote Unification in the Economic Field

After the Japanese government established the Greater East Asia Ministry last November, it transferred various agencies in China under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Asia Development Board to the Greater East Asia Ministry. The Japanese Ambassador was appointed to direct and supervise them. In addition to Nanjing as the main base, embassy offices were established in Beijing, Shanghai, Zhangjiakou, and other places, and plenipotentiary ministers were appointed to be responsible for them respectively. The various agencies that previously belonged to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Asia Development Board, including consulates general, consulates, and police stations, were also placed under their control. Thus, the unified organization has been established.

Previous Organization

As for the organization of the embassy offices, in addition to establishing a secretariat under the minister, five departments were established: General Affairs, Justice, Economy, Finance, and Culture. In order to adapt to the economic situation at the time, the financial affairs were further divided into general economic affairs, financial affairs, and fiscal affairs. The section chiefs of the various sections handling general economic affairs were staffed by active duty military personnel from the army and navy, so that they could directly handle the matters. The organization of the Japanese embassy office in Shanghai was the same as the above. However, due to the National Government's entry into the war and the progress of Sino-Japanese relations, the situation has changed greatly. At the same time, in order to adapt to this new situation, the organizations of the major embassy offices were reorganized on April 1st of this year.

New Organization

After this reorganization, the new organization only has a secretariat, a deliberation office, and three departments: General Affairs, Political Affairs, and Economy. Each department has various sections. For example, the General Affairs Department has four sections: General Affairs, Information, Investigation, Reporting, and Culture. The Political Affairs Department has three sections: Administration, Police Affairs, and Training. The Economy Department has six sections: Planning, Commerce and Industry, Agriculture and Forestry, Transportation, Finance, and Fiscal Affairs. The main goal of this reorganization is to seek simplicity and efficiency and to exert comprehensive functions.

Overview of the Reform

The main points are as follows: (1) The deliberation office, which previously belonged to the General Affairs Department and was directed by the director of the General Affairs Department, has been promoted to be directly under the minister and has become an auxiliary body to the minister, deliberating or planning various important policies. In other words, it is an auxiliary organ to the minister. (2) The various sections and offices in the embassy office that were directly staffed by active duty army and navy personnel have been abolished, and the active duty military personnel have been reassigned to the deliberation office and the planning office to deliberate on important policies and to be responsible for liaison with the military. (3) In the past, in addition to the deliberation office and the secretariat, there were five departments and fifteen sections: General Affairs, Justice, Economy, Finance, and Culture. After the reorganization, there are three departments and thirteen sections: General Affairs, Justice, and Economy. This can avoid the complexity of affairs and promote the activities of the entire organization, making it more rational. (4) The General Affairs Department has separate sections for information investigation and military reporting to avoid confusion between the affairs of the two sections in the past, and the organization of the former Culture Department has been reduced to a cultural section directly under the General Affairs Department. (5) The Economy Department has newly added a planning section to design ten plans for material movement, transaction transportation, capital labor, etc., to establish price countermeasures, the China Central Development Company's business, and other economic policies related to economic and financial affairs. (6) The Finance Department, which previously made great contributions to financial and currency policies in Central China, has been abolished and merged into the Economy Department. Therefore, the three sections of finance, fiscal affairs, and auditing in the former Finance Department have also been changed to two sections of finance and financial management and merged into the Economy Department. The former auditing department is also included in the new financial management section.

Significance of the Reform

At this point, we can clearly understand the significance of the reform of the embassy office's organization. Since China's entry into the war, the National Government has actively prepared the domestic war participation system, and in order to enhance its combat power, revive industry, and stabilize the people's livelihood, it has first sought to completely transform the free economy into a wartime planned economy. At present, a self-reliant control economic organization has been established, and the entire economic sector has been mobilized to actively promote it. When China entered the war, Japan declared the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, and further eased the rules for the movement of materials in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and transferred the regulatory authorities to the National Government for self-management. In order to cooperate with the National Government in completing the unified currency policy in Central and Southern China with Central Reserve Bank notes, it resolutely abolished the issuance of new military notes. From this, it can be seen that the relationship between China and Japan has become closer, and they are moving together towards the common goal of completing the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, in order to adapt to this situation, the various Japanese agencies in China have reformed their past organizations. From another perspective, the abolition of active duty army and navy personnel serving as section chiefs in the major embassy offices and the trend towards unification of financial officers and economic and financial countermeasures in China by the Ministry of Finance are closely related to the strengthening of the National Government's political power and the success of its currency policy. From this, it can be seen that the reform of the Japanese embassy in China has great significance.

### Exhibition of Chairman's Calligraphy Sensation in the City

The manuscript of Chairman's calligraphy "Stories of Old Friends" has been on public display in the art gallery on the fourth floor of the Great China Department Store since the day before yesterday, creating a sensation throughout the city. The number of visitors has been no less than 10,000 each day, mostly cultural figures and college and middle school students. They all stop to admire it, from beginning to end, not leaving a single word, and praising the fine letter and handwriting. The Great China Art Gallery is shoulder to shoulder, bustling with unprecedented excitement, setting a record. It is a pity that the exhibition period is limited and the whole city has not been able to enjoy it.

### Public Concession Epidemic Prevention Campaign; Health Division Specifies Injection Times

A notice from the Municipal Council states: "From the 20th of this month, citizens can go to the epidemic prevention injection sites set up by the Bureau's various district health divisions or the Baojia authorities in each district to request free epidemic prevention injections and receive epidemic prevention certificates. The addresses of the various district health divisions are listed below:"

(Except Saturday afternoons, holidays, and Sundays)

### Provisional Income Tax Regulations; Rules for Imposing Penalties and Recoveries; Income Tax Payable by Companies and Firms Shall Not Be Declared by Accountants on Their Behalf

The Shanghai Regional Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, shall settle income tax revenues for all industries once at the end of each year. Now that the 31st year has long ended, collection has begun, and the Ministry has issued orders to all industries to truthfully declare the amount of tax payable in order to increase national tax revenue. However, according to the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, the amount of income tax payable by companies and firms shall not be declared by accountants on their behalf, and the district bureaus shall not accept such declarations. Therefore, the bureau will absolutely refuse to accept the declaration by accountants entrusted by various companies and firms to uphold tax policy.

Reasons for Drafting

The declaration of various types of income tax is intended to discover those who make false or concealed statements, as well as taxpayers or those who withhold income tax who fail to pay taxes within the prescribed time limit. According to the provisional regulations, the competent collection agency may transfer the case to the court for punishment. In the past, the courts have not had a set of rules for handling cases that violate the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, and they have often been unable to impose penalties, which has had a significant impact on tax revenue. Minister Luo of the Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that income tax is the best tax system in the world and is suitable for the wartime financial system. Therefore, he drafted a draft of the rules for judicial organs to impose penalties and recover taxes in accordance with the amended Provisional Income Tax Regulations, which was approved by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the 153rd meeting of the Executive Yuan for approval. After this, the income tax competent collection agency will be able to transfer cases of failure to pay taxes within the prescribed time limit to the court for trial, and the court will be able to impose penalties in accordance with the newly promulgated rules. If the taxes are still not paid by the deadline, the court will forcibly execute the recovery of the taxes and fines. When hearing lawsuits, if the court discovers cases of violation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations or other income tax laws, it may also transfer the case to the income tax competent collection agency for verification of the tax amount and then impose penalties or recover the taxes separately in accordance with the regulations. The rules for judicial organs to impose penalties and recover taxes in accordance with the amended Provisional Income Tax Regulations are explored as follows:

Full Text of the Regulations

Article 1: Judicial organs shall, in accordance with these rules, impose penalties and recover taxes in accordance with Article 19 and 20 of the amended Provisional Income Tax Regulations on cases of violation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations that are transferred by the income tax competent collection agency for trial or discovered during the trial of lawsuits.

Article 2: When the income tax competent collection agency transfers cases of violation of the amended Provisional Income Tax Regulations to the judicial organ for trial, it shall immediately state the facts of the violation in detail, together with the relevant documents of the case, and transfer them to the judicial organ. After the case is closed, the judicial organ shall return the original documents.

Article 3: For taxpayers who conceal or make false reports, the income tax competent collection agency shall first directly determine the amount of income and the amount of tax payable in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the amended Provisional Income Tax Regulations, and then transfer the case to the judicial organ for penalty and recovery of the income tax payable in accordance with the preceding article.

Article 4: When a judicial organ discovers cases of violation of the amended Provisional Income Tax Regulations or other relevant income tax laws during the trial of a lawsuit, if it is necessary for the income tax competent collection agency to verify the amount of income and the amount of tax payable, the judicial organ shall state the facts and transfer the relevant documents to the income tax competent collection agency for review and decision in accordance with the regulations, and then transfer them to the judicial organ for separate penalty or recovery. The proceedings of the preceding paragraph shall not be suspended, except as provided by the amended Provisional Income Tax Regulations.

Article 5: The judicial organ shall impose penalties and recover the amount of tax payable for cases of amendment or violation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations in accordance with the provisions of Article 19 and 20 of the same regulations by ruling.

Article 6: If there is dissatisfaction with the ruling in the preceding article, an appeal may be filed with the competent superior judicial organ within five days from the day following the delivery of the ruling. If the appeal is due to dissatisfaction with the amount of income and the amount of tax payable determined by the income tax competent collection agency, the judicial organ may request the income tax competent collection agency to reinvestigate and decide.

Article 7: An appeal to the ruling of the appellate judicial authority may be filed only if there is dissatisfaction with the amount of income and the amount of tax payable determined by the income tax competent collection agency after reinvestigation. The judicial authority accepting the appeal shall apply to the review committee for review and decision on behalf of the judicial authority in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of the amended Provisional Income Tax Regulations.

Article 8: The fine imposed by the judicial organ in accordance with the amended Provisional Income Tax Regulations and the amount of tax to be recovered shall be paid in full by the person subject to the penalty or the taxpayer within a specified time limit. If the payment is not made by the deadline, the penalty shall be enforced and the person sentenced to imprisonment or detention shall be punished according to law.

Article 9: For cases transferred by the income tax competent collection agency for trial by the judicial organ, five percent shall be used to purchase judicial stamps, two percent shall be retained for the judicial organ's office expenses, and the remaining three percent shall be sent to the income tax competent collection agency for distribution as rewards. The percentage of the fine in the preceding paragraph shall be based on the actual amount received. The funds for purchasing judicial stamps shall be included in the judicial revenue item and reported monthly.

Article 10: These rules shall take effect from the date of promulgation.

The Public Concession Municipal Council Police Headquarters and the police personnel of each district will select the most elite members for a grand review to be held at the Racecourse at 2:00 p.m. on Friday. The review will be presided over by the Municipal Council Director-General Katsuo Okazaki. After the review, the Director-General will award various medals to all police personnel who have made contributions. At that time, Japanese military officers and officials from China, Germany, Italy, and France will be invited to participate. This kind of grand review is held once a year as a matter of routine. It was not held last year due to various reasons. Now that the Public Concession's police administration has been adjusted several times and has been completely renewed, this year's review is of great significance. The commands will be given in Japanese during the review. The police personnel in each district have been actively preparing and intensifying training in order to select outstanding personnel to participate in the review. In addition to regular Chinese, Japanese, and Indian detectives, there will also be special Japanese patrols, White Russian auxiliary teams, and reserve teams. The Ward Road Prison will also send personnel to participate.

### Central Police Station Detains Thief; Stolen Money Awaits Collection

Chinese detective Tian Changyuan of the Central Police Station recently detained a thief named Lin Changkang in the concession and seized hundreds of yuan in stolen money. According to the confession, the money was stolen from the Bund area on the Fourth Road, but because the victim did not report it to the police station, it is hoped that the loser will report to the Central Police Station after seeing the report, explaining the amount of money and the circumstances of the theft. If it matches the facts, the money can be collected.

### Mr. Zhang Yipeng Spoke on "Citizen Welfare" Yesterday

Mr. Zhang Yipeng, a veteran of the judicial community, was invited to speak on "Citizen Welfare" at the Jing'an Temple Academic Weekly Lecture yesterday. More than 200 people from all walks of life attended. Abbot Migala delivered an introductory speech, and Mr. Zhang took the stage amid applause. The main points of his speech were as follows: "In recent years, I have been resting in Shanghai and have been urged by all sectors to assist in local undertakings and seek welfare for the citizens. This is my long-cherished wish. However, according to the general observation of Shanghai today, the so-called welfare is only the welfare of a part of the people. Therefore, the prosperity of Shanghai today is distorted, unreasonable, and does not conform to the ideals of the fragrant people. If we want the people to exert their strength and strive for common welfare, we must first rely on the sound local autonomous organizations and the elimination of bad customs, so that everyone has no concerns about their personal safety and property, the citizens are protected, each gets what they deserve, each lives in peace, and each enjoys their work. Last autumn, my colleagues felt the importance of their responsibility and concentrated local manpower to organize an association to study local reforms, and in the form of suggestions, to cooperate with the relevant parties to improve the people's lives, so that they would not suffer from disasters and be in line with the principles of citizen welfare. All sectors may make suggestions at any time. Shanghai is a part of China and also a part of Greater East Asia. Citizen welfare is extremely important." It is said that next week, Master Jizang, who has studied philosophy in India for six years, will speak on the Great Vehicle Accomplishment Theory. The public is welcome to attend the lecture.

### Economic Circle

Shanghai's weekly business interest rate fell from 20 cents to 18 cents. Various daily necessities maintained a weak trend. The industrial and commercial situation was unremarkable.

### Commentary: Japan's New Decision to Maintain Price Controls

The issue of commodity prices has become a serious problem at present. Therefore, methods to resolve this issue have also become a pressing topic. Of course, tightening controls, improving rationing, punishing price gouging, thoroughly investigating hoarding, and so on, are all aimed at solving the problem of commodity prices. However, when it comes to commodity prices, it is better to focus on maintaining low prices beforehand than to exert effort on suppressing high prices afterwards. Looking around the world, Japan, our allied nation, has been most effective in maintaining a wartime low-price policy. It is said that after so many years of war, the extent of price increases in Japan is only about double the pre-war prices on average. Such an achievement is probably unsurpassable by any other country.

The other day (April 16), the Japanese Cabinet meeting again decided on the basic principle of maintaining low commodity prices. Its dual purpose is to stabilize people's lives on the one hand and increase wartime production on the other. Its main method is to pay higher prices for industrial products and apply lower prices to people's consumption. According to this method, when the government purchases industrial products, producers will receive a guaranteed standard price. In other words, the price they receive is sufficient to maintain manufacturing in terms of raw materials. At the same time, the prices that consumers should pay will be maintained at their current levels.

Such a basic principle of maintaining low commodity prices is truly worth learning from. Because the principle of commodity prices lies in stability, and the basic principle of stabilizing commodity prices lies in promoting production. Because after production increases, social materials will naturally not evolve into a situation where demand exceeds supply. Therefore, this column specifically proposed the point of factory cost accounting in the April 5th discussion on "Rationalized Commodity Price Issues," advocating not to let manufacturers suffer excessive losses, which also meant encouraging production to suppress commodity prices.

### Silver and Money Trade Association: Strictly Supervising Member Business; Firms May Not Engage in Buying and Selling of Goods; Pawns Limited to Members of the Trade Association

In order to assist in suppressing speculation and hoarding to curb commodity prices, the Silver and Money Trade Association has not only instructed member firms to carefully lend in accordance with the new method of restricting lending, but also in accordance with government laws and regulations: (1) Each firm shall not provide loans secured by goods to any individual or group other than members of the Trade Association. (2) Each firm shall not engage in the buying and selling of goods. (3) When each firm provides loans secured by goods, regardless of the amount, it must immediately report to the local competent authority for record. As for the pawns already made, the following items should be listed in detail and sent to the Silver and Money Trade Association for transfer to the local competent authority: (1) The name, occupation, and address of each borrower, as well as the name of the company or firm and the name of the representative. (2) Loan amount. (3) Loan period and expiration date. (4) The name and quantity of the secured goods, and the place of storage. (5) Whether there is an extension and whether there is a partial repayment. In addition, at the end of each month, a detailed list of loans secured by goods, divided into principal paid, unpaid, and transferred accounts, should be sent by the association to the competent authority. Violators will be investigated and dealt with according to law.

### Joint Associations of Various Industries: Organizational Principles and Functions

In order to actively establish internal institutions, the Commercial Control Association is currently discussing the Joint Associations of Various Industries, and will complete its organization as soon as possible, so as to restore the normal transactions of various industries as soon as possible. According to reporters, the association has also stipulated the following three general principles of organization: (3) Trade associations related to raw material procurement. (2) Trade associations for manufacturing and processing. (3) Trade associations for product sales. The association has also determined the functions of the Joint Associations of Various Industries as follows: (1) Control and operation, (2) Procurement of raw materials, (3) Promotion of production, (4) Handling of industry allocation.

### After Free Transportation of Food, Rice Prices Plummet

Since the authorities of the two concessions simultaneously revoked the prohibition of moving rice, flour, etc., and allowed free transportation, the people of this city have relaxed. Rice dealers have suffered a great blow, the frenzy of competitive purchases has completely subsided, and the black market of national rice has plummeted sharply. The general public is quite satisfied with the authorities' adoption of this measure.

### Strict Enforcement of Cigarette Price Limits in Urban Areas; List of Retailers, etc., Already Sent to Police Department

Since the implementation of the Huazhong Tobacco Allocation Association's reward and drag-delivery system, the trend of price increases and hoarding by various cigarette paper shops has been curbed. Although the initial delivery to various retailers has not been strictly followed, since the second phase of delivery began, the association has decided to strictly enforce it to rectify the situation. It is understood that in order to prevent various cigarette paper shops in the urban area from profiting for personal gain, the association has specially sent the retail prices and the list of various retail stores and wholesale cigarette merchants in the urban area to the Municipal Police Department to assist in enforcement, so that the cigarette black market can be quelled.

### Decision on Exchange of Goods Between Central and North China

Due to the relationship between the Reserve Bank Notes and the United Reserve Bank Notes, the Central and North China regions have not been able to form a whole group economically, and the trade between the two has not been able to achieve ideal smoothness. The highest authorities believe that this phenomenon is detrimental to the development of the wartime economic system. In the future, they will try their best to open up the current situation so that materials between the two places can be smoothly exchanged. Therefore, Central China will supply North China with wheat, soybean cake, and food materials, while North China will compensate with coal and other materials. However, there is still a considerable surplus. As for the settlement method, it has also been discussed and decided that, based on the fundamental principle of material circulation, the imbalance in the exchange settlement this year will be allowed to exist. The settlement will use both Reserve Bank Notes and non-exchange methods. For important materials in the Reserve Bank Notes settlement part, half of the imbalanced amount will be used as the Reserve Bank's loan to North China as one of the settlement methods. Therefore, the leap in trade between Central and North China and the smooth flow of materials are expected.

### Views of Personnel Participating in the Commercial Control Association

Candle

Only when the Chinese and Japanese business circles unite to organize lower-level institutions can the Commercial Control Association's control of materials fully exert its effect. The rational control of material procurement and allocation is the core of the problem, but how to achieve rationality still depends on the extent to which lower-level institutions are prepared.

Mr. Dike Youzang (candle industry), manager of Rongtai Foreign Firm, who was appointed as the preparatory director of the lower-level institutions, expressed his aspirations as follows when the lower-level institutions were established:

It is said that the authorities' policy is to first control commerce and then control industry. Therefore, the goal this time is how to establish lower-level institutions for procurement and allocation. In this context, the connection between China and Japan is the biggest problem. The good or bad of the connection between the two parties is enough to determine the success or failure.

To organize an allocation mechanism that integrates the Chinese and Japanese business circles, the first thing is to reorganize those scattered Chinese allocation mechanisms.

Second, how to connect with the Japanese allocation combination. Third, how to combine the unified allocation mechanism in the mainland and the allocation mechanism in the Shanghai area. If the above problems are solved perfectly, then materials can flow smoothly.

For example, in the current Shanghai candle manufacturing industry, the Japanese side has Japan Oil and Fat, Izumitsu, Fukuju, and Shanghai Oil and Fat, in addition to the four major factories of Japan Oil and Fat (military management factory). The Chinese side has 28 companies. The total production capacity of the Chinese and Japanese sides is 000. However, most of the Chinese side is family-style industry, with only 60 roots of production capacity for one machine. Each family has as many as five or six machines. Not only is the manufacturing power not as good as the Japanese side, but the quality of the products is also very poor. The future problem is how to ratio the products of the Chinese and Japanese sides and what kind of allocation method to use for various places.

According to the past allocation methods, the products of the Chinese side were not controlled, only the products of the Japanese side were allocated to both the Chinese and Japanese sides.

It is said that the Chinese side is working on preparing for the establishment of a joint association in this direction, while the Japanese side is also engaged in this issue. When it is resolved, the two parties can truly unite. For example, setting up a Chinese-Japanese consultation meeting is also a way. Regarding control matters, Shanghai and the mainland must be unified in any case. Regarding this point, I intend to fully exchange opinions with the Chinese side. In short, it is an urgent task to connect the advantages of China and the advantages of Japan and use its mechanism. (Continental New Report, April 15)

### A Few Words on Success and Failure

— Hu Li

The theory and facts about the two words "success and failure" are well-rehearsed by most people, not to mention the historical evidence since ancient times. As usual, it is best to hide one's clumsiness to avoid making a fool of oneself. But recently, I encountered a matter that could go either way, and I am a little confused. I would like to ask the wise to give me an answer; I just want to vent my melancholy without a way out.

The matter started with buying leather shoes: Buying a pair of leather shoes is naturally not something that ordinary honest salaried people can easily afford. I set a plan to deduct 60 yuan per month from the two items of "regulating the body and mind" and "reducing fat," so wouldn't I get my wish in six months? It is true that "planning is up to people," and I followed the rules for two months, accumulating 120 yuan. I thought I would visit the "footwear" displayed in the window, which looked quite impressive. Thinking that in another 100 days, I would be the owner, I felt a little proud, and my body floated up. Unexpectedly, when I went to take a look, the "footwear" was fine, but its value had increased after two months of "living abroad." It was true that "three days apart, one should look at each other with new eyes," let alone two months; I gasped and turned back. So my plan of accumulating 60 yuan per month was successful, but buying that pair of leather shoes was a failure. Speaking of the two words "success and failure," they are opposites, but could they also be two sides of the same coin, or perhaps the two personalities of a hypocrite? If I compromised and sought a second-best option, it would still be a pair of leather shoes, but would I be worthy of my two months of hardship?

So the feeling came. Xiang Yu couldn't defeat Liu Bang and blamed it on "not the crime of war." Looking at my failure to buy leather shoes, it is the same, with no distinction. However, Xiang Yu is still praised as a hero in historians' comments, getting the partial but not the correct. Regardless of whether Xiang Yu at the time wanted the word "hero" and committed suicide by the Wujiang River, ordinary people think that Xiang Yu may have understood that the general situation was gone and was unwilling to be a "loser is a bandit" and make a fool of himself. Although he committed suicide, he was unwilling, but someone comforted him after his death, so he could rest in peace. In my case, I am neither willing to get the partial, let alone the correct. I am just angry and cut off my sleeves. I am afraid that some people will say that I am afraid of buying a second-best option and becoming an insignificant general and cut off relations with him. Then let me praise myself with another name, but unfortunately there is no suitable one, let it be "Clerk Dian." If you want to ask me what deep meaning it contains, to be honest, I removed the head and tail from the title of the famous "Biography of Clerk Yan," Dian is a minor official not as good as a general, but at first glance, it seems to be the role of the pawnbroker.

While I was angry about the leather shoes, a friend came to enlighten me: "Now everything is rising in price day and night. Not buying it at the time caused today's troubles. I advise you to endure the pain and buy it today, maybe it will go up again tomorrow." I was moved, but the key to success or failure came again. If I had two hundred sheets of white newspaper or some quinine or something else, even if I had succeeded in buying the leather shoes in two months but failed on the leather shoes, I could still break even.

Although I was depressed, I didn't forget to fight, so I still cut expenses—like us who lack the ability to increase revenue. Therefore, I was willing to use the horsepower of 60 yuan per month to fight against the two months. My heart seemed to have more than enough, but I always felt that my strength was insufficient, only the heaven and earth seemed a little smaller.

That friend said again: "Why have you been so thin lately?"

I replied: "I'm running a marathon!"

"Why are you running a marathon for no reason? You're really a little crazy."

"Ha, crazy."

I told him about the 60 yuan and 150 yuan thing. As a result, he said, "You're dreaming." After speaking, he left in a dismissive manner.

Madness plus dreaming, naturally not successful and must be hopeless? Saying that is absolutely appropriate is not very reasonable: Being a civilized person, struggling in worries day and night, doesn't it deeply coincide with Mencius's words that "born in worry and die in ease," he already received the half sentence of dying in ease, which seems to contain some successful meaning, otherwise he would become a passive suicide or a person who shaves his head and wears a cassock and relies on the Three Treasures. The saint, the time, he certainly doesn't refer to this character, then my worry is blessed. In this way, as for the speculator, I hope they can live a year longer, because I have to wait for my "success." But the general citizens (of course, I also have a share) are verbally cursing them, wishing to skin them, eat their flesh, and drink their blood and be satisfied, and I don't know if it is because the meat price is expensive and there is less oil and they are born as fat as pigs, or if they are like me because they can't buy leather shoes and wrongly accuse them of being as treacherous as snakes! I can write, but I read a passage in Zhu Xi's Quotations: "Although literati may not be able to do it, they can speak and write, enough to move people to hear, mostly leading to failure." Because I am waiting to be successful, if I chatter and write nonsense, it is to avoid failure. Alas, this world.

I thought about writing their success stories of getting rich, but I don't have the power to print them and publish them to the world. Thinking about it, I will ultimately sink and float in worries more often, and it is better to be at ease in the crowd than to be dispatched by a few people. Pain is indeed inevitable, but the feeling of comfort in the bones is thicker, and it seems to be a little helpful. Therefore, I, who used to suffer from insomnia, am now like Ah Q, who gained a spiritual victory and got a good night's sleep.

Isn't there some success, just worth a smile?

### My Long Gown

— Hui Ren

Thin smoke curls and floats into the sky, one circle, then another.

My only long gown is gradually turning bluish-gray; it's aging. There's a tear on the left corner, and a tear on the right corner; soon, holes will cover my prized possession. They've found many companions and are happily settling down. I hurriedly consulted a "surgeon" for clothes, asking for a way to expel them. Who knew, the doctor shook her head: "Too late!" She lightly refused. Disheartened, I immediately took it off in anger. My short jacket was exposed—ah, even worse, even more holes where the parasites could live, unfit to be seen! Helpless, I put it back on and waited quietly for a new long gown to replace it.

I pondered and planned, wanting to accumulate some of the human world's demons—money. I disregarded morning and night, I disregarded illness, racking my brains and sweating, shaking my pen, dropping more black ink, row upon row, dot upon dot, on the white paper; heaven favored people's wishes, and I actually caught more demons. The old gown was also filled with joy, about to produce a replacement. I raised my head and stepped into the hometown of long gowns, wanting to hunt for a beloved one. The old gown widened its eyes, completely stunned; its kind had clearly risen in price, risen to the clouds. It regretted leaving home too early, and I measured the demons; I couldn't find an equivalent on the price tags with undried ink. I accompanied it in disappointment back to the asphalt road. My long gown remains a circle, then another circle. (Remuneration transferred to scholarship)

### On Yu Xi's Poetry

— Shen Ji

In the collection of Yu Xi, two distinct moods can be seen. One belongs to a secluded soul, and the other is the resentment caused by a troubled and wandering life. Of course, only the former represents the clear sound of the poet's dreams, because all passionate sounds are harmful to crystal-clear poetic sentiments. However, this sentence is not appropriate for all poets. For example, if it were not for the decline and hardship of the world, I don't think Du Fu would have surpassed a loyal good citizen or a small official. Because Du Fu had no ambition, only loyalty; no deep following of direct response to nature, only a sincere tendency towards good politics. Such a person, in a better environment, would at most show a silent, pleasant smile. Li Shangyin is not like this. We only need to look at a few of his poems to see that he completely lacks that kind of rustic sincerity and humor. Like all "imperfect" geniuses, his heart is full of desires and a kind of inexplicable sadness. We can say that even if he created a world for himself, he would not be able to deal with it without regret. His existence seems to be not for life but for imagination. His tender, child-like emotions, of course, cannot be born in a cruel world. So, like all geniuses without the ability to practice, he entrusts his entire soul to poetry. He has a power to see through the mundane world, seeking beautiful things in the world—things that are not absent in the world, but too few people know how to seek them out. Furthermore, this kind of exploration must first have a kind of self-generated, incomprehensible "melancholy of the heart," because true beauty must become great through this thing. For example, these most beautiful lines of poetry, which one is not deeply stained with "melancholy of the heart"?

Flowers bright and willows dark, grief surrounds the sky,

Having ascended all the city walls, I climb higher still,

Wishing to ask the lone goose where it is going,

I do not know my own fate is adrift.

Heaven cherishes the hidden grass,

The human world values the late clearing. (Late Clearing)

In the red tower, separated by rain, we look at each other coldly,

With jeweled blinds fluttering, I return home alone with the lantern. (Spring Rain)

I do not refuse the title of envious of youthful beauty,

But I pity the flowing dust darkening the candle chamber,

Last night, the west pond was full of cool dew,

The sweet osmanthus blew away the fragrance in the moonlight. (Last Night)

This is not only beauty, but also a feminine delicacy, an excessively gentle emotion with its inevitable regret. This is Li Shangyin's first mood. In fact, he himself felt this kind of thing. He said:

I use clouds to add lines in the morning,

I command snow to compose poems in the cold,

Good times are mostly self-felt,

Are all writers like this...? (Occasional Sentiments)

How could a thoughtful person like him not understand himself? He had deeply realized that he was and always would be a person troubled by thought and haggard for beauty, but in this endless trouble, he was not absolutely without joy. Looking at the following two poems, we can see that on the one hand, he has reached the moment of extreme fatigue, but at the same time he can also be happy; and this kind of joy simply overflows from the soul.

Day by day, the spring light struggles with the sun,

On the mountain city's sloping road, apricot blossoms smell fragrant.

When will my mind be completely free of cares,

To be able to be like a silk thread a hundred feet long.

Dense locks of vermilion door hide green moss,

Deep halls and winding pavilions cause me to pace back and forth.

I first know that the wind rises and the moon contains a halo,

Still the dew is cold and the flowers are not yet open.

Bats disturb the pipes and reeds, endlessly tossing and turning,

Rats overturn the window screens, with little feeling.

Alone in the backyard, I share the remaining incense in the first month. (Dwelling at the Chong Rang Mansion)

Happy, he almost murmured a smile to himself, but except for this time, he rarely rejoiced again. He cannot wait forever in this secluded mansion. His ambition led him to run into the world, but in the world, he was forever disappointed.

Speaking of his ambition, and the other mood produced by this kind of ambition, I just want to say a few simple words. Li Shangyin was a person with great ambition, and this ambition was almost exaggerated, completely incompatible with his gentle character. For example, in his youth, he had such ambition, "Forever remembering the rivers and lakes, grieving over white hair, wanting to turn the world upside down into a small boat," but his era was chaotic, and his fate was particularly setback. After many years of struggle and ups and downs, he lamented, "How can I share the task of rectifying the country, which is not in line with my long-held aspirations." This is really pitiful. He felt that his entire life was being lost in mistakes. He was always in a big dream without getting to live. He said, "I am worried that I have a dream like a big dream, and I am even more worried when I expect you not to come." This is true. It is simply impossible for a thoughtful person to formulate a true life and want to achieve it. He will never succeed, just as Yeats said, "You were born for something more difficult than success."

### The Human World

— Mu Zhi

A gloomy night,

Meditating in a daze.

Fine threads of rain floated in through the small window;

Soaking my hair;

Soaking my cheeks.

I woke up with a start,

Far away, a night owl was wailing.

The pitch-black surroundings were like a desolate graveyard.

Summoning up courage, I shouted wildly.

——No echo.

Opening my eyes, searching for a ray of light,

The moon was devoured by dark clouds,

Not a single star either.

The cold wind stood my hair on end,

The fine rain soaked my entire body.

A burst of sorrow surged from the bottom of my heart,

Owl's cry, wind, rain, sobbing;

Playing Tchaikovsky's "Pathétique Symphony."

### The Old Cobbler and His Wife

— Wen Fan

In the kitchen shed downstairs from us lives an old cobbler, a skinny little man in his fifties, hunched over like a shrimp, hardly able to lift his head. His face is covered in wrinkles, like a jumble of knots. But his complexion is red, that murky, pig's-blood kind of color...

He has no children, only a wife who is about the same age as him. He contemptuously calls her "the old woman." She is half a head taller than him, but her face is pale and just as wrinkled, making her look even older than her husband.

The old cobbler is very amiable outside, not much of a talker, but always smiling; as if he has immense joy. The maids and poor housewives also like him; his shoes are sturdy, and his prices are cheap. But at home, his temperament becomes very volatile, and he is often heard cursing his wife, sometimes even hitting her, holding her head down and pounding her skull as if hammering a nail.

"You old hag, I'll beat you to death... I wish I could..."

His wife, however, is as meek as a lamb, silently enduring his insults and beatings. She never fights back. At most, she sobs quietly, muttering a complaint:

"Sins from a past life... sins..."

One evening, I was washing shoes at the tap when I saw the old cobbler drinking at the table. His wife, having finished eating, sat opposite him, taking apart old shoes, only occasionally glancing at him. The old cobbler glared, angrily cursing:

"You old hag, what are you looking at me for?... Are you wishing I would die sooner? Say it, you old hag..."

His wife cried out, wronged:

"Truly, sins from a past life, when did I ever curse you?... I was seeing if you had finished your wine, the rice is getting cold... Truly, sins..."

The old cobbler's anger had not subsided. He took a sip of wine and glared at her fiercely; until he had finished the last drop. Suddenly, he shouted angrily again:

"What are you doing, trying to starve me to death?... Not even serving me rice?... Good, you're asking for it..."

His wife, startled, stood up to serve him rice, still explaining softly:

"I was dazed... a damned knot... Truly, sins..."

Even after the lights were turned off and they had probably crawled into bed, one could still hear the old cobbler's murky, delirium-like voice:

"Why won't you die, you old hag! Just looking at you makes me seethe with anger..."

Then, one evening, after dinner, the air was quiet, and suddenly, the old cobbler's angry voice erupted again:

"Beast! Old hag... I... I'll beat..."

The kitchen shed suddenly seemed to be in an uproar: the tables, benches, and metal nails, awls, clashing in a chaotic mess. The old cobbler gasped madly, shouting:

"You old hag, you want to murder me... I'll kill you first!"

The whole house and the back alley were in an uproar. Everyone crowded around his door, only to see the old cobbler grabbing his wife's hair with one hand and pounding her head with his fist with the other, striking her fiercely. His wife sobbed, waving her hands feebly. Her overly long body was bent over in a terrible way, her face was ashen, and blood was flowing from her mouth.

Several people went forward and pulled them apart. The old cobbler, seeing us, relaxed. He smiled sheepishly and held out his left hand, with a wound on his thumb, bleeding.

"Look, gentlemen,... the shoes she took apart still had nails left in the heel,... isn't she deliberately trying to kill me?... This old hag, look at how vicious she is..."

His wife sat on the ground sobbing, wiping the blood from the corner of her mouth with her sleeve, defending herself:

"Truly sins, you say I did it on purpose... I just had a moment of blurred vision, I didn't see clearly... Truly..."

The old cobbler glanced at her again, but he didn't explode for quite some time. He smiled at us sheepishly again.

"Hehe... Look, gentlemen, where in the world could you find an old woman like this?... What is she like? Just a few slaps and she cries like this, hehe,... I'll tell you gentlemen, before, when my master beat my thumb to a pulp, I didn't dare even make a sound..."

After everyone had left, the old cobbler closed the door, and we heard his murderous voice again:

"You old hag, you want to harm me, fine... One day, I'll kill you..."

A few days later, his wife fell ill. At first, we still heard her low moans as she got up to empty the chamber pot and light the coal stove, but eventually, she couldn't get up anymore. As soon as the old cobbler left, she started moaning loudly... but the old cobbler still had his old temper, scolding at every turn:

"You're pretending to be dead to show me, are you?... You old hag, you're tormenting me... I have to work and cook for myself..."

His wife moaned softly, saying with difficulty:

"Sins from a past life... feel my forehead..."

That day, on a gloomy winter morning, the old cobbler got up early to light the coal stove. He was probably struggling with the coal fumes and started cursing fiercely again.

"Why won't you die, you old hag... You're tormenting me..."

After a while, suddenly, the old cobbler's desperate cry was heard:

"Ah, old woman;... what's wrong?... Ah, old woman is dead..."

He ran madly to the platform by the tap, calling out hoarsely:

"Old woman is dying... Ah, old woman, what's wrong..."

He ran back in and shook the old woman's increasingly stiff body violently; the planks creaked as if they were about to break. We stood far away at the door, afraid to run in: we only heard the old cobbler stamping his feet madly, his face covered in tears and snot, still shaking her.

"Old woman, you... ah, why did you have to die..."

The next day, several people came to carry the body away. The old cobbler first shed silent tears, but as soon as the body was carried away, he suddenly threw himself on the empty planks, howling like a wolf. Sometimes he pulled his own hair, sometimes he tore at his cotton-padded jacket with all his might, howling:

"Old woman, it's my fault... I tormented you to death... Why? I ruined my heart and liver with drinking... I have no heart..."

The old cobbler didn't go to work, nor did he eat. He didn't sleep at night either. All day long, his eyes stared blankly like a dead man's, then suddenly burst into piercingly mournful cries... No one dared to approach him.

A few days later, he packed up his simple luggage and moved away... No one knew where he went. Some said he went to the countryside, others said he was watching the alley somewhere, his face so thin that only his cheekbones remained...
