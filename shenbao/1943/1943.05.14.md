### Prospects for the European and Asian War Situation

The year 1943 will be the year of decisive battles in this world war, and also the year that determines the future world situation. While it is difficult to definitively confirm this view right now, judging from all the movements of the belligerent parties since the Lunar New Year, the thoroughness of their preparations, the comprehensiveness of their mobilization, and the importance that all parties attach to the future war situation, we can conclude that the scale and significance of the summer war that is about to unfold will be unprecedented.

First, concerning the North African war situation, the retreat of the Axis forces from Tunisia and Bizerte has already begun a pivotal shift. That is, the North African war situation is no longer one of the focal points of the world war; this focal point has shifted to the Mediterranean. Since this spring, under the pressure of the overwhelming strength of the anti-Axis forces, the Axis forces in North Africa, under the command of Generals Rommel and Arnim, have waged the most arduous struggle, buying several months of time so that the work of "fortifying the European continent" could be completed in an orderly manner. In addition to this main task, the Axis forces also had two major tasks: (1) To give the anti-Axis forces as much of a blow and attrition as possible, pre-emptively weakening the fighting will and strength of the Anglo-American forces to invade the European continent; (2) To preserve the excellent combat capabilities of the Axis forces in North Africa as much as possible so that in the most critical situation, they could be transferred to other strategic points in the Mediterranean or European positions. To date, the anti-Axis propaganda apparatus has not been able to point out the fact that the North African Axis forces have failed to complete the above-mentioned tasks. Secondly, after the withdrawal from Tunisia and Bizerte, as Gada, the chief writer of the Italian newspaper Gazzetta del Popolo, pointed out: "The war of Anglo-American imperialists has gradually shifted from the African continent to the European continent" (Rome telegram from the Central News Agency on the 11th). However, here we cannot ignore the following three facts: (1) Even the propaganda dispatches of the Anglo-Americans cannot but admit that at present, the Axis forces still have a large force of more than 100,000 troops in the southeastern mountains of Tunisia and the Cape Bon Peninsula, maintaining their strong combat power. This is a powerful restraint on Anglo-American aggression against the European continent. (2) As Gada pointed out in the above-quoted article: "The Axis forces have now completed their European defense plan. This can be proved by future facts." It is a big question whether the Anglo-American forces, whose consistent strategy is to take advantage of opportunities, and who have not yet completed the closest and seamless unity in strategy and command, will blindly move forward lightly. (3) General Franco of Spain's call for peace (Lisbon telegram from the Central News Agency on the 10th), and Turkish Prime Minister Saracoglu's statement regarding the transition from absolute neutrality towards Britain to restoring non-belligerent status (as published in the evening edition of the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun on the 11th), these subtle political or diplomatic developments cannot be ignored for their role in easing the war situation. Therefore, while we should point out the possibility of European warfare and the inevitability of its unfolding future, we must also point out that the focus of the recent war situation is still on the Mediterranean naval and air war and the submarine war in the Atlantic.

Looking at the German-Soviet battlefield again, it has been almost silent for nearly two months since late March. During this period, common sense can tell us that both sides are preparing for large-scale operations in the future. The Axis forces' preparations seem to have taken longer than the Soviet Union's. They have stopped their offensive since the winter of 1942 and are preparing for a second major offensive, while the Red Army was still engaged in intense combat until mid-March of this year. Therefore, the effectiveness of the strategic preparations of the two sides will naturally not be equal. In terms of space, the scope of Germany's total mobilization and the limitation of the Soviet Union to the historically weak area east of the Urals can be clearly seen by comparing the world map. As for the quality, including both spiritual mood and material equipment, it is naturally not easy to judge lightly, but according to German experts: "The Soviet Union's thorough mobilization of men and active expansion of military industry to fill the personnel and material losses suffered in the winter war has largely been successful, but this is a quantitative aspect, and the qualitative aspect of the soldiers is far lower than when the winter counter-offensive began; the Soviet army seems to have restored its previous strength in terms of weapons and equipment, and its heavy weapons have been greatly enhanced." (Berlin telegram from the Central News Agency on the 11th) Judging from the above aspects of time, space, and quality, it can be seen that it seems impossible for the Soviet Union to cooperate with the United Kingdom and the United States and launch an offensive in the summer. On the contrary, although the Axis forces have increased their attention to defense in the Mediterranean and Europe, generally speaking, their strategic goal has never shifted from the Eastern Front. Therefore, the decisive war will still be played out on the Eastern Front, and the day of its arrival will be sooner.

Finally, we have always attached importance to the decisive impact of the East Asian war situation on the world war. The biggest concern for the United Kingdom and the United States in their strategic plan to invade the European continent is the rapid expansion of Japanese military and political power in the Pacific. What the heads of the anti-Axis forces have been concerned about recently is mainly "where Japan will attack tomorrow." Their estimates roughly fall into the following three points: (1) The opening of the northern route, which the United Kingdom and the United States are promoting, and which contains the malicious intention of provoking Japanese-Soviet relations. (2) The southern route, advancing into Australia. Recently, not only the Australian authorities are terrified, but also the Anglo-American Pacific operations authorities are constantly crying for help. (3) The western route, the recent victory in the operation on the Burmese-Indian border, has further increased the threat felt by the United Kingdom and the United States. Comprehensively, the anti-Axis forces' mood of being terrified at every sound deeply depicts their loss of fighting spirit and predicament in the Pacific. In fact, the Japanese army has indeed maintained absolute initiative and maintained a superior position from which it can launch offensives in any direction. When the world war situation begins a new transformation, it will not neglect the opportunity to win greater victories. As for the recent political renewal and strengthening of the total war system, in diplomacy, Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China, Manchuria, and the Philippines, and Minister Aoki's visits to various parts of the South Seas, as well as new measures in internal and external economy, have all shown the thoroughness and perfection of preparations for the decisive battle in the near future, and the fuller tension of the national power of Japan and East Asia. As we discuss this, what we feel guilty and uneasy about is that the strength that our China has exerted before this serious overall situation is too limited. In particular, the Yu Communist regime continues to resist stubbornly, which is extremely unfortunate from the perspective of our country, and should arouse a sense of self-blame from the perspective of China's responsibility to the world. The recent two-stage offensives by the Japanese China Expeditionary Force in the Jin-Yu border area, the Jin-Cha-Ji border area, and the southwest bank of Dongting Lake clearly illustrate the need for China to further invigorate its own strength to assist Japan in advancing its future strategy. Here, we not only hope for the awakening and efforts of our compatriots in the peaceful areas, but also hope that our compatriots under the Yu Communist regime will recognize the reality, get rid of the shackles, and jointly sacrifice and struggle, embark on the bright road, and jointly seek the true liberation of the East Asian nations in the dramatic transformation of the world war situation.

### Military Inspection Group of the National Government Leaves Japan and Arrives in Shanghai with Ye Peng and His Entourage

The military inspection group dispatched by the National Government to Japan, Army General Ye Peng, Sun Liangcheng, Hu Yukun, and Army Lieutenant General Xiang Zhizhuang, Yang Zhonghua, and his entourage, have thoroughly inspected the various military facilities of friendly countries since they went abroad across the sea, using them as a mirror to enhance our country's military strength after participating in the war. It is now learned that General Ye and others have completed their mission in Japan, and they safely returned to China by plane on the afternoon of the 12th. Lu Ying, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau and Deputy Commander of Security, and others went to the airport to greet them. After exchanging greetings, they were led to the official residence to rest. Last night, Lu held a banquet at his private residence, and the guests and hosts were very happy. It is said that Mr. Ye and others will stay in Shanghai for a while before going to Nanjing to meet the Chairman and report on the inspection in Japan.

The members of the group talk about their feelings after visiting Japan

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) The military observation group sent to Japan by the Chinese National Government has made a detailed inspection of the war capital Tokyo and its surrounding areas, and the impression gained is very good. They have left here on the 12th to return to China. The following is the general idea of the impressions expressed by General Ye Peng, the head of the group, and others before their departure.

General Ye Peng (Minister of the Army of the National Government) said: I have gained a lot of impressions from this visit to friendly countries. In general, Japan in the decisive battle period has become a large barracks. In this large barracks, everyone and everything is moving in tension. In addition, with abundant resources and increased production, there is no shortage of materials, and it can indeed carry out a long-term war. The fighters in this large barracks all have the spirit of "life-or-death" and the belief that "the Greater East Asia War will be won." All of this can only make me admire. One thing worth mentioning is that when we visited a certain Japanese national school, the principal of the school personally acted as a guide. When we were walking to a certain wall, there was a water tap that was not turned off, and the water was gurgling. The principal immediately stepped forward and turned it off. Although this matter is small, the feeling is very deep, because it is enough to show the spirit of thrift and the seriousness and responsibility of the Japanese people in dealing with things. This is really worthy of our emulation. General Sun Liangcheng (Commander-in-Chief of the Second Front Army of the National Government) said: Before coming to Japan, I already had a good impression in my imagination. After arriving in Japan, I gained a clearer and deeper understanding after detailed inspection. In particular, the national spirit of the Japanese people in this decisive battle period is even more worthy of our admiration. In the past, China emphasized spirit, and Europe and the United States advocated material things, because they were all biased towards one end, so various evils also occurred. But Japan can just integrate spirit and material into one, using both inside and out, so it has today's strength and today's results. This is incomparable to any country. I have seen a lot during this visit to Japan. What I feel most deeply is the wisdom and perfection of the control policy. This is not a manifestation of the lack of materials, but a necessary countermeasure in wartime. Due to the rationality of the control methods, the Japanese people, regardless of their status, wealth, or poverty, can have an equal enjoyment and ensure the stability of their lives. There is an ancient Chinese saying, "We are not afraid of scarcity, but of inequality." Japan can just achieve this "equality." The so-called hoarding and profiteering for personal gain are unheard of in Japan, which is enough to reflect the stability of Japan's economy and people's livelihood in wartime.

### After the Offensive in Dongting Lake, the Japanese Army Achieves Great Results

Guangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency) After the Japanese army launched an offensive in the Dongting Lake area, it has dealt a great blow to the central part of the Sixth War Zone of the Yu. According to the Yu, the Dongting Lake area and Sichuan Province are both (granary areas) of the Yu. Now, after this blow, the anxiety of the Yu can be imagined. According to the Yu telegram, the Yu Sweeping Report 13 also said that the Japanese army's operation in the Dongting Lake area has caused a deep blow and loss to the only remaining granary in the Hunan war zone, which is a huge economic wound. Therefore, the embarrassment of the Yu can also be seen from this.

Hunan Front, 13th (Central News Agency) The 29th Army Group of the Yu was badly defeated by the Japanese army on the banks of Dongting Lake, and it seems to have collapsed. Only the senior cadres and officers escaped. According to the latest news received from the Hunan front, the Yu is quite anxious because the 29th Army Group lost its troops and land. Therefore, it has recently ordered Sun Lianzhong, the acting commander of the Sixth War Zone, to quickly save the decline. In addition, the Yu's 10th Army Group is afraid of the Japanese army's lightning warfare and is currently doing its best to defend the key points of Lixian and Jinshi in the northwest of Hunan Province, actively building fortifications.

Nantang, Hunan Province, 13th (Central News Agency) Nantang was occupied by the Japanese army on the 8th. Because the Yu army had implemented a scorched earth tactic, the entire city was reduced to ruins, and the residents had no homes to return to and were waiting to be fed. The situation was very tragic. After the Japanese army entered the city, they immediately provided relief. The general residents expressed their deep gratitude for this and decided to start construction work from the ashes of the scorched earth to seek the restoration of China. In addition, when the Yu army withdrew from Nantang, they were too embarrassed, so they left behind a large amount of wood used for building barracks and warehouses. The Japanese army plans to distribute part of it to the residents for building houses, and the rest will be used for building Hunan Province. The Japanese army has now obtained the assistance of the residents and formed a raft unit on the right bank of Jiudu, sailing upstream to a certain place.

### Commander-in-Chief Hata Visits Tong to Inspect the Qingxiang Area in Northern Jiangsu

Nantong, 13th (Central News Agency) General Hata Shunroku, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army stationed in China, visited the Qingxiang area in northern Jiangsu. He left Nanjing with his entourage on the 13th and arrived in Tong at 11:00 a.m. Those who went to welcome him included Li Shiqun, Secretary-General of the Qingxiang Committee, Zhang Beisheng, Director of Qingxiang in Northern Jiangsu, Sun, Secretary-General of the Party Office, and representatives of various agencies and students from various schools, totaling more than a thousand people. There were dense military and police along the way, and the security was strict. The Commander-in-Chief shook hands with the welcomers as a courtesy, and then, amid the music, took a car to the resting place.

### Three Thousand Communist Party Members Declare Their Withdrawal from the Communist Party

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency)

According to information obtained by the Nanjing Continental News, the Chongqing-based newspaper (Jie Bao) published in Jiangxi Province reported that 3,000 members who had joined the CCP, feeling the contradiction in the CCP's theory of resistance, issued a joint declaration of withdrawal from the CCP. The above-mentioned incident occurred in the CCP's base camp, Jiangxi, which shows that our theory of harmony and transportation is correct. It is reported that the content of their declaration of withdrawal is as follows: Since the War of Resistance, the crimes of the CCP have been well known. The CCP's purpose of resistance is purely for their own selfish calculations, and our people are only sacrificed for them. In particular, the CCP's conspiracy has become increasingly exposed recently, and it is attempting to eliminate the Kuomintang and demand the cancellation of all legitimate administrative organizations of the government, almost intending to replace the existing political control forces. In order to fight against the CCP, we hereby declare our withdrawal. The above-mentioned departing cadres include (1) Huang Luping, former Secretary of the CCP Jiangxi Provincial Ganxin Southwest Special Committee, (2) Zhang Lu, Secretary of the Ganxi Northwest Special Committee, (3) Xu Liangshan, Secretary of the North Special Committee, (4) Shi Ping, Director of the Yuebian Youth Department, (5) Yang Fusheng, Secretary of the Gandong Special Committee, (6) Qiu Meifeng, Member of the Minbei Special Committee, etc., totaling nearly 3,000 people. It is worth noting that as our government regains governance in Jiangxi Province and its political power expands.

### Ministry of Finance Restricts the Establishment of New Financial Institutions

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency)

Regarding the restriction on the establishment of new financial institutions in the Shanghai area, the Ministry of Finance issued a statement as early as December 18th of last year, stopping registration. More than several months have passed, but there are still a few new financial institutions opening one after another in the Shanghai urban area. The outside world does not know the truth, and there may be doubts about this. Therefore, the reporter visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance about this matter, who gave a brief account of the actual situation, saying that since the Ministry issued a statement on December 18th of last year, stopping registration, all applications for new financial institutions in the Shanghai area that were submitted to the Ministry after December 18th of last year were rejected in order to achieve the government's policy of controlling finance. As for the fact that there are still a few financial institutions opening one after another in the Shanghai area after the registration was stopped, they were all submitted to the Ministry before December 18th of last year and had been approved for handling at various times. In addition, there are also partnership organizations and money shops that were approved by the Ministry to extend the deadline to change to joint-stock companies. They were delayed in opening due to the unfinished preparation for reorganization. They were not newly established with the approval of the Ministry after the registration was stopped. Therefore, a special announcement is issued to clarify the truth.

### Huazhong Railway Plans to Dig a Yangtze River Tunnel

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) Huazhong Railway Company recently plans to dig a tunnel under the Yangtze River to connect the Jinghu and Jinpu railways, and is currently investigating. Because there is a Yangtze River between Xiaguan and Pukou, it is very inconvenient for passengers to travel back and forth. In order to solve this transportation difficulty, it is planned to dig into the ground near Hepingmen Station and then cross the Yangtze River, and dig out north of Pukou Station on the north bank. The entire project will take five years, and the project cost will be 70 million Japanese yen. After this project is completed, Nanjing, Jinpu, Beijing, Xinjing, and Kyoto and other places will be directly transported.

### Mr. Wang Yitang's Speech to Reporters in Tokyo

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency)

Mr. Wang Yitang, a member of the National Government of the Republic of China and former Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, after arriving in the north on the 11th, immediately visited Prime Minister Tojo and members of the Japanese government to express his gratitude for past Japanese assistance and held various cordial talks. At 5 p.m. on the 12th, he also hosted a press conference at the Imperial Hotel, stating in essence, "The purpose of my visit to Japan is to express my gratitude to the Japanese side for the assistance given to me during my tenure as Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission and to observe the wartime situation in Japan. China joined the war in January of this year and is cooperating with Japan to defeat Britain and the United States. The entire country is under the leadership of Chairman Wang, and everyone is actively working in their respective positions, devoting all their efforts to cooperate with Japan in all aspects of politics and economy to win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. The current China, especially the North China region, is in the rear and bears an even greater mission. Before the National Government announced its participation in the war, North China actively assisted Japan. After the National Government's entry into the war, it has worked even harder to ensure public order, stability, and people's livelihood, in order to contribute to the enhancement of the Greater East Asia war effort. This time, Japan has changed its policy towards China, and the people of China have unanimously expressed their goodwill. The recovery of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights have been the goals that the Chinese people have strived to achieve since the Opium War. Now, thanks to Japan's friendly measures, these goals have finally been realized, for which the Chinese people are particularly grateful. At the same time, China will certainly make even greater efforts to promote wartime policies in the future. Although I have now resigned from the post of Chairman of the North China Committee, given the importance of the current situation, I am determined to contribute to the revival of China and the defense of East Asia in the future, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, with my powers as a member of the National Government."

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency)

The Japanese Imperial Family has decided to award the First Class Order of the Rising Sun Grand Cordon to Mr. Wang Kemin, member of the National Government of the Republic of China, Mr. Wang Yitang, who is currently visiting Japan, and other Chinese dignitaries for their significant contributions to Sino-Japanese friendship. The award has been officially announced by the Japanese Decorations Bureau. Mr. Wang Yitang's medal was presented by Foreign Minister Shigemitsu at 4:40 p.m. on the 13th. The four Chinese dignitaries who received awards this time are Mr. Wang Kemin, a Third Class Order member of the National Government of the Republic of China; Mr. Wang Yitang, a member of the National Government; Mr. Zhu Shen, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission; and Mr. Hong Zhi, President of the National Government's Control Yuan.

According to the Italian military authorities, a total of 53 enemy planes have been shot down by Axis fighter squadrons over Sicily in the past three days, and the total from the 1st to the 10th has reached 132.

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to an official announcement today: Another Axis hospital ship was attacked by Anti-Axis aircraft in the Tunisian waters. Qualified sources here pointed out that this type of attack has occurred ten times in eight days.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - German military circles declared today that the Axis forces are still stubbornly resisting in the mountainous areas of Tunisia, but the German and Italian forces on the southern front have had to abandon resistance because they are out of ammunition and have no reinforcements. They are still able to inflict heavy damage on the enemy forces under the enemy's pincer attack. Rome announced that the Italian First Army has been ordered by the King to cease resistance, but the commander of the army, General Mais, still refuses to surrender and continues to resist.

### Turkish Parliamentarians Reiterate Determination to Remain Neutral - All Able-bodied Men Must Not Evade Military Service - Some Government Agencies Moved Out of Ankara

Istanbul, 13th (Central News Agency)

Sadak, the editor-in-chief of the famous Turkish newspaper Akşam, recently wrote an editorial stating: Turkey has no territorial ambitions or demands, and this principle has not changed to this day, because it is very satisfied with its own destiny and has no intention of changing its position. Turkey's armed neutrality policy is a wise move and will continue. The world should understand Turkey's position. It is regrettable that there have been some doubts raised recently by people at home and abroad. These people believe that once a second front is established in the Mediterranean or the Balkans, the most likely offensive and defensive routes for the belligerent countries will be through Turkey, and therefore they believe that Turkey will be forced to abandon its current policy. In fact, Germany will not change its relationship with Turkey while concentrating all its forces on the Eastern Front. Recalling that during the Balkan campaign, German troops stopped when they reached the Turkish border and immediately concluded a treaty of friendship with Turkey. Today, Turkey has gained the complete trust of the world and Germany.

Ankara, 13th (Central News Agency)

According to Washington news: The Roosevelt-Churchill meeting opened at the White House yesterday. The two men have already held an informal conversation, and the number of participants is increasing daily. Canadian Prime Minister King has announced in the House of Commons that he will leave for Washington next week to attend the meeting. Although there is no definite news that Australian Foreign Minister Evatt and Chongqing Foreign Minister Song Ziwen will attend, they are staying in Washington and have not gone elsewhere. Czech President Benes also visited the White House yesterday and is said to be discussing the future relations between the countries of Central and Eastern Europe with President Roosevelt and Hull.

At the same time, the White House revealed today that post-war issues are also one of the topics of the meeting.

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency)

British sources solemnly stated that although Lord Beaverbrook came to the United States on the same plane as Churchill, he was not among the entourage and was traveling to the United States in a private capacity. According to the Associated Press in New York, the exact date and route of Churchill's arrival in the United States have not been announced. The only report is that Churchill came to the United States by plane and then took a train to Washington.

Asian Issues Also to Be Discussed - Louisville, 12th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Washington, well-informed sources in Washington expect that the main topic of discussion at the upcoming meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill will be how to implement the plan to open the first battlefield in Europe, as outlined at the Casablanca Conference.

Chongqing Foreign Minister Song Ziwen. Madame Chiang Kai-shek (Soong Mei-ling). As well as Roosevelt's personal representative in India, Philip, who is currently in Washington, may participate in the meeting.

Berlin Speculates That Politics Is More Important Than Military Affairs

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry announced today that Stalin's absence from the British-American meeting held in Washington indicates that the discord between the Anti-Axis countries still exists. The spokesman commented that the special feature of the meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill is the absence of the Soviet leader. In the past few weeks, British and American newspapers have advocated the necessity of holding consultations between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, but there has been no response from Moscow. This fact shows that the military personnel accompanying Churchill are only representative in nature, and the political issues that have arisen since the Casablanca Conference will undoubtedly occupy a prominent place in the negotiations. Therefore, Stalin's absence from the Washington meeting is only natural, which also proves that the Anti-Axis countries described by the United Nations are mistaken. After the Casablanca Conference, Britain and the United States assured the world that they had decided on the Anti-Axis military plan for the next nine months. It is now only April, so it can be assumed that this meeting is more political than military. (3) Abandoned farmlands, back

### A Great Tragedy in World History (3)

— Tokutomi Iichiro

(3) Abolish Religion

Leave Religion

England is a nation established on the principle of thorough individualism. While this does not pose any significant obstacles during times of national peace and in the conduct of national affairs, it can suddenly become a fatal problem when the nation faces adversity. This is because individuals exist for the sake of the nation, and therefore, it is necessary to turn to individuals and demand that they exist for the sake of the nation. In England, when emergencies arise, acts of valor and public service, while not entirely absent, are merely exceptions.

In such circumstances, although the nation exists for the sake of the individual, maintaining this nation is essentially protecting the individual's interests. Therefore, an individual's sacrifice for the nation ultimately amounts to nothing more than an individual sacrificing for the individual. According to the Utilitarian philosophy, the individual should also be required to sacrifice for the nation.

For this reason, even at the crossroads of survival, England cannot implement conscription. Even if it does, it is only after the war has already intensified, and even then, it cannot be implemented effectively. Even at such times, the laborers engaged in manufacturing military supplies make improper or excessive demands of the government regarding wages; if their demands are not met, they do not hesitate to resort to strikes. In Japan, such actions would be regarded as treason against the nation; however, in England, no one finds such phenomena strange.

Napoleon was correct in calling the English "a nation of shopkeepers." The English are not an agile and vigorous nation. Although they have achieved great things, their nature, no matter what, cannot escape calculations of profit—they cannot escape the nature of a shopkeeper wearing an apron. This shopkeeper's nature and the pirate's nature complement each other, and this is the factor that has made England a great world empire.

However, it is also for that reason that England has forgotten agriculture, neglecting the fact that a halt in maritime transport would lead to starvation. During the outbreak of World War I, German submarines displayed their power. If the situation had continued for another two weeks, eight million Londoners would have starved to death.

Learning from past mistakes, England now has a considerable stockpile of food and other supplies, but that is not unlimited. Previously, planting potatoes in parks and wheat on golf courses were emergency measures, but they were only temporary solutions and did not fundamentally address the past.

The English were originally not ignorant of farming. Animal husbandry is a profession in which the English excel. Their wool is of the highest quality in Europe, and wool weavers in Flanders relied entirely on English raw materials. However, England, once known for its excellent wool, not only does not export it now, but even relies on imports from Europe and New Zealand to meet its domestic needs. During the mid-Victorian era, the repeal of the Corn Laws caused a great deal of controversy; fortunately, the repeal did not have as many negative effects as opponents had feared. Why is this? Because at that time, grain imported from foreign countries did not exceed 20% of domestic production.

However, fifty years have passed since then, and England has no choice but to rely on Canada. If we look back at the progress of all cultures, the first stage is hunting, the second is animal husbandry, and the third is farming; however, England has gone in the opposite direction. Farmlands have been turned into pastures, and pastures have been turned into hunting grounds. The departure of English farmers from the land did not begin recently; as early as the late 18th century, the poet Oliver Goldsmith wrote the poem "The Deserted Village," lamenting the fate of wandering farmers.

That trend has accelerated with time. The English upper class, whether the old aristocracy since the Norman Conquest or the new aristocracy supplemented by the tide of large-scale capitalism, cannot live without horse racing and hunting. They take pride in hunting foxes, deer, rabbits, pheasants, grouse, and wild ducks. They designate hunting areas of several or dozens of miles, employ hunting staff, and raise large numbers of birds and animals every year for entertainment during the hunting season. Therefore, it is not uncommon to hunt hundreds of deer or pheasants at a time.

In such a state, they treat the land entirely as a hunting ground, a racecourse, or a golf course. Who would feel the inspiration of "spring sunshine spreading its grace, and all things shining with glory"?

What is destroying England is precisely what made it prosperous. The English abandonment of their land led to success as merchants and industrialists, but it is also their abandonment of their land that has made them unable to maintain their position as merchants and industrialists.

Secondly, we cannot overlook the decline of religion. Christianity gave a touch of morality and spiritual style to the ferocious pirate nature of the Anglo-Saxons. In English history, what a weak king was Edward the Confessor? At the same time, what a devout king he was! He left a very deep mark on history.

The Puritan Revolution, in a sense, was a movement to defend the king or demand political freedom; economically, it was a question of land distribution or the amount of taxes; but it cannot be denied that it also became a religious issue. Seeley said:

"Even in Cromwell's time, just as in Elizabeth's time, commercial influence, disguised as religious influence, extended its power."

This is certainly true, and the influence of religion itself on individuals or the nation should not be despised. It is unjust to call Cromwell the worst of hypocrites. Cromwell, on the one hand, was the embodiment of the pirate and shopkeeper nature inherent in the Anglo-Saxons; on the other hand, he was a zealous Christian. In this sense, he can be said to be a successor to Edward the Confessor. His "Ironsides" were strictly disciplined and committed no offenses. After their disbandment, not one of them joined the ranks of vagrants and bandits. Even their enemy, the Royalists, said:

"They were also successful in peaceful work. Whether baker, mason, or cart driver, if he was engaged in solid labor, it would probably be correct to assume that he was a veteran of Cromwell."

Religion, in the eyes of the Anglo-Saxons, is a life-extending elixir; it has always risen and fallen with the times. From the mid-18th century to the late 18th century, John Wesley initiated a religious revival movement, separating from the Church of England and founding the Methodist Church. Secondly, in the mid-19th century, Oxford University, led by John Henry Newman and his colleagues, launched the Oxford Movement. Although that movement did not achieve its full effect because it either turned to Roman Catholicism or returned to the Church of England, it can be regarded as a major alarm clock shattering the complacency of the religious world. Afterwards, there was William Booth's Salvation Army. The Salvation Army arose from the Methodist Church, just as the Methodist Church arose from the Church of England. However, Booth and Wesley were opposites in terms of education, taste, and character. Booth was fervent and popular.

Gladstone, like Cromwell, was called the worst of hypocrites by the opposition party, but he was not a person who abused the power of the strong for personal gain through politics. This is recognized by anyone. The so-called "even a thief has three points of reason." Although piracy was the reality of England, it still paid lip service to benevolence and morality. Even Gladstone's political enemy, the Marquess of Salisbury, offered his eulogy to his coffin as "a great Christian statesman."

But what about England after that? Which English politician deserves the title of "Christian statesman"? After Gladstone's death at the end of the 19th century, the style of politicians deteriorated. Even the empty rhetoric of Christians vanished entirely. As for the Churchill generation now, they can only be described as shameless descendants of pirates, and no other praise can be added.

Did the English abandon religion, or did religion abandon the English? No matter which, the English have fully and unreservedly displayed their pirate nature of not fearing God, not respecting heaven, and believing in materialism. How can this not consume the nation's vitality and accelerate its self-destruction! (Translated by Ding from the Mainichi Shimbun, April 30)

### Household Flour to Be Sold Soon - Price per Pound Awaits Announcement - Sale of Third Phase of Sugar May Be Postponed

Sources in the rice industry have learned that the 35th phase of household flour in the two concessions is preparing to resume sales soon. At that time, the 35th phase flour purchase certificate will be used to grant purchases. It is reported that each person can purchase one market pound. The price per pound is awaiting formal announcement by the two authorities. The purchase method is the same as in the past. Rice stores can receive sales slips today, with each bag priced at 207.80 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, compared to 100.08 yuan per bag previously.

Transporting Glutinous Rice Requires a Passport

The Ministry of Food considers glutinous rice to be a type of rice and therefore not allowed to be transported freely. It has specifically informed the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct its subordinates to assist in inspection. Anyone transporting glutinous rice from other areas to the Shanghai area should, before transport, follow regulations and apply to the Ministry for a grain transport passport. Only after approval and issuance can the transport take place (this should also be done for transport to the Shanghai control line). When it arrives in Shanghai, each inspection agency must inspect based on the Ministry's passport. Anyone transporting without the above passport will be charged with smuggling.

Phase Two Sales End on the 17th

Since the second phase of household oil began to be sold universally with housing tax receipts on the 7th of this month, most households have already purchased it. Each person gets four ounces, sold for 5.10 yuan. It is now known that this oil sale is scheduled for ten days and will end on the 17th. Failure to collect by the deadline will be considered voluntary abandonment.

Sugar Prices Will Definitely Change

The distribution procedures for some retailers of the third phase of household sugar have not yet been completed, so the sale on the 15th may not take place as scheduled. The price of the third phase of household sugar will definitely be increased, but the amount of the increase is still under consideration by the authorities.

Nanshi Opens Distribution - Current Ration

The distribution of food rations based on population count for the 13th phase in the urban area has been completed by the Municipal Food Bureau. It has instructed the public rice distribution centers in the urban area to pay and release rice. Nanshi has already started universal distribution yesterday. Each person, regardless of age, can still purchase two *sheng* of rice, and the price is still six yuan. Other districts will also begin sales soon.

### Minister Lin Arrives in Shanghai Last Night - Convening the China Electric Meeting

It is reported that Minister Lin will personally preside over the opening ceremony of the company's new film today in his capacity as chairman of the board of directors of the China Film United Corporation and convene the company's shareholders' meeting.

### Travelers to Other Places Must Have an Epidemic Prevention Certificate

The China Branch Epidemic Prevention Association has responded to the epidemic prevention movement in the two concessions and launched tiger epidemic prevention injections. It stipulates that from now on, travelers going to other places by train must show an epidemic prevention certificate, otherwise they must be injected at the station. It is also learned that those going to other places by boat must also show an epidemic prevention certificate.

### Demolishing and Selling Old Houses in the Urban Area Requires a Permit

Demolishing old houses in the urban area is a prohibited practice. However, recently, due to rising prices, there are still those who demolish and sell them. The municipal authorities believe that this not only harms the appearance of the city but also easily causes incidents. Therefore, they have instructed their subordinates that if civilians want to demolish old houses in the future, they must obtain approval and a certificate from the Municipal Works Bureau and permission from the Municipal Police Bureau. No one is allowed to demolish and sell houses without authorization, and violators will be severely punished.

### Occupying Houses Where the Zhabei Owner Is Absent - Rental Procedures Should Be Completed

Since the Navy Rehabilitation Department and the Japanese Resident Group transferred the houses and land in Zhabei District 1 where the owners were absent, the work of the Shanghai North Office of the Housing Management Committee has been very busy. It is now heard that the office will begin an investigation and registration because of the many changes in owners in the Zhabei area, in order to maintain the rights and interests of the owners. This registration regulation was announced by the Housing Management Committee as early as last November. Anyone occupying land and houses where the owner is absent should go to the office in the district to complete the rental procedures within two months after the announcement of the regulations. Otherwise, once discovered by investigation, they may be fined up to ten months of land rent or house rent, and 50% of the rent collected retroactively may be used as a reward for the informant. Therefore, those occupying land and houses where the owner is absent should quickly go to the office to complete the legal rental procedures to avoid harming themselves. The address of the office is No. 27 Fusheng Road, at the end of Hongkou Laobazi Road.

### Strict Inspection of Contraband on the Shanghai Suburban Blockade Line

The Shanghai Qingxiang Branch Blockade Management Office recently reported that there are often lawless elements in the Qingxiang area who privately carry weapons, ammunition, opium, heroin, and other narcotics in and out of the blockade line. Yesterday, it specifically instructed the blockade management offices in Nanhui, Fengxian, Beiqiao, Baoshan, Jiading, and Chongming to strictly inspect people entering and leaving, and not to be perfunctory.

### Tenth Batch of Coal Distribution - Starting to Handle Various Procedures - Distributed to the Industry in Four Grades - Deadline for Payment - Coal for Civil Use Has Also Begun to Be Shipped

The Shanghai Coal Retailers Joint Association has now begun to handle various procedures for the tenth batch of coal distribution and will distribute it to its members. It is understood that this distribution includes Datong, Liuquan Tong, and Sino-British small blocks. All members can pay the payment to Yitaixing, Huazhong, and Yuantai coal companies after receiving the notification from the Joint Association. If there is a delay, the distribution of this batch of coal will be stopped, and the membership qualification will be cancelled.

Four-Level Distribution This distribution method is divided into four grades: Grade A, Datong Tong 75 tons, Liuquan Tong 25 tons, Sino-British small blocks 1.25 tons; Grade B, Datong Tong 6 tons, Liuquan Tong 1 ton, Sino-British small blocks 1.2 tons; Grade C, Datong Tong 45 tons, Liuquan Tong 75 tons, Sino-British small blocks 1.15 tons; Grade D, Datong Tong 3 tons, Liuquan Tong half a ton, Sino-British small blocks 1.1 tons. The grade of each member is clearly indicated on the notification.

Coal for Civil Use

The first batch of civil use coal for customer registration, except for restaurants, has already been distributed in full. However, other civil use customers, such as dish and rice restaurants, dyeing industries, etc., have not yet been delivered. The reason is that the Jiaozuo white coal could not be returned to the designated storage within the scheduled time last week, causing delays for the retail merchants who delivered to customers. It is now known that the Jiaozuo white coal merchants have started shipping, and retail merchants have begun to expedite the procedures. They will be able to deliver to registered users in a few days.

Distribution of Charcoal The charcoal joint operation has now begun to handle the fifth batch of charcoal distribution. The distribution method is divided into two grades: Grade A, 400 kg; Grade B, 300 kg. The official distribution price is 3 yuan per kg in Central Reserve Certificates. The joint operation has sent letters to all retail members, urging them to pay the payment within the deadline, calculated as 1,200 yuan per household for Grade A and 900 yuan per household for Grade B. As for the source of charcoal, it is still very smooth, and there should be no shortage in the future.

Wang Xiaoniu, a native of Shaoxing, 42 years old, operated a pickled vegetable stall at the entrance of Baoyu Lane on Caishi Street and lived at No. 220 Kulun Road in Zhabei. At around 4:00 PM on the 9th, Wang was carrying a bucket on a shoulder pole when he collided with a dilapidated cart pushed by Yang Zhifang, the owner of the public firewood shop at No. 64 Wuzhen Road, and his partner Zhang Jun, causing an argument. Yang and Zhang immediately committed assault and injured Wang's vital parts. He was sent to Baolong Hospital but died. The police station reported it to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office for examination and collection. On the one hand, Wang's wife, Wang Shen, filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office against Yang and Zhang for causing death by injury, requesting legal action. On the other hand, she appealed to the fellow villagers' association and the pickled vegetable industry association for assistance. The Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office summoned the defendants for interrogation yesterday and ordered them to be detained pending review. The deceased left behind a wife and three children, and the family is poor. The deceased's wife has hired a lawyer to file an incidental civil lawsuit, seeking compensation for damages to maintain their livelihood.

### Case of Electric Tram Ticket Seller Neglecting Duty

On the 11th of this month, Dan A'er wanted to board the trailer of the Route 12 tram. Seeing that there were very few people in the carriage, the ticket seller Zhu Bajin hurriedly pulled the iron gate shut and pushed Dan A'er down with force, causing four of Dan's fingers to be crushed off. The incident was discovered by the police, who sent Zhu Bajin to the court.

### Spokesperson for the Japanese Army Press Department Criticizes Exaggerated Allied Propaganda

The press department of the Japanese Army Headquarters in Shanghai, at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 13th), as usual, hosted a regular meeting of the Chinese press corps in the city. During the meeting, the spokesperson criticized the enemy Allied forces for their meaningless and exaggerated propaganda regarding the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill. He stated that the Allied side, taking advantage of the situation in North Africa, advocated opening a second front in Europe, which was greatly exaggerated. Furthermore, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox, during a meeting with reporters, falsely claimed that by exploiting the situation in North Africa, they could not only threaten Sicily but also the Mediterranean in the future. While this may be the Allied side's hope, whether it can be achieved in reality remains doubtful. Without regaining their lost air superiority, any plans would be no different from a fool's dream and would be impossible to realize. In addition, opening a second front in Europe faces many challenges, particularly the thorny diplomatic issues in the Balkans, making it difficult to proceed. The exaggerated broadcast from London to Chongqing yesterday, in two parts, showed both triumph and disappointment. Moreover, reports from British war correspondents revealed insufficient troop deployments and morale significantly inferior to the Japanese army. In short, the repeated meetings between Roosevelt and Churchill, the previous one in Casablanca focusing on a counteroffensive in Burma, ultimately failed. This time, they may be plotting using the Pacific as a source of resources, but based on the current situation, we can predict that their efforts will again undoubtedly fail. According to yesterday's telegrams, Stalin of the Soviet Union and Chiang Kai-shek of Chongqing did not participate in the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. From Stalin's and Chiang's perspective, this kind of meeting is bound to raise problems. Furthermore, Bishop Yu Pin of Chongqing stated at the U.S. diplomatic conference that the U.S. has been maintaining a defensive posture in the Pacific, failing to take the offensive, which has disappointed Chongqing. They hope the U.S. can adopt an offensive strategy. Therefore, the relationship between Chongqing and the U.S. can be seen from this Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. Whether the focus of this meeting is to discuss the Pacific issue is difficult to say before the facts are revealed. However, its main purpose may be to seize Burma. Even if this is achieved, whether it can solve all the difficulties for Chongqing is a problem. Finally, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing is fiercely competing with Chongqing for command, so Chennault's return to the U.S. is a last resort to seek assistance from Washington.

### Second Special District Party Headquarters Requests Strict Prohibition of Opium and Gambling in the City to Align with the Promotion of the New Life Movement and Frugality

Central News Agency: The Second Special District Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang in Shanghai, regarding the prevalence of opium and gambling in Shanghai, which harms the people, has repeatedly received reports from various district branches stating: "Since the National Government returned to the capital, Shanghai's cityscape has become more prosperous, and the population has continued to grow. As the New Life Movement is actively promoted, the citizens' lives should urgently advocate thrift, increase production, establish a model of clean government, and lay the foundation for the construction of a new China. However, opium and gambling are rampant in the urban areas of Huhang, Zhabei, like scales on a fish. Countless citizens are destroying themselves, losing their fortunes, and ruining their families. The harm is extreme. We, the branch headquarters, are shocked and cannot remain silent. We hereby request that you forward this to higher authorities and send a letter to the municipal government, ordering a strict prohibition to align with the promotion of the New Life Movement and frugality, and to eliminate harm for the citizens." Based on this, the headquarters has already forwarded it to the Municipal Party Headquarters for review.

### Shanghai Combined Team Defeats Beihua Team in Beiping with a Score of 1-0

(Beiping Correspondence) The Shanghai Chinese Combined Football Team, having defeated the Dongfeng Team 3-1, fought against the North China Team at the Xianongtan Public Sports Field (on the 9th). Shanghai is the representative team of Central China, and its star players, Li Tiansheng, Sun Jinshun, and Jia Youliang, are all famous players who have attended the World Games. The North China Team is also composed of top players from Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao, such as Li Fenglou, Li Chaoquan, Xu Humin, and Tan Fushun, who are all outstanding figures in the North China football scene. Therefore, over 20,000 fans came to watch. The competition was very intense, with both teams alternating between offense and defense, holding each other at bay. It wasn't until the end of the first half that Li Yichen of the Shanghai team scored a goal, creating a 1-0 lead. After the break, the North China team launched a major offensive and, with the help of the wind, had many opportunities to shoot. The Shanghai team's goal was in constant danger, but Liu Xianhan was agile and saved many dangerous shots. The North China team did score a goal, but it was disallowed due to offside. Until the end of the game, neither side made any further gains. As a result, the Shanghai team defeated the North China team 1-0. The Shanghai team went to Tianjin on the 14th. Yesterday, this newspaper broadcast the news at 7:40 PM.

Economic Circle: Commentary

### "Economic Shanghai"

Mr. Takeuch Fumio, a famous Japanese economist, advocates the construction of "Economic Shanghai," believing that this issue holds the key to the economic revitalization and construction of China. His conclusion is: "The purpose of this shift in diplomacy and economy is the construction of 'Economic Shanghai,' and it should not be constructed elsewhere."

Mr. Takeuchi's intention is fair, and his arguments are insightful. Why should "Economic Shanghai" be constructed? That goes without saying. What we want to examine is how to construct "Economic Shanghai"? In his conclusion, Mr. Takeuchi points out the pessimistic view regarding the construction of "Economic Shanghai"—that Shanghai's economy has always relied on trade. Since the severed trade is not easy to restore, the question now is whether Shanghai can use its existing inventory to extend its economic life. Mr. Takeuchi's criticism of this fallacy contains a "penetrating" remark: "Knowing only that the Shanghai economy has always relied on trade, they mistakenly believe that China has no power of self-sufficiency."

The driving force for building "Economic Shanghai" lies in "self-sufficiency," and the necessary condition for "self-sufficiency" lies in promoting production. Before the war, Shanghai relied on trade for survival. The people's needs in clothing, food, housing, and transportation were met by foreign goods. As a result, Shanghai became a one-sided consumer, never striving for industrial production, which is regrettable. Since the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai has lost its trade-dependent nature and has actively engaged in promoting various productions in order to achieve self-sufficiency. To give one or two of the simplest examples: regarding medicines related to people's health, the current development of Shanghai's new pharmaceutical industry is almost self-sufficient; and regarding bicycles related to daily transportation, the current manufacturing capacity of Shanghai's bicycle industry is also almost self-sufficient. From this, it can be seen that Shanghai's power of self-sufficiency is definitely not non-existent and is very strong. Some may ask: After Shanghai changes from a trading port to an industrial city, can it achieve self-sufficiency without the assistance of trade? To answer this question, it is first necessary to understand the meaning of constructing "Economic Shanghai," which is to revitalize the Chinese economy, stabilize the Chinese people's livelihood, and further achieve the economic co-prosperity of China and Japan. In that case, the exchange of materials between Shanghai and other regions of China, as well as between Shanghai and other regions of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, must become a necessary condition for constructing "Economic Shanghai." In other words, Shanghai's industrial power absolutely cannot do without the raw materials of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the economic control of the Chinese interior also absolutely cannot do without the products of the Shanghai region. Therefore, although "Economic Shanghai" does not have to worry about its self-sufficiency status due to the loss of its previous trade dependence, the trade necessary to maintain Shanghai's industrial production power—within the Co-Prosperity Sphere—must still be smoothly promoted.

### Financial Circles in the City Initiate Rural Banking Syndicate Organization Content

Enhancing agricultural production, the first priority is to establish a rural financial system. The Bank of Communications, recognizing this, previously announced the organizational plan of the "Rural Banking Syndicate," which has attracted attention from all sides. Now, it has obtained a concrete plan for rural finance and plans to submit the plan to the National Government for implementation soon.

The Bank of Communications, based on the instructions of the Ministry of Industry, began investigating the actual situation in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui peaceful areas at the end of last year and urged major banks in Shanghai to join the rural financial group. It has now obtained agreement in principle from all sides. Based on the first investigation report, an agreement has been reached on concrete measures for rural lending. The specific measures have not yet been announced, but the main content is roughly as follows:

Participating Banks: It is speculated that the Bank of Communications will be at the center, and banks such as China, Jin Cheng, and Yanye will also join. However, rural finance has lower profits than commercial finance and requires long-term low interest rates. The relevant authorities also intend to limit the financial nature to about 20 powerful banks to join the group.

Supply and Demand Quota: It is expected that the first phase (five years) will be set at 1 billion yuan of financing. Regarding the above financing, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Reserve Bank have also reached an understanding in principle.

Loan Methods: The main reason for the failure of rural finance in the past was that there were landlords and usurious capital between financial institutions and farmers, resulting in the benefits of rural finance being seized. This time, the following methods will be followed: (A) Not all existing cooperatives will be used, only those deemed most reputable will be used as lending targets. In rural areas without cooperatives with a solid foundation, financial cooperatives will be organized under the supervision and guidance of the banking syndicate as lending targets. (B) Supervise and guide the operation of cooperatives to ensure their suitability, prevent the existence of commercial capital, and maintain low interest rates. The interest rate will be divided into stages for farmers, farms, and agricultural enterprises, with the lowest interest rates for farmers, followed by higher rates, depending on the actual situation in each region. It is also planned to dispatch a second investigation team to various places by the end of this month to determine the location for setting up the financial group's offices.

### China Communications and Other Banks to Establish Rural Loan Offices

China, Communications, Jiangsu, and Shanghai Fuxing banks are jointly organizing rural loans, and all work is actively underway. The "Rural Loan Office" of the four banks will also be announced this month, and then "Rural Loan Sub-Offices" will be established in various parts of the inland.

### Unified Registration of Banks and Pawnshops Must Be Completed by Deadline

In order to stabilize finance and unify the management of financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Financial Institutions and their implementation rules. After the implementation, all financial institutions (such as banks, pawnshops, and trust companies) are required to apply for registration and supplementary registration in accordance with the provisions of the regulations. They are only allowed to operate after the Ministry of Finance approves and issues a business license. The Ministry of Finance's relevant financial inspection agencies have found that most of the banks and pawnshops in this city have been approved for registration and issued licenses, but no less than 50 banks and pawnshops have been operating without applying for registration. This violation of laws and regulations hinders financial promotion and has a great impact. Therefore, it is planned to consult with the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office to urge the banks and pawnshops to complete the application for registration procedures in accordance with the law by the deadline in mid-August. After the deadline, they will be strictly banned and not allowed to operate.

### Jianghai Customs Considers Connecting Shanghai Suburbs Transshipment Tax Collection Points

The Jianghai Customs is considering strengthening the connection between the transshipment tax collection points set up around Shanghai. Recently, there have been frequent cases of peddlers evading the eyes of various transshipment tax collection points and smuggling goods, especially in the Xujiahui area. In order to prevent this malpractice, in the future, whenever it is discovered that someone is traveling on a prohibited road, they will be strictly dealt with in accordance with the regulations for preventing smuggling. (May 13th, Dalu Xinbao)

### Amidst Re-Investigation of Hoarding, Black Market to Face Strict Suppression

Recently, special commissioners have been dispatched again to thoroughly investigate hoarding, and the "Regulations for Punishing Hoarding" have been promulgated. It is rumored that a tough policy will be adopted against the black market, so the black market has slightly fallen. Although some commodity prices have stopped rising wildly, the average black market prices in January, February, March and April are still shocking. Everyone believes that the only way to suppress prices and eliminate the black market is to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation so that prices return to the levels of January.

Among the black markets of various commodities, only rice has shown a slight decline. This can also be regarded as a success of the national management of rice through the issuance of food warehouse bonds by the National Government. Based on this experience, it is hoped that commodity warehouse bonds will also be issued for major commodities such as cotton yarn and cotton cloth to implement national management.

Currently, miscellaneous grains are prospering, and their rising prices are inversely proportional to the falling price of rice. As a result, farmers will not focus on producing rice, only ensuring enough for their own use, and will shift their energy to producing miscellaneous grains and selling them on the market. Currently, all parties are considering balancing price controls. (Translated from Dalu Xinbao, May 13th)

### Economic Bureau Assigns Section Chief Lin to Attend Spring Cocoon Research Meeting

It started at the end of last month and was originally scheduled to end on the 10th of this month. However, it was found that a small number of merchants have not yet registered. In consideration of the difficulties of the merchants, it has been decided to extend the deadline for ten days, until the 20th of this month. Merchants who have not yet registered during the extended period should expedite the procedures. No further extensions will be granted.

### Wheat Merchants in the City Convened Yesterday to Discuss Wheat Purchasing Strategies

### Hua Stock Trend

After falling, the New Pharmaceutical Industry was absorbed by powerful investors in the afternoon, with New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory and Sino-French Pharmacy each down five jiao. Yong An Textile Factory suddenly had eager sellers, falling ten yuan, and Mayer Silk Factory was also down four yuan. Zhabei Water and China Merchants Electric Power in the public utilities sector were the most sluggish. Although there were few buyers, sellers were also unwilling to sell cheaply. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Great China Match were flat and weak. Jiuan Industrial and New Yih Property were also soft.

### Talking About Patience

— Zhiwu

"A small impatience ruins great plans." People in ancient times regarded this saying as a profound warning for their conduct in life.

Xiang Yu had the courage of a commoner and lacked patience in handling affairs. He obtained Han Xin but could not use him. Although he was able to win every battle, he used his strength lightly, so he ultimately ended up "committing suicide at the Wujiang River." Liu Bang was insightful and far-sighted, and he could endure in handling affairs. He could accommodate strategists such as Zhang Liang and Chen Ping, nurturing their full strength to wait for his own weakness. Therefore, he was able to seize the Central Plains and become king of the world. Success or failure in doing things depends entirely on the key of being able to endure or not endure. Therefore, Fan Li did not commit suicide due to the shame of Kuaiji, and Cao Mo did not die from the humiliation of three defeats. They ultimately avenged Goujian's feud and repaid the shame of the State of Lu. Being able to endure a moment of anger ultimately allows one to wash away centuries of humiliation. History is not lacking in such precedents.

Like Jizi not showing respect to his sister-in-law, Maichen being abandoned by his wife, and Han Xin having suffered the humiliation of crawling between someone's legs, a person may be humiliated by ordinary people when they are frustrated, in distress in their hometown, or when their life is struggling. But they were all able to persevere for a time and strive to create a great future. Their success lay entirely in grasping the difference between being able to endure and not being able to endure. Therefore, the kind of person who "draws their sword and rises up in battle at the sight of a common insult" is not worthy of being called courageous. A truly courageous person has the magnanimity to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens. "They are not startled when suddenly confronted, and they are not angry when insulted for no reason. This is because what they hold is very great, and their ambition is very far."

Mencius said: "When Heaven is about to entrust a great task to a person, it must first cause their heart to suffer, their muscles and bones to be strained, their body to be hungry, their life to be emptied, and their actions to be disrupted, so as to move their heart and endure their nature, and increase what they cannot do." The so-called "cause their heart to suffer" and "move their heart and endure their nature" are important secrets for conducting oneself in life. Therefore, a person who can chew on vegetable roots can do anything. Throughout history, great undertakings have all grown from hard work and perseverance. If Su Qin had two qing of fields to rely on in Luoyang, how could he have had the day when he was sealed with the seal of the prime minister of six states!

People with patience and cultivation can remain calm in the face of adversity and not be distracted by favor or disgrace. Xunzi said, "Practice enduring nature and then you can cultivate yourself," which is indeed a golden rule for conducting oneself in life for thousands of years.

### "Successful People"

— Shen Zhong

Buy, buy, a chorus of buying, and then comes the price increase, price increase, rising like crazy, creating a batch of—a minority among the majority—"successful" nouveau riche.

Although the increase in nouveau riche further intensifies the oppression of the little people who have no "inch of gold," which means more sacrifices, the "successful people" believe that this is inevitable, simply absolute. Thus, the "successful people" laugh triumphantly.

Suppose there are "clueless" "fools" who "righteously" raise objections, and even bring up "benevolence," "morality," and "ill-gotten gains never prosper" kind of "sour words" as arguments. Our "successful people" will then pull out a "famous saying" that "has been the case since ancient times"—"One general's success is built upon ten thousand corpses"—to shut your mouth.

Really, "fool!" Our "successful people" can further explain to you, "The market" and "the battlefield" are not the same "principle"? Who told you that you have no "inch of gold?" Otherwise, wouldn't you have the hope of being "one general's success?"

If "one general's success" requires "ten thousand corpses," then a nouveau riche's "success" requires "ten thousand starving."

So, friend, what else do you want to say, except to wait to become a starving corpse? (Payment to Charity for School Funding)

### After Viewing "Eternal Fame"

— Zheng Rong

The long-promoted "Eternal Fame" has finally been screened before moviegoers. This is a historical record of the "Opium War," a bloody fact that provides people with an indelible lesson. The end of the Opium War resulted in the signing of the first humiliating Treaty of Nanjing, and the scourge of opium has not yet been eradicated to this day. It is truly regrettable! Infinitely hateful! The screening of this historical fact will shake the heartstrings of millions upon millions of compatriots, causing them to roar in anger. At a time when East Asian nations are rising up and extricating themselves, I feel that everyone should see it.

The scriptwriting of "Eternal Fame" is very moving. The power of the dialogue and the severity of the satire are heartbreaking and can be deeply etched on everyone's mind. The unreasonable behavior of the British at the time, their numerous tricks, and their various violent actions are hateful to the core and make one's hair stand on end. When Commissioner Lin Zexu was appointed as the imperial envoy to specifically prohibit the import of opium and confronted the British, investigating and handling private smuggling, the British schemes suffered a major blow. And Zhang Jingxian manufactured opium abstinence pills to universally save people, and established the "Anti-British Corps" banner to support the imperial court, all of which were enough to inspire excitement in several scenes.

In terms of actors, Gao Zhanfei's Lin Zexu is the most powerful, calm and steady, with a solemn attitude, portraying the character vividly and in great detail, deserving of sincere respect. Wang Yin's Pan Danian, previously addicted to opium and unwilling to make progress, later awakened, quit his bad habits, and served the country, being heroic, handsome, and full of vitality, still retaining his tough style. Li Xianglan's Feng Gu is pitiable and lively, making people feel pity and love for her, and the two songs are melodious and beautiful. Chen Yunshang's Zhang Jingxian performed with the posture of a female hero, her heroic spirit overflowing from her eyebrows, also inspiring people. Yuan Meiyun's Zheng Yuping is good at portraying emotions, as if weeping and complaining, moving the hearts of the audience. Yan Jun's Yeli A'tuomengna's Marianna has a sinister and cunning expression, which is quite fitting. Other actors also have special performances.

### The Three Heads Doctrine

— Yin Zi

Living in today's society, everyone needs some principles for living and dealing with the world, so as not to suffer losses everywhere. Summarizing the many people in today's society whose value has increased tenfold, they mostly fall into the following three heads: First, backing; second, gimmick; third, fist. Having a strong backing truly allows one to take advantage everywhere. The position is comfortable, the work is easy, one doesn't miss out on taking advantage, and there is no major risk of doing things wrong. People are both respectful and humble, and no one can surpass the strength of their momentum.

Speaking of gimmicks, this is a skill of the mouth. If one can use it flexibly, one can indeed be resourceful. Although one's own skills and knowledge may be limited, with a mouth that can make flowers fall from the sky, dead things can come alive, and everything can be turned around!

If one doesn't have either of these, then one must use a coarse fist. If one doesn't agree with a word, roll up one's sleeves, and shout loudly, "I agree to this fist, but I don't agree to this hair," This is enough to scare the other party, knowing that one is not easy to mess with. A clever person doesn't suffer immediate losses, and immediately changes course, and from then on, one must look at you with new eyes!

If one is born without a backing, has an honest heart, has no gimmicks, is physically weak, and is as docile as a lamb, then one will naturally be unknown and suffer losses everywhere!

### Random Words

— Jing Wen

The bad social environment is not worth resenting, because this is a necessary process of life. As the saying goes, "He who eats bitterness upon bitterness becomes a man above men." Abundant results are originally hidden in the thickets of thorns.

A flintstone will never produce sparks without friction. Similarly, if people do not receive major stimulation, the flame of life will never burn!

### Travelogue of Wudalianchi

— Kato Mio

The scenic Wudalianchi in northern Manchuria is a large pond blocked by fourteen arranged volcanic cones. Rarely visited, this article is a real-life depiction of the volcanic area.

The author participated as a member of the Kwantung Army reporting team from mid-January to early February. During this time, I was trained in the extremely cold region of northern Manchuria, and got the chance to actually inspect many things in northern Manchuria.

Manchuria and the Soviet Union are only separated by the Heilongjiang River. The life of the soldiers on the Manchurian-Soviet border during the extreme cold period of forty degrees below zero is something that not only their parents, brothers, and sisters, but also the entire population, are eager to understand. The sky is as heavy as lead, and the earth is covered with powdered and jade-carved crystalline snow. Walking with a rustling sound on the black soil that has been melted by the footprints of previous people, walking, walking, what the eyes can see is a vast, ice-covered plain, and in that plain lies a barrack as if forgotten by people. How do the soldiers live there? Having become accustomed to the neat and prosperous buildings of my own country, the first sight of the desolate scene here aroused the feeling of sympathy in my chest. Stepping into the barracks, these fearful thoughts disappeared immediately. Soldiers full of vitality ran up and greedily looked at us with eyes longing for the motherland.

"The spirit of the mainland is probably still very strong!"

Although the soldiers are in a remote border area, they still miss the present state of the motherland with deep longing. The comrades in the South maintain the progress of the South, and the unity of the people consolidates the rear of the front line. The soldiers here hold fast to the northern border. Training themselves and never slacking off in cold resistance training, cultivating fighting spirit, is how the soldiers here repay the people in the rear (The northern soldiers often practice running alone like athletes, constantly exercising their physique. Therefore, when an enemy appears, everyone has the absolute confidence and strength to win. In the icy and snowy natural environment, they constantly fight against the demon of cold and overcome it. In the eyes of these young soldiers, this is like a spiritual struggle, a white-blade encounter with the enemy.

The soldiers try their best to find entertainment to comfort themselves, such as planting flowers, raising birds, and organizing theater and music groups. The northern soldiers cannot but endure this kind of tempering under the fierce power and environment of nature. The people in the rear can only step up the activities in the rear and unite with the front line, which is enough to repay the hard work of the soldiers in the northern border by one ten-thousandth. After returning from the inspection, the author respectfully presents his gratitude to the soldiers in the northern border.

The author would like to report a little on the cold-resistant weapons of the Northern Manchurian army and the scientific research of the soldiers. Although the details are not very clear and there is no freedom to publish them, I would still like to present to the readers a visit to the "Winter's Wudalianchi and Arranged Volcanoes" in the Northern Manchurian mountainous area.

"Are there earthquakes in Northern Manchuria?" How many people can answer that question with certainty? However, according to records, Northern Manchuria is by no means a land without earthquakes.

The survey report of Dalian University of Technology

states: "The Manchurian volcanoes are clustered in two places. In southern Manchuria, from Longgang through Yitong to Zhengjiatun, there are twenty volcanoes within three hundred li east and west. In the northern Manchurian region, with Mo'ergen in northern Manchuria Province as the center, there are forty volcanoes within a range of fifty li. The remaining seventy or so dormant volcanoes are in Changbai Mountain and Wudalianchi. In addition, all are extinct volcanoes."

Our group, including members of the reporting team, the press team (news, magazines, writers), the art team, the photography team, and the internship team (national school instructors), many people, carrying cold-proof gear, short swords at our waists, led by several guards, eagerly began to advance to the site. Thanks to the kindness of the Bei'an Provincial Office, the team members were able to ride in long-distance buses, following behind the army's transport vehicles. On a bulletin board in front of the guard post of a certain unit, the current temperature was indicated as thirty-two degrees below zero. Walking, walking on the vast northern Manchurian plain, all we could see around us was an endless horizon. Although we were in the car, wearing scarves and cold-proof hats, our nose hairs were freezing, and our beards were forming white frost pillars. It was such a vast place that we didn't see a village for dozens of miles. Our fingers and toes were all numb with cold. After the car had been running for nine hours, we got out of the car to warm up and walked behind the car, and then got back in the car when we were a little warmer. Passing through the city of Dedu County, and going about twenty kilometers further north along the Bono Mur River (transliteration), we saw a hill shaped like an upturned alms bowl. This is the starting point of the "Wudalianchi Arranged Volcanoes" we wanted to explore. Wudalianchi is located in Dedu County (126 degrees 7 minutes east longitude, 48 degrees 43 minutes north latitude). The original name was Wuyun He'ergeji Volcano. In the fifty-ninth year of Kangxi, two of these fourteen volcanoes, Huoshaoshan and Laoheishan, erupted violently, and the lava flowed to the lowlands, forming a large pond. Seven days after the eruption, the lava solidified.

This is what the residents have associated with many legends (one says that the black dragon and the golden dragon fought) and call it Shilon Lava. The fourteen mountains are not large in area, each with its own crater. The area of ​​Shilon Lava is 3.7 times that of Sakurajima in Kyushu, Japan, and its volume is 0.7 times that of Sakurajima. The rock quality is Mesozoic and basalt, and below it is pitch-black or blue-black olivine, and dense and porous vitreous rock. Its color and shape become a special background for Wudalianchi, just like a dragon drinking water, so this place is called Shilon Lava Flow. In order to see the lava flow and Wudalianchi clearly, we rustled through the powder snow and climbed Yaquan Mountain. The elevation of this mountain is only 358 meters. The bare mountain has no grass, and you can't see anything around. You can clearly and freely view the distant view of the arranged volcanic cones. The north wind blowing over the top of the mountain was like sharp needles, directly piercing through our cold-proof gear. We looked at the fourteen volcanic cones and bowed our heads in the mystery of this great nature.

Yaquan Mountain is not only a suitable place for viewing, but at the bottom of the crater of this mountain, there is also a building (Qiling Temple), which is famous for its five grotesque idols. In order to commemorate the history of ethnic struggles, that is, the rise and fall of the Han and Mongolian peoples, this place is regarded as a sacred place. This is hard to believe. However, in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, a so-called old monk built a spiritual temple at the foot of this mountain, as a subordinate temple of Falun Temple in Baiquan County, Bei'an Province. It took another eleven years to place 146 bronze Buddha statues of the same size as real people, as well as 61 child statues, in the Zhonglingguan in Baiquan County, enshrining ancient and modern saints, sages, loyal ministers, and filial sons, and built temples to make Wudalianchi sacred. Among the enshrined Buddha statues are Sakyamuni, Christ, Confucius, Abbe, Maria, Aristotle, and the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, but there are no Japanese sages, which is quite noteworthy. In the grassland area connecting Yaquan Mountain and the lava area, 1,200 meters east and west, there are carbonic acid springs everywhere. In the spring, Mongolians from far away carry their families in large carts to this place, and fast and bathe in this spring, and scoop the spring with shell spoons and drink it. It is said that the cold spring has miraculous effects on stomach and intestinal diseases, and it is a spiritual spring for washing away the filth of body and mind.
