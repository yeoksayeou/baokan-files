### How to Handle Winter Relief

The Municipal Winter Relief Fundraising Committee convened its first meeting a few days ago to promote fundraising efforts, with a target of 10 million yuan. Shanghai, being a concentrated area of industry and commerce with many wealthy individuals, and its people known for their charitable inclinations, this sum of 10 million yuan is not, in fact, very large. Therefore, our concern is not whether the relief funds can be fully raised, but rather how the relief work will be carried out in the future, so that the famine victims can truly receive substantial benefits and not be exploited.

China has almost always been a country with constant disasters, meaning that relief efforts are needed every year. Looking at past relief efforts, many have been absolutely earnest in their work, ensuring that every penny of the funds reaches the disaster victims. However, there are also not a few who live off of the relief. This time, the fundraising target, in terms of numbers, is indeed larger than in the past. However, in terms of current purchasing power, it is negligible. We propose that, firstly, all salaries of relief personnel and office expenses should not be paid from the relief funds. Secondly, all rice, cloth, and cotton used for relief distribution should be requested from the allocation agencies at the allocation price, and not purchased on the black market, because black market prices are not only too high, but also lack standards and are difficult to audit.

Relief is a part of social welfare work, and in principle should be organized by social welfare agencies. However, since the relief funds are not allocated by the government this time, but rather donated by the people, then, to demonstrate credibility to the people, it is best to have all relief work jointly and uniformly carried out by various non-governmental charitable organizations, with social welfare agencies acting in a supervisory and guiding role. What the staff of various charitable organizations lack is funding. Handling winter relief is also a part of their regular work. In the past, they were unable to carry it out on a large scale due to a lack of funds. Now, entrusting them with a large amount of donations would be a win-win situation and would save on expenses. However, when entrusting them, the internal workings and the usual work ethic of each organization should be strictly reviewed. And the supervision aspect must be meticulously thorough, so as to avoid corruption and affect the success of this winter relief effort. As for office expenses, while they should not be taken from the relief funds, nor should the charitable organizations be forced to cover them. Instead, the public sector should be asked to bear them, as this is the responsibility and obligation of the public sector.

Next, we want to raise the issue of the scope of relief. Considering the current situation in Shanghai, more than 50 percent of the citizens are enduring hunger and cold and are eligible for relief. However, it is impossible to provide relief to everyone. In that case, we can only use the old saying of past relief efforts, which is "rescue the dying, not the poor," and limit it to the homeless on the streets who are suffering from hunger and cold. We feel that we can take advantage of this winter relief opportunity to shelter and manage these vagrants. Because doing so would not only facilitate auditing, fundamentally eliminate duplicate claims and abuse, but also help to clean up the city's appearance. If we can go a step further, and classify the sheltered vagrants by gender, age, and physical strength, and require the young and strong men to perform compulsory labor, we can not only prevent them from eating without working and developing a habit of idleness, but also help with municipal construction. If municipal funding permits, and by next spring when the weather warms up, those who should be taken care of can be placed in separate shelters, and those who should work can be given jobs or repatriated to their hometowns, which would greatly benefit the elimination of vagrants and the improvement of the city's appearance. If we can do this, then this winter relief effort will not only be a passive undertaking for society, but also an active one.

The formation of vagrants is due to two reasons: one is the stagnation of industry and commerce, which turns employed people into unemployed; the other is the poor social environment, which tempts people to become degenerate. While we strongly support the nation's material control policy, we regret the fact that after purchasing cotton yarn and cloth, the delay in implementing allocations has led to the stagnation of industry and commerce, thereby creating countless unemployed people. We also hope that the market will be prosperous and tax revenues will increase, but we cannot help but say that using opium dens and gambling houses to prosper the market and increase tax revenues does more harm than good. If these errors are not fundamentally corrected, it is tantamount to promoting relief on one hand, while trying to create objects for relief on the other. I fear that next year, even with ten times the donations of today, it will not be enough.

### Japanese Army Doctor in Burma Invents Effective Dysentery Drug

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base in Burma: A Japanese Army hospital there has invented a new substitute drug that is superior to emetine, an effective drug for dysentery.

The method is to extract "biological wheat" from the bark of the "Duo Ji" tree and use it to make an injectable drug. The manufacturing method is extremely simple, and its effect is no less than that of "emetine." Even the most malignant amoebic dysentery can be cured within three to five days after injection of the drug.

### Famine in Bengal Province of India Worsens

Central News Agency, Shanghai - The great famine in the Bengal region of India has recently become increasingly severe. According to消息 received here, 6 million civilians in Bengal are struggling on the brink of death. 300,000 have been admitted to hospitals, of whom 75,000 have died. More than 150,000 others have died from famine, starvation, or malnutrition. This shocking number is expected to increase in the next few days. Because there is no time to report the disposal of these corpses to the authorities, families are burying them themselves. In the metropolis of Calcutta, hundreds of corpses are lying on the streets every day. The Indian government, in order to devise countermeasures, has specially allocated a portion of the railway transportation facilities used for military purposes to transport grain and distribute it to various regions, or has mobilized cargo ships and military trucks to distribute medical supplies. From this, it can be seen that the British are extremely embarrassed by this great chaos before their long-publicized operation to retake Burma and are striving to clean up the tragedy under their government.

### Thrift Campaign: Zhang Yipeng Broadcast

Since the establishment of the Citizens' Thrift Campaign, work has been carried out tirelessly. Various practical activities have been held to awaken the entire citizenry to practice thrift. In order to further enable citizens to understand the meaning of thrift, Chairman Zhang Yipeng gave a special broadcast on Shanghai Radio last night, entitled "Explanation of the Six Major Creeds of the Thrift Campaign." He briefly stated that thrift is saving, and economy is frugal. Confucius spoke of gentleness, kindness, respect, frugality, and yielding, and frugality is one part of it. Duke Wen of Wei, wearing clothes of coarse cloth and a hat of thick silk, could revitalize the country and save it from ruin. This is of great importance to individuals and the country. Some people say that the poor are naturally thrifty, and the rich do not need to be thrifty. I think this is a specious argument. You say that the poor are naturally thrifty, but haven't you seen those rickshaw pullers, coolies, and street children gambling with broken pieces of cardboard or worn-out copper coins? The rich seem to not care about spending more money, but you should know that there are not a few people who go to dance halls and game halls, get sick from overwork, and work all night. Now is a time of crisis, and resources are tight, and there is concern that we will not be able to sustain ourselves. If a few people continue to waste arbitrarily, they will face endless trials. Therefore, thrift is particularly important and urgent in today's situation. The purpose of this association is to make thrift a habit for the whole city, so we first briefly put forward six major creeds, which can be summarized into three items: first, clothing; second, diet; and third, social interaction. Its regulations are mostly easy to implement and do not force people to do what is difficult.

### Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf (3)

Funding and Future

The funding for the Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf, according to the 1942 fiscal year final accounts, amounted to 58,348.82 yuan, averaging 4,862.40 yuan per month. The budget for the 1943 fiscal year is 91,247.60 yuan, averaging 7,604 yuan per month. The budget for temporary expenses in 1943 is 166,500 yuan, including the cost of repairing school buildings and dormitories.

There is no fixed fund or funding. Only this large courtyard can be used. It is said that the foundation area is 466 feet, and the building area is 412.8 square feet, including the so-called "Building No. 1," which is three stories high and 316.8 square feet; "Building No. 2," which is two stories high and 45.8 square feet; and "Building No. 3," which is one story high and 20.2 square feet. Currently, the revenue that can be used is the temporary rental income from the third floor of Building No. 1, which is estimated to be 2,000 yuan per month, or 24,000 yuan per year. Most of the rooms have already been rented by several Japanese residents.

In addition to the income from a portion of the rent, there are fees from the school's affiliated "Treatment Department," which are estimated to be 3,330 yuan per month, or 39,960 yuan per year. Combined with the rent revenue, the estimated total annual income is 63,960 yuan. In the future, the development of the "Treatment Department" will be an important factor for the development of blind and deaf education in the school. Apart from this, there are only the tuition fees paid by students, but these cannot be considered the main funding source.

According to the school's plan, the first floor of Building No. 1 will be renovated, with half of it used as a classroom and half as the "Treatment Department." After renovation, the second floor will be divided into a lecture hall, a music classroom, a principal's office, a faculty office, a drawing room, etc. The third floor will still be used for temporary rentals after renovation. Some renovation work has already begun. However, there are concerns that the source of the monthly operating expenses of over 7,000 yuan will dry up. The huge cost of repairs and renovations is naturally even more unattainable. Therefore, the renovation work on the second floor of "Building No. 1," apart from slightly whitewashing the four walls, has been unable to continue. It is such a pity that such a tall and bright courtyard is now being left vacant! (The End)

### First Division Soccer Match Yesterday: Lianyi Defeats Qiaolian, Scoring Once in Each Half

In the first division soccer league, Lianyi played against Qiaolian at 10:30 AM yesterday at the [unclear] Stadium. Lianyi completed its glorious record of two wins and two [unclear] losses by defeating Qiaolian 2-0.

The match between the two sides was extremely tense, but Qiaolian was always in a passive position. In particular, goalkeeper Ivanoff repeatedly saved impossible shots, but the two goals conceded were inexplicable. Veteran Victor demonstrated his extraordinary style, but the great [unclear] was unable to use his skills. Lianyi's Gao Baosheng's [unclear] style effectively suppressed the enemy, which was [unclear]'s successful achievement. Fei Chunhua scored both goals, making him invaluable. Qian Shuyong is old and declining, retiring just ten minutes after entering the field. Ah Chu [unclear] is good at fighting and is ultimately a defensive talent. Qi Xiang is more stable than Zhang Lingen, and Cai Shengmiao is not bad. Wen Kui's heart is willing but his strength is insufficient, but his movements are still generous and beautiful.

At the beginning of the match, Lianyi's Fei Chunhua made a high shot with a good angle, but Qiaolian's Ivanoff lost it after gaining it, and Lianyi scored, making it 1-0, ending the first half. After changing sides, Qiaolian was eager to get revenge and launched a counterattack. Li Tiansheng intercepted the ball halfway and retreated. Carlo [unclear] once penetrated into the hinterland, but was offside and returned without success. Three minutes before the end of the match, Fei Chunhua received assistance from Yu Zhenyue, and the two scored a goal, and Lianyi finally defeated Qiaolian 2-0.

### Another Scene in the First Division Soccer League: Donghua Overwhelms Sansheng

Han Longhai Scores Four Goals Alone

Another scene in the first division soccer league, the two Chinese giants Donghua played against Sansheng at 3:30 PM yesterday at Jiaozhou Park. Tan Fuzhen mistakenly missed the match and did not appear. Donghua's Han Longhai scored four goals alone. Sansheng scored two goals, which was not easy. Donghua kicked off, and Han Longhai took advantage of the opponent's unsettled position and scored. Sansheng [unclear] resisted with all its strength. In less than fifteen minutes, Xue Pengkui shot from a distance, and Bang Lun was momentarily careless, resulting in a tie. The two sides fought fiercely. Longhai once again showed his power, scoring with a header, ending the first half 2-1. After changing sides, Dai Lin and Sun Jinshun attacked from both sides. Han Longhai seized Jingzhou. Sansheng was unwilling to be silent for a long time, and Mai Ersen crossed the border and scored, and then took advantage of the unguarded moment, ending the match 4-2.

Donghua: Zhang Banglun; Li [unclear]; Zhuang Youren; Liang Shutang; Zhang Lingen; Liao Shiming; Li Yao; Sun Jinshun; Dai [unclear]; Han Longhai; Jia Youliang

### Pickled Vegetable Industry Association Requests Increased Salt Allocation

Has Been Approved by the Salt Affairs Authorities

The Shanghai Pickled Vegetable Industry Association, because its members are numerous and need a large quantity of salt, the current allocation is far from the actual needs. In addition, fresh vegetables are now on the market, which is the season for pickling, so the need for salt is urgent. In view of this, the association has repeatedly requested the Salt Affairs Authorities to allocate as much as possible to meet the emergency needs and maintain the people's food supply. This request has been approved, and members will soon be able to obtain [unclear] salt.

### Last Week's Financial Situation: No Significant Changes

Commodity Prices Remain Stable

The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai last week remained stable as usual. Occasionally, a small number of goods saw a sharp increase in demand, and holders of goods engaged in hoarding, so prices were slightly raised. However, they were detected by authorities, punished according to law, or ordered to suspend business or fined as a warning. Statistics show that there were more than ten such cases throughout the week. As for food, prices fluctuated due to varying sources and changing demand. However, cotton and wool textiles saw the most significant price increases, which was due to [unclear] reasons. As for the financial situation, the official market prices of customs gold and silver ingots remained unchanged, and the discount rate remained at 17%, but the money supply was still very tight, and it was difficult to allocate funds for various industries. Fortunately, the Central Reserve Bank and the [unclear] Bureau managed the situation effectively, and no unfortunate incidents occurred.

### Various Issues as the Work of the Commercial Control Association Enters the Second Stage

Since its establishment, the Commercial Control Association has implemented material control, engaged in establishing the autonomy of the Chinese economy through a controlled economy, and is gradually advancing to cope with the rapidly changing situation around it. Whether the Commercial Control Association itself will adopt new strategies for high-level operations in the future is attracting much attention from various parties. The following is an overview of the various issues that need to be implemented.

Progress Since Establishment

The biggest purpose of the establishment of the Commercial Control Association is to achieve the mission of the Chinese economy under the Greater East Asia War and to promote the cooperation of the national government and national capital and the economic cooperation between China and [unclear]. Therefore, powerful figures in the financial world were appointed as directors and supervisors, and engaged in: Unified procurement and allocation of materials; Operation of material exchange between various regions in the country; Supply of export materials; Allocation of import materials; Procurement of materials entrusted by the government; Handling of matters designated and entrusted by the Ministry of Industry and other competent ministries. Observing the progress of its work, the association's administrative organization and various professional committees for important materials were completed in June. In addition, the industry associations of the lower-level organizations were also established in July. The criticisms mainly focus on the following three points: The defects of the Commercial Control Association itself; Insufficient cooperation of economic personnel; The relationship between the Commercial Control Association and various related authorities. The reality of these three points will be described below:

Defects of the Commercial Control Association Itself

The first problem is that the material control work of the Commercial Control Association has shifted sharply from a free economy to a controlled economy for some time. If we can truly understand the current stage of the Chinese economy, then everyone will recognize the difficulty of implementing a controlled economy. As for the preparation of the organization, it undertook the work of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth midway, and at the same time focused on establishing a unified purchasing organization for important materials. Therefore, some people criticized the Commercial Control Association for focusing on the organization and not considering the significant Chinese economic institutions and the possibility of a controlled economy. At times, its work is not only economic work, but often linked to politics, and special attention should be paid to this point. (Excerpt from [unclear] New News) (To be continued)

### Prospects for the South Pacific War Situation

Since landing on Mono Island on October 27, the enemy has dispatched large fleets and transport convoys seven times, attempting to recapture Bougainville Island and New Britain Island, constantly coming to the strong port, wanting to fight to the death, and to reduce Ganben's strategic southern stronghold in one fell swoop. Thanks to the efforts of the Japanese naval air force and surface ships, and the extremely clever strategy of the operational headquarters, they suffered an unprecedented defeat in the history of warfare, sinking and destroying a total of 85 ships, including six battleships, eight aircraft carriers, cruisers, [unclear] ships, and transport ships. This is a huge blow to their new offensive, and the enemy has paid such a high price and still gained nothing. They covered up the continuation of their defeat by greatly publicizing the landing on Cape Torokina on Bougainville Island, which they gained from this huge sacrifice, saying that it had achieved its intended purpose. Furthermore, future battles in this area will not proceed as smoothly as they had hoped, which can be clearly understood from their judgment of the battles they have already encountered and the previous jungle warfare. The longer the battle lasts on the enemy's side, the more the public opinion will clamor for the truth about the defeat. Therefore, while anxiously trying to make the situation on the two islands of Bougainville favorable, they are also planning to seek new results on new battlefields. In other words, they will use new battles to shift their focus, hoping to disperse the strength of the Japanese air force and naval forces in the Solomon Islands and open a way out in the Solomon Islands northward operation. So where will the enemy want to attack in the near future? Judging from the enemy's military strength and previous strategies, it is clear that they will be active in the Central Pacific. Let us try to review their new plan from the enemy's shipbuilding and attack situation.

Utilizing Air Power

Since the start of the war about half a year ago, the enemy has lost most of the aircraft carriers they had before the war, and the tactics they are currently adopting are to utilize a large amount of air power. Therefore, there must be a large number of land-based air force bases. It is only necessary to pull the bases towards the battlefield until the time of operation, without the need for aircraft carriers or large fleets. However, on the other hand, the enemy is actively engaged in building aircraft carriers. After losing most of its remaining aircraft carriers in the South Pacific naval battle, in just one year, the enemy had many more aircraft carriers commissioned and completed the training of its crew. Thus, using this aircraft carrier-centered mobile unit, they conducted island-hopping operations from the Solomon Islands northward, and encountered the strong defense line deployed by the Japanese army from Bougainville Island to New Britain Island. The base air force prepared by them in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea area felt insufficient here. However, they still forcibly [unclear] the Japanese air force base, spending a great deal of resources, and although they were able to suppress the Japanese army's Bougainville Island base at Buin, Balale, etc., they were ultimately unable to completely control the New Britain Island Rabaul base. In this great war, replenishment cannot exceed consumption. They dispatched an aircraft carrier loaded with gasoline, ammunition, and hundreds of aircraft, and paired it with battleships and many other naval vessels, wanting to annihilate the Japanese air force and naval fleet in one fell swoop, and then leisurely land. However, due to the wisdom and bravery of the Japanese naval air force and naval vessels, they were frustrated.

Enemy Fleet Annihilated

As such, Harl Halsey's Southwest Pacific Fleet has become a poor fleet. It has not been able to annihilate Japanese naval vessels and aircraft carriers as desired, and it is extremely difficult to reinforce and replenish the Torokina Point landing troops. Their attempt to conquer Rabaul in one fell swoop, which they had been calling for, has turned into a prolonged state that they do not like, and domestic public opinion will not allow the defeat to be covered up for long. At this point, they seem to have decided to disperse the Japanese forces in order to open up the war situation in this area. This is what they call the Nimitz attack. Nimitz, who is still [unclear], once said that he planned to use the Pacific Fleet to attack and contain the Japanese fleet and air force. On the 68th anniversary of the founding of the US Navy on the 10th of this month, he claimed:

"The United States will soon launch a major offensive against the Japanese army and smash its island [unclear] fortresses. The United States will implement this operation using a single [unclear] direct entry method."

On the 18th, he also said: "The Japanese army cannot but realize that the major offensive in the Central Pacific war situation is coming soon. It is absolutely necessary for us to control the Marshall Islands and the Gilbert Islands and for the US army to land." This can be regarded as proof that he will operate in the Central Pacific. However, what we should consider here is that this time is clearly not like the previous time, when the mobile unit centered on the aircraft carrier came to attack and learn from Minamitori Island and Okinotori Island, and [unclear] withdrew temporarily. He said that he must land, so it can be seen that it is not a temporary attempt at containment. However, because the islands [unclear] in this area are densely populated and are all small coral islands, they cannot deploy their large air power. Therefore, the enemy's activity in this area will center on the activities of the mobile unit with the aircraft carrier as the main engine. The fleet battle under air supremacy that they most hope for is, needless to say, greatly limited. The enemy's [unclear] fleet's attack is exactly what the Japanese army hopes for. Even the Halsey fleet, which came to attack under the cover of a powerful base air force, was slaughtered and left with nothing. Before the Japanese fleet, will the Nimitz fleet also [unclear] the Halsey fleet? (翔: Translated from the November 22, Fourth Section [unclear] Daily News)

### Breaking Through the Perilous Darkness: A True Account of the South Pacific Bloodbath

Black mountain peaks, layered upon layered, like evil, and bottomless valleys as silent as death. The dense, mournful mist, the rain dripping onto helmets, seeping into bones. In the tropical cold season, a layer of gray floats on the faces of shivering soldiers. These layers of mountains are the Stanley Range, running straight down the back of New Guinea. A certain Japanese unit, sealed off in this dark world by this natural fortress, scattered the Australian troops in this mountain battle and finally broke through 〇〇 and occupied it. All the senses of the soldiers were concentrated on crushing the enemy's fighting spirit.

Seven days passed like a dream, gnawing on bamboo shoots like sprouts, and chewing on grass leaves like goats, yet they did not feel hungry. To 〇〇! Look down. Far away in the darkness, two or three lights faintly shone, emitting a sharp, needle-like glow. Go there and kill them!

The food was gone. A portion of the soldiers was sent to the rear, but it would take many days for them to return with provisions.

"Good! Let's go there to kill and die together!"

In this place, rather than starve to death, let's fight them. After making this decision, a certain unit leader tied on a white headband, and the soldiers all began to prepare together.

"We will die together!"

A certain unit leader gripped his Japanese sword, his eyes flashing brightly.

"Good!"

Sacrifice for the Country

A sharp sound like the breaking of air. Now is the time to offer our lives for the nation.

Charge into the enemy camp where the lights are, and then return to Yasukuni Shrine! A surge welled up from the depths of my heart, and hot sweat flowed down my cheeks.

The suicide squad, after bowing in the direction of the Imperial Palace, sang "Umi Yukaba" in unison, the heroic song penetrating the dense forest as if to intimidate the enemy. This was the image of the divine Japanese soldiers setting out to attack the enemy camp on the night of 〇 month 〇 day.

I was at the 〇〇 base bidding farewell to the 〇〇 unit in early 〇 month. What was that like?

Within 〇 days, under the enemy's group attacks, they completed a landing before the enemy on the north shore of New Guinea. Soon after, on the transport ship, I received the following information from a staff officer.

"The main force of the 〇〇 unit has already occupied positions near the Stanley Range and is preparing to attack the enemy. The attack is scheduled to begin on 〇〇 day."

Indeed, it's fast! A lightning strike.

The enemy army, in order to defend New Guinea and nearby Australia, was fortifying the north and south coastlines. There was also a powerful mobile fleet at sea. However, this fleet was caught by the Japanese naval forces and completely turned into a seabed for algae. That was the famous Battle of the Coral Sea.

"Can the Japanese army break through the Stanley Range, where even wild beasts cannot live?" The enemy, using their own combat capabilities as a standard, arrogantly made this judgment. But for the Japanese army, nothing is impossible. The Stanley Range? ... Just look at the morale of the Japanese soldiers! Fighting spirit! Everything is fighting spirit!

Japan's elite troops landed one after another. Along the coast, there was an endless stretch of dense forest. The shadows of those swiftly marching under the starry sky, rushed through the coconut groves and leaped onto the main road. Bang bang, gunshots rang out. Enemy planes came and began to bomb wildly. The unloaded 〇〇 transport ships had already disappeared into the ocean. Only one was still unloading its last cargo. Bang, bang, bang! A bomb fell. Bastards! Crew members, soldiers, braving the fire, worked hard. Sandbags flew, water gushed, attacking the flames. The well-trained personnel calmly carried out fire-fighting operations. At the same time, in this critical moment, the crane was still creaking and operating non-stop. The deck had already turned into a sea of fire. "Unloading complete!" a first-class transport soldier shouted loudly. A small boat sped towards the shore, blown by the shrapnel, veering to one side. The enemy plane was gone. No more bombs? Look, there are red and green lights coming down from the mountain peak! It's an enemy plane! Here it comes again.

Marching in the Rain

At this time, after securing the landing point, the troops immediately advanced towards the main road. The road was unexpectedly good. The advance party of Yokoyama engineers had already repaired and strengthened the road surface. However, after it rained, the road turned muddy again. "What heavy rain!" the soldiers said, laughing at the sky. This violent, messy rain! Until 〇〇, our only enemy was the rain. With a splash, the column marched in the "gutter." Suddenly the rain stopped, revealing a clear blue sky. Steam rose from the soldiers' shoulders, burdened with heavy helmets.

The enemy soldiers, retreating from the coast, were using Kokoda as their last stronghold of resistance, desperately transporting troops, ammunition, and provisions from Port Moresby using large aircraft. Although friendly planes came to attack them, they continued to resupply. The sharp edge of the Japanese army steadily advanced towards the enemy's stronghold. Like the temperature chart of a patient with a fever, the battle line rose moment by moment.

〇〇 li away from the coast. This was already a vast, flat plain. Coconut palms were everywhere. Papayas were also found. During breaks, because they had been walking on the hot, dry earth, the sweet coconut juice did not suit their tastes; papayas were better. Breaking open the long, oval papaya, a tropical fragrance wafted out, and the thick, yellowish-brown flesh, when bitten into, was truly delicious. What a wonderful meal!

Entering the mountains increased the difficulty, and since no food could be found in the mountains, the rice carried with them had to be conserved as much as possible. The soldiers fought hard with hunger.

After passing the plain near 〇〇, the terrain gradually rose. Every day, they encountered more than three torrential downpours. Mud filled the tops of their military boots, making walking slippery. The column stopped and started, started and stopped. The soldiers' backs and noses often bumped into each other. Rain followed by sunshine, sunshine followed by rain. This was the situation every day, so when their marching feet stopped even briefly, their entire bodies seemed to be soaked in sweat. The soldiers carrying heavy weapons always "stood" to rest. "Why don't you take it off?" There was no need to ask; after taking it off, they would not have the strength to carry it on their shoulders again. Those soldiers, slightly bowing their heads, stood silently. Their broad shoulders looked like solid rocks. During transport and carrying, the burden was always shifted from one shoulder to the other, and other than when they were sleeping for the night, they always carried heavy loads.

Thankfully, there were many rivers on this leg of the journey. Clear streams, as clear as the rivers in mainland Japan, crossed the plains. At night, camping and bathing in the clear streams was extremely enjoyable. But for some reason, strange rashes developed on the bodies of the soldiers who had bathed, causing them to itch unbearably whenever they marched and sweated.

Entering the mountainous area from Oiibi, steep slopes and winding paths along the mountainside connected to each other. The engineering corps felled trees and opened mountains, creating a 〇-meter-wide road. When encountering valleys, they built log bridges; when encountering steep cliffs, they strung vines. Enemy planes flew by every day, but they flew over our heads, counterattacking towards the coast. Kokoda, which had become an enemy stronghold, was located in the highland area under the Stanley Range and had an airfield. For the enemy, it was the heart of the mountain range's defensive position.

### Illustrated Summary of Major Events in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere for the Week

Based on reports and telegrams from November 22nd to 28th

### Autumn Night

— Zhang Huinan

The season I love the most is autumn—the cool breeze, the clear sky, the lively islands, and the flying fields. I call autumn the season of freedom because of this image.

I love the vitality of spring, the splendor of summer, and the solemnity of winter, but I love the tranquility of autumn even more.

The fallen leaves are the refuse of the era; the bare branches reveal the truth of reality.

Autumn night! It is quiet. I seem to intentionally put on thinner clothes and wander alone in the desolate streets. The cool breeze blows on me, the moonlight caresses me, and I feel cold; but in my spirit, there is infinite sweetness and tranquility. And I still intentionally wander in the quiet, cool autumn streets. This is intentional wandering, not wandering aimlessly. Until the moonlight fills my whole body, bathing me in its refreshing light, I feel as if I have taken a mercury bath in my consciousness. Urged by the night breeze, I reluctantly bid farewell.

Friend, have you ever experienced the night? Have you paid attention to the night? Especially the tranquil night of late autumn.

The most beautiful thing in the world is a quiet night, especially on a clear day. Whether one is indulging in fantasies alone or having a heart-to-heart talk with friends, the quiet of the night is the most suitable for people.

Looking up, I see sparse stars in the darkening sky, twinkling like the eyes of lonely lovers, smiling at you deeply, sorrowfully, yet sweetly.

The still night, with a refreshing breeze, is the most suitable for contemplation. You can indulge in fantasies of future joys, laugh out loud, or shed tears for past sorrows. At this time, the cool breeze will dry your tears, the moonlight will comfort your heart, and your breath will reveal your worries, resonating with your heart. No one—assuming they are human—will laugh at your emotions. This is the mystery of the night, and also its greatness!

Unfortunately, I am not a painter and cannot paint the emotional stars, and I am not a writer or a poet, so I cannot use gorgeous words to describe this silent autumn night, which contains the true meaning of beauty.

### Song

— Hu Ruoliu

I love songs, and I especially like singing, especially vigorous and majestic songs that invigorate the spirit.

Perhaps it is because of my inherently strong nature, but I like to sing majestic songs. Especially when I am lonely, or on a moonlit night, it is so interesting and meaningful to raise my voice and sing majestic songs!

I believe that songs invigorate the spirit. I remember the world-famous "La Marseillaise," which aroused the decadent and dispirited French soldiers and helped them achieve victory.

I love "La Marseillaise," and I love the many vigorous and majestic songs of China even more.

Although I have not been able to sing majestic songs since I came to Shanghai, this makes me feel very bad inside. Especially the young ladies across from me, who also like to sing, but they sing soft and depressing songs, "Love's Twists and Turns," "Books Everywhere Open," "Dream Man"... which make my head hurt when I hear them.

Now, as I am clenching my fist and writing, their singing is coming again, that delicate, melodious, numbing song. Every word and every sentence is unbearable. So, I raise my voice and sing—

"With hair bristling in anger, leaning on the railing, the drizzling rain stops, looking up, roaring to the sky, my heart filled with fervor..."

After I sang this vigorous song, the delicate, numbing songs could no longer be heard.

### Untitled

— Yan Shizhi

Today—

Is not my day to sing.

My voice has become hoarse; my lips and tongue are already bitter;

Only a fire burns in my chest, igniting anger.

But I will use the tears that I swallow to extinguish it.

Because I know that anger is useless.

I want to clearly see what kind of hideous and cruel executioner destroyed her youth.

I will use my weapon: my writing, my javelin, to fight it

Until we achieve complete victory.

Today—

Is not my day to sing,

Tomorrow!

Will be our day to sing triumphant songs.

When victory follows,

The sun of tomorrow will rise at the same time

Our songs,

Will resound all around!

### Appreciating Chrysanthemums in Huangyuan Garden

— Zou Kanru

A Gift for the Owner of Yueyuan

Carrying friends, strolling into the flower bushes, I know that there are reclusive old men in the city, All of the topics here are about old friends, every time we praise the strong integrity that braves the autumn wind. Withdrawing and satisfying oneself is a happy life, good art can rival the skills of creation, The winding path leads to seclusion, far from the worldly affairs, a crane dances in the courtyard.

### Seventh Anniversary of Lu Xun's Death

— Rong Gobi

Our mentor—Mr. Lu Xun,

It has been seven years since you left this world,

Although your physical body is dead,

Your ever-great spirit lives forever in the hearts of every young person,

You are a bright star,

Guiding us forward in the darkness!

Our mentor—Mr. Lu Xun,

Today we do not need to hold any ceremonies,

We will only commemorate you with practical actions,

We must learn your selfless spirit,

Bravely pick up the javelin you left us,

"In a place that can be cursed, defeat an era that can be cursed"!

### Apprentice

— Shu Jun

I get up,

Before dawn;

Tidying up the bedding,

Hurriedly wiping and sweeping;

The coal stove is still dark,

Waiting for me to light it,

A cloud of smoke,

Suffocating me and causing tears to fall!

Although it is irritable,

But I still have to light it well.

Outside, the sound of a cart is coming,

I habitually—

Pick up the lacquered nightsoil bucket,

Run to the door to pour it out,

The street is still desolate,

The night wind is like a sharp knife!

The old man pushing the cart,

As usual, smiles and says "Good morning"!

Hurriedly running back,

I am being called from upstairs,

It is the landlady's voice;

Instructing me to fetch wash water,

—to serve and wash up.

The doors open,

At that time it is still early,

Business is slow;

So:

Again, carrying a bamboo basket,

I follow the mistress to the small vegetable market.

Coming back, I wash up alone,

Slowly, the market fills up,

I become a shop assistant!

Darting back and forth in the shop,

So busy that I can't breathe,

The boss stands by with his arms crossed,

Just smiling slightly;

Occupation, making money, a way out…

Apprentice, shop assistant, human…

Stirring up my chaotic thoughts,

I stand blankly,

—Standing in the shop,

Dazed,

A slap in the face!

"You little devil! You know how to play dead"!

The boss shouts angrily:

His eyes like a mad beast,

Revealing a menacing gaze,

I angrily want to resist,

But the giant hand of life,

Holds me down;

I endure silently,

But I feel my face burning!

### West Qing Basketball First Week: Eastern Team Shows Pride

Many Talented Players: Overcoming the Western Allied Forces; Ren Yu Defeated: China Film Shows Great Promise

The West Qing Basketball League kicked off last Monday (November 22nd). On Jing'an Road, fans were as thick as clouds, and in the basketball gym, the noise shook the sky. In this competition, there are two Group A games and two Group B games every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and only one Group B game every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. This week, Zhongbei vs. Eastern was originally scheduled for the 26th, but unfortunately, Zhongbei postponed it. A North-South showdown may be reserved as a highlight. Here is a brief account of the Group A games in the first week:

First Night (22nd)

China Film Wins Against Amateur: Amateur has Tao Shaosheng and Hu Xiaoguang from the Red Team, as well as You Youliang, Zhou Zhi, and Wang Wenji from the Paramount, among other veterans. The China Film lineup is slightly inferior. Before the game, many said that Amateur would definitely win, but the reporter predicted early that China Film could win. This is not the reporter speaking with hindsight. Basketball emphasizes teamwork. Amateur was hastily assembled, and there is inevitably an air of disorganization. Under the earnest guidance of Qian Xucang, China Film is improving daily, passing smoothly, and the players all feel confident of winning. The result was a 32-28 victory over a strong enemy. Gao Mangsheng and Ren Yawei of China Film performed exceptionally well. Liu Qiong's interception of the ball under the basket was unique, but his stamina seemed insufficient. Shu Shi was hardworking and showed great effort. Youliang and Shaozhi of Amateur had good skills, but because they could not know themselves and their opponents, and the whole team was not in harmony, they suffered defeat!

Tongren Wins Against Dihua: In this game, Tongren's performance was not as ideal as it should have been. The offense was scattered, and the defense was lax. Dihua could have won but did not. The reason was that they were too aggressive. They committed many fouls, and a certain player was ejected for violently bumping into the rib of Tongren's Xu Antong (at which time Dihua was leading). They had to play with four players, and being outnumbered, they were inevitably defeated. I hope that player will learn from his mistakes and cultivate his temperament more.

Second Night (24th)

Huanan Wins Against Sanshu: Sanshu are all veterans, and there is a sense of waning strength. Huanan are all young and strong, in the flourishing autumn of their careers, but the performance was evenly matched. The reason is that Huanan lacked the strong player Liu Fuzhi, and they were also slightly complacent. A proud army is bound to be defeated. They were already very lucky not to be defeated. Although Sanshu are veterans, they are still willing to invigorate their spirits and work hard. Under normal circumstances, they had a good chance of winning. Although they lost by a small margin of 44-49, they can be considered blameless!

Shan Team Wins Against Ren Yu: It can be said that the Shan team are students of Ren Yu. Everyone expected the Shan team to lose, but unexpectedly, this battle was a major upset. The student surpassed the teacher, and the once-renowned Ren Yu team was defeated by students they had trained themselves. This was undoubtedly the biggest upset of this year's West Qing Basketball League. The advantage of the Shan team may be their morale. The defeat of Ren Yu is perplexing. Perhaps they were holding back, or there were other reasons that we cannot know. The result was 38-28, a difference of as many as five baskets, which is quite strange!

Third Night (26th)

In the first game, the Wing team did not appear, so the Giant team played against Monaco. The tactics of these two Western teams were identical, so the game was very close and the scores were unusually difficult to get and close. Giant's Miloff and Funic's long shots were effective, and they won 19-11.

The second game was supposed to be Zhongbei vs. Eastern. Both sides had famous players, and the fans were eager to see who would win. So, the room was packed that night. It was the biggest crowd yet. Zhongbei's main player, Li Qizhong, was injured and requested a postponement. Eastern was temporarily replaced by the Western Allied Forces. The friendship match was a tough and exciting one. Eastern had Paramount as its base, plus Bao Songyuan, Zhang Jiajun, Gao Baosheng, Li Zude, and Du Bensheng. Many talented players. This game used a rotation strategy, mainly to prepare for future team coordination. The Western Allied Forces were made up of the Monaco team and the Giant team. They had just finished the Group A game and had to reorganize, so they were inevitably tired. Eastern waited in ease, and as a result, they narrowly defeated the Allied Forces 38-35.

Encouragement to the Eastern Team

Looking at the situation in West Qing, the three major Chinese teams are Eastern, Zhongbei, and Ren Yu. Unfortunately, Ren Yu has already lost once, which has greatly dampened their spirit, so they are at a disadvantage overall. The only team that has shown pride for us Chinese is Eastern. Zhongbei is another strong team. After Eastern's performance the night before, the reporter has something to say as a humble offering.

The Eastern team has the following generals who can fight against strong enemies: Lu Zhongen, Bao Songyuan, Wang Jinghu, Zhang Shaoqing, Xu Wenyan, Gao Baosheng, Zhang Jiajun, Qian Jingyun, etc. Feng Nianhua is often injured, and Du Bensheng is still in training and in the rational stage of his game, so he cannot cope with strong enemies for the time being.

Eastern's tactics, although using man-to-man defense, are such that Xu Wenyan is too short and Zhang Shaoqing likes to run around. Using man-to-man defense, these two will inevitably have loopholes. Therefore, when using man-to-man defense, you must use Lu Zhongen, Zhang Jiajun, Bao Songyuan, Gao Baosheng, and Wang Jinghu. These five tigers are fast and strong. They will be able to guard their assigned players. Scoring will depend entirely on Wang Jinghu and, to a lesser extent, Bao Songyuan and Gao Baosheng. If using a five-man zone defense, the players should be Bao Songyuan, Lu Zhongen, Zhang Shaoqing, Xu Wenyan, and Wang Jinghu. This lineup was originally the full Paramount team, which has always used man-to-man defense. However, the reporter believes that if using man-to-man defense, if one person fails, everyone will be affected. Xu Wenyan is not good at guarding. Zhang Shaoqing has both over- and under-performance. Therefore, with the above lineup, I strongly recommend using the five-man zone defense, as they have been working together for a long time and can achieve perfect harmony. Moreover, the forwards are all good shooters, so they will definitely score more points. (Mei Bicheng)

### Football League Group A: Three Strong Teams Sing Triumphant Songs

The Police Brigade is Unbeatable; Lianyi and Donghua Each Win by Two Goals

In the football league, the Police, Lianyi, and Donghua teams each defeated their opponents last week, advancing to the next level and maintaining the three-way stalemate.

The Police Are Unbeatable

Last Saturday's match against the Jews at Jiaozhou Park did not attract many spectators, as people thought the outcome was already decided. But in fact, the police showed their superb skills. The little yellow-haired player's rush, the wingers' flights, and the team's seamless coordination were truly worthy of appreciation by true football fans. It is a pity that the police's performance was marred by the fact that in the last fifteen minutes, both teams became violent, almost engaging in a full-scale brawl, which was regrettable. Fortunately, it did not escalate. The police's Yu Tian deliberately injured someone in the first half and was ejected. The police played with ten men throughout the game, but the Jews were unable to win with a numerical advantage. Their skills were clearly inferior. The result was 4-1, with the little yellow-haired player scoring three consecutive goals, which was incredibly fast. He is truly a dangerous figure that our Chinese team must be wary of.

Lianyi Defeats Overseas Chinese United Team

Yesterday (November 28th) morning, the enthusiasm at Yiyuan Stadium was fervent. Lianyi's lineup was the same as in the match against the Three Provinces team, with Li Yichen still in the shadows, except that Yu Zhenyue was the only change on the left wing. After yesterday's game, it has become clear that Lianyi's defense is strong but their offense is weak. Li Tiansheng and Wu Qixiang are excellent in their positions and have superb footwork, unmatched by others. The forwards lack coordination and footwork. Besides Xu Wenkui's few good shots, Gao Baosheng and Fei Chunhua are too weak. Qu Yongfu plays too much baseball, and Yu Zhenyue is not worth mentioning.

The Overseas Chinese United team performed well. Xu Erzhu's handling of Qu Yongfu, combined with Yu Zhenyue's uselessness, was very appropriate. Unlike the previous game, Fan Xiaojin was marked, which prevented him from launching any attacks. Lianyi scored one goal in the first half by Fei Chunhua and one goal in the second half by Gao Baosheng, resulting in a 2-0 victory and advancing to the next level.

The Three Provinces Threaten Donghua

Yesterday afternoon, the weather was drizzly and gloomy, which dampened the fans' enthusiasm. At Jiaozhou, the scene was dismal. Everyone thought that Donghua would easily win, but unexpectedly, the Three Provinces' young players showed a new face and almost created a tie. This truly fits the saying that newborn calves are not afraid of tigers. Donghua's victory was assured, and He Fuzhen sat on the sidelines, while Lin Gen was stationed in the central plains. The center of gravity was shaken, and with Chen Shiming as the right midfielder, it was difficult to coordinate the attack. However, the Three Provinces' luck was also very poor yesterday. Donghua's shots were saved by Gao Zhiwen more than half a dozen times. If things had been normal, the bottom spot could have been defended. Yesterday's game was tense throughout. In the last fifteen minutes, Donghua was only leading 3-2. The Three Provinces' offensive was fierce, with the ambition to break through again and create a tie. But in the end, they lacked strength and were unable to achieve their goal. Instead, Han Longhai made a sneak attack, and Donghua increased the score to 4-2, adding two points to their standings.

Special Edition of Mr. Liu Haisu's Painting Exhibition

### Introduction to Mr. Liu Haisu's Painting Exhibition

— Chen Binhe

Mr. Liu Haisu will be publicly exhibiting his recent works (from November 30th to December 11th, at the China Painting Gallery at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Jing'an Temple Road). Mr. Haisu's integration and mastery of both Chinese and Western painting styles, along with his reputation in the art and cultural world, are already well-known to people in Shanghai, so there is no need for further introduction. However, my admiration for Mr. Haisu lies not only in his humble demeanor but also in his bold and unrestrained character; not only in his exquisite artistry but also in his unique creative approach. It is this bold character that allows him to create magnificent and imposing compositions; it is this unique creative approach that allows him to produce outstanding works that represent the era. I am originally an outsider to the art of painting, but I enjoy observing and studying it. Recently, I have had the opportunity to view famous paintings in the studios of gentlemen such as Wu Hufan and Liu Haisu, and I have benefited greatly. I deeply believe that painters of every era who achieve fame and are remembered forever must have a style in their works that suits the characteristics of the time, and they must create independently, not rigidly adhering to formal imitations of ancient models. Now, Mr. Haisu is also able to grasp the two special characteristics of the era and creativity. Furthermore, with a solid family background and a deep understanding of the painting styles of his predecessors, as well as extensive travels around the world and exposure to world-renowned paintings, his works are always ingeniously crafted, uniquely created, and powerfully imposing, truly extraordinary. This is by no means accidental. Therefore, on the eve of the exhibition, I offer a few words to express my humble opinion and seek correction from the visitors. The works in this exhibition are divided into two parts: the Chinese painting section consists of sixty-one pieces, and the Western painting section consists of fifty-nine pieces, truly a grand spectacle. Recently, I have also obtained several paintings selected by Mr. Haisu, which will be reproduced and printed later as a special collection, to allow readers to preview and to repay Mr. Haisu's refined intentions.
