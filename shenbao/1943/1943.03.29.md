### Wartime Life and Thrift

"Those whose lives are consistent with war are strong, those who are separate are weak, and those who are opposed perish." We can prove the correctness of this sentence by reading both Chinese and foreign history. For example, in the ancient Roman Empire, during times of peace, the general life of the people was decadent and romantic, arrogant and licentious, so they soon tended to destruction. Ordinary times are like this, let alone in wartime? On the contrary, for example, Japan, sixty or seventy years ago, when the aggressive forces of Europe and the United States knocked on the door, internal and external troubles were no less than those of China in the past ten years. However, because the lives of the people of the whole country were revitalized and everyone knew how to love the country, in a few decades, it leaped to become a world power. Also, like Germany, when it failed in the First World War, it was divided and oppressed by foreign powers, and there were party struggles and revolutions internally. However, because the people worked hard and lived a tense and serious life, it rose again to dominate Europe in twenty years. Looking at the history of our country, there are also many facts that show the spirit of wartime life. The most obvious examples are Tao Kan of the Jin Dynasty transporting bricks morning and evening and Zu Ti dancing with chickens at dawn, which were all manifestations of revitalizing one's own life during national crisis. Now that we have declared war on Britain and the United States for more than two months, our daily life should fully reflect the characteristics of wartime, learn from the hard work and patriotism of the modern Japanese and German people, increase production on the one hand, and save consumption on the other. Speaking of increasing production, our first step must be to achieve self-sufficiency in daily necessities, and the second step must be to enrich materials and supply the needs of combat. As for saving consumption, it is to save materials and keep them for national use. The Chinese nation was originally a diligent and thrifty nation. Being diligent can increase production, and being thrifty can naturally save consumption. Working hard in one's own position as a producer is diligence, and saving one's own life as a consumer is thrift. It is not a difficult task to move Mount Tai across the North Sea, nor is it something that heroes and heroes can do. It is a plain and glorious thing that every ordinary citizen can do. The true meaning of wartime life is nothing more than this. If you are not diligent or thrifty, taking ease as glory and spending money to maintain face, you are an unfilial son or daughter of the nation, and you will certainly be uneasy in your own conscience. Moreover, at this time when friendly countries respect us especially, seeing that our life after participating in the war is not a wartime life, the result will also affect their feelings. Therefore, each of us must not think that our personal life will not affect the entire nation, but must recognize the great significance of "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." The ancients said: "There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart." Today, we should all ask ourselves, is my heart dead? As long as the people's hearts are not dead, then everyone can see the glorious and bright future of our Chinese nation, restore the nation's self-esteem and self-confidence, cheer up, practice wartime life, encourage and warn each other, then not only can we be ashamed of the country and friendly countries today, but also in the future we can show great righteousness and leave glory to our children and grandchildren.

### Chairman Wang Returned to Nanjing from Guangdong Yesterday After Completing Inspection of Military and Political Affairs in South China; Published Announcement Before Leaving Guangzhou

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Chairman Wang of the National Government, accompanied by Military Training Director Ye Peng, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chen Chunpu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Longxiang, and military advisors Major General Teraoka, Colonel Saito, Tanaka Naka Kamus, and others, flew to Guangzhou on the 22nd of this month to inspect the military and political situation in South China after the war, and inspected the military police and youth groups in Guangdong. He expressed his deep appreciation for the organization and training of the army and youth, and the good results of the work-study schools. The inspection has now been completed, and at 1:20 pm on the 28th, he took a plane back to the capital. At that time, the heads of various ministries and councils of the National Government, and the diplomatic envoys of various countries, were all at the airport to welcome him.

Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) - Chairman Wang specially published an announcement before leaving Guangdong, which is recorded as follows: Since July 7th of the 28th year, Zhaoming must go to Guangzhou once a year. This is the fifth time. Every time I go to Guangzhou, what I hear and see always feels like a step forward. This is thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of the authorities of friendly countries overseas, so that the comrades in the province can devote themselves and achieve this result. In addition to the enthusiastic assistance of the authorities of friendly countries overseas, the comrades in the province have made progress in politics, military affairs, economy, and culture. Zhaoming will never forget this. The people in Guangdong of friendly countries and the authorities have the same aspirations and work together. Zhaoming will never forget this either. Every time Zhaoming goes to Guangzhou, seeing the elementary school students of friendly countries holding national flags, and the elementary school students of our country holding national flags, standing side by side on the road, intertwined and winding, he is always moved to tears. This time, he was able to personally hear the spirit of love and unity between the Chinese and Japanese people from the various performances of the kindergarten, national school, and senior girls' school students of friendly countries, as well as the residents in Guangdong. He felt even more pleased. When China participated in the war this time, it never failed to consider its weak national strength, how much it could contribute to the Greater East Asia War, and how much it could cooperate with friendly countries. However, inheriting the legacy of Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism, he felt that China would one day be able to stand on the same front with friendly Japan, seeking common sweetness in common suffering, and seeking common life in common death. From the perspective of the Chinese and East Asians, it is really reassuring. Guangdong is the birthplace of the Father of the Nation, and it is also close to Hong Kong. Compatriots engaged in industry and commerce in Nanyang and the Americas have deeply tasted the poison of British and American colonialism and recognized Pan-Asianism. Their enthusiasm for participating in the Greater East Asia War should be even deeper than that of ordinary people. Zhaoming, thinking of his elders, brothers, sisters, and aunts in his hometown, is even more determined to complete the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia with the spirit of courage, diligence, perseverance, and hard work. He is reluctant to leave and has endless words to say. Wang Zhaoming, March 26th, 32nd year.

Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Guangdong Provincial Government recently issued a bulletin stating that Chairman Wang of the National Government received a warm welcome from officials, civilians, the authorities of friendly countries stationed in Guangdong, and all Japanese expatriates during his inspection in Guangdong. During his stay in Guangdong, in addition to having various social events with the authorities of friendly countries, the Chairman gave instructions to the cadres of the province's party, government, military, police, and students, held cordial talks with responsible comrades from all parties in Guangdong Province, listened to reports from all parties, inspected the army, navy, police, and youth groups, visited Guangdong University, the new campus of Mingsong School, and the work-study school, and attended the welcoming ceremony for residents of friendly countries. The Chairman deeply appreciated the progress made in the province's party affairs, politics, military affairs, economy, culture, and youth group training in recent years. In particular, he was even more grateful for the enthusiastic assistance of the authorities of friendly countries. At the welcoming ceremony for residents of friendly countries, the Chairman witnessed and heard the various performances of students and expatriates from friendly countries, which fully demonstrated the spirit of love and unity between the people of China and Japan. He was deeply moved. The Chairman believed that Guangdong was the source of the revolution, and that a large number of compatriots were doing business in various overseas regions. Their opposition to British and American colonialism and their enthusiasm for practicing Pan-Asianism and participating in the Greater East Asia War were deeper than those of ordinary compatriots. Therefore, he placed great expectations on his fellow East Asians. The Chairman took his plane and left Guangzhou for Beijing on the 26th. Director General Ye, Secretary-General Chen, Vice-Minister Zhou, and military advisor Major General Teraoka, and others, followed him back to Beijing. When the Chairman took his plane and left Guangzhou, senior officials from China and Japan in the province, as well as the Consuls-General of Germany and Italy stationed in Guangzhou, went to the airport to see him off.

### Japanese Authorities Announce Return of Four Factories Including Shenxin; Last Batch of Military-Managed Factories Returned; Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry Issues Important Statement

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Since the incident, the purpose of the Japanese military authorities managing factories in various places has been to ensure that various industries continue to produce and do not stagnate. This is a necessary measure. Since the National Government returned to the capital, the authorities of friendly countries have repeatedly returned military-managed factories. After the National Government participated in the war, friendly countries recently transferred a large number of British and American enemy factories. Now, they are returning the remaining twenty-four military-managed factories in various places for the last time. Their intention is undoubtedly to assist the National Government in enhancing its combat power and making China a powerful member of the Greater East Asia War. We should deeply understand the good intentions of friendly countries and work hard ourselves. After the incident, the Japanese military managed a total of 140 Chinese factories in Central China. Their distribution area included 82 factories near Shanghai, 2 in Zhenjiang, 1 in Jiading, 2 in Jiangyin, 2 in Chongming, 1 in Taicang, 4 in Nanjing, 2 in Suzhou, 2 in Wuhu, 1 in Haimen, 7 in Wuxi, 2 in Jiaxing, 7 in Nantong, 1 in Qidong, and 3 in other places. There were 67 textile factories and 73 general factories. All military-managed factories in various places have been returned in 12 batches since 1940. The return dates of the previous eleven batches are recorded as follows: First time, October 31, 1940; Second time, November 20, 1940; Third time, February 28, 1941; Fourth time, May 31, 1941; Fifth time, July 31, 1941; Sixth time, October 31, 1941; Seventh time, May 9, 1942; Eighth time, August 13, 1942; Ninth time, October 10, 1942; Tenth time, November 8, 1942; Eleventh time, January 14, 1943.

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - After the National Government returned to the capital, in order to fulfill the spirit of the treaty and based on the principle of economic cooperation, to assist the rise of industry in our country, more than 100 military-managed factories have been successively returned. It is learned that the friendly country, in view of the fact that our country is currently participating in the Greater East Asia War with all its strength and can make the greatest contribution in economy, has decided to return all twenty-four factories, including the unresolved Shenxin Yarn Factory, to our country for management on the occasion of the third anniversary of the return to the capital. This move will make a great contribution to the National Government's revival of industry, speeding up production, and completing the great cause of wartime economic policy. It can also prove the intention of the authorities of friendly countries to assist the revival of industry in our country. Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry and the authorities of the Japanese Embassy have made important statements on this fact, which are explored below.

### Statement by Minister Mei

Since the occurrence of this incident, not only have most of the factories operated by Chinese people been destroyed by artillery fire, but also the factories invested by friendly countries in our country have been severely damaged. Fortunately, the Japanese military authorities have worked hard to restore them, and have protected and managed the remaining factories in our country, so that production has gradually recovered. After the return of the National Government, the Japanese military authorities, based on the principle of economic cooperation, declared their intention to return them. After joint handling by both parties, more than 100 factories have been returned in batches since the process began, which is unexpectedly smooth. This is a good proof of the good intentions of the authorities of friendly countries to assist the revival of our country's factories. Now that the National Government is participating in the Greater East Asia War with the strength of the whole country, it is especially hoped that it will make the greatest contribution in economy, and the friendly countries will also fully support the National Government's war and economic policies. There have been various factual manifestations that are visible to all. This time, the authorities of the Embassy of Friendly Countries in China have once again specially declared on the occasion of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital that they have decided to return the following twenty-four unresolved factories. After receiving the news, I am extremely grateful and pleased. I hope that the industrial circles of our country will cherish themselves and work hard, and should follow the example of friendly countries that are advancing industry and work hard to produce in order to contribute to the war and ensure victory.

Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said yesterday that the remarks made by former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Davies to "Life Magazine" in New York have confirmed Britain and America's willingness to concede Europe to the Soviet Union. Davies's remarks should be carefully noted. Although Davies tried to dispel doubts that the Soviet Union's war aims included annexing the Netherlands, the Baltic states, Poland, Bessarabia, and Tartary, the Soviet Union must achieve this goal before it can be satisfied and before it can show faith in Britain and America. We believe that the speech given by British Foreign Secretary Eden in Annapolis is of no great significance.

### Chongqing Army War Zone Units

This time, the Japanese army carried out a spring offensive in Central China, giving a devastating blow to the Chongqing army in the Sixth War Zone (Hubei Front), the Ninth War Zone (around Nanchang), and the Lu-Su War Zone (Su-Huai Front). However, the Chongqing army is now an integral part of the anti-Axis forces and dares to continue its stubborn resistance. Each war zone has become the foundation of regional defense, and its command organization is: Army Group - Army - Division. Here is an overview of the composition and deployment of each war zone:

(First War Zone) Located in northern Shanxi Province, the commander-in-chief is Yan Xishan, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Yang Aiyuan.

(Third War Zone) Centered on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line, it is distributed in the provinces of Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. In the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign last May, it suffered a severe blow from the Japanese army. The commander-in-chief is Gu Zhutong, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Tang Shizun.

(Fourth War Zone) Located in Guangxi Province, the commander-in-chief is Zhang Fakui. After the Japanese army moved into the French concession in Guangzhou Bay, Zhang was appointed as the commander of the forward troops to plot an invasion of the area. This attempt has been thwarted.

(Fifth War Zone) Distributed in southern Henan Province, northern Hubei Province, and western Anhui Province. The commander-in-chief is Li Zongren, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Sun Lianzhong.

(Sixth War Zone) Located in western Hubei Province, it controls the Yangtze River and guards the front door of Chongqing. The commander-in-chief is Chen Cheng, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Wu Qiwai. Although Chen Cheng has clamored to retake Yichang, he has suffered a severe blow from the Japanese army in Central China.

(Seventh War Zone) Located in Guangdong Province, the commander-in-chief is Yu Hanmou. After the Japanese army moved into Guangzhou, the remaining troops around the war zone were swept away.

(Eighth War Zone) Spans the three northwestern provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. The commander-in-chief is Zhu Shaoliang, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Fu Zuoyi.

(Ninth War Zone) Distributed in the provinces of Jiangxi and Hunan. The commander-in-chief is Xue Yue, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Yang Sen.

In addition, it is rumored that a Tenth War Zone was established in Yunnan Province at the end of last year, with Guan Linzheng as the commander, but the details are not known. In addition to the above, there are also two special war zones as follows:

(Lu-Su Special War Zone) Operates in the original areas between Shandong and Jiangsu provinces occupied by the Japanese army. The commander-in-chief is Yu Xuezhong, and the deputy commander is Han Deqin. Since the generals Wu Huawen, Li Wen, and Li Yongping joined the National Government one after another, the strength of this war zone has declined significantly.

(Ji-Cha Special War Zone) This also operates in the Hebei and Chahar areas under Japanese occupation. They can only barely maintain their existence while avoiding the eyes of the Japanese army. The commander-in-chief is concurrently held by Jiang Wen, the commander of the First War Zone, and the deputy commander is Pang Bingxun.

There are also two guerrilla-style border areas of Henan-Shandong-Jiangsu-Anhui. The former is commanded by Tang Enbo, spanning the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui; the latter is commanded by Wang Zhonglian, operating between Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui. Both forces are insignificant. Secondly, the Eighteenth Group Army, commanded by Zhu De and deputy commander Peng Dehuai, consists of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region (Commander Nie Rongzhen, in Shanxi, Chahar, and Hebei), the Lu-Ji-Yu Border Region (Commander Xu Xiangqian, in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Henan), the Northwest Shanxi Military Region (Commander He Long, in northwestern Shanxi Province), and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region (Commander Liu Bocheng, in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan). Most of them nest in the North China region. (Ding: Translated from the March 18th Asahi Shimbun)

German Headquarters, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's German military report stated that there are still defensive military operations in Tunisia. Although the enemy is numerous, they failed to achieve a decisive victory yesterday. The enemy attempting to invade was repelled by German and Italian forces. The Axis counter-attack drove the enemy back to their original positions. German bomber groups attacked a convoy near Algiers, hitting several enemy merchant ships.

Rome, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - An Italian military headquarters communiqué today stated that the Axis forces on the Tunisian front are currently resisting a new Allied offensive. Italian torpedo planes heavily damaged Allied transport ships off the coast of Algiers and sank three ships, totaling 32,000 tons. The Italian army achieved a triumphant victory. The three ships totaled 15,000 tons, 10,000 tons, and 7,000 tons. Another ship in the distance was on fire. German aircraft heavily damaged an enemy ship in the western Mediterranean and hit four medium-sized ships with torpedoes, one of which sank during the day.

Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - The German and Italian Allied forces on the Tunisian front launched a fierce attack with powerful units the day before yesterday. The second phase of the great battle in central and southern Tunisia has already begun. The enemy seems to be maintaining its original offensive plan: (1) A frontal attack on the Mareth Line, while special units bypass the right flank. This task is undertaken by the British Eighth Army. (2) Advancing eastward from the Gafsa area towards the coast, in order to encircle the Axis forces. The U.S. Fifth Army is the main force there, assisted by British and French forces. The enemy implemented this plan and launched attacks in several places, all of which were repelled. Fierce battles took place at that time. The enemy's strength is clearly very sufficient.

Bern, Switzerland, 27th (Havas News Agency) - According to the latest Axis war report from Tunisia, battles are currently underway on the central and southern fronts. All attacks on the Mareth Line by the British Eighth Army have been repelled. The British army has suffered heavy losses. The American radio station in Algiers said that fierce fighting is still taking place on the outskirts of the Mareth Line. The British Eighth Army is advancing slowly, but every step requires a hard fight. The Allied war report from North Africa only stated that the Eighth Army is advancing towards the Axis defensive positions. U.S. infantry has launched an attack on Fudou in central Tunisia. According to the U.S. military report from the Maknassi area, the U.S. military's eastward advance has been blocked by German troops controlling the high ground. In the Gafsa area, especially the El Guettar area, the initial Axis war report stated that the lines of communication between the U.S. military and its main force have been cut off, presenting a state of "uneasy silence." The ground has become hard under the increasingly intense sunlight. The troops have brought tropical equipment. On the northern front, the Allied forces claimed that there was skirmishing near the Axis front line a few miles northeast of Métouia-El Bab. Skirmishing was particularly intense south of the Ousseltia Valley. Both sides' air forces are very active. British and American aircraft bombed the Axis positions near El Hamma, which is located behind the Mareth Line. The Allied attempt to bypass the German army from here has been thwarted by strong Axis resistance. Axis aircraft cooperated effectively with ground units, bombing rear lines of communication and concentration points for British and American motor transport units.

### German Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Capture of Shchigry; Only Local Battles Elsewhere; Commander of the Cossack Army Killed in Action

Tangier, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - It is learned here that the U.S. military suffered heavy casualties in southeastern Tunisia. Wounded soldiers are being transported to Algiers and eastern Morocco every day, causing great unease among local residents and making supply very difficult.

German Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Capture of Shchigry; Only Local Battles Elsewhere; Commander of the Cossack Army Killed in Action

German Headquarters, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's German military report stated that the city of Shchigry, northwest of Kursk, was finally captured by German forces after several days of street fighting. The Eastern Front was generally quiet yesterday, with only local battles in a few places. German bomber groups hit a large ship near the Lebyazhy Peninsula.

Moscow, 28th (Allied News Agency) - The Soviet Information Bureau reported last night that there were no changes in the front line situation. The large-scale German offensive in the southern part of the Eastern Front was the first since June of last year. The midnight communiqué stated that there were no changes on any front line after March 27.

Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - The commander of the Cossack army, Lunenkov, who was fighting alongside the German army, has been killed in action on the Eastern Front. He was 50 years old this year. His father, General Lunenkov, served as the commander of the Russian First Army during World War I. The army was defeated by the German Eighth Army, led by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, in the Battle of the Masurian Lakes.

Soviet Border Area, 28th (Havas News Agency) - The fighting on the Eastern Front was deadlocked today. Only local battles occurred in the northwest of the Caucasus, on the north bank of the Donets River, and in the central sector. According to Berlin sources, the German army annihilated two Red Army infantry divisions and a tank brigade between Orel and Kursk. Because the Red Army had reinforcements arrive on the front line west of Kursk, they resumed their offensive but were repelled by the German army. The battle situation in each area of the Eastern Front is described as follows: (1) Northwest of the Caucasus, according to Moscow sources, the Red Army under General Maslennikov continued to attack in the Kuban River basin, attempting to reduce the bridgehead. They have already occupied two densely populated areas, and their vanguard has reached 20 miles northeast of Novorossiysk. The Red Army is fighting under "extremely difficult conditions," often attacking while standing in deep water. However, according to Berlin sources, all Red Army offensives have been repelled by the German army. (2) Belgorod Sector, the German army continued to attack the Red Army positions fiercely, breaking through one position, but it was soon repelled by the Red Army to its original position. The German army is advancing in two directions on the upper reaches of the Donets River, attacking the Red Army positions fiercely under the cover of artillery and tanks. The Soviet side has not announced the results. (3) Central Sector, the focus of the battle is still south of Bely. The German army is defending the area near Dorogobuzh, trapping General Konarev's forces. Fierce fighting is also taking place on the Yartsevo front. According to the latest news from Moscow, the position of General Konarev's Red Army near Dorogobuzh has greatly improved. Dorogobuzh is one of the German strongholds on the upper reaches of the Dnieper River, only 45 miles from Smolensk, and the terminal of a branch of the Nikitka railway. It passes through the Vyazma-Smolensk railway in Dorokhovo. However, as early spring arrives, the ice and snow on the ground have begun to melt, making transportation more difficult. The Red Army is advancing slowly in the mud, feeling the hardship of marching and constantly being disturbed by German rear guards. Moreover, the German army has laid mines in various places, making it even more difficult for the Red Army to advance quickly.

### The True Nature of Anglo-Saxons (Part 2)

— Original by Tokutomi Iichiro

Let me further discuss the greatest difference between England and Japan. England is a thoroughgoing parliamentary-centered country, while Japan is a thoroughgoing imperial-centered country. England's politics are bottom-up, while Japan's politics are imperial-centered. England's monarchs, though not formally elected by public vote like the United States today, were chosen through discussions among powerful clans, chieftains, and other influential figures, or with their promise of agreement.

England's history, in terms of foreign relations, is a history of being conquered by foreign powers or failing in attempts to conquer certain territories on the continent. In terms of domestic relations, it is a history of power struggles between the king and the people. And by "people," it initially referred to aristocratic landowners, then to middle and small landowners, and then to large capitalists and the middle class who had achieved commercial success, and finally to the general laboring population.

The result of the people's struggle for power with the monarch was the transfer of all political power to Parliament. As for the so-called Parliament, to be precise, it is not the upper house but the lower house, not the House of Lords but the House of Commons. As English history shows, England's Parliament, from the perspective of the land, is a body for collecting taxes. England is based on the idea that the nation is entirely a commercial joint-stock company, the people are its shareholders, and the king is its manager, appointed to protect or increase the interests of the shareholders. Therefore, even the smallest amount, even a penny, cannot be collected without the consent of the shareholders—the people.

"No taxation without representation" is an unwritten law since the founding of England. The American Revolution, though not entirely, was largely derived from this principle.

The English Parliament, with such characteristics, often clashed with the king over its demands. Therefore, the king always tried to minimize expenses as much as possible, avoid doing things as much as possible, and avoid convening Parliament as much as possible. However, when faced with unexpected needs to collect new taxes or restore old taxes that had been abolished, he had no choice but to convene Parliament. Once convened, Parliament gradually expanded its power.

If the king happened to disregard this principle, the people would rise up against the king in revolt. The first English Revolution occurred in this way, and the result was that Charles I became a sacrifice on the guillotine. Because the English Parliament dared to execute the king—although this Parliament had also been threatened by Cromwell's soldiers (the Iron Army)—actions such as deposing or establishing a king were as easy as a shareholders' meeting changing managers, without any obstacles.

The second revolution, which banished James II from England and welcomed William of Orange and Queen Mary from Holland, also demonstrates the power of the English Parliament. Dicey, Albert Venn, a British constitutional scholar, praised the unlimited power of the English Parliament, saying, "There is nothing the English Parliament cannot do, except that it cannot turn a man into a woman or a woman into a man by parliamentary resolution." This is quite true.

Therefore, in the English Parliament, matters such as changing the political system can be proposed by a single member's motion, and their realization is by no means impossible. Even in the mid-Victorian era, Sir Charles Dilke proposed moving the republican system into England. Although that gentleman eventually silenced his eccentric arguments, he served as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the second Gladstone cabinet and wielded considerable influence. It is also not unbelievable that the Queen complained to Gladstone about his position as Under-Secretary.

Such parliamentary centrism dominates England, even today. Baldwin asked Edward VIII whether he would sever his unnatural relationship with Mrs. Simpson or abandon the throne, forcing him to choose between the two. This, needless to say, was because Baldwin, before and after, had a majority of parliamentary members as his party members. Although it was Baldwin who carried out that matter, it can be said that it was Parliament that made it happen.

As mentioned above, parliamentary centrism should never be advocated in Japan. Anyone who advocates it is nothing short of a rebellious subject. However, some people who claim to be loyalists and patriots are actually advocating parliamentary centrism, and the world tolerates it without finding it strange. One must say that they ultimately regard Japan as the England of East Asia, or still hope that Japan will become the England of East Asia.

In short, to completely eliminate the bad habit of worshiping Anglo-Saxons in Japan, it is essential to first understand that the fundamental spirit of Japan and England, in terms of national foundation, is absolutely incompatible. This is the first and foremost requirement.

(III) Evaluation of Anglo-Saxons

What exactly are Anglo-Saxons? Historians describe them as:

"White, gigantic bodies, ferocious blue eyes, reddish-golden hair, voracious eaters, fond of drinking, guzzling day and night, without shame."

However, these words only scratch the surface of the Anglo-Saxons. If we dissect and observe these barbaric and animalistic Anglo-Saxons, we can see that they possess characteristics that cannot be easily categorized. Are they foolish? They are very quick-witted. Are they indulgent in pleasure? They are extremely active. Are they extravagant? They are very good at making money. Although their religious sentiment seems very strong, their pirate nature is ingrained in their bones. Although they love animals and are accustomed to walking dogs and playing with horses, they secretly abuse and slaughter them at will, without any pity.

Travelers around the world, even those who only know Japanese, are probably willing to acknowledge the dignified posture of the Anglo-Saxons, their air of overwhelming other nations. Not only do they themselves boast of having superior character, but they can also make other nations, regardless of love or hate, acknowledge their superiority. Even the French, who pride themselves on standing at the highest peak of world culture, write and read books titled "The Superiority of Anglo-Saxons."

Thus, they strut around the world looking down on everything. In fact, they are originally a very quarrelsome people in the world. Whether they are Englishmen from the old country or Americans who are their branch, except for the Jews, they all have the habit of squandering money like dirt. And among the Anglo-Saxons, there are also not a few Jews who are like tigers in donkey skins. They say, "As long as there is money in the world," they enjoy themselves to the fullest in all the winter resorts, summer resorts, hot spring resorts, and all other places of enjoyment in all corners of the world.

Originally, the Englishmen from the old country were a bit more stable, while the Americans from the new country were even more likely to put on the airs of the rich. Their sense of superiority can be explained by the saying "When in Rome, do as the Romans do," but no matter where they are, they always impose their own style, impolitely. Regardless of whether it suits the situation or whether others like it, they always force their goods on others. After all, it is because the consciousness that "the world is ours" exists in their minds.

Now, let me briefly describe the true nature of the Anglo-Saxons and present some evaluations of them. The great English poet Byron said:

"There is no one in the world as hateful as the English. I am very unhappy to be close to them, and if possible, I would like to hate them from afar. Except for hell, I have no place to live with them."

The English have been famous for lying since ancient times. Erasmus said:

"When it comes to the question of truth and falsehood, the English generally have a bad reputation."

Erasmus was a Dutchman, a great scholar of continental Europe, and Oxford University was where he lectured. He would never have had ill feelings towards the English, but he still said such words.

Also, Frederick the Great said:

"The first principle of English politics is to demand everything from its allies, while not contributing a single hair itself."

When the Anglo-Japanese alliance was concluded, if Japanese politicians had known Frederick's words, they would surely have been wary.

In the upper half of the Victorian era, the famous Foreign Secretary Palmerston declared:

"England has no permanent enemies, no permanent allies, but only permanent interests."

What Palmerston meant was that if it was in their interest, they could sell out their allies and shake hands with their enemies. This is the English habit. And this can be understood more than halfway by simply looking at the current relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Benjamin Franklin, one of the signatories of the American Declaration of Independence and the inventor of the lightning rod, said:

"Probably no nation does not hope for England to be humiliated."

Franklin's Twelve Virtues were his lessons for life. And Franklin, the proclaimer of these Twelve Virtues, actually hoped that England would be humiliated. This is inconsistent with his character. However, it shows how much the English are hated by the world.

Goethe said:

"No matter from which aspect, there is probably no place with as many hypocrites and sanctimonious people as England. No matter which country, there is probably no country as thoroughly dominated by 'my profit, my obsession' as England. No matter which nation, there is probably no nation as devoid of humanity in its political and personal relations as England."

Goethe was by no means a writer who habitually spoke deceptive and provocative words. He was a philosopher with the most complete mind, who had the universe stored in his brain. It was no accident that he said these words. The hypocrisy of the English is truly deeply ingrained. Their so-called "gentleman" is a title of hypocrisy. In their own country—in public view—they behave in a civilized, dignified, courteous, and respectful manner, but once they go abroad, they become unrestrained and indulgent, and their so-called pirate nature is naturally exposed.

### Rice Industry Organizes Joint Rice and Grain Cooperative to Plan for Civilian Food Supply and Military Needs

The Commercial Control Association has been established. Regarding the rice and grain sector, the Food Department has promulgated regulations to plan for the establishment of joint cooperatives by rice merchants in various regions. Rice merchant Lu Wenshao and grain merchant Fu Qian’geng of this city yesterday telegraphed the department to establish the Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Cooperatives. The original telegrams are recorded as follows:

Telegram from Rice Merchants

To Minister Gu and Vice Minister Zhou of the Nanjing Food Department,

It is our understanding that controlling resources is a key strategy for regulating the wartime economy. Recently, authorities of friendly nations, in the spirit of shared existence, co-prosperity, cooperation, have returned control to our nation. Your department, seeking to ensure wartime military needs and maintain civilian food supplies, has planned for rice merchants in various regions to establish rice joint cooperatives, strengthening the organization of the rice industry itself to achieve sufficient food and strong military effects. We foresee no grain left in the fields, no starvation among the people, full granaries, and a wealthy nation. This is upon your shoulders. We are deeply gratified to hear this news. Merchants and people in the Shanghai urban area are actively organizing. However, given that Shanghai is a major commercial port connecting China and foreign countries, with a large population and a focus of national attention, we respectfully request your personal guidance to provide direction. We respectfully submit this telegram for your consideration.

### Second Phase of Sugar Certificates to be Issued Starting Today

Following the implementation of sugar rationing by the Sugar Merchant Cooperative, the second phase of sugar distribution will begin on April 1st. Sugar certificates will be issued starting today. (1) In the Public Concession, they will be issued by the Municipal Council. (2) In the French Concession, they will be issued by the Conseil d'Administration Municipale. (3) In Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, Pudong, etc., they will be issued by the Food Bureau. The method of purchasing sugar with the second phase of sugar certificates, as well as the quantity and price, will be announced by the Cooperative at a later date. It is heard that the distribution of the second phase of sugar certificates has been improved, based on the addresses of the Class A retailers re-registered by the Cooperative. Therefore, certificate holders can purchase nearby from now on. The military authorities have approved 15,000 bags of sugar for distribution in March. The Cooperative has already handled the distribution: (1) to Class A retailers for sugar rationing, (2) to Class B retailers for business purposes. It is also stipulated that the first phase of sugar distribution is from March 11th to 31st. Certificates that are not collected within the time limit will be invalid. Certificate holders are urged to purchase from designated Class A retailers as soon as possible to avoid losing the right to allocation.

### Neighborhood Summer Sanitation to be Inspected by Jia Chiefs

As summer approaches, attention should be paid to sanitation. Residents casually dumping garbage and relieving themselves in the alleys are unsightly and harmful to public health. The two authorities now entrust the Baojia chiefs to investigate such instances. If garbage is found accumulated within a certain Jia chief's area, the Jia chief will conduct an on-site investigation to find the dumper. If it is a first offense, a fine will be imposed. If it is a repeat offense or if advice is ignored, in addition to the fine, detention may be imposed depending on the circumstances. There are also some petty citizens who, out of stinginess to pay the night soil collectors' tip money and monthly fees, secretly dump their chamber pots into the sewers at night. This is especially reckless of public hygiene and is harmful to the city. To encourage enforcement, the two authorities will reward those who catch someone dumping chamber pots on the spot with half of the fine imposed, to demonstrate encouragement and raise city-wide awareness of sanitation.

### Silver Reserve Committee Public Notes and Public Treasury Certificates can be Used to Borrow Funds at Face Value, and Certificates are Issued Based on Member Banks' Reserve Assets, Valued at 70% Each

To strengthen the reserves of basic and ordinary member banks, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee, in accordance with regulations, may provide assets paid into the Committee as reserve assets: (A) real estate within the Shanghai city area, (B) government securities or company stocks or bonds with market value in Shanghai, (C) other assets deemed qualified by the Committee. The Committee will issue member banks with (1) public notes accounting for 50% and (2) public treasury certificates accounting for 50%, based on 70% of the assessed value of the reserve assets deposited. Member banks may request to convert the proportion of public treasury certificates into public notes at any time. These public notes and public treasury certificates are registered. When member banks borrow from the Committee or among themselves, they can use the public notes and public treasury certificates as collateral and are allowed to borrow funds at full face value. If the market price of the reserve assets deposited by member banks falls or is damaged, the Committee may notify them to make up the difference. Violators will be dealt with in accordance with the covenant. Member banks, after subscribing to the reserve assets, should bear the obligation to deposit the full amount at any time according to their subscribed amount.

### Factories Must Obtain Permission Before Opening Night Shifts

It is learned that the French Concession authorities require factories within the Concession that need to open night shifts to submit detailed reasons for review. If deemed necessary, permission will be granted. Opening night shifts without prior approval will be considered a violation and will be punished.

### Chinese Cigarettes to be Distributed Starting Today

To unify cigarette distribution and eliminate the black market, the Central China Tobacco Distribution Cooperative implemented the first phase of distribution starting on the 25th of this month. Wholesale and retail merchants have already paid and collected their goods with cigarette distribution cards. The distribution of various cigarettes produced by the Yizhong Tobacco Company managed by the military and the Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco Company is being carried out first. The distribution of cigarettes produced by Chinese factories such as Huacheng, Nanyang, Dadong, and Fuxin will continue starting today. To ensure the strict implementation of cigarette price limits, the Cooperative has reached an agreement with the Municipal Council, the Conseil d'Administration Municipale, and the Police Bureau on enforcement measures. Buyers are allowed to report violations at any time. Violators: (1) Wholesale merchants will be dealt with according to the oath. In addition to confiscating the deposit, they will be severely punished. (2) Retail merchants will have their permanent distribution rights revoked and will be suspended from business. It is also heard that wooden signs have been issued to each contracted wholesale merchant, with the wholesale merchant's number and store name written on them, and they are ordered to hang them in conspicuous places.

The program for tonight will be even more spectacular.

### Malfeasance at Taihe Sugar Store in the Southern District Confirmed

Since the Municipal Food Bureau began implementing sugar rationing this month, with the aim of generally alleviating the serious threat of sugar scarcity in the city, it has found that retail sugar merchants in the Southern District have failed to comply with the Bureau's regulations and promote the initiative. Numerous violations of laws and regulations have occurred, which is deeply regrettable. The Food Bureau has already issued warnings to the sugar merchants involved in the malfeasance. It has come to light that Taihe Sugar Store, located at 194 Jinjia Lane (金家弄) on Limma Road (裏馬路) in the Southern District, has been selling sugar at 5 yuan (Central Reserve Bank notes) per kilogram under the pretext of converting granulated sugar, exceeding the price limit by a significant 3 jiao per kilogram. Furthermore, they are charging an excessive 4 jiao for packaging. This matter was reported to the Food Bureau by Zhu Guoming (朱國明), a resident of the Southern District. An investigation confirmed the report, and the matter is currently under discussion for punishment. The Bureau expresses its regret that the sugar merchants have failed to comply with the authorities' regulations for the sale of sugar. To effectively rectify the situation, it has drafted a comprehensive plan to eradicate the malpractice.

### Readers' Forum: After Reading the Article "Save Electricity"

— Hu Xianfeng (胡賢豐)

After reading the short commentary "Save Electricity" in the 23rd's newspaper, I have a deep feeling about the current electricity consumption problem in this port. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Shanghai Electric Power Company, due to the uncertain source of coal and insufficient coal reserves, has had to repeatedly ask electricity users to save electricity. Apart from special and social undertakings (schools, hospitals, etc.), the method of reducing electricity consumption applies to manufacturing factories, entertainment venues, and residences. The former (factories) are cut by about 10%, while the latter (entertainment) are cut by almost 90% or more. Comparing the two, social undertakings are certainly important, but I ask, can factories that seek production be treated the same as ordinary entertainment venues? The importance of factories, even before the war, I believe is very clear to all sectors. Moreover, in the present Greater East Asia War, Shanghai's position in the national wartime economy is at the forefront. The importance of its industry is self-evident. We can take an example at will: Germany, for many years, has never dared to slightly halt the work of domestic factories while campaigning south and north. When male workers are lacking, they are routinely supplemented by women. I remember a national defense expert in a certain country saying, "Only industry can revitalize a country." Since we know the importance of industry and manufacturing, and the urgency of wartime production, why does the electricity company coldly reduce electricity to factories that are working to produce goods?

The above is not a direct view. From a social perspective, factories are unable to work fully due to electricity restrictions. In a month, they often cannot work for half a month. Some factories are even restricted to the point where they cannot start work. Of course, factories are not charitable organizations. Because the power has stopped, workers have no work to do and are heading towards unemployment. Society has another group of people with no livelihood. Isn't this kind of situation easy for discerning people to see?

Furthermore, the original intention of saving electricity is that thrift is a virtue, but we must grasp its center. The entertainment venues in this city are a good example. If I say the opposite, if the method of restricting electricity is applied to thousands of entertainment venues instead of factories, then the entire society will definitely be prosperous, and at least it can save a little for people who are accustomed to enjoying themselves. However, in fact, we only see the opening of theaters, song halls, and art academies every day. Where is the electricity restriction and electricity saving?

I hope that people from all walks of life will put forward their opinions for discussion, and at the same time hope that the electricity company will do its best to dredge the source of coal to the authorities, and give Shanghai factories the minimum convenience for electricity consumption. This would be a great blessing for society and the country! (Reward for Helping Students)

### Economic Circle: Shanghai's Financial and Industrial Market Conditions Tend to Be Stable

It is heard that Shanghai's financial and industrial market conditions have become more stable under the strict control of the authorities in the past week. The interbank lending rate is quoted at 16%, and the official prices of commodities such as rice, miscellaneous grains, flour, soap, matches, soybean oil, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth remain unchanged. Trade in all industries is sluggish.

### Comment: Further Expectations for Trade Associations

After the authorities promulgated the regulations on trade associations, they also took steps to reorganize various trade associations. This is indeed an urgent task at present and goes without saying. In the era of material control, the most important institutions are the trade associations of various industries. However, due to differing interests among traders, there is often a habit of acting independently and establishing separate banners. Therefore, in the same industry, there can be as many as ten or more associations. The authorities are inconsistent, audits are impossible, and even mutual attacks and private interests are pursued, which is indeed undeniable. Therefore, in the future, for the same industry, it is urgent to stipulate a unified trade association, strictly define the name, and assign several leaders who are fair, honest, and reputable in the industry to be responsible for organizing it. The Municipal Economic Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should send personnel to guide and reasonably reorganize it, so that a small number of people or bad elements cannot take control or cause trouble, which would hinder the progress of the association's affairs. It is especially hoped that the government will promulgate various implementing rules as soon as possible in addition to issuing regulations, guide the organizational procedures, so that the reorganization of trade associations has a basis.

At the same time, the General Chamber of Commerce for Material Control and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other institutions, as they are both private commercial institutions, should advocate and supervise the trade associations and should convene the backbone members of various trade associations from time to time to hold symposiums to discuss the rectification of trade association regulations and the promotion of the government's economic program, and must thoroughly eliminate the bad rules and bad habits of various industries. By eliminating corruption and improving customs, the implementation of various policies will naturally be smooth.

### The General Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control Adjusts Lower-Level Organizations; Unit Associations Will Be Reduced to Below One Hundred

Since the establishment of the National General Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control, China's autonomous trade control mechanism has been established. On the 25th, the Supreme National Defense Council also passed the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, which were promulgated on the same day. Therefore, the lower-level organizations are estimated to be fully completed within one month. Regarding the adjustment of lower-level organizations, the General Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control has begun to investigate the existing associations and has repeatedly convened the main figures of various associations to discuss specific matters. In short, the focus of the adjustment of lower-level organizations is the extent to which the existing three hundred or more associations will be adjusted and merged. It is heard that the General Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control is adopting a policy of awaiting the automatic merger of the business community based on the principle of one trade per association, and the general business community is also quite aware of the situation and has the intention of automatic merger.

The General Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control's policy of adjusting lower-level organizations will minimize the number of unit associations as much as possible, intending to reduce them to below one hundred. It is expected that the joint associations of various industries will not exceed twenty.

At the same time, the Material Control Review Committee has been established, and the Chinese and Japanese representative members have also been decided. The first committee meeting is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on April 1 to discuss the comprehensive demand and supply plan for materials, guide the basic principles of control, etc. At the same time, the movements of Japanese merchants are attracting much attention from the outside world. It seems that the Japanese merchants' adjustment of unit organizations also intends to automatically adjust them based on the principle of one trade per organization. It is generally believed that the Japanese merchants will automatically merge under the guidance of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and be incorporated into the new production and marketing mechanism. (Mainland New Paper, March 28)

### Municipal Economic Bureau Orders: All Trade Organizations to Register

Central News Agency, Shanghai News: The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau, in accordance with the wartime economic policy guidelines promulgated by the National Government, is adjusting and reorganizing all old economic institutions that are not suitable for the wartime system. Therefore, it has issued a notice to all industrial and commercial organizations in the city, including all federations, joint business offices, trade associations, and other similar organizations that have not been approved for registration, to report to the Bureau for verification. Recently, it has been learned that the various trade organizations are actively registering with the Bureau, which is being handled by the Industrial and Commercial Registration Office of the Second Section of the Bureau. However, the organizations that have not yet completed the registration must complete the registration procedures before April 10. If they fail to register within the deadline, they will be banned in accordance with the law.

### Japanese Government Convenes a Roundtable Conference on Economic Affairs with China

The Japanese authorities are scheduled to return the concessions in China on April 1. The relations between China and Japan have entered a new stage of fulfilling promises. In order to adapt to the new situation, enhance the friendship between the two countries, and seek tangible achievements in economic cooperation, in order to complete the holy war, the Japanese government has convened more than 60 people involved in trade, investment, mining, textiles, and other businesses with China that have headquarters or main stores in mainland Japan. An economic roundtable conference is scheduled to be held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 9:30 AM on the 29th to ask representatives from various industries to understand the government's new policies and various administrative measures. At that time, Prime Minister Tojo (東條) and Minister Aoki (靑木) of the Greater East Asia Ministry will first deliver speeches, and then the roundtable conference will begin. The attendees include Prime Minister Tojo, Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army and Navy Ministry, relevant officials, and more than 60 people involved in business with China. President Yūki (結城) of the Bank of Japan and President Tsushima (津島) of the North China Development Company will also attend. (Mainland New Paper, March 28)

### General Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control Moves to New Address Today

It is now scheduled to move to 984 Avenue Haig (愛文義路), (former site of the Farmers Bank) today. Telephone numbers: (1) Public line 32925, 33015; (2) Director's office of each office 35543; (3) Counselor's office 35057.

### Translated Commentary: Stopping the Issuance of New Military Notes and Our Country's Responsibility

It is rare to see a special case of organizing military notes paid in military affairs during operations. However, the Greater East Asia War is now progressing step by step, and construction is being carried out on one side, which is the main goal of the current operation. In a country, having two systems of currency circulation, in a situation where their strength basis is different, will of course cause various inconveniences, not only making the unified currency policy encounter difficulties, but also affecting the work of strengthening the allied country of China. After the cessation of the issuance of new military notes, the National Government's currency has gained autonomy. Although the Central Reserve Bank notes can already unify China's currency, Japan's responsibility has not been lessened. The responsibility for supporting the Central Reserve Bank notes will be even greater in the future. In order to maintain the value of the currency, there are two indispensable conditions behind it: that is, the existence of productivity and materials. Therefore, it is necessary to increase production separately in various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and seek to communicate the exchange of materials in various places. This is the principle of maintaining the value of the currency and making Greater East Asia a truly co-prosperous sphere. Japan has never spared assistance to the National Government in terms of materials and funds, and will continue to make the greatest efforts in the future. Although military notes have established brilliant achievements in defeating the old legal currency in the past, we must know that the currency war will never end here, and further struggles are still ahead.

Literary Criticism

### The Reconstruction of Shanghai's Literary Scene

— Qing Zhi (靑之)

From the Sino-Japanese Incident to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai was called an "isolated island." The relationship between this "isolated island" and the Shanghai literary scene is like the relationship between a "greenhouse" in the wilderness and the flowers in the greenhouse. Therefore, at that time, no matter how full of struggle or how beautiful and lively it was, it was just a flower in a greenhouse. When the sound of gunfire rang out and the special nature of the isolated island disappeared, all of this became the past at the same time.

There are still many literary authors who either yearn for the past, or are decadent, or change careers, or are passively silent, etc. This is all very regrettable on the road to rebuilding the Shanghai literary scene.

The strength of the vitality of a flower blooming in a greenhouse needs to be tested by putting it outside. Similarly, whether Shanghai, which has lost the special nature of the "isolated island," can re-establish a brilliant cultural foundation depends on whether Shanghai cultural people have strong personalities. The past will never return. The special nature of the "isolated island" will not only never return, but the remnants will soon be completely cleared. The reconstruction of the Shanghai literary scene must recognize this reality, and then actively work to build the foundation for tomorrow, and on this basis, raise our literary banner.

### One in the Window

— Chen Kai (陳楷)

On a quiet road, there are very few vehicles passing by at this time when the sun is about to set. There are also very few customers in the shops on both sides, and they are all lifeless and without any vitality. The setting sun shines on the dusty windows of the shops on the left, seeming very dry. In the middle of that row of shops, there is a second-hand shop. Because the things sold are old and the windows are not cleaned, they are dirty and full of all kinds of things, and they are very messy. Among them, there is a violin hanging alone, playing a sad and indignant tune. We can very well hear that it is extremely disgusted with the world. At the same time, there is also a steel pen, standing firm and upright, with an indomitable expression. It seems very surprised to hear the violin's solo, and soon, it finally can't bear to want to stop the violin:

"Why do you play that kind of sad and indignant tone? The world needs us to constantly work hard to transform it. We are temporarily resting here now. Why should we worry ourselves? "

When the violin heard him say this, he stopped and replied to him:

"I don't want to live anymore. The world is full of cunning and cruelty, and there is no justice at all. What is there to stay in such a world? I can't bear it anymore. I can't live in such a world anymore. I hate everything, and I hate myself. I will break my heartstrings and shout out my throat. Please don't stop me. That is what I am willing to do and happy about."

The steel pen could not bear it anymore, and he shouted out:

"Who said there is no justice in the world, but it is hidden. As long as you go to find it, you will find it. But you are sad and indignant and don't want to get close to it, then you will never find it. As long as we work hard to break all the darkness and remove the sadness in our hearts, justice will be in front of our eyes. Look at the great figures of all ages! They have strong self-confidence and perseverance, and they have overcome any dangerous obstacles. They have succeeded, found the truth, discovered justice, and found happiness for mankind. Just like my former master used me to write non-stop, writing for the justice of mankind, until the moment he died, are there no justice in those books? Think about the happiness we have gained through struggle! Don't curse the world like that anymore! The world is beautiful and lovely! It's a pity you haven't discovered it."

The violin seemed to be thinking about the beautiful pastoral land that came from struggle. It emitted a quiet and pleasant tone. When we listened, it seemed that we had arrived at a vast land, with dense forests lined up on both sides. It seemed that the sky was already night, and the moon was slowly rising! At that end, there was a cottage in front of which was a pastoral land. That was such a beautiful and peaceful place! There was no cunning, only kindness and peace. Several people appeared in that place, and they were all working in harmony, without any looting. The violin seemed to gradually find it lovely and reluctant to give it up. Suddenly, it stopped its singing and said to itself:

"That is a fantasy, a fantasy, a fantasy that will never exist."

However, the steel pen said very confidently:

"All the strong and fierce events are entirely caused by demons. If we eliminate the demons, can't we get that beautiful and peaceful place? We have to work hard to find it ourselves. Now listen to me sing, so that we will no longer be discouraged."

So the steel pen raised his powerful throat and sang majestically:

"We are young, we are young,

We have hot hearts, and strength

We have the ability to work——

To create human happiness.

We have compassionate hearts to influence everything,

To create human justice,

To find the truth of mankind.

We have an indomitable spirit to destroy darkness,

To break the cunning thoughts of mankind,

To eliminate the cruel spirit of mankind.

We are young, we are young,

We have boiling blood, and useful brains,

We have the ability to work constantly

To make the world bright."

The violin was immersed in this majestic singing, and it seemed to be gradually awakening.

### Soul

— Song Lian

The price of white coal has risen again.

October 1942 was the peak period for the prosperity of white coal. In cities where it's impossible to save on heat, this is of course a temporary trend that can be eased. However, for the pot-bellied gentlemen, besides seeing it as a way to make money, a fake frown is already considered the pinnacle of sympathy.

However, "after a great war, there will surely be a great epidemic." Those friends who live on salaries and calculate every penny, and those outsiders who make a living by scavenging coal dust, have to become victims of this man-made disaster.

Misfortune finally struck this group of people. In the faint morning light, along with the rumbling sound of the night soil carts, one could no longer hear the cheerful sound of sifting coal, or the father's commands pointing this way and that. In the struggle for survival, diligence has lost its due power, deviating from the laws of life—

A group of souls with a spirit for work but without work opportunities are idle all day long, idle. However, the demon of hunger is, after all, terrifying. It drives thoughts to commit crimes, and having committed crimes, they lack the cunning instinct to deny it, the morality of merchants to feign innocence, while their original loyalty ruthlessly gnaws at their conscience. Thus, they cannot stand firm in the position of life and fall down.

Little Ba-zi, with a small woolen sweater under one arm and half a liter of rice in the other, passes by a familiar trash can, unable to resist casting a nostalgic glance at it. However, what is reflected in his eyes are only fish skeletons, withered vegetable roots, rags, and rotten paper. Frowning slightly, with a face full of worry, he turns to another path. This path has left an indelible impression in his mind, radiating an attractive force. Almost unconsciously, Little Ba-zi often falls into this path. Now that he has realized that he has already entered this path, an even stronger desire urges him to go further inside. Desire is filled with repentance, which has been troubling him these past few days.

Committing crimes for those not accustomed to it, and having no work for those who want to work—this kind of pain is enough to overturn an era, disrupting the peaceful state of mind of healthy people. In the past, although Little Ba-zi worked hard, he did not suffer the condemnation of his conscience and was able to maintain normal health. However, these past few days, due to the internal and external attacks, the function of his heart, due to excessive use, is sometimes particularly sensitive, and sometimes particularly contradictory, even to the point that at the critical moment of "robbery," he remains hesitant. However, he never thought that this was dangerous. Danger, in his view, was originally their duty. His only wish is to find a way to make a living elsewhere, to escape the vicious cycle of his current life. But this seems not easy, and he is always troubled by this point.

Under the gentle winter sun, his shadow is drawn out long. Unexpectedly, the woolen sweater he "did" yesterday is still fluttering in front of the golden "Pawnshop" sign. Moreover, it is marked with an eye-catching price: "Sixty Yuan." This makes him numb. He stole sixty yuan of someone else's property, but he bears the full infamy of committing a crime for the price of six yuan, leaving the rest for the old gentlemen sitting comfortably in leather armchairs to enjoy. He had witnessed the pain of his father, who lost his spirit because of his robbery, and even the shrillness of their voices when "calling back the soul."

"White Coal! Come home, come home with Mom... Go inside the house..." "Okay, I'm coming!" The hurried, hysterical gestures of the mother and the father shaking his head with a loud voice. All of this constantly wounds his heart. He always feels like he is walking into that trembling air, where everything around is a blurry darkness. A huge hand covers a lantern that is so small it doesn't look like it's "calling back the soul." When they have happy faces and hopeful hearts as they hurry home, the trash in their arms really feels like carrying a light, slender spirit. At that time, their faces really look like they have shared the third soul. The soul is really such a light thing!

He can't think anymore. He seems to see a small crying face about to burst his throat getting into his chest, constantly directing his actions. He wants to cry out loud, to confess that he has eaten the soul of the little thing, to confess the terror and the sin of robbery... He really wishes he could return everything to the little thing, but his soul—soul—soul—.

That night, in the roaring wind and rain, the west wind turned the sand on the ground into solid triangles, and the dilapidated street corner building emitted sounds like a coal stove again. In the pitch-black street, two pious faces vaguely appear. The woman scatters her long hair, letting the flames of the burning paper money pierce through the thick hair. The man shouts in pure Hubei dialect:

"Little Ba-zi, come back—come back—"

But it seems like "Little Ba-zi—

Who killed you, who killed you—"

On the cold, slippery, and trembling street, the fine rain is beating down. He forces the upward vitality of the paper money, making it sink—sink.

### Human Face Design

— Yun Sheng

Ears should grow in the middle, so that "honest advice is not unpleasant to the ear," and only one is needed, so that it can only enter and not exit, and will not be ignored!

Eyes should be larger, so that one will not "have no one in sight." The eyebrows should be removed to avoid flirtatious glances and create many love affairs!

Two mouths should grow, suitable for "distributing grain by head." No teeth should grow, so one can eat and say less. If one cannot chew rice, one can drink porridge!

Two pairs of nostrils should grow, to avoid "relying on others' breath," and also to eat more air. Even if one is ridiculed by others, one will never burst one's stomach!

### Expectation

— Dongpu

Listen, on the roaring sea—

Huge waves surge in the darkness,

A storm rages across the sky.

Hey! Don't be afraid,

Don't panic.

Use steadfast eyes to gaze into the distance.

Shake off all your strength,

Strive forward! Break through the treacherous waves!

We are together on a lonely boat,

We live together, we die together.

One day, dispel the gloomy atmosphere,

And the clamorous universe returns to its original state.

Fear and panic drift away in the waves.

See white clouds lingering in the sky above the sea.

See the green seedlings planted on the shores of the happy other side.

A bright song rises on the lonely boat.

The hazy East,

Emerges with a dazzling dawn.

### How I Pass My Evenings

— Fang Qiong

It has been four years since I stepped into this city full of intoxicating romantic atmosphere. In these many days, I have lived a tightly packed schedule every day, dispatching thousands of unforgettable evenings.

Thousands of evenings, along with the social environment and life turbulence in recent years, began to lurch and somersault; I have spent many different joyful and beautiful evenings, but I can't count how many difficult and sorrowful nights I have endured; I only feel that the days are getting more and more tense, and sometimes I even feel that my whole life has fallen into the abyss of life, unable to touch the edge, unable to grasp the shore...

Since childhood, I have stubbornly wandered to foreign lands, and I have acquired a hard heart. This time, under the endless flames of war, I was blown to Shanghai (initially, of course, I came to escape). At that time, I said to myself:

"The mouth that is used to eating tree bark and grass roots is now preparing to learn to absorb dust and coal dust!"

But I have always been attached to the fact that Shanghai is a cultural source, so no matter how much difficulty the problem of living brings me, I refused the repeated tempting beckoning from my family. I stubbornly lived like a groundhog squatting in a hole, living alone.

So the days unfolded to the present,

I cherish and protect my every evening. During the day, from eight o'clock in the morning until eight o'clock in the evening, I fully solved my desire for knowledge and the problem of living, so all day long, I packed all my twelve hours, teaching, reading, and teaching again in the evening. Every night, whether it is a night with the northwest wind blowing tightly, or a night with heavy rain pouring down, wandering along the noisy city, I look for the quiet streets, stepping on my own footsteps that I can hear myself under the evening lights, dragging my tired body back home, and begin to spend my evening.

I leave all my private affairs, big and small, to be taken care of in the evening. The house is very desolate. I start to unpack and read the letters from my distant hometown; my elderly parents complain to me with resentment about the situation in their hometown, and also earnestly exhort their children; in this way, I once again remember my hometown in the misty fog, a long series of quiet scenes flashed through my mind, it seems that many kinds of clamorous and nagging voices attacked me; suddenly I saw my father stroking his wheat-awn-like beard, saying to me:

"Child, come back! The land is gold!"

Parents love their children, but they don't understand the hearts of their children, they don't understand why their children are willing to leave their inch of golden land, and wander and run outside all day long, but there is no complaint, no resentment, even if they are so poor that they are starving from morning till night.

"Since you are so poor, why don't you go home and stay for a while?"

But I silently shook my head.

"There are many people who go home to sit at this time, it's always better to be at home than alone outside."

I still smiled at those who cared about me.

In fact, I can only afford one lunch a day. In the long evenings, I have the "good fortune" to smell the aroma of rice wafting from the streets, the sweetness of the rice grains makes my nostrils open and the wrinkles on my face straighten out; my hungry stomach attacks me so fiercely, my intestines are squeezed tightly together, but I warn myself:

"How many people are suffering the same fate as me? Otherwise, the poverty of the soul will make you..."

So I hold my head high, smile, and boldly continue to spend my own beautiful evening.

I cherish and protect every inch of time in my evenings. I will not forget that part of the books on my desk are waiting for me. I joyfully finish reading the prescribed number of pages every day, and I feel as relaxed as if I have had a full dinner; I have completed a part of my difficult task of staying in Shanghai. I know myself that the meaning of our human existence is here, as long as the cells are still active, I demand that the will to work will never fade; only this kind of life allows me to fearlessly strive to develop.

"Roosters look for high perches, large ships look for wide seas, and women look for a peaceful life where they can enjoy themselves."

Friends before and after me point and talk about me, they scold me, I won't find a few rich boyfriends, can spend sweet evenings in the brightly lit dance halls; even they pityingly teach me how to be charming in the evening and deal with men; but I tell them, I am not afraid of material difficulties.

I know that in these evenings, I have different gains from them. I am planning to store five years of food—this is originally the fruit of every evening that I have tasted hardship!

After reading the prescribed books, I stand up, take a breath, and hurriedly circle the room twice. The room is so small that these two circles seem like a key turning twice in a lock; I sit down at the table again and start to review my work of the day.

During the day, the sun burns me, like a potter burning pottery, giving me color, sound, and hardness; in the evening, this is a string of dark shadows, quietly, I peel off my own skin again and again, through the depths of my soul, I examine some of the corrosive longings that remain, these corrosive lamentations, if they grow in my heart, will bring me depression and sorrow, chilling my heart, what I need is the tenacity of white, discarding all dross, so after peeling off my skin again and again, each time I grow a new layer of skin.

I judge many thoughts, these thoughts are many and long, like the roads in the grassland, so my evening is easily dispatched.

Every evening, I warn myself.

"The passage of time is so rapid, when you have not grasped this evening and prepared to do something, the evening has passed again."
