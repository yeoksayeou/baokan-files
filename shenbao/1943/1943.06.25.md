### Crucial Current Economic Issues: Hopes for the Second National Economic Conference

The Second Plenary Session of the National Economic Council is being held in Nanjing today, bringing together administrative personnel, entrepreneurs, and economists. The government is reporting on economic administration measures, entrepreneurs are presenting the successes they have achieved in promoting economic endeavors and the difficulties they have actually encountered, and economists are providing theoretical opinions on solving problems. The aim is to review the past, integrate current realities, and determine future strategies. We believe this should be the purpose of the meeting, and not merely to "go through the motions" by holding a meeting every so often according to the meeting rules.

The scope of the agenda to be discussed at this meeting has not been publicly announced in advance. We believe that the "Wartime Economic Policy Outline" discussed and decided at the first meeting on February 12 was approved by the Supreme National Defense Council on the 13th and promulgated by the National Government. Therefore, this economic policy outline can be said to be the achievement of the first meeting of the council. At the second meeting, after four and a half months, the first thing that should be done is to thoroughly review the items included in the "Economic Policy Outline" that was decided upon. (1) Which items have already been accomplished? What are the results? (2) Which items are being implemented? What are the results? (3) Which items are practically unworkable or cannot be implemented at present? (4) Which items have not yet been implemented, and what are the reasons? (5) Which items particularly need to be actively promoted? This review work will be an important task of today's meeting. Because the important sectors of the wartime economy have already been fully included in the policy outline, it is only necessary to develop specific implementation plans based on the policy outline. If this can be thoroughly done, the two major goals of supplying military materials and stabilizing the people's livelihood in the rear can be achieved. There is no need to create new economic policies or seek other economic systems. Therefore, we dare to say that this meeting should focus on reviewing the degree of implementation of the previous proposal, making revised proposals that adapt to the environment and facilitate implementation, and at the same time, making proposals to support the government in implementing the resolutions.

We have always believed that improving people's livelihood and stabilizing people's livelihood are the most important goals of government economic measures. Only when people's lives are stable can materials be supplied continuously to adapt to total war participation. Of course, what we call the economic policies to stabilize people's livelihood is not some magical remedy that needs to be sought from famous mountains. The published policy outline is already quite perfect. As long as the various departments responsible for implementation and promotion can exert their leadership capabilities, proceed step by step, follow the order, cooperate with each other, and help each other, there will definitely be progress day by day and harvest piece by piece. If the policy is announced and the meeting is held, and that's the end of it, then the words on paper will always be words on paper, and they will not change even after thousands of years, let alone four months.

Based on what we have seen and heard in the past four months, based on the wartime economic policy outline, and with the goal of stabilizing the minimum standard of living, we would like to briefly express our views on economic measures as follows:

(1) Increasing production is, from any point of view, the most important point in the current economic problem. Plans for increasing agricultural production should be formulated by region and implemented as soon as possible. The improvement of seeds, the use of new agricultural tools, and the guidance of cultivation techniques must be carried out practically from the lower levels of rural areas. Rural loans should start with rural surveys. The Bank of Communications is already carrying this out, but the strength of one bank cannot be universal. Banks like the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, with its large amount of capital, should take a long-term view and do things that are beneficial to the country and the people, organize an agricultural loan group, and handle it jointly to build up real strength. Here, of course, the aim is to help farmers increase production, not to buy up land and create big landlords. In addition, areas such as the drought-stricken provinces of North China are in urgent need of seeds, so efforts must be made to provide relief to prevent continuous crop failures and increase the suffering of the people. On the industrial production side, overall planning is also needed. Military supplies and essential civilian goods must be fully increased in production, and raw material supply and transportation convenience must be taken into account. In particular, the unreasonable situation of power supply should be adjusted urgently. For example, factories producing daily necessities are affected by power restrictions, even though they have plans to increase production and have raw materials and labor. However, entertainment venues, which are purely consumption-oriented, do not have power supply difficulties. If this can be shifted from the latter to the former, the benefit of increased production of daily necessities can be reaped on the one hand, and the waste of consumption can be reduced on the other hand. If such unreasonable phenomena can be completely and thoroughly adjusted from the economic perspective of the interests of the country and the people, it is believed that it will be of great benefit to stabilizing people's livelihood and contributing to the war effort.

(2) Stabilizing the currency value is also the most worthwhile and necessary thing to do in the current stage of economic problems. We are not saying that there is any instability in the current currency value. At the last economic conference, there were rumors in the market that the government would issue new currency. After Minister Zhou clarified this, the rumors subsided. Not long ago, there were rumors in the market again that the Central Reserve Bank would issue 500-yuan notes. The announcement of the revised law of the Central Reserve Bank proved that there was no such provision, and the rumors were false. All these rumors, although fabricated out of thin air, were self-disturbing. However, from the standpoint of the people, we must also calmly calculate the trend of the purchasing power of money. Not to mention since the exchange of old currency in June last year, even after January this year, it can no longer be said to be normal. However, although the formation of this trend is not simple, and the cycle of rising prices is already a common perception, this perception has evolved to the point where it can no longer be remedied by justification and explanation, but must be corrected by facts. That is, currency policy and price policy must have a close and mutually supportive relationship.

(3) Prices, needless to say, are the most important issue for people's livelihood. Since the last economic conference, the National General Association for Commercial Control has been established, intending to use controlled economy and unblocked materials as means to achieve the goal of suppressing and stabilizing prices. Designating major commodities for registration first, allowing them to be transported first, grasping materials, unblocking materials, and distributing materials has not yet been realized. In addition, hoarding and speculation were originally a cause of rising prices. During this period, the government also ordered a thorough investigation and organized a Materials Investigation Committee. The Municipal Economic Bureau also has a valuation agency established. Measures for materials and prices seem to be under active discussion. However, when we observe the facts, the prices in shop windows are increasing month by month, and in the recent days, they have been surging again, especially for yarn and cloth. Here, we hope that the relevant authorities will pay close attention to this issue and jointly seek effective containment measures. It is not appropriate to let it go naturally, and it is even more against the wishes of the people to observe and shirk responsibility from each other.

We really have no lofty opinions, but when we think of the future of people's livelihood, we are worried. Reviewing our past statements, we have made multi-faceted considerations on the issue of prices, saying it again and again, but today's facts are still the same, which increases our shame of silence. Therefore, what we want to sincerely contribute to the gentlemen of the National Economic Conference today is only the two sentences "review the old and know the new" and "emphasize implementation". What is recorded today is still what was said yesterday, that is the truth; what is said today will be implemented tomorrow, that is practical work.

### Follow-up Report by Japanese Reporters in North China: Chairman Wang Talks About the Current Situation in China

Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Beijing Japanese Reporters Group recently went to Central China for inspection. When they were in Nanjing, Chairman Wang kindly received them and briefly talked about the current situation in China. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) "The Rise of Political Consciousness": The Supreme National Defense Council decided on the Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda on June 10. The purpose is to mobilize the national cultural and ideological circles to raise the wartime consciousness of completing the Greater East Asia War. In the future, we will rectify thoughts and train the people's wartime life according to this outline. (2) "The National Government and the North China Political Affairs Committee Under the National Government": The Executive Yuan of the National Government is responsible for the administration of the directly administered areas. The administration of the northern provinces and cities is the responsibility of the North China Political Affairs Committee. What the central government expects from the North China Political Affairs Committee is to take the same steps in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects in accordance with the central government's intentions to complete the Greater East Asia War. (3) "Cleansing the Countryside": The work of cleansing the countryside has been promoted for two years, and the common areas have gradually expanded. Currently, we are planning to promote the security range to the northern Jiangsu region and the northern Hangzhou region. In the past, the work and administration of the cleansed areas were the responsibility of the Cleansing Committee, but recently it has been changed to be directly under the command of the Executive Yuan, in order to thoroughly penetrate political power. (4) "Movements of the Chongqing Side": The elements of the Chongqing side are three, namely its direct line army, miscellaneous army, and the people. The first type of Chongqing's direct line army, such as Hu Zongnan, currently has 600,000 troops, but has not fought the Japanese army once. They falsely believe that the United Kingdom and the United States will eventually win, and even if they do not win, they will not fail, so they continue to engage in useless resistance. The second type of miscellaneous army was originally opposed to Chiang Kai-shek, but they still lack understanding of the fact that the National Government is a powerful and trustworthy government, so they still follow Chongqing Chiang's orders to engage in resistance. If they accurately understand the National Government's concept of peaceful nation-building, they will surely come to participate in the peace movement. As for the third type of people, they have long been deeply disgusted with Chongqing Chiang's exploitation, but they lack the strength to actively carry out large-scale opposition movements. Under this situation, the reasons why the Chongqing side can maintain its position are three: first, the Chongqing side has food and self-sufficient rural areas; second, it sacrifices the people to ensure the army, especially the Chongqing direct line army, and its strength has not been excessively consumed; third, it receives various material assistance from the United Kingdom and the United States, and actively publicizes to prevent the people's hearts from being scattered. In short, we should not expect the Chongqing side to collapse on its own, but should increase the strength of the National Government and absorb the Chongqing army to actively promote the collapse of the Chongqing side.

### Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry Talks About the Issues of Materials Management and Control

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – Since the National Government participated in the war, all political institutions, economic construction, and materials management have been actively carried out in accordance with the wartime system. Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry gave a detailed explanation yesterday on the issues of materials investigation, management, and control. The main points are summarized as follows: Recently, in order to further thoroughly investigate the hoarding and speculation of unscrupulous merchants manipulating the market, the Supreme National Defense Council has specially established a Materials Investigation Committee, which was officially established in Shanghai on the 22nd of this month. The list of Chinese and Japanese members has been appointed by the competent authorities. For the convenience of work, the two sides will jointly work in Shanghai. In the future, the Chinese and Japanese sides will adopt the method of proceeding separately. All areas under the jurisdiction of the French Concession, the International Settlement, and the municipal government will be strictly investigated. Once hoarding is discovered, the Materials Investigation Committee will set an appropriate price to purchase it. However, the ultimate goal is still to eliminate the wind of hoarding, stabilize prices, and evenly distribute supplies. The investigation work is scheduled to begin in early July. The internal organization of this investigation committee is extremely strict. Senior Chinese and Japanese officials in the city expect that the work will proceed very smoothly in the future. They will never allow ordinary speculative unscrupulous merchants to escape the law, harm society, and affect people's livelihood. In addition, the National General Association for Commercial Control has recently been transferred to the Executive Yuan, so there will be more perfect measures for the future control and management of materials. The authorities are actively planning and expect that they can gradually revise and implement them soon.

### Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Food Talks About Food Issues

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Zhou Naiwen, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food, the day before yesterday to inquire about the government authorities' measures for food for the people during the time of year when the old grain is running out and the new grain has not yet been harvested, the harvest of the wheat season this year, and the distribution of flour and other issues soon. Vice Minister Zhou answered in detail one by one, and the details are recorded as follows: (1) The wheat in various parts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has generally been harvested this year, but there was slightly more rain during the harvest season, and the harvest was slightly inferior. On average, it is estimated that the wheat harvest in Central China this season is more than 80%. As for North China, the food situation this year is also expected to be a good harvest. (2) In previous years, every time the old grain ran out and the new grain had not yet been harvested, there was always a food panic. Now it is that time again. The Ministry is responsible for not shirking its responsibility because of the difficulties, and is still urging its internal and external subordinates to try to remedy the situation. On the active side, it is searching for rice and grain as much as possible to supplement a large amount of flour and wheat. On the passive side, it is persuading people to conserve consumption, strengthening anti-smuggling, and preventing outflow. In short, the difficulties can be overcome. (3) Flour is also a major food item. How to collect and distribute it uniformly is being planned and implemented by the National General Association for Commercial Control. The Ministry of Food has now estimated the amount needed for distribution and sent it to the Commercial Control Association for review. How to sell it in various places in the future still needs to be carefully considered.

### Java Resolves to Assist Japan, Convenes General Assembly of Various Ethnic Groups Yesterday, and Expresses Gratitude for Prime Minister Tojo's Statement

### US Coal Miners' Strike Resolved, Secretary of Interior and Lewis Reach New Agreement

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington: The US coal miners' strike has largely come to an end due to a new agreement reached between Lewis and Secretary of Interior Ickes on the 22nd. According to the new agreement, the resumption of work is conditional on placing all coal mines under the management of the government (represented by Ickes). The Policy Committee of the Mine Workers' Union declared that if the government's management ceases before midnight on October 31 during the temporary resumption of work, the resumption of work agreement will automatically be terminated.

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington report: US coal mine owners have sent a letter to the Wartime Labor Board, requesting that the mines be returned to them. The letter stated that the mine owners had their mines taken over due to their compliance with the orders of the Labor Board. At the same time, news came from the coal mines at noon yesterday (Eastern War Time) that a quarter of the coal mines would resume work before dark, and that all production might be resumed by today (Thursday). Lewis, Chairman of the Mine Workers' Union, ordered an immediate resumption of work on Tuesday as "employees of the government," with wages and working conditions remaining the same. The coal miners' strike, involving more than 500,000 miners, has now come to an end. All US coal production will be supervised by Secretary of Interior and Coal Administrator Ickes until October 31 of this year.

### Martial Law in Detroit Extended for 24 Hours

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Michigan report: Detroit, the center of the American automobile industry, which has been under martial law for the past few days due to serious riots between black and white residents, saw a thousand foremen at the Rose River plant of the Bland Company go on strike yesterday afternoon in sympathy with the sixty-odd workers who were fired for striking last week. At the same time, President Roosevelt announced that he intended to ask Congress to raise the military service age limit to 65 in order to curb strikes. Federal troops immediately rushed to the Rose River plant to suppress the strike after a spokesman for the Ford Company said there was some disturbance in the factory. Roosevelt said that his action was intended to prevent any interruption in the work of factories and coal mines owned or operated by the government. Before the coal miners' strike was resolved, the government had taken steps to establish an organization to force all coal miners who were absent from work without cause to join the army. The actions of the leaders of the US Mine Workers' Union are intolerable and have aroused the indignation and hatred of the majority of people in the country. At the same time, according to a Washington report, the recent racial unrest, including the Detroit riots, will be publicly tried next week. The state of martial law in Detroit has been extended for 24 hours by the Governor of Michigan. Black and white workers are now working together to investigate the ringleaders of the riots. Police authorities have begun to charge more than 600 people with crimes of varying degrees. The first batch of black and white defendants were sentenced to three months in prison yesterday.

### Italy Calls Up People to Participate in Wartime Labor Service

Rome, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Havas Agency reports that an Italian newspaper published an article yesterday explaining the reasons for the authorities' call-up of the 18th class of people to participate in wartime labor service during this period. The main reason is that a large number of munitions workers who were exempted from military service and soldiers on temporary leave have now been recalled to the military by the military authorities. At the same time, officials in military organs who are suitable for working on the front lines have also been transferred to the front lines. Therefore, there is a sudden shortage of workers in domestic production and management organs, so it is necessary to call up their personnel to supplement them. The authorities take into account the family responsibilities of the women who are called up, so women with complicated family affairs or who are breastfeeding will be exempted from service.

The book also warns the public not to be misled by radio propaganda or leaflets, and instructs two wartime guidelines: first, resistance is necessary no matter what; and second, it is wrong to publish any news about the war effort. The book also instructs the people to abide by international law even if the enemy does not. The book also instructs soldiers to report to their units as soon as possible, and if there are no trains to ride, to ride cars, bicycles, or walk. Civilians who can participate in combat can join the National Defense Forces or the militia. The book also provides various instructions to non-combatant civilians in occupied or non-occupied areas. Finally, it says, "Sweden hopes to have the ability to defend itself and is determined to defend itself."

### German Reinforcements Arrive in Greece to Strengthen Southeast European Defenses, Rommel Appointed Commander of Southern French Defenses, British and American Psychological Warfare Against Turkey Intensifies

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Havas report from Former Beijing, which received German news on the 23rd: German reinforcements have arrived in Greece. This German reinforcement, like two years ago, has transported its 400-horsepower tanks to Salonica in order to strengthen the defensive line in southeastern Europe.

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Havas Agency reports: Regarding the Mediterranean theater, although there is not much new news at present, the military authorities in Berlin are paying close attention to developments in that area. The impression here is that the silence in the Mediterranean region is gradually coming to an end. The extent of the anti-Axis forces' activities in that area known to the German side has not yet been revealed, and no announcement has been made regarding the anti-Axis report that the German army has sent reinforcements to the Mediterranean, but military authorities here ensure that the German army will assist the Italian army in repelling any enemy attacks.

Ankara, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Havas Agency reports: Measures taken on the Turkish-Syrian border and rumors of the severance of diplomatic relations between France and Turkey are all manifestations of the British carrying out psychological warfare against Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean. People here believe that the reported visit of British land and air forces to the Near East is a routine visit and does not involve any military measures to be implemented immediately. Regarding the possibility of this military action, there have been several contradictory rumors in Syria, but the conclusion is that any large-scale military action based in the Levant is difficult to implement at present, but action against the Dodecanese Islands (Italian-owned islands in the southern Aegean Sea) is still possible. If put into practice, its psychological significance is more important than its military effect.

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to well-informed sources in London today, Germany has established a headquarters for defending against aggression in Avignon in southern France, with Marshal Rommel as commander.

### German-Soviet Front Lines Stand in Tense Standoff

(Special Dispatch from a Correspondent in the Vicinity of Kuibyshev on the 20th) June 22 marks the second anniversary of the outbreak of the German-Soviet War. During these two years, the command of operations has sometimes been in the hands of the Germans and sometimes in the hands of the Soviets, with extreme changes, and neither side has achieved decisive results. Summer is favorable to the Germans, while winter is favorable to the Soviets. The German-Soviet War has passed in this situation for two years.

Air Force Begins to Become Active

Last summer, the German army swept through the vast area of the Don River, the Kuban River, the northern Caucasus region, and the Kalmuk steppes, reaching Stalingrad and arriving on the banks of the Volga River, the Soviet Union's artery. However, after winter came, the Red Army turned to the offensive, regaining Stalingrad, the Don River region, the Kalmuk steppes, and the northern Caucasus, and breaking into the Donets region and recovering Kharkov. There, it encountered the German army's counter-attack, abandoned Kharkov, and retreated to the east bank of the Donets River again. April and May were spent by both sides in preparing for battle, and the Eastern Front was temporarily calm. However, since the beginning of May, the activities of the German and Soviet air forces have gradually become more active. The Soviet Air Force began long-range bombing of East Prussia, Poland, and western Ukraine, while the German Air Force concentrated on bombing the transportation network in the front-line areas of Rostov, Bataisk, Krasnodar, and Kursk. As a result, the Soviet Air Force also stopped long-range bombing and turned to bombing German transport facilities and troop and material concentration points in the front-line area. By June, the reciprocal bombings became more intense, with the German Air Force attacking the skies over the upper and middle reaches of the Volga River, attacking Gorky and Yaroslavl, and bombing Saratov.

Which Side Will Strike First?

As such, the situation on the Eastern Front is extremely tense. The question now is which side will begin large-scale military operations first, and when and where. The German army began operations on the Kerch Peninsula on May 8 last year, and on May 10, in order to contain the Soviet army, it turned to an offensive in the Kharkov area. According to the Soviet Information Bureau, this counter-offensive only succeeded in preventing the German army from attacking Rostov, and the German army launched a strong attack on Sevastopol in early June, and in mid-June, it turned to an offensive in Kupyansk, east of Kharkov. By the end of June, the German offensive aimed at Valoniz had reached its peak. This year, June is fast approaching, but the Eastern Front has not yet begun large-scale operations like last year. It is likely that it is too late. How should this situation be explained? Because the winter war continued for a long time, it was necessary to spend a considerable amount of time to complete the necessary preparations for the next offensive. This may be one reason. The general Soviet public believes that the reason why the Eastern Front has not started large-scale operations is because the British and Americans have opened a second front. Recently, the battle situation in the Orel and Kupyansk areas has gradually become more active, so considerable attention has been paid to it. The German and Soviet armies both claim that this is only a local battle. Looking at the overall situation on the Eastern Front, the current atmosphere of urgency seems to be reaching its peak. The German and Soviet Union are staring at each other, waiting for the changes in the world situation.

Although most Soviet people do not know which side will take the lead, they believe that large-scale operations on the Eastern Front are about to begin. Since Chairman Stalin issued a proclamation on May 1, Soviet newspapers have issued warnings to the Soviet army and the Soviet people, pointing out that Germany still has the military power to launch a major offensive.

The Focus Is on the Central Line

Looking at all the circumstances, the most likely place for an offensive to be launched this summer is the central region. In this area, the defensive battles of both sides are deep into each other, and their positions threaten each other. This will be the area where the German and Soviet Union are active. Both sides intend to launch their first decisive offensive from this location. From this point of view, the ground forces in this area have been quite active recently. Both the German and Soviet sides are targeting the transportation facilities and troop concentration points in this area for bombing, which is worthy of attention. Many people predict that the southern region of the Eastern Front will be the main battlefield. (Xiang: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun of June 21, Fourth Section)

### The Intensifying Air War on the Western Front: British and American Air Fleets Fiercely Attack German Industrial Centers; 135 Aircraft Lost

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 24th – Air warfare on the Western Front has recently intensified. The Allied Air Forces, mainly using the so-called “Flying Fortress” heavy bombers, launched large-scale air raids on western Germany on the nights of the 21st and 23rd, and the morning of the 22nd, indiscriminately bombing the steel industry centers in the Ruhr region. They also attacked the Marne region of France on the evening of the 23rd. The British Air Ministry announced on the 23rd that 37 aircraft were lost during the bombing of western Germany. Reuters also reported that the air raid was met with unprecedented fierce counterattacks from German fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns, which is evidence of the intensity of the air battle at the time. According to statistics from the German authorities, the Allied Air Forces lost 135 heavy bombers, including 28 "Flying Fortresses," with a loss of 1,700 crew members in the 24 hours from the morning of the 22nd to the morning of the 23rd. At the same time, German Air Force bomber squadrons also carried out large-scale retaliatory bombings of the British mainland, fiercely bombing the heavy industrial areas surrounding London, achieving significant results. According to a Reuters report on the 23rd, the cumulative number of German aircraft that raided the British mainland from January to June 19 this year reached 14,000.

### Jointly Operated Society to Distribute Rice: To Begin Next Month; Rationing Will Still Be Handled by the Original Agencies

Since the transfer of rice distribution work for the Chinese to the Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society by the Central China Rice and Grain Group, the society has been actively preparing everything in recent days. It is now known that the rice distribution work of the society will officially begin on July 1st.

Rice Sources Can Be Divided into Two Types

According to the person in charge of the society yesterday, the source of rice for the Joint Operation Society can be divided into two types: one is foreign rice shipped to Shanghai from abroad, supplied by the Japanese Embassy, accounting for one-third of the total amount; the other is domestic rice, supplied by the Ministry of Food. This domestic rice is uniformly purchased by the Ministry of Food from rice-producing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, accounting for two-thirds of the total amount. For the foreign rice, the embassy is responsible for a continuous supply. For the domestic rice, there is currently a surplus in other ports that can be shipped to Shanghai. Once the new rice harvest arrives in the autumn, the Ministry of Food will naturally purchase a large amount.

Focus of Work is Transportation and Distribution

From July 1st, the society will be responsible for the transportation and distribution of rice. The rice purchased by the Ministry of Food from the producing areas will be allocated to the society on a regular basis, and the society will find ways to transport it to Shanghai. The transportation of rice supplied by the embassy will also be the responsibility of the society. After the rice from both sources is gathered, the society will distribute it to the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Public Works Department, and the Municipal Food Bureau, and the above-mentioned agencies will then redistribute it to the member stores of the Joint Operation Society, which will then ration it to the citizens. Therefore, the Joint Operation Society does not directly undertake the rationing of rice; its main focus is on transportation and distribution. In effect, it can be regarded as an intermediary agency between the Ministry of Food and the agencies that handle the rationing of rice.

### Ting Yun Lou's Charity Exhibition for Education: Successful Outcome; Total Exceeds 300,000 Gold

Shao Daren, the owner of Ting Yun Lou, organized a charity exhibition of fan paintings for education, gathering 2,000 exquisite works by famous calligraphers and painters from all over Shanghai. From the 22nd to yesterday, it was displayed at the Da Xin Gallery for charity sales. For three days, people flocked to visit and order paintings, reaching a temporary peak. The total amount of the charity sale exceeded 300,000 gold, which will be used entirely as educational aid funds for the Shen Bao and Xin Shen Bao newspapers after deducting expenses. Mr. Shao and the calligraphers and painters who participated in the charity exhibition, as well as people from all walks of life who came to bid, all contributed to the good cause with the kind intention of helping poor students, which is truly admirable. Once the settlement is completed, the exact amount will be announced publicly. This note expresses our gratitude.

Aid Received Yesterday: Yesterday, this newspaper received aid for education, totaling: Lu Ruifang 200 yuan, the Girls' Department of Aurora University Affiliated High School 170 yuan and 1 jiao, Shen Tianmin 100 yuan, Dai Cangqi (painting fan assistance) 20 yuan, Mr. Li 10 yuan, totaling 500 yuan and 0.01 jiao in savings certificates, with a balance of 461,786 yuan and 6 jiao and 9 fen.

### Civic Welfare Association Welcomes Ambassadors Ishisha and Senkyo

For the visit of ambassadors Ishisha and Senkyo from friendly nations, the Shanghai Civic Welfare Association will hold a tea party at 5:00 PM this afternoon (the 25th) in the conference hall of the Industry and Commerce Association on the fourth floor of the Xing Ya Building, No. 12 on the Bund, inviting Chinese and Japanese officials and celebrities from all walks of life in the city to participate and socialize. Both individuals are outstanding figures in the Japanese diplomatic circle and have a deep understanding of Chinese issues. Their visit to China will undoubtedly make many contributions to promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation.

Ambassador Ishisha Speaks: Ishisha Idaye, the former Japanese Ambassador to Brazil, has arrived in Shanghai to inspect the situation in China. He met with reporters at the Broadway Mansion yesterday (the 24th) afternoon and discussed the situation in South America, centered on Brazil and Paraguay. He said that Brazil has now severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, but after the severance, the Brazilian Foreign Minister repeatedly explained to him that the rights and interests of Japanese diplomats and Japanese residents would not be hindered in any way. The staff of the Japanese Embassy enjoyed complete freedom of movement. However, from the severance of diplomatic relations in January to around March, they were placed under house arrest, and Brazil began to oppress Japanese residents and issued orders to suppress the Japanese, which angered them. However, Brazil's severance of diplomatic relations with the Axis powers or oppression of the Japanese was all instigated by the United States. Long before the war, there were US officials in the Brazilian intelligence agencies and police headquarters supervising the suppression of the Japanese. Brazil has no grievances against the Japanese, and some even celebrated the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor wholeheartedly, but because it is completely dependent on the United States economically, it had no choice but to be bound and constrained by the United States, hence the severance of diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. In addition, Argentina in South America is known as a naval power, while Brazil can be said to be an army power. In recent years, it has been actively expanding its military. Before the war, most of its armaments were purchased from Germany, but now it has to purchase them from the United States. Although Brazil's national wealth is relatively abundant, its government is extremely poor and has repeatedly borrowed huge sums of money from the United States. The United States skillfully uses a pincer-like restraint. This kind of intention of the United States is not only for Brazil alone, but also for all countries in Central and South America. At present, only Argentina still exists as a neutral country, but Argentina also has many situations and is generally unable to stand on its own. The United States is exerting great pressure on it, even the backstage person of the recent revolution, the price and the US

### The Material Investigation Committee: Investigation Officers' Offices Established; Investigations Conducted Separately by Chinese and Japanese Systems

The Chinese and Japanese sides will each send six investigation officers. The Japanese side will be selected by the embassy and military authorities, while the Chinese side will consist of four members from the municipal government and two members from the Public Works Department. The investigation officers' offices have now been established and will soon begin work. Under the investigation officers of the committee, there will also be investigators. Except for the investigation of the Japanese side, which will be carried out by a system consisting of Japanese committee members, investigation officers, and investigators, the investigation work for the Chinese side will generally be carried out separately in the Public Concession, the French Concession, and other areas under the supervision of the relevant departments in the investigation office. The number of investigators required in each area will be jointly determined by the municipal government, the Public Works Department, the Board of Directors, and the Chamber of Commerce, and then they will be dispatched.

In addition, the Material Control Bureau of the Public Works Department, in order to understand the quantity of materials stored in various warehouses within the concession, has instructed the investigation section to investigate all warehouses within the concession, whether for business or private use, for statistical purposes. This investigation work has already been implemented. It is understood that the investigation of various business warehouses has been completed, and the investigation of private warehouses is now underway.

Li Shiyu, the director of the Fourth Division of the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch, specially issued a statement saying: The Fourth Division of the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch and its affiliated law enforcement team are the law enforcement agencies in the Qingxiang area.

### Gold Prices and Commodity Prices

— Derson

Since 1931, when countries around the world successively abandoned the gold and silver standard and entered the paper currency standard or managed currency standard, gold has no longer been used as a material for a country's monetary system. In theory, the price of gold should have fallen. However, because gold is a rare and valuable item, the price of gold not only did not fall, but actually rose sharply, and gold prices continue to have a significant impact on commodity prices, as they always have.

During wartime, a country seeks military victory abroad and social and economic stability at home. To achieve social stability, the first step is to stabilize commodity prices, because commodity prices are most closely related to people's livelihoods. Looking at all the warring countries, they all strictly control, ration, and supervise commodity prices. Since gold price fluctuations have such a huge impact on commodity prices, the highest authorities of a country invariably control or reclaim gold as national property during wartime, fearing that a sharp rise in gold prices would affect the country's entire financial system.

Looking back at the Shanghai financial market, since the war, gold has never been controlled or reclaimed as national property, allowing it to rise and fall freely. This has had a strong impact on commodity prices and has been very harmful to the general public. Although the rise in general commodity prices is also due to reasons such as scarcity of sources, inconvenience of transportation, increased costs, hoarding, and speculation, speculative merchants always use the sharp rise in gold prices as the biggest reason for raising commodity prices. Therefore, strictly controlling gold prices is a necessary measure for warring countries. Although the authorities have issued policies to change their past free-floating policy on gold prices and imposed price limits, first of 3,000 yuan and then of 5,000 yuan, so that it cannot be used as an excuse for price increases and to stabilize people's livelihoods, in the black market, people are just paying lip service and are acting against the regulations, eventually exceeding the price limits. This has led to a steady rise in commodity prices in recent days, with no end in sight, causing suffering to the people. The authorities will certainly not sit idly by in the face of such insane actions. The author believes that if the authorities can further control gold prices or prohibit its trading, and even promulgate measures for nationalizing gold, the adverse phenomenon of gold prices affecting commodity prices will not recur today.

(2) Each evening, this bank will collect all fund transfer orders received from each bank, compile them separately, calculate the total amount, and send them to each bank the following morning for cancellation and exchange with deposit slips and checks, to be used to pay each bank's "Clearing Account." D. Cash Withdrawal: (1) If a clearing bank needs to withdraw cash due to its own needs or at the request of a depositor, it should still issue a fund transfer order, but must note "Please Pay Cash" on the back and affix an official seal. This fund transfer order must be cancelled separately on the same day. E. Returned Checks: (1) Returned checks after clearing between clearing banks will be sent by each bank to the Bankers' Association for forwarding to the bank that originally issued the check. The Bankers' Association will issue a temporary receipt to the returning bank, which will exchange it for an official receipt from the paying bank. The amount listed on the receipt will be credited to each bank's "Clearing Account." (2) Temporary receipts obtained by clearing banks from the Bankers' Association due to returned checks must be submitted to this bank before 11:00 AM the next morning to be credited to the next day's account, with interest calculated from that day. If the deadline is missed, the returned check amount will be combined with the receipts of the following day and interest will be calculated from the day after that. (3) For the return of the amount of returned checks from other clearing banks, each clearing bank should issue an interbank check payable to this bank and submit it to the Bankers' Association for deposit into the Association's "Clearing Account," while simultaneously paying the accounts of each bank. (4) For the return of the amount of returned checks from entrusted collection, if the collection was entrusted to the Bankers' Association, an interbank check payable to this bank should be issued and submitted to the Bankers' Association. If the collection was entrusted to this bank, an interbank check payable to this bank should be issued and submitted directly to this bank for payment to each bank's "Clearing Account." F. Clearing: (1) Clearing banks should still send checks received from other clearing banks to the clearinghouse for clearing procedures. After the daily clearing is completed, the clearing bank should still issue a "Transfer Application for Clearing Difference" and a corresponding "Transfer Certificate for Clearing Difference," which should be submitted to the Bankers' Association for verification and then sent to this bank for debiting and crediting each bank's "Clearing Account." The transfer application will be retained by this bank as a transfer voucher, and the certificate will be stamped by this bank and returned to each bank the next morning for filing. (2) The advance fund transfer orders issued by clearing banks to this bank's "Clearing Account" and the clearing difference payable shall be based on the daily balance, that is, the deposit balance as of the end of the day. G. Insufficient Funds: (1) If a clearing bank needs to replenish funds due to insufficient deposit balance in its "Clearing Account" to pay the difference payable on that day, it can borrow from this bank or borrow from the Bankers' Association as usual, whichever is convenient for the bank. The borrowing methods of this bank will be stipulated separately. H. Balance Reconciliation: (1) This bank will send a detailed statement of each clearing bank's "Clearing Account" every weekend for each bank to reconcile. I. Bund Clearing: (1) The clearing of Bund banks will be handled by a representative of this bank participating in the clearing between foreign banks and Chinese banks from June 22nd.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks first fell and then rebounded, initially due to news of a sharp drop in gold prices, but later boosted by both new and old investors.  Most stocks rose more than they fell.  Judging from the sentiment of various parties, there was still a bearish trend amidst the confusion.  In the cultural sector, the Business and Commercial Press and the Chinese Pharmaceutical Bookstore reached new highs amidst constant buying pressure, while the World Bookstore remained unchanged.  Among public utilities, the Zhabei Water and Electricity and China General Edison Company stocks continued to rise sharply.  The Great China Match Company reached a new high again, while the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company tended to be stagnant and flat.  Textile stocks showed mixed results, with Wing On Textile and the Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories seeing declines, while Rongfeng, Guoyan, and Tongji mostly progressed upwards.  The Great China Weaving Factory even reached a high of one and a half yuan again.  In the department store sector, Wing On fell by several yuan, while Sincere and China Emporium rose.  Jinglun and Jingfu shirt and sock stocks experienced little supply for considerable demand.  Hongxing Hosiery Factory's low price attracted buying pressure, causing it to rise.  New pharmaceutical stocks rose and then returned to flat as before.  Kang Yuan Canning Company experienced a shortage of supply.  Sin-yi Land was stagnant and flat.  Jiu An Industrial was traded at the border, and the communication easiness trust remained at the previous price.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds:  The unofficial market for unified government bonds rose and then fell back, with no significant gains or losses for bond types A, B, C, D, and E.

Gold and Silver:  Jewelry gold at the Da Hsin and Tong Hsing jewelry stores in this city was sold at the limited price, but the handling fees increased repeatedly with market conditions.  There was no actual market price among traders, and off-market transactions were weak.  Prices rose and then fell, but the final result still exceeded six whole numbers.  The listed price of sycee silver remained unchanged, and the off-market price was the same as before.

### Brief News

Tobacco Bank Granted Exemption from Penalty:  The China Tobacco Bank, due to delays in submitting required reserves for demand deposits, proposed remedial measures and made repeated requests, resulting in a delay.  The assistant director of the inspection bureau telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting a fine of 5,000 yuan.  After receiving the document, the bank truthfully explained the situation to the Ministry of Finance and requested the revocation of the penalty.  It is reported that the bank has now received a reply from the Ministry of Finance granting the exemption.

Honey and Candied Fruit Industry Association Established Yesterday: The Shanghai District Honey and Candied Fruit Industry Association was officially established yesterday. It is reported that Li Jinsheng, Chen Jiaming, and five others were elected as managing directors, and it was publicly decided that Li Jinsheng would serve as chairman of the board and Zhou Zhongliu as managing supervisor. At the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors, many important matters were approved, and active progress was made in all aspects of the association's affairs.

### Provisional Regulations for Provincial and Municipal Banks; National Government Revises Article 6

Nanjing, 24th Central News Agency Telegram: The National Government orders (June 24, Year 32): The amended Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations for Provincial and Municipal Banks is hereby promulgated. This order.

Amended Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations for Provincial and Municipal Banks (Promulgated on June 24, Year 32): Article 6. The capital of a provincial or municipal bank must reach at least six million national currency, which shall be allocated by the provincial government's Department of Finance or the municipal government's Bureau of Finance. It may also draft a share prospectus and, after submitting it for approval, solicit commercial shares. However, the total amount of commercial shares shall not exceed forty-nine percent of the total capital. Shareholders of the aforementioned commercial shares shall be recruited primarily from those who are registered in the province or who have property and residence within the province or municipality. If there is a shortfall, additional shareholders may be recruited outside the business area, and shareholders shall be limited to those with Republic of China nationality. The aforementioned share capital may be paid in two installments. If there is still a need to increase the capital after the full amount has been collected, the local government may submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for approval.

### The General Commercial Control Association and Sino-Japanese Economic Relations (3)

Regarding the economic relationship between China and Japan, there is much talk of cooperation and mutual support, but it is not easy to truly understand the underlying realities of the Chinese economy.  It is necessary to understand that Chinese economy is fundamentally different in its division from the Japanese economy. However, among the diverse and confusing opinions, there are few who can truly understand the core issues and grasp the actual situation of the Chinese economy in their efforts.  This is due to the prejudices and misunderstandings on both sides.  If both sides can face the situation squarely, the question of whether it is appropriate for Japanese personnel not to participate in the central leadership of the General Commercial Control Association can be clarified. At that time, it will be understood that we have no reason to retreat. Consequently, we can clearly identify our goals and move forward bravely.  The Chinese side should also understand the great significance of the phrase "living and dying together" and use the adjustment of interests between the Chinese and Japanese business communities to come to a mutual understanding.  Then, the erroneous consciousness of recovering national rights will be dispelled, and the close cooperation between Chinese and Japanese economic actors can be promoted through the work of the General Commercial Control Association.  We are confident that this will inevitably reveal an unprecedentedly bright future.

Some say that the inevitability of the General Commercial Control Association's birth lies in China's autonomous participation in the war. In fact, this is not necessarily a correct view. I believe that since we already know that China is a country within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, then no matter how much Chiang Kai-shek relies on the United States and Britain to resist Japan, we cannot say that it is not a country within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, whether China likes it or not, it is naturally designated as a country within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, the inevitable existence of countries within the Co-Prosperity Sphere is the inevitable reason for the birth of the General Commercial Control Association. This understanding is correct.

### "New Life" and "Corruption"

— Zhao Xiang

Old age is venerable, while youth is lovely?

The youth period is a period of breaking away from the foolishness, immaturity, and ignorance of childhood, while still maintaining innocence, frankness, and purity. It is neither infected with the sentimentality that some middle-aged people are prone to, nor does it carry the air of decline of general older people. Like a sharp blade freshly sharpened, the ardent emotions contain boiling red blood, and the whole body is full of vitality. The fire of life is burning fiercely like a hurricane, advancing vigorously towards the goal, never thinking of shrinking, fear, or avoiding…

This kind of youthful vitality is truly the loveliness of youth!

The times bestow significant responsibilities on youth, and the country and society place deep expectations on youth.

Ardent pursuit of knowledge, steadfast loyalty to truth; ability to humbly accept teachings, ability to rigorously criticize; cultivation of generous virtues, creation of good habits; respectful manners; strong physique; freedom from the current bad habits; heroic, capable, and motivated - this is truly the loveliness of youth!

Among the gray-haired elders are antiques, which are not worth respecting; but among the fair-skinned and handsome youths, there are also "remnants of the past dynasty." While their age is in the prime of youth, and their demeanor is elegant and refined, their spirits have already been corrupted. Suffering from "premature aging," they are muddled and foolish in their daily lives, their speech is illogical and decadent, their actions are absurd and deviated, and they are unlearned and unskilled, no different from walking corpses. This kind of youth is outside of the category of loveliness!

As there are sterile grains among rice and weeds among crops, not every youth is excellent and lovely. Among pure, striving, and upward-looking youths, one must be careful of weevils and traitors lurking within. However, the formation of sterile grains is related to irrigation and fertilizer; only weeds are inherently inferior. Moreover, humans are not made of wood or stone, and there are no born slaves. The drifting of youth into vulgarity and corruption has various reasons, and it does not happen overnight. Youth should also have this self-awareness and self-admonishment, and should not become those who are abandoned by the times.

### Alas! Worldly Wisdom?

— Yan Weisheng

The proverb says, "Learn a lesson from every loss." There is no such thing as "instant success, instant achievement." The more nails are hit, the more experience one accumulates. Of course, one becomes more "worldly wise" about human relationships and the ways of the world.

Indeed, the more "worldly wise" one becomes, the closer one gets to the realm of success, which is undeniable. But unfortunately, many worldly wise people do not always develop "cleverness and competence" to seek advancement in promising careers. Instead, their worldly wisdom strengthens their ability to plot and flatter. Success gives them a numb feeling towards human relationships and the ability to use unscrupulous means. This is truly a case of "cleverness being ruined by cleverness," becoming a "cunning old fox." They believe that they can always "handle things with ease" and "be all things to all people" to gain some advantages, but they do not realize that their "achievements" have reached their limit. Sooner or later, they will be despised, their reputation will be ruined, and their promising future will be destroyed.

### How Do People in Iron Lungs Procreate?

— Nan Ren

Reports say that a person in an iron lung is going to have a child again. Everyone who reads this news must have doubts. He sleeps in an iron lung all year round, and at most can only leave for a few minutes. How can he get married? How can he procreate? Isn't this a question? Perhaps his marriage is only in terms of formalities, and conception is probably done artificially? This is completely wrong.

Since returning to his country, the person in the iron lung still cannot leave the iron lung. He cannot breathe if he leaves it because his respiratory nerves are damaged. He cannot survive without the iron lung.

His father, Shi Lide, is an American copper and iron magnate, a famous wealthy man with countless millions of assets. He only had this one treasured son. If he is always confined to this iron lung, isn't his father the same as not having a son? Who will he pass on all this wealth to in the future? This psychology is probably the same for all humanity! So his father said: Find the most famous doctors and scientific experts to solve this problem, how to leave the iron lung, and how to get married, etc.

After careful research by many experts, they came up with a solution. It is fundamentally impossible to leave the iron lung, but he can't breathe, and other than that, he is very healthy. You can't limit all his freedoms for one part of his lung is damaged. So, the iron lung, which is like a boiler in the boiler room of a small fire boat, was shrunk down to the size of a copper wire vest worn by policemen.

Since the person in the iron lung wore this breathing vest, it has been much easier. He can sit up, he can walk, and of course, he can get married, so he can procreate. Science is omnipotent, and it is so great for the happiness of mankind! (Donation for Scholarship Fund)

### Li Lihua's Words

— Lao Yu

The summer sun shone on the earth. I rushed from the office to Lane Lian, Avenue Joffre to visit the "Um" girl, Li Lihua.

Fortunately, when I walked into the living room, I saw Li Lihua writing a letter at the table. When she noticed my footsteps, she quickly tore up the letter, crumpled it into a ball, and threw it into the spittoon. She immediately stood up, with the same lively attitude of a sweet girl, smiling, and invited me to sit down. She took out a cigarette, took a few puffs, and I asked her first:

"Miss Li, how busy have you been recently? The stage scenes of 'Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds' are said to be very grand. Can you tell me about it?"

"Busy, of course, goes without saying. I'm filming all day long at the studio. After filming, I have to learn to play the piano, sign autographs for fans, and write letters back to fans. I'm really exhausted. For the past half month, I've been filming 'Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds' every day. The song and dance scenes in that new film are even grander than those in 'Lingbo Fairy' that I filmed before," she replied.

"Then how many kinds of songs and dances will you be performing?"

"I'm sorry, I can't name them. I can only say that there are many varieties."

"Are there any members of my Girl Scout troop participating this time?"

"I remember that the most recent time we filmed a song and dance scene, there were more than thirty people."

"Where were the outdoor scenes for 'Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds' filmed?"

"Just last Monday, from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, we filmed the outdoor scenes at Zhaofeng Park. The scenery was very good, and we shot more than twenty shots."

"I'm filming this one very seriously. When it's released in the future, I hope everyone will give me a lot of pointers." "You're welcome."

"Have you seen any news about me in the newspapers these days?"

"There's a lot of news. We're going to drink your wedding wine."

"The newspapers are always making fun of me. It's really inexplicable!" She pouted her little mouth, looking a little angry.

"Well, there must be some reason. People are saying that you're going to get married. This doesn't seem to be just a rumor." "Oh, I'm still young, how can I talk about such things? Please don't believe these rumors. I can honestly say that marriage is something no one can escape, but I think of marriage as a family prison, which even affects personal freedom. I'm now dedicated to the silver screen. Filming is very tiring, but it's very enjoyable in spirit. Do you agree?" She hugged her knees with both hands, looked at me with squinted eyes, and said a series of serious words playfully.

"Okay, I understand. Let's talk about filming. What is your latest film, Miss Li?"

"I haven't decided yet. I'll probably talk about it after 'Autumn Begonia' is finished."

At this moment, a maid suddenly came in and said, "Miss, the Victory Record Company is calling and urging you to go record a record. They want you to go right away."

"Okay, I know."

"Well, I'll say goodbye then. Goodbye," I stood up and nodded to her.

"I'm really sorry, goodbye, Mr. ××," she also stood up and saw me out the door.

### Textile Industry Comrades Establish Improved Wooden Spinning Machine Training Institute

— Yan Ming

The improved wooden spinning machine has been introduced to Shanghai for quite some time. This spring, only one company is manufacturing and selling them. Currently, there are several other places. From the perspective of sales, it seems that the wooden spinning machine can be promoted. However, after examining the actual situation, there are still many factories. The operation of the improved wooden spinning machine has entered a stage of mechanization, unlike the simplicity of the old style. Therefore, manufacturing spinning machines requires considerable mechanical knowledge and a thorough understanding of the principles of spinning. Only in this way can excellent spinning machines be produced. With excellent spinning machines, good yarn can be spun. "A workman must first sharpen his tools if he wishes to do his work well." This is what it means. The improved wooden spinning is suitable for cotton-producing areas where cotton is cheap and yarn is expensive. Currently, due to transportation difficulties and inconvenience, those engaged in wooden spinning machines often purchase a simplified spinning machine, and then imitate it after reaching their destination. Because the manufacturers lack a deep understanding, they often end up with a poor copy, and the mechanism is not accurate. Although the operation may be smooth, the result is often unsuitable for spinning. Therefore, some mistakenly believe that the mechanism is not working and become discouraged. This situation is actually enough to hinder the promotion of wooden spinning machines. Several textile comrades have established an improved wooden spinning machine training institute, so that those who want to engage in textile machines can have a deep understanding of the manufacture and use of wooden spinning machines in advance, and then operate. In this way, the application of wooden spinning machines can be promoted, and those engaged in spinning can understand the principles of the spinning mechanism, and there is a possibility for research and improvement. The institute is now located at the Shilu East Tiwen Middle School, Lane 363, Ningbo Road. The course is divided into primary and advanced levels. In addition, a special class is set up to teach small iron machine spinning. Registration starts at 1:00 pm every day. Those who are interested in learning from other places can also correspond.

### Disaster Situation in Chao-Shan

— Su Ren

I have a relative who came to Suzhou from Chaoyang, and according to him, the actual situation in Chao-Shan is extremely severe. Since spring to summer this year, the Chaozhou-Shantou area has not had a single drop of rain. The weather is dry and the land is barren for thousands of miles. Prices have risen to hundreds of times. There are no harvests of beans, wheat, or miscellaneous grains. Wild grass and trees are scorched and withered, so that on average, dozens of people die from starvation every day. Some die in ditches, some by hanging, and some by drowning. The situation is unbearable. The price of rice in Chaoyang is more than 900 yuan per dou (unit of dry measure), and in the inland areas such as Pingxia Mountain, the price of rice is more than 600 yuan per dou. Sweet potatoes, which used to be used as pig feed, have risen to 40 or 50 yuan per catty, and sweet potato vines, which are used for fuel, have risen to more than 10 yuan per catty. Other goods are not only extremely expensive, but also impossible to buy.
