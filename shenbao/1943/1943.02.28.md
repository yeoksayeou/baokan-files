### Promoting Wartime Public Education: Hopes for the National Education Conference (4)

Public education, or popular education, is a powerful tool for mobilizing the strength of the people to implement government policy. First and foremost, it is literacy education. We have long advocated for the elimination of illiteracy, and the most effective way to achieve this is through the widespread promotion of literacy education. Because if illiteracy is not eradicated, the people's wisdom will not be opened, the country will have no way to turn from weak to strong, and the nation will have no way to recover. We must, through universal public literacy education, utilize students at all levels of schools and existing intellectuals in society to work together to eliminate illiteracy. For example, stipulating that students at all levels must teach a certain number of people to read as a component of their semester performance evaluation, so that we can eradicate illiteracy throughout the country in a short period.

Secondly, public education should universally develop supplementary education. On the one hand, it provides necessary supplementary knowledge to those who have received national education but feel it is insufficient; on the other hand, it addresses the shortcomings of past school education and provides the knowledge necessary for new-era citizens. This kind of supplementary education, in all subjects, must fully adapt to the international situation, national policies, and social needs. At the same time, it should impart essential wartime knowledge and skills, especially basic political common sense, to enhance the people's organizational strength and give them the ability to self-govern and be self-aware.

The third key point of public education is to pay special attention to the literacy education, supplementary education, and technical education of adult men and women. On the one hand, it enables them to become literate, understand the righteousness of life, and the responsibilities they should bear to the country and society; on the other hand, it enables them to skillfully apply what they have learned to improve their actual lives. Therefore, the content of literacy textbooks should not be the same as that taught in ordinary primary schools, but should be in line with social life and current affairs, so that they can learn to read and write in a short period, and also acquire life skills, so that they can become a part of wartime production or post-war reconstruction.

To meet these requirements, public education must be: (1) Mass-oriented: all out-of-school adult men and women, or those who are undereducated but aspire to further their studies, should be welcomed to enroll without restriction. (2) Socialized: that is, the meaning of "education is life, the universe is the school." On the one hand, cultivate students' group life, so that what they learn is closely related to their life; on the other hand, guide them to unite and help each other, improve their actual lives, and participate in social undertakings and patriotic movements. (3) Popularized: that is, all textbooks and class organizations should be designed to attract out-of-school people to study and obtain practical benefits. What they learn should be understandable, digestible, and applicable; otherwise, even if they know many characters, they will know nothing about the affairs, and the original meaning of public education will be lost. (4) Universalized: that is, it should not only be promoted in cities, but more importantly, it should be developed in rural areas, to eliminate illiteracy and improve the general cultural level. (5) Most importantly, the central goal of all methods should not be simply to consider the completion of a few public schools as the end of the matter. On the one hand, we must use vernacular newspapers, picture newspapers, wall newspapers, simple books and periodicals, improved storytelling, broadcasting, public speeches, street and door-to-door propaganda, etc., to complement public schools and improve the cultural level of the people. On the other hand, we must take reforming bad social customs and promoting production as an important mission.

How to promote the above-mentioned public education? In terms of implementation agencies, the first is naturally to universally improve and add public schools, various tutoring classes, etc. The curriculum can be determined according to the environment, students' level, and actual needs. Teachers can utilize civil servants at all levels, students, and enthusiastic intellectuals in society. The second is to establish public education centers, which can generally be divided into lectures, exhibitions, libraries, and attached public schools, public tea gardens, and public clinics, craft training classes, etc., paying special attention to helping the public solve practical problems. However, in the past, public education centers only worked within the centers. In the future, public education should be deeply rooted in the people, truly living up to its name. Other facilities such as public libraries, public gymnasiums, public reading rooms, public amusement parks, and mobile book and newspaper teams can be determined according to local conditions and actual needs. In addition, we want to especially mention that public education has often been restricted by the political environment in the past. We believe that a wise government should provide a favorable political environment for the development of public education, concentrate people with aspirations from all walks of life, allocate sufficient funding, and promote public education in a planned and organized manner. On the one hand, it should ensure that those who run public education are not affected by political personnel changes; on the other hand, it should also cut off the opportunity for educators to enter politics. In the social sphere, we should help the government with effort and money, and universally develop public education under the guidance of the government. It is obvious that things like libraries, museums, botanical and zoological gardens, public theaters, public sports fields, and various supplementary education, etc., are impossible to rely on the government's strength alone, especially in the current wartime state. The government should quickly formulate measures to encourage people with aspirations from the private sector to contribute efforts and funds to promote public education, so that all parties can work together to eliminate illiteracy throughout the country and improve the cultural level of the people, so as to concentrate public strength during the war and realize "total war participation." We also hope to develop the people's strength after the war and complete the construction of a new China. We hope that this National Education Conference will encourage this.

Regarding increasing education funding, it was resolved that: 1. The central government and all provinces, cities, and counties should increase education funding. 2. The increased amount should be specified as a percentage within the overall budget. 3. The central government should establish a unified plan for the education funding of each province, city, and county to avoid uneven surpluses and deficits. 4. The food for those engaged in education should be distributed at a low price and preferentially if the government adopts a rationing system. All other cases in Group 1 were passed according to the review opinions. The meeting was adjourned at 12:00 noon.

Hubei Front, 27th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army launched an annihilation war against the Yu army under Wang Jinzai in Hubei, they have achieved great success. On the 24th, Wang Jinzai, seeing that the general situation was over, escaped from his base of Baiziqiao under the protection of more than 2,000 of his subordinates. At midnight, he tried to escape alone to Liujiaji from Fengkou. The Japanese army detected this and captured him on the levee near Gongjiawan (2 kilometers northeast of Liujiaji) at 7:30 p.m. on the 25th.

Hubei Front, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Yu army under Wang Jinzai in southern Hubei had built solid positions in the area, boasting that they could be defended for a long time. However, after the Japanese army's fierce attack since the 21st, they had been completely defeated by the 25th. The Japanese army's results as of the 25th are as follows: 3,900 corpses of Yu soldiers were abandoned, 7,500 were captured, and the Japanese army captured a total of 70 light and heavy machine guns, 40 mortars, and a large number of other military supplies.

Hubei Front, 27th (Central News Agency) - A certain unit of the Japanese army has been advancing from east to west on the front line in Hubei for several days. After occupying Nanjiadaqiao at 3:00 a.m. on the 25th, they swept away the defeated Yu army everywhere, and launched a fierce night attack on the Yu army's last major stronghold 15 kilometers southeast of Mianyang, launching a heroic bayonet battle. By about 7:00 a.m., they had completely occupied the area.

Jiangxi Front, 27th (Central News Agency) - On the 23rd, the Japanese army annihilated the 183rd division of the Yu army on the high ground in the direction of Cunqianjie and crushed its tight defensive positions. On the 24th, they turned their attack on the newly formed 12th division of the Yu army. At 10:00 a.m. on the same day, the Japanese army crossed the Jinjiang River near Gaoan and annihilated the Yu army in that area at about 10:00 a.m. on the 26th, and annihilated the 36th regiment of the Yu army that was reinforcing near Maanshan. On the other hand, the Japanese army also launched a fierce attack on Macheng at the same time and completely occupied the area. The strategic gains of this battle are as follows: 360 Yu army corpses were abandoned, 90 were captured, 3 mortars and 320 rifles were captured.

Western Shandong Front, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army in Shandong, with the remnants of the 2nd regiment of the 22nd brigade of the Shandong Security under Liu Huachuan, the head of the regiment and the magistrate of Xiazhen, entrenched in the area between Linqing, Tangyi, Qingping, and Xiazhen on the border of Hebei Province, and plotted to stir up trouble. On the morning of the 22nd, at 7:40 a.m., they launched a surprise attack on Dazhangguanying, 10 kilometers southwest of Qingping County, and launched a fierce attack with a small number of troops on the Yu army.

### Member of the Japanese Information Department Talks About the Su-Huai Battle

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - The battle in the northern Jiangsu plain, which began on the 13th of this month, has fully demonstrated the results of the joint operations of the Chinese and Japanese armies. In a short period of time, the Yu army's strongholds have been successively occupied, and the courageous campaign of suppression is still continuing. Ohno, a member of the information department of the Japanese General Army, served as a campaign instructor in this battle and recently returned to base. According to what he said about the truth of the battle, the general idea is that I have served in the Chinese war zone for three years, but I have never seen such good conditions as in this battle. The connection between the Yu army's 89th army and the New Fourth Army and Chongqing has been completely cut off. The surrounding areas are all peaceful areas, and the people there have also understood the reality of the peaceful areas. Therefore, throughout the battle, they have always cooperated with the Chinese and Japanese armies. This is also enough to prove that the Yu army's 89th army and the New Fourth Army's work among the people has been too harsh, so they have lost the trust of the people. The area near the battlefield is almost all rivers and swamps, which has caused considerable inconvenience to the advance. However, the residents there are happy to serve as guides, and thanks to this, the advance has been smooth, regardless of water or road. Some have bravely captured defeated soldiers. All this makes it easy to imagine the deep suffering that the local people have suffered from the oppression of the Yu communist army in the past. After the battle in that area is over, the residents quickly organize self-government associations and cultural associations to cooperate in promoting post-war reconstruction. It is also worth mentioning that a certain army of the National Government participated in the battle and was exceptionally active. According to reports, this army was established in the 29th year of the Republic of China and has repeatedly fought with the 129th Division of the Yu army in the Hankou area. This army is worthy of praise in terms of both its military appearance and morale. Moreover, all the officers and soldiers of this unit know that they are an army of the people, so they have gained the trust of the people, which is also the biggest reason why they can get the cooperation of the residents.

### Japanese Army in Burma Launches New Military Action to Prevent Chongqing from Moving Yunnan Troops

Rangoon, 27th (Allied News Agency) - A spokesman for the Japanese Expeditionary Force in Burma announced that the Japanese Army in Burma has launched a new military action to prevent the Yu army from moving troops in Yunnan and to disrupt air transport between India and Kunming. The Japanese Air Force has been in the eastern part of India for the latter half of February. The British army hopes to retake Burma and has continued to attack Japanese creeks since December of last year, but each time it has been repelled by the Japanese army and suffered great losses.

Rangoon, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army Air Force continued to attack the Tinsukia Airport in eastern India on the 25th with large formations of fighters and bombers, destroying eight large aircraft parked on the field. Together with the 15 aircraft destroyed on the 23rd, the total is 23 aircraft. Five enemy fighters were shot down in air combat. Since Chongqing lost the Burma Road, the import of supplies has been decreasing, so the United States has changed to transporting supplies with large transport aircraft. The Tinsukia Airport is the main route from Calcutta to Burma, with about 12 or 13 transport aircraft flying between the two places every day. This time, the enemy's transport aircraft were destroyed in a surprise bombing by the Japanese Air Force, most of which were Douglas (DC-3) type sports aircraft. In addition, three Japanese aircraft did not return to their original defense in this battle.

Two Major British Crimes Against India

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Since Britain's rule over India, what is forever resented and hard to forget by Indians are the most brutal Rowlatt Act and the most cruel Amritsar Massacre. The so-called Rowlatt Act was when Britain broke its promise of post-war autonomy for India, which it had allowed during the last World War, and stipulated in the law that British military police and officials could punish Indians without legal proceedings in order to control British resistance. The Indians sacrificed a great deal for the British during the Great War, but the British broke their word and repaid kindness with evil, which caused a nationwide anti-British upsurge. Gandhi stipulated that the first Sunday after the implementation of the Act would be a day of sorrow for the Indians. All Indians would stop all business on this day, fast to express their pain, and hold a general assembly against the Rowlatt Act. On April 12, 1919, when Indians held a meeting against the Rowlatt Act in Jallianwala Bagh Park in Amritsar, the British military commander of the area, Dyer, believed that they were violating his order prohibiting gatherings of more than four people, so he led British troops to surround more than 20,000 Indians participating in the meeting and ordered machine guns to fire indiscriminately for ten minutes until the ammunition ran out. At that time, more than 2,000 Indians were brutally slaughtered, which was extremely cruel. This is the historical fact of the so-called Amritsar Massacre. The British were so brutal that the Indians' resentment towards Britain increased day by day.

Japan Holds Rally to Aid India

Finally, Chairman Mizuno led the entire assembly in shouting "Long live the Emperor," and then Mr. Toyama Mitsuru led the entire assembly in shouting "Long live Indian Independence" three times, and the meeting adjourned amidst enthusiastic emotions.

Okumura Delivers Speech on Saving India

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Information Bureau Vice-Minister Okumura delivered a speech today at the Relief for Indian Nationals Rally. The main points are as follows: Gandhi has started his sorrowful struggle again with his only weapon of fasting to resist Britain, and has attracted the attention of the world. Our Japanese people, while building Greater East Asia, are willing to provide assistance with fiery enthusiasm. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan had also provided assistance to India, but due to the infinite deception and obstruction of the British and Americans, it was unable to help India achieve independence. During the last World War, Britain used the promise of Indian independence as a condition to drag India into the vortex of war, but in return for the great sacrifices of Indian people and materials, it broke its promise and massacred Indian patriots seeking independence, and imposed the Rowlatt Act, which was enacted by British officials to suppress 400 million innocent Indian people. The outbreak of the Manchurian Incident further increased Gandhi's hope for Indian independence, and India was also full of the momentum of the independence movement. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Burma and the Philippines, which had long been dominated and ravaged by the British and Americans, were finally liberated by Japan. Gandhi believed in Prime Minister Tojo's statement and hoped that the British and American troops would withdraw from India. Because he called for independence, he was thrown into prison by the brutal British. The 400 million Indian people, you should fight for the independence of India. Japan will not hesitate to provide you with all assistance.

### Axis Positions in North Africa Consolidated, Greater Freedom of Movement, Allied Generals Hold Meeting, Large Numbers of British Troops Gather in Medenine Area

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - A Swedish newspaper correspondent in London reports that the British are gradually becoming disappointed with the situation in central Tunisia. They believe that General Rommel still holds the initiative and has the advantage, and that the freedom of movement obtained by his troops' suitable advances is greater than that of the Allied forces. Moreover, the so-called Tunisian corridor, with an area roughly equal to Ireland, is conducive to the deployment of troops, so it is very easy for the Axis forces to concentrate, while the British First and Eighth Armies are separated by a distance of 600 kilometers. British military personnel expect the Axis forces to make the most of this advantage to prevent Allied action.

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - According to North African news relayed from London yesterday, General Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in North Africa, has left his headquarters and gone to a certain place behind the front line to hold a meeting. It is said that General Alexander and other Allied generals will participate.

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to a front-line correspondent for the London Times, Vice Commander of the Anti-Axis Forces in North Africa, General Alexander, and the heads of the American forces have agreed to have him take command of the Tunisian front.

Tangier, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - The General Headquarters of the Allied Forces in North Africa announced today that the British Air Force in North Africa will merge with the American Air Force and be called the Northwest African Air Force, commanded by Major General Spaatz, the current Commander of the American Air Force in North Africa. As for the air force in the Mediterranean region, it will be under the command of British Air Marshal Tedder. In addition, the commander of the bomber squadron is American General Doolittle, and the air force ground forces are commanded by General Coningham.

Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - The British Eighth Army is now gathering in Medenine and Kettake, deploying troops in preparation for an offensive. Therefore, there was only reconnaissance activity on the southern part of the Tunisian front yesterday. Artillery fire in the central and northern parts of Tunisia broke the silence of the line from time to time. The Axis forces are carrying out a planned retreat near the Algerian border, and have not been pursued by the British army due to effective rearguard cover.

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Havas News Agency) - Land battles in Tunisia have become quiet today. The Axis forces have broken the main force of the American army in the middle, preventing it from supporting the British Eighth Army in its advance, and have already reached the main point, and are now consolidating their positions. Berlin claims that the heavy losses of American soldiers and equipment have completely thwarted the Allied plan. The American army lost 400 tanks and a large number of vehicles. A war report from the Allied Headquarters in North Africa stated that the Allied forces had retreated some days ago, and then moved towards the Kasserine Pass after attacking the German rearguard. British infantry and American tanks were dispatched together, and occupied the high ground northeast and southwest of the pass, but the German positions were consolidated and covered with landmines. The Allied forces recovered 10 to 15 miles of territory in the Spiba area.

Axis Forces in Tunisia Concentrating Towards Gafsa

However, the Axis forces in central Tunisia are now concentrating from the Gafsa area. The air forces of both sides are becoming more active today. According to Italian war reports, the port of Bona in Algeria was bombed by the Italian air force, and three Allied merchant ships in the port sank. At the same time, German planes also bombed Algiers and Tripoli. American planes bombed various targets in Medenine. The Allied forces claimed to have sent planes to bomb the ports of Sbeitla, Gafsa, and Bizerte.

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German High Command announced the Tunisian war situation on the 26th, stating that the entire Tunisian front was relatively stable on the 25th. After the Axis forces finished their mopping-up operations in the southeast of the front, they were unfolding their operations according to plan.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador Saburo Kurusu made a final effort to negotiate with the United States in November two years ago, and hurriedly flew to Washington to assist Ambassador Nomura. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he returned home on the first Japanese-American exchange ship in August last year. This afternoon at 1:00 p.m., he delivered a speech at a lecture meeting sponsored by the Great Political Association in the Nakanoshima Public Hall in Osaka, entitled "Japanese-American Negotiations and British-American Strategies," frankly pointing out that the British and Americans had used their insincere strategies against Japan's diplomacy to maintain world peace, and especially put forward the following three points: (1) The breakdown of Japanese-American negotiations was a far-reaching strategy of the British and Americans; (2) The American war aim is to dominate the world, and even Britain is in danger of being sacrificed, so there are also opponents of the war in the United States; (3) Japan is now working together to establish world peace, and is exerting all its strength in the Greater East Asia region with tens of thousands of people to jointly complete the war, in order to establish East Asian co-prosperity. In his speech, Ambassador Kurusu first pointed out the reasons for the United States to provoke the war. Secondly, Ambassador Kurusu explained the common strategy of the British and Americans, saying that Churchill sent pro-war elements to oppose former British Prime Minister Chamberlain's European coordination policy, and cooperated with Roosevelt to launch a siege against Germany. Then, he mentioned Roosevelt's determination to participate in the war after the defeat of Dunkirk, and the various processes by which the Churchill faction sacrificed Britain to establish a plan to get the United States to participate in the war. At this point, he pointed out that the United States did not participate in the war solely because of Britain's instigation, but wanted to take the place of Britain in order to secure its leading position in the world. After the United States entered the war, it used economic pressure on Latin American countries to force them to declare war on or sever diplomatic relations with Japan, Germany, and Italy, and ordered the confiscation or freezing of the property of Japanese, German, and Italian people in those countries, and expelled or imprisoned a large number of Axis country expatriates, overturning the rights and interests of Japan, Germany, and Italy in Central and South America. This, together with the expulsion of British capital mentioned above, is a sign that the United States is trying to completely place Central and South America under its control. All these facts are sufficient to prove that the United States' work to dominate the world is progressing steadily. Recently, there have been frequent rumors of fierce infighting between Britain and the United States, centered on the North African issue and the Indian issue. From this, we can clearly understand what the United States has gained and what it intends to do after entering the war. However, although the United States is engaged in war with the aim of dominating the world, it is still wary of criticism from home and abroad, so it has repeatedly denied Anglo-Saxon domination of the world. However, President Roosevelt and other important figures still advocate dismantling the armed forces of Japan, Germany, and Italy and controlling the world by international police, that is, the military force of Britain and the United States, as the goals after the war. The American war aim is to dominate the world, as mentioned above, but the traditional foreign policy of the United States tends to be completely opposite to this. Members of Congress have also repeatedly raised discussions, strongly advocating that the government should make the war aims more obvious, and oppose the President's autocratic power, and demand an investigation into the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act, and fiercely oppose the United States government's policy of dominating the world. At the beginning of this year, the British believed that this situation in the United States was enough to promote the rise of isolationists, and expressed great concern. Recently, the United States published a white paper, and Roosevelt also repeatedly boasted in his address to Congress on January 7 that the war situation had improved and that the expansion of production capacity had been effective. As for the conference recently held by Roosevelt and Churchill in Canada, its intention was also to deal with the situation in the United States. Looking back on when we were restricted by the United States, some people in the United States advocated racial equality with the aim of comforting the Indian independence movement and manipulating the Chongqing government, but we have never heard that the United States has deleted a single line from the immigration law. Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for the brilliant results achieved in all aspects, and express my admiration for the hard work and struggles of the soldiers on the front line. Our friendly country, China, also resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9, in order to strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation. Moreover, Burma and the Philippines, because of Prime Minister Tojo's speech in the Diet on January 28, have obtained a promise of independence. All of this is a glorious construction of Asia, and we should congratulate you together. In the future, externally, we should consolidate our alliance with allied countries, and internally, we should be of one mind under the majesty of the Emperor, and vow to fight to the end to win the final victory.

### Aoki Points Out That Shanghai Should Be the Center of Economic Cooperation

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, in response to a question raised by Congressman Kimura Takeo at the House of Representatives' North China Development Corporation Bill Committee this afternoon, said that the focus of China's construction is to increase production, and Shanghai should be made the center of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. The general idea is that it is urgent for China's construction to focus on increasing production. In fact, many people who are suitable for this kind of construction now live in Shanghai. In the past, there were not a few who adopted a wait-and-see attitude, but in view of the development of the war situation and Japan's definite policy, their trend is also becoming more and more obvious. As for Shanghai, now that the concession has been returned to the national government, Shanghai should be made a major economic city in China and start a new development. However, the specific matters are in the hands of the National Government. In my opinion, Shanghai should be the center of Chinese industry and commerce, and should be made a place for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation to promote its development.

### Roosevelt Confined for Rest, Will Broadcast if Health Permits

Lisbon, 27th (Allied News Agency) - According to a report from Washington, President Roosevelt is still not fully recovered from a slight intestinal ailment. Yesterday's press conference was cancelled. The president will take a few days of rest and is currently living quietly in his private residence and will not meet any guests until he has recovered his health.

Lisbon, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - Washington telegram, President Roosevelt, if his health improves satisfactorily, will broadcast a speech at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow. General Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in North Africa, and Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, will follow Roosevelt and broadcast speeches.

### Australian Foreign Minister to Visit the United States

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - Washington telegram, American officials are very interested in Australian Foreign Minister Evatt's upcoming visit to the United States. Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that important issues related to the two countries will be discussed at that time.

### Spellman's Mission to Italy

Vatican City, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - Well-informed sources at the Vatican said that Archbishop Spellman of New York's visit here will not produce any surprising results. President Roosevelt merely wants to use this to show the 30 million Catholics in the country the close relationship between the United States and the Vatican. It is very likely that the talk that Washington will sign a religious agreement with the Vatican will become a reality. If the Pope elects new members of the Holy College in the future, Spellman will undoubtedly be the first to be elected. Also, President Roosevelt deeply hopes that the Pope will be able to independently take care of the living conditions of prisoners in Soviet territory, and is expected to put pressure on the Soviet government to force it to recognize the Vatican as the only intermediary for exchanging prisoner information and accept this plan. It is not yet known whether the Vatican intends to accept Roosevelt's suggestions.

### Italy's Total War Posture

Due to the importance of the Soviet front, the increasingly urgent situation in the Mediterranean has caused Fascist Italy to enter a complete total war posture. Especially in the political, military, and diplomatic aspects, it is necessary to implement a strong wartime policy. What is Italy's future direction? What preparations are being made? These are gradually becoming apparent in recent developments.

After the major cabinet reshuffle in Italy, the new situation in wartime policies can be roughly summarized as follows:

First, in the political aspect, from the first announcement of the change of major cabinet members on February 5 to today, a total of ten new ministers, eleven vice-ministers, thirty-four senators, ten Fascist councilors, and twenty-one local governors have been appointed, which is the largest adjustment since the Fascist Party came to power. Prime Minister Mussolini had this intention at the beginning of Italy's participation in the war, and it was finally implemented due to the sharp turn of the situation. In essence, it can be said to be a national general mobilization cabinet with no talent left unused. Mussolini also serves as the Minister of Interior, Foreign Affairs, Army, Navy, and Air Force. This move gives us the impression that it is based on an independent and autonomous policy to complete the victory.

Mussolini's return as Foreign Minister is the biggest event in the diplomatic aspect. Referring to the importance of Italy's international position at present, we can speculate that Italy's new diplomatic policies will have great developments in the future. The appointment of Count Anno as the ambassador to the Holy See is even more noteworthy. This is the first voice of Mussolini's diplomacy, and from this, it can be inferred that the situation will gradually become more active due to the cooperation with the Vatican's diplomacy.

Second, the appointment of Francesco Gondar, a powerful figure in the Fascist Party, as Governor of Dalmatia can be seen as a manifestation of Italy's strengthening of its Balkan policy. Agusto Rosso, a talented Italian diplomat and former ambassador to the Soviet Union, has been appointed as ambassador to Turkey, which also shows that Turkey, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Balkans are the most important areas in Italy's new diplomacy. The ambassador to Germany will also be changed. The voice of Raifeal, Galigeli, the former ambassador to the Holy See, to succeed is very high. After the outbreak of this war, until it participated in the war in 1940, … [unclear text] mainly diplomacy, and therefore developed into a German-Italian integrated Axis diplomacy due to the opportunity, strengthening cooperation with the Axis group, and promoting an active and autonomous diplomatic policy in the Holy See and the Mediterranean.

In the military aspect, General Amprochio, who has a well-deserved reputation, has been appointed as the Chief of General Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. He is the builder of Italy's mechanized corps and has made great achievements in the Balkan War. During the war against Abyssinia, he served as the commander of the Palermo Army, and used his troops like a god in the Mediterranean, making him the only suitable person to break the current difficult situation in Italy. He is trusted by the Italian people as a cadre in the Italian army, but he is apolitical and a purely simple soldier.

Under Minister of the Army Mussolini, the next officer … [unclear text] … typical military man. This time, the military's adjustment allows the commander and military affairs to be separated from political strategy and dedicated to war.

In the economic and social sectors, not to mention the strengthening of wartime life, but the realization of this total war posture, such as the original Military Supplies Production Supervision Bureau, has been upgraded to the Ministry of Military Supplies. Regarding production and allocation, even those belonging to the Army, Navy, and Air Force are all controlled by the Minister of Military Supplies. All of Italy's production is now separated from civilian relations and mobilized for military purposes. Under the newly formed ministers, all of the dynamic measures have been adopted to subject the economic life to military training in the future, and the current labor force of 2.5 million in Italy will be rapidly strengthened again.

### Current State of Food Rationing in the Soviet Union

(Special Dispatch from Kuibyshev by Watanabe, 20th) The war has caused the Soviet people to make many significant sacrifices, among which the food problem is the most prominent. In reality, since the beginning of the war, the Soviet people have been subject to extreme restrictions on food under a strict coupon system. Regarding the food problem, the Soviet Union had bitter experiences in the past. From the First World War to the revolution, it fell into a state of near starvation. According to records from that time, residents of Moscow, Leningrad, and other major cities could only obtain less than 50 grams of bread per day – a thin slice to satisfy the hunger of the entire day. Leningrad, in particular, was the most distressed among the major cities.

The lack of food would inevitably lead to anti-government sentiment. The Soviet authorities have not forgotten this bitter experience, so they always pay the utmost attention to the food problem. Preparations were made long before the start of the German-Soviet war and implemented immediately after the war began. The first of these was the current coupon system. The Soviet coupon system has the following three distinctive features:

First, restriction or standardization of food product types. Currently, the types of food products are restricted to the following five:

(A) Bread, (B) Fats – butter? lard, cheese, vegetable oil, (C) Meat (including fish), (D) Sugar, (E) Wheat flour.

Second, focusing all efforts on increasing production, transportation, and supply of the above food products.

Third, the organized implementation of this coupon system.

The Soviet Union is now concentrating all its strength on the war against Germany. Their slogan is: "Everything for the front, everything for victory." Food is naturally sent to the front lines first. The war inevitably causes a decline in food production. To remedy this, the Soviet government has adopted the following five measures:

First, a complete ban on the export of food products;

Second, suppressing food consumption;

Third, increasing grain purchases from collective farms;

Fourth, expanding farmland in the eastern and Siberian regions;

Fifth, importing some food products.

In addition to the coupon system, there are special measures for food supply. Since last spring, organizations similar to cooperatives have been established in major factories. These organizations provide a certain amount of food to each factory, or they can eat in the canteens operated by these organizations. The quantity of food supplied by the coupon system is as follows:

(1) Daily bread ration – 800 grams for laborers, 600 grams for general employees, 400 grams for unemployed women and children.

(2) Monthly fat ration – 400 grams for laborers, 300 grams for general people, 200 grams for women and children.

(3) Monthly meat ration – 1,800 grams for laborers, 1,200 grams for general people, 500 grams for women and children.

(4) Sugar ration is unknown.

(5) Monthly wheat flour ration – 1,200 grams for laborers, 800 grams for general people, ration for women and children is unknown.

As mentioned above, it is clear that the food situation in the Soviet Union is not sufficient, only enough to ensure the minimum necessary for life. When I visited Moscow last November, a citizen who had experienced the difficulties of the revolutionary era told the reporter:

"The current food situation is much better than normal. At least we don't have to starve now. Of course, we can't eat our fill now, but for the sake of the war, we must endure this difficult situation. We can endure it now."

### A Glimpse into Wartime Life in Germany

(Special Dispatch from Berlin by Oshima, 20th) Following the general mobilization of labor, the order restricting non-essential wartime shops, and the ban on handicrafts, Finance Minister Funk also explained the tax increase proposal at a meeting of the Reichsbank. The Second World War, after three and a half years of fighting, has hit the bottom of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. The deepening of total war is gradually emerging on the streets of Berlin. The first labor application, which ended on the 15th of last month, can be regarded as the mobilization order for women. From businesswomen and female students to barmaids and maids, women of all classes have come to register in various locations in the city.

Shops have posted notices announcing temporary closures, to reopen after the war. On the bustling main streets, shops have pulled down their iron gates. Among them, car showrooms, high-end pottery shops, antique shops, stationery stores, and candy stores have all been closed. Flower shops have turned into vegetable stores, candy stores have become food stores, and bars have become restaurants.

In the publishing industry, there were originally 2,500 types of magazines. Now, all magazines, weekly publications, and film magazines that are not necessary for the war have been discontinued. From this week onwards, there will only be one major news reporting agency, and only 250 magazines on politics, economics, and health.

The sports world has also been affected. Professional sports such as boxing, tennis, golf, skiing, skating, and cycling will all be banned in the future. The first to respond to the new situation was the Berlin City Subway Corporation, which sent forty to fifty female transport workers to the front lines after completing special education.

Since the beginning of the war, in the replacement of male and female jobs, most women have occupied men's positions, creating an all-female situation. Factories are also taking this opportunity to use women and foreign workers to replace operations, except for the minimum amount of expertise.

Universities have a temporary one-week holiday. The graduation exams for the semester begin all at once from this week. As a result, students have stopped their studies and are going out on the streets. The people all maintain their belief in victory. The retreat from Stalingrad and Rostov makes everyone understand how to live in the future, in order to overcome the difficulties and achieve victory. This new revolution is led by Propaganda Minister Goebbels, a right-wing member of the party. He first consulted with President Hitler and discussed it with the three services, Minister of Munitions Speer, Director-General of Conscription Wuerz, and Chairman of the Labor Conscription Committee Sauckel. After detailed planning, it will be implemented vigorously. (Source: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, February 22)

### Germany Holds Munitions Production Conference - Goebbels Publishes Essay - Denounces Jewish Calamity in Europe

Berlin, February 27 (Havas) The conference recently held in Plassenburg Castle in Franconia, Germany, discussed Germany's munitions production plan. It was chaired by Munitions Minister Speer, and a total of 140 munitions experts from various European countries attended. The meetings were held daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., with only a slight break for meals. Speer did not deliver a formal opening speech at the opening, but only asked the experts to express their opinions frankly and provide practical opinions on the munitions production issue. According to Speer, the reports received from all parties have shown that Germany's munitions production work is progressing smoothly, production is increasing, and efforts are being made to save raw materials. This has now achieved remarkable results. Improving production methods and reducing costs have also saved the country millions of marks.

Berlin, February 27 (Havas) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the latest issue of "German Magazine" stating that the present is the most difficult time in Western Europe. Our struggle is related to life and death, not only to protect the lives of the German people, but also to safeguard the future of Europe. German soldiers are fighting on the Eastern Front, vowing to prevent the spread of the Red Peril. The material and spiritual aspects of Europe are now facing an unprecedented crisis. Therefore, Germany has made total preparations. All of this is caused by the disruptive behavior of international Jewry, who spare no effort to seize and monopolize world power by various despicable means, but ultimately failed. The Bolsheviks also want to destroy Western civilization, and Britain and the United States are helping them to do evil, resulting in today's world conflagration. If Europe does not try to reinvigorate itself under such circumstances, the disaster will be immense. However, Europe has clearly recognized this crisis and there has been a significant expression of the interconnectedness of Europe, so it must be able to protect Europe from the Jewish catastrophe.

Berlin, February 27 (Havas) German Deputy Director of Information Sundermann recently published an article in the "People's Observer" entitled "The War is not on the Warta River in Germany, but on the Mius River," reviewing the current military and political situation, stating briefly that the war is still ongoing on the Eastern Front and has not shifted to Central Europe. The strategy adopted by the German High Command has prevented Soviet troops from infiltrating Europe. The losses suffered in this winter war have been extremely significant, but the cleanliness of Europe has been preserved by the German army, and there is nothing to worry about in the future.

### President Hacha Issues Proclamation to the Czech People Urging Efforts in Munitions Production and Support for German War Effort

Prague, February 27 (Havas) A mass meeting was held here yesterday, at which a proclamation jointly issued by President Hacha and the occupying authorities was read to the Czech people. The content stated briefly that at this time of war against the Bolsheviks, Germany is the only protector of the Czech future. Britain is helping the Soviet Union to do evil, resulting in today's catastrophe in Europe. It is hoped that the Czech people will recognize the reality, fully support Germany's war effort to the end, and work hard in munitions production.

Prague, February 27 (Havas) The government of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia announced a general mobilization of Czech labor at a mass meeting last night. President Hacha and government officials participated. Propaganda Minister Moravec mentioned that fierce battles are taking place on the Eastern Front. The Czech people should do their utmost to assist Germany in the war against the Soviet Union. Czech citizens are exempt from military service and should mobilize all labor. The German army on the Eastern Front is fighting not only for Germany but also for the whole of Europe. The fate of the Czech Republic is linked to Germany.

### Many German Newspapers and Magazines Suspended Publication

Berlin, February 27 (Havas) Many German newspapers and periodicals have been suspended from publication in order to increase manpower for the German army and military industry. The number of periodicals suspended is greater than the number of daily newspapers suspended. The number of periodicals remaining in Germany this spring is likely to be less than one-third of the total. Among the daily newspapers published in Berlin, only the "Berlin Evening News" and the "Berlin General Report" have been suspended. "Monday Report" and "Monday Post" will also be temporarily suspended. All politically prominent newspapers in Germany may continue to be published, except for the "Stuttgart News Daily". Provincial newspapers that have been suspended include the "Hanover Guide," "Liegnitz Daily," and "Munich News," among others.

### Finnish Prime Minister's Choice to Be Determined Soon

Stockholm, Sweden, February 27 (Havas) A correspondent for the Stockholm Dagens Nyheter in Helsinki reports that the most promising successor to the Finnish Prime Minister is Kivilamki, the country's ambassador to Germany. The Social Democratic Party is strongly opposed to appointing a member of the Agrarian Party or a right-wing figure as Prime Minister and advocates for the re-election of the current Prime Minister Rangel, but this proposal is strongly opposed by the Agrarian Party. Kivilamki has now returned to Helsinki today. It will soon be announced who will hold the position of Prime Minister.

### Stalin Receives Polish Ambassador

Istanbul, February 27 (Havas) Stalin met with Rommer, the ambassador of the Polish government-in-exile in London, yesterday. Foreign People's Commissar Molotov also participated in the talks.

Stockholm, Sweden, February 27 (Havas) Since the Moscow "Pravda" published an article on the Polish issue, Polish people in exile in London have become uneasy. Now, the British "New Statesman and Nation" has published a detailed Moscow dispatch, implying that the British government has no intention of protecting Poland's eastern border and that the Soviet sphere of influence will extend to Eastern Europe, which has made the Polish people even more apprehensive.

### Ciano Meets the Pope to Present Credentials

Vatican City, February 27 (Havas) Italian Ambassador to the Holy See Ciano (former Foreign Minister) is scheduled to meet the Pope the day after tomorrow to present his credentials.

### Disputes Over British Security Plan Continue

Bern, Switzerland, February 26 (Havas) According to messages received here, disputes over the "Beveridge Social Security Plan" continue within the British government. After Labor Minister Bevin virtually broke with the Labor Party Executive Committee a few days ago, the Labor Party has not yet found a solution to the various difficulties that have arisen. Moreover, political observers point out that the positions taken by the Labor Party members in the government differ greatly from the various decisions made by the Labor Party itself. At the same time, it is also heard that the Labor Party is now requesting the immediate commencement of research on the establishment of a Department of Social Welfare, so that the department can be formally established as soon as the war ends.

### Donets West German Forces Carry Out Counteroffensive Successfully - Soviet Encirclement Net Has Been Breached - German Reinforcements Ensure Spring Offensive Base

Berlin, February 27 (Havas) The weather in the central section of the Eastern Front is still extremely cold, which is probably the only reason for the activity of the Soviet troops in the area. According to recent news here, although the Soviet troops launched a major offensive south of Lake Ilmen, they achieved nothing. The Soviet troops also have a tendency to attack southwest of Kaluga. The point where the enemy troops broke through the German defense line in the Sukhinichi area not only cannot expand their battle results, but has also been encircled by the German army. The Soviet attack north of Sukhinichi is as fierce as the battle south of Oryol in order to achieve victory, but things are far from their wishes, and victory is still far away. The Soviet advance towards Konotop has not stopped, but its momentum is no longer as rapid as before. The German counteroffensive in the western Donets is proceeding smoothly. The second important railway junction southwest of Izyum, which was occupied by the Soviet army a few weeks ago, has been recaptured by the German army, and a part of the Soviet army has been surrounded. The Soviet attack in the Mozhaisk area has failed, and there are only local battles there now.

Stockholm, Sweden, February 27 (Central News Agency) The battle on the southern front of the Eastern Front has been stalemated due to the German forces' preparation for an attack and the obstruction of "General Mud." Especially in the northwest of Rostov, the Soviet offensive seems to have been completely thwarted due to the fierce German counteroffensive. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow on the 26th, it was also reported that the Soviet army in that area was facing a crisis, implying that the southern front was gradually slowing down due to the early arrival of this year's spring weather, and the German army had gradually gained an advantage in several areas. The Soviet army's organ newspaper Red Star also strongly urged that the speed and scale of the current winter counteroffensive must be increased as soon as possible. In order to ensure the base for the spring offensive, the German army is sending reinforcements to the front line, so the German counteroffensive in various places has become more intense.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, February 27 (Havas) Judging from recent news from Berlin, the German army is still conducting encirclement battles between the Donets River and the Dnieper River. Moscow also admits that the battle in the Donets River basin is benefiting the German army, and said that the German army has launched a major counteroffensive towards Kramatorsk and Krasnoarmeysk, but the cities are still being held by the Red Army. In other areas, the Soviet army is still adopting an offensive posture. In view of the fact that the Red Army's offensive has greatly eased, the comments published in Soviet newspapers are also very cautious. The Red Army's organ newspaper "Red Star" stated that the German army is launching a fierce counteroffensive in the Donets River basin, especially in the Kramatorsk area, and we should be especially vigilant.

Heavy Losses for Soviet Tank Units - Germans Repel Soviet Troops Attacking Across Ice

Berlin, February 27 (Havas) Havas learned last night from well-informed sources here that the Soviet tank units that were defeated by the German army between the Donets River and the Dnieper River in the past few weeks suffered heavy losses. The army lost a total of 479 tanks, 97 cannons, 188 anti-tank guns, 18 anti-aircraft guns, 54 howitzers, 143 armored vehicle transporters, 300 trucks, and a large number of other war materials. The number of dead and wounded in the army was also very tragic. Three German teams participating in the battle killed 12,000 enemy soldiers.

Berlin, February 27 (Havas) Those responsible recently stated that the elite Soviet troops attacked across the ice on Lake Ilmen and failed. After the Soviet troops reached the lake, Peter was violently sealed, and the few soldiers who were able to reach the shore were still repelled by the German army on the shore. In this battle, more than 2,000 corpses were left by the Soviet side. Among the spoils of war obtained by the German side were 1,500 pieces of ice.

### Citywide Implementation of Sugar Rationing by Headcount - To Begin on March 11 - Eight Ounces Per Person Per Month in Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai - Type A Retail Sugar Businesses Have Been Reregistered and Merged

After the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office's headcount-based sugar allocation was approved by the military allocation authorities, preparations have been completed. From March 11, the Shanghai Municipal Council (including Hongkou), the French Concession, West Shanghai, Zhabei, and Nanshi will implement the allocation simultaneously. Regarding sugar prices, purchases will be made according to the newly set prices. The amount of sugar allocated will be eight ounces per person per month (using the "Tianping" scale) in Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession are still awaiting announcements from the authorities. The city has been divided into seven districts, and Type A retail merchants have been designated to sell sugar. Reregistration and merger are being rushed. The names and registration numbers and addresses will be announced tomorrow.

Deadline for Supplementing Sugar Ration Payments

The Cooperative Business Office issued a notice yesterday stating that in regard to the February sugar ration, a previous notice stated that payments would be made on a preliminary basis, pending the Office's determination of the price for final settlement. Now that the newly set prices have been approved by the authorities and announced, all Type A retail merchants who have made preliminary payments for the February sugar ration must supplement the shortfall by March 1, in accordance with the newly set prices, and settle the account with the original allocated sugar merchant. Payments made by the sugar merchants to this Office must also be settled according to the new prices by March 2. This notice is hereby issued, along with the attached list of newly set prices. It is hoped that all sugar merchants and Type A retail merchants will be informed accordingly.

### Japanese Embassy Office Discusses Ideological Integration

The Japanese "Continental News" reports that the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office held a regular cadre meeting on the 25th. Minister Tajiri and all section chiefs attended to discuss policies adapting to the changing administrative period. One point, promoting the integration of Chinese and Japanese ideologies, is most noteworthy. It states that it is difficult to achieve the purpose of increasing production, construction, and economy without integrating the thinking of the peoples of China and Japan. At present, the Cultural Department of the Embassy Office is trying to integrate Chinese and Japanese ideologies. Existing ideological and cultural organizations include the Central China Religious Unity League, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, and social service groups. However, these are guided in activity by responsible officials, which makes it impossible to freely develop and difficult to obtain results. Leaders cannot advance appropriate policies because of their official positions. To remove this obstacle, all parties hope that the current leaders will resign from their official positions and participate in various groups as leaders. Otherwise, it is impossible to establish a Sino-Japanese cultural and ideological integration adapted to the changing administrative period.

Annual tickets can be purchased from the Revenue and Tax Department of the Bureau, or the Revenue and Tax Department branch office at 130 Haining Road, or the park. After the park is opened, the rules stipulate that soft and hard tennis, lawn bowling, and football can be played, and golf can be played in the park's grounds after approval and with restrictions in the early morning. Fishing games can also be held after application. To protect the grounds, various sports may be prohibited for a period of time after rain. During the year, the Public Works Department will continue to carry out repair work on the park and add equipment to improve it. A committee has now been established by the Bureau to supervise the operation and management of the park. It is hoped that the citizens who visit the park will abide by the park rules and maintain the park's beauty.

### To Prevent Rice Ticket Fraud, West Shanghai Checks Household Registration

### Three Years After Li Yinhen's Murder, the Murderer is Sentenced to Death

Li Yinhen, from Liaoning, was engaged in trading, traveling between Shanghai and Kunming, carrying a large sum of money with him. On October 24th, 1940, Li arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou and stayed in room 305 of the Continental Apartment in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, his evil friend Wang Chengnai (i.e., Zhang Bingsheng) found out about it and had the idea of ​​killing him for money. He colluded with Wang Fusheng (i.e., Crooked Head), Shi Jinquan, Hua Xiaodi, etc., to design to lure Li to room 401 of the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road, strangled him with a rope, and seized a passbook. After inspection, there was only more than 1,000 yuan in savings, which was divided and used. Three years later, Hua Deputy Detective Chen Jinsheng, Detective Zhang Faxiang, and Detective Ju Xingmei of the New Gate Police Station successively arrested the above four criminals and sent them to the First Special Court. After clear interrogation, Judge Zhu Chuzhe ascended the seat and announced the verdict yesterday morning.

### "Good Officials" and "Good Institutions" are the Necessary Preparations for Recovering Concessions and Extraterritoriality

Whether the Chinese people understand Japan's righteous and Mahayana spirit is a question for the future for the time being. I think the focus of the problem is how the National Government will prepare to accept Japan's current return of concessions and abolition of extraterritorial rights, which is a realistic move in history. -

Mr. Takada of Murakami Law Office, in a calm but passionate tone, narrated the above paragraph from the conclusion. He also said: "The institution that acts as a good official" is a prerequisite, but as the saying goes, "It is easy to know, but difficult to do." Preparing to solve difficult problems cannot be successful overnight.

According to my observation, among the many people in Shanghai, except for the youth, few express concern and sympathy for the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. The concessions are their place to relax, and this habit is deeply imprinted in their minds, so people who are immersed in this atmosphere have worn away all their ambitious aspirations. However, this can also be said to be generated in the psychology of only taking care of personal interests and distrusting the guiding and supervising institutions. In other words, it is the people's passive resistance to the previous government's distrust. This affection is also evident in the judiciary, as I can see personally. The people are very indifferent to the special zone court, and almost all litigation cases are resolved by lawyers in mediation. Then, even if the Chinese side recovers judicial power, police power, etc., it will probably only increase the difficulties for the National Government itself. These words may be too much, but I sincerely hope that after the return, there must be people and institutions with sufficient ability and exceeding the current situation.

Mr. Takada has lived in China for thirteen years and has traveled extensively to Chongqing and other places. He also narrated a historical story from the past, containing a very profound meaning in this interesting recollection. he said.

Shipwreck tragedies often occur in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. When the Nisshin Shipping Company opened the route to Chongqing, the company's ships traveled at full speed, impacting the waves, causing many civilian ships to sink. Although this incident was not enough to constitute anti-Japanese material for the Chinese side, the Nisshin Shipping Company itself considered what methods to use to remedy or compensate. At that time, because it was not easy to decide, I was entrusted to study the aftermath of this matter, so I went to Chongqing to investigate locally, but there was no way to solve it legally. Later, I discovered that the only way to deal with these shipwreck incidents was for the boatmen to insure themselves. They knew the company's sincerity and took the initiative to find ways to avoid shipwreck tragedies, which later reduced many shipwreck incidents. Therefore, my conclusion about the shipwreck incident is that the sinking of the ship was caused by one's own carelessness.

The above words show a character of the Chinese people. It can be seen that as long as you reason with reality, the people will inevitably be sincerely convinced. Therefore, you must have firm sincerity and great efforts to prepare for this work.

I hope the National Government will do its best to prepare to meet the times. (Qiqing: Translated from the Mainland News on February 27)

### A Large Amount of Bean Flour Will Be Refined to Provide Household Miscellaneous Grains; The Quality and Taste are No Different from Soybean Flour and Wheat Flour; Noodle Product Merchants Requesting Flour Allocation is Under Discussion

Recently, the Concession authorities are about to issue miscellaneous grain purchase certificates. However, the scope of miscellaneous grains is very broad, and what type of distribution will be given is of great concern to all parties. According to reports from Datong News Agency reporters, the beans used by oil mills in this city are of very good quality. After refining and making them into powder, their quality and taste are the same as soybean flour and are no different from wheat flour. A large amount has recently been produced, and it will soon be distributed by the authorities. Therefore, the miscellaneous grains distributed by the Concession authorities are probably of this type.

Flat-Price Soybean Sales Insufficient to Meet Demand

In addition, the miscellaneous grains provided by the Grain Maintenance Group Liaison Office are all supplied to retail stores, and most retail stores do not sell them at the prescribed prices, so citizens rarely benefit. As for the long-rumored 6,000 bags of flat-price soybeans, each tofu shop in this city is assigned to sell seven bags, and fried goods shops, etc., are assigned five bags each. Datong News Agency reporters specially visited the persons in charge of the tofu and fried goods industries yesterday. According to them, the amount distributed by the Miscellaneous Grain Group is far from the actual need, and the difference is huge. It is hoped that the authorities can increase the distribution quantity, so that retail prices can also be suppressed.

Noodle Stalls Hope to Resume Flour Allocation

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Association Section and the Materials Control Department have been conducting thorough discussions on the request of noodle product stores and stalls to resume flour allocation. Because there are many workers engaged in this industry, it is intended to resume allocation and production in the short term to show consideration and relief. However, each noodle product trade association must guarantee that the allocated flour will not be sold on the black market and provide a written guarantee of severe punishment for violations, in order to show caution. It is also understood that the Cake and Steamed Bun Trade Association is sending personnel to conduct detailed investigations in order to understand whether the members have used the flour in stock, whether there has been black market trading, and whether the location of the store has changed, in order to report to the authorities and request changes to the methods and provide allocations as soon as possible, in order to maintain the livelihood of colleagues.

### Huai'an Association Donations in the Money Industry Will Increase Across the Board Starting Tomorrow

The Shanghai Northern Shanghai Money Industry Huai'an Association, which is run by the Shanghai Money Industry Association, has a history of several decades. It provides relief funds to unemployed and destitute people in the industry, as well as to their orphans and impoverished families, to help them make a living. In the past, the Huai'an Association expenses were paid by each business in installments on a regular basis. From last year to this spring, each business paid 20 yuan per month. However, the Executive Committee of the Money Industry Association has repeatedly received proposals from members to increase the amount given to relief households, as the prices of everything are now high and life is difficult. The original amount of relief funds given should be increased, and the source of the relief funds should be started by each business increasing the monthly donation to the Huai'an Association first. This matter was formally passed by this year's annual meeting of managers of each business submitted by the association, and it was immediately decided that starting from March 1st, the monthly donation of each business should be increased to 40 yuan per month. Special donations are not subject to this rule. The increase in donations has been notified to all member businesses by the association for compliance. As for the increase in the amount of relief funds for relief households, it will be implemented as soon as the meeting passes.

It is understood that the thirty-second evacuation of coffins and the fifteenth batch of poor coffins, as well as the coffins of the Siming Guild Hall without family members, totaling 200 coffins, will be transported to Yongbo by the Xinning Shao wheel on March 2. It is reported that the Coffin Transportation Department will meet the urgent needs of the coffin owners in this city and plans to load a large number of coffins left in Shanghai before the Qingming Festival. It is also reported that the next evacuation date has been set for March 6th. Therefore, all coffin owners in this city can go to No. 2, Lane 96, Jing'an Temple Road to apply for registration in order to be transported to their homeland before the Qingming Festival.

### Random Notes on Malaya (5)

— Voters

(8) New Posture of Malaya

Since the Japanese army occupied the Malay Peninsula of Singapore, it has gradually established a new public order.

The Japanese army divided the former British Malaya and the former Dutch Sumatra into the same military and political jurisdiction, under the jurisdiction of the supreme commander of Malaya, and the Malay military and political supervision department as the executive agency. The characteristics of the Japanese military administration are to integrate Malaya and Sumatra, and within the Malay Peninsula, the Straits Colonies of the directly governed territory and the Federal States and the non-Federal States are uniformly under the control of the military and political organs, without any distinction in the implementation of military and political affairs. The military and political supervisory department is located in Zhaonan Island (renamed Singapore), and under the military and political supervisory department are various departments, and under each department are various sections, which are responsible for the business under their jurisdiction. The branch organizations are located in the original states, namely (A) On the Malaya side, Zhaonan Special City (Zhaonan), (the place where the government is located is in parentheses below, the same below,) Johor (Johor), Malacca (Malacca), Negeri Sembilan (Negeri Sembilan), Selangor (Kuala Lumpur), Perak (Ipoh), Kedah (Alor Setar), Kelantan (Kota Bharu), Terengganu (Terengganu), Pahang (Lipis). B) Sumatra side: Aceh (Kota Raja), East Coast (Medan), Tapanuli (Sibolga), West Coast (Padang), Riau (Pekanbaru), Palembang (Palembang-Parempen,, Jambi (Jambi), Bangka Belitung (Pangkalpinang), Lampung (Telukbetung), Bangka Belitung (Pangkal Pinang). In Zhaonan Special City, under the mayor, there are five departments: General Affairs, People's Livelihood, Business, Economy, and Police. Under the state officials, departments and sections are set up as necessary.

One of the biggest tasks of the current Malayan military administration is to strengthen local administration. The number of Japanese officials has now reached one hundred and ten to thirty. The lower-level organization of local administration is the village, and its organization and functions will not be greatly changed. In order to strengthen guidance, the military and political supervision department has specially established the "East Asia Training Institute" in Zhaonan as a training center for local officials, selecting young people from various states, providing short-term training, and making them members of the local administrative committee.

The judicial institutions have also been allowed to be restored later. The trial court implements a two-instance system of the High Court and the District Court except for religious trials. Under the guidance of the military and political supervision department, some local judges are appointed, and the law also follows the previous principles. In addition, there is a military law conference that conducts special trials on those who endanger the safety of books and the Japanese army.

In terms of finance, the budget headquarters for the fiscal year 1942 was more than 60 million yuan, the accounting of each branch in Malaya was hundreds of millions of yuan (Lek currency), and the accounting of each branch in Sumatra was about 40 million shields a year, totaling 220 million yuan (shields), which is about 70% of the pre-war budget. Among the revenues and expenditures, the revenues are mainly based on taxes, licenses, opium revenue, and regulations, and the expenditures are mainly used for the expenses of revitalizing industries, restoring civil engineering, building wooden ships, health care, and communication undertakings. In terms of revenue, tax system reforms are implemented in accordance with the requirements of the military administration and the concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The fundamental policy implemented in finance is to adhere to the principle of "local collection and supply."

In terms of industry, the basic policy of economic construction is, first, to develop and obtain important national defense resources, and second, to seek self-sufficiency for local necessities as much as possible. Most of the industrial facilities have been thoroughly destroyed by the British and Dutch armies before the Japanese army occupied them, but after the day and night efforts of the Japanese army, the production institutions that had been stopped have been successively restored, and the mobilization plan for materials and the ensuring of the necessary production volume have also begun to be realized. The resource developers and transaction managers have also gradually arrived under the guidance of the Japanese army, and factories, mines, and farms are operated by the Japanese army under the entrustment of "military management". Special attention is paid to the acquisition and restoration of production of tin and bauxite in Malaya and petroleum in Sumatra.

Regarding rubber, the Japanese army established a rubber supervision committee when it occupied it to investigate the current situation of rubber tree gardens, collect all stocks, and appoint farm managers to each farm to supervise and manage the original facilities, and the collected stocks were transported back to Japan as quickly as possible. Secondly, it guides Japanese rubber operators to establish the "Zhaonan Rubber Union" to control the production, transportation, purchase and export of all rubber plantations in Malaya and Sumatra.

In addition to rubber, agricultural resources are coconuts, quinine, and bark acid, which are unique products of the tropics, and efforts are also being made to restore their production. In addition, cotton in southern Sumatra and flax in northern Sumatra are also rapidly increasing their production. Under the slogan of "revitalizing Malaya and building Sumatra," the Japanese military administration is working hard to develop the resources of these two major southern treasures.

Malaya is a typical colony under the colonial policy of European and American imperialism. It only pays attention to the development of raw material selling sources such as rubber and tin that are needed by imperialism itself, but the colony has no self-sufficiency in food necessary for the life of the colony, the industry is not developed, and there is no basis for a self-reliance system. Therefore, the main food and all clothing and groceries have to rely on other countries, and there is naturally unspeakable pain in wartime when material exchange is extremely difficult. For this reason, the Japanese army is working hard to establish a local self-sufficiency system as the basis for its current economic policy. The first is food. In Sumatra, the Dutch Indian government had promoted it before the war, and after the Japanese army occupied it, it has reached self-sufficiency. Is it only about 100,000 tons? Need to be imported from Java. The self-sufficiency rate of food in Malaya is only 40%, and the remaining 60% depends on the import of Thai rice and Burmese rice. In view of this, the Malayan military and political supervision department has vigorously launched a food production increase campaign in its jurisdiction since last summer, such as reclaiming wasteland, rectifying irrigation facilities, and distributing high-quality seeds, in order to improve quality, increase the production of corn, sugarcane, miscellaneous grains and other subsidiary foods, and strive to make agricultural finance smoother, encourage excellent farmers, and establish agricultural research institutions, etc., in order to ensure food self-sufficiency.

Almost all salt and sugar depend on imports from other places. Salt is imported from Thailand, and sugar is supplied by Java. On the side of strengthening external industries, Japanese experts are also working hard to promote it in order to increase aquatic food products. In northern Sumatra, efforts are being made to promote animal husbandry in order to alleviate the food problem.

Most of the clothes and other daily necessities depend on external imports, and they are naturally even more insufficient, and rising prices are an inevitable phenomenon. In addition to expanding local enterprises to strengthen production, the Japanese occupying authorities are also working hard to make the exchange of materials between the Japanese mainland and the Southern Circle smoother, in order to ensure the supply of daily necessities. At the same time, in order to cope with the reduction of materials, while strictly stipulating that the prices of food and daily necessities are at the pre-war level, and suppressing prices, a ticket rationing system is adopted in order to save money.

The restoration of the industrial sector has also gradually become active with the arrival of Japanese mainland operators. Factories such as rubber, iron plate, lumber, beer, glass, bricks and tiles, and shipbuilding (wooden ships) have been successively started, but they are all small-scale restoration of the original industries, and all the materials needed locally still have to rely on imports from outside. The development of formal local industries still has to wait for the future.

In terms of trade, the first is the transportation of materials from the occupied areas such as petroleum, rubber, bauxite, manganese, iron, tin, leather, bark acid, and coconut back to the country. Secondly, in order to investigate the minimum necessary amount of civilian materials, they are then imported from the mainland, Manchuria and China to realize the economic connection of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Third, for the exchange of materials between the Southern Circle, rice, sugar, salt, poultry, pigs, and miscellaneous grains are supplied by Myanmar, Java, Thailand, etc., and coal and cement are supplied by Sumatra, etc., and they are transported by civilian ships. Zhaonan Island is the center to restore transportation agencies and port facilities, promote the smooth development of local transportation, and adjust the supply relationship of materials.

In terms of finance, the currencies of Malaya and Sumatra are the Lek Yuan military ticket, the shield military ticket and the local currencies, namely the Lek currency and the Java Bank banknote (Malaya uses the Lek currency, and Sumatra uses the shield ticket). It is made to use the military ticket and the local currency at par value, and there is no special uneasy phenomenon in terms of military ticket credit and currency circulation. However, Malaya is the area where the old British currency is used, and Sumatra is the area where the old Dutch currency is used. There is some dual phenomenon in the currency within the current Japanese single military and political area, and the inconvenience of this can be imagined. Therefore, the military and political supervision department has recently implemented a currency exchange system between Malaya and Sumatra, and is working hard to adjust the currency between the two. In terms of financial institutions, in addition to the Yokohama Specie Bank, Taiwan Bank, and South China Bank, which are the three Japanese banks in Singapore before the war, opening "branch offices" of the Yokohama Specie Bank in each state under its jurisdiction, and for the Chinese and Indian banks, some of them are recognized by the Japanese authorities as non-antagonistic, and are also allowed to resume operations, and the "civilian financial institutions" such as pawnshops have also been restored, and "common people's vaults" have also been opened.

In terms of hygiene, Malaya and Sumatra are both on the equator, and the temperature is lower than imagined. There is no particularly unbearable heat throughout the year. After the Japanese army ended the war, they immediately worked hard to implement sanitary measures, cleaned and sorted out rivers and ditches, and implemented universal vaccination and preventive injections for residents, so the sanitary work after the war may be better than before the war.

In terms of education, it was very underdeveloped in the past due to the ignorance policy implemented by the British rulers. More than half of the residents have not received elementary education, and there are very few people who have received secondary or higher education. Except for the private schools set up by wealthy overseas Chinese, all educational and cultural institutions are monopolized by the British, with the first priority being to train slaves. The Japanese occupiers attached importance to the education of local children in accordance with the concept of the "Co-Prosperity Sphere," and paid special attention to the popularization of elementary education, especially Japanese education, which has achieved amazing results.

Local religions include Islam, Buddhism, and Christianity. The Japanese occupying authorities adhered to the policy of non-interference in local religions and respected freedom of religion, which is of course one of the main policies for winning people's hearts.

The new posture of Malaya and the newly incorporated Malay area is roughly as follows. However, the bright future still depends on the continued struggle of the local residents, especially the overseas Chinese compatriots who account for the majority! (End)

In the second round of the Western League Group A football, Tung Wah and Portuguese Merchants will meet again in Jiaozhou Park at 3:45 this afternoon. In the first round, the two teams drew 1-1. This time they meet again, and the Portuguese Merchants may inevitably surrender. The strength of the Portuguese team this season is mediocre. Oliveira, Gaines, V. Suruo and others are not as fierce as before. Although the veteran Victor has made a comeback, the lineup is still not strong. Tung Wah showed their skills in the recent battle against the Italian Navy, and each performance was excellent. In particular, Han Longhai was a general and minister, and had the spirit of one man being in charge and ten thousand men being invincible. For the rest, Mai Youliang's right wing, the technique of passing the ball has reached perfection, and no one else in Shanghai can think of it. Aquie has also recovered his former glory, and Ah Dai, Youren, and Li Ning are all above the standard. Therefore, Tung Wah is confident of victory.

### Joint Business Office of Chinese Paper Mills Officially Established on Schedule

In order to suppress the black market for newsprint and comprehensively adjust paper prices, the paper mills in this city are following the instructions of the authorities to organize a trade association in order to investigate the cost statistics of various newspapers and submit them to the authorities for review so that they can legally limit prices, and to organize a joint business office of Chinese paper mills to sell the newspapers produced by various factories under the control of the office, so that hoarding will be impossible to monopolize, and the black market can be suppressed. It is reported that the joint business office has been prepared by the organizers of the association and will be officially established and start business on March 1. However, it will still maintain close contact with Japanese paper mills.

Cigarette Rationing Implemented: Hoarded Goods Released, Black Market Prices Plummeted

Since the Chinese New Year, the price of cigarettes in this city has risen step by step, and the black market price has reached its peak. In order to facilitate the transportation and sales of cigarettes and suppress market prices, the Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association decided to implement a unified cigarette rationing method and put it into practice. It actively registered cigarette wholesalers and retailers throughout the city. After the association's review, more than 90 wholesalers and more than 5,500 retailers were qualified. It was decided to start implementing the rationing from the 10th of next month. After the implementation of the rationing, various hoarded goods were released one after another, and the black market on the market plummeted for days. It is predicted that after the implementation of the rationing, the black market can be suppressed.

Economic Commentary

### The Central Reserve Notes in the Future

Since the major changes in Shanghai's currency last June, the Central Reserve Notes have become a very unique legal tender. All public and private transactions must be paid in Central Reserve Notes. Months have passed. From the New Year to the early spring, the prices of goods, gold prices, stocks and public debt suddenly showed a galloping labor. Is this a shake in the credit of the Central Reserve Notes? Or is it the mediocrity of the capitalists? The reasons for this will not be discussed for the time being. However, since the Central Reserve Notes are the legal currency of Shanghai, and are complicated for the people's livelihood, we should have a correct understanding of them. In the near future, according to the reporter's observation, there will be three possible developments: First, although the Central Reserve Notes are commonly used in Shanghai, they have not been fully promoted in remote areas. In the future, the government will do its best to promote the Central Reserve Notes through laws or other coercive forces. Since the Central Reserve Notes can be sold and paid in the inland, the Central Reserve Notes in Shanghai can be reduced. Second, the industrial products that Shanghai can continue to produce and the agricultural products that the inland can produce will inevitably be leveled out in price due to the corresponding supply and demand after comprehensive planning and adjustment. Third, military tickets must be gradually recovered with Central Reserve Notes, and Japanese military tickets will not be seen on the market. All items and payments that can be purchased or paid with military tickets must be replaced with Central Reserve Notes, and in the future, only Central Reserve Notes will be able to settle Japanese remittances. If the Japanese exchange rate is increasingly extended, and 100 yuan can be exchanged for 100 yuan, then the economic level of China and Japan can be averaged, and the people's livelihood can also be the same. However, in this time of rapid world war, all estimates cannot be too high. There may be some distance from the above in fact, so we cannot keep excessive hope. In short, in the wartime economy, there is no other way for the people but to endure the pain.

### Chinese Stock Market: Resumption Expected Next Week

The Chinese stock market has been suspended for nearly ten days since the Shanghai Municipal Council inspected the Yongchang and two Chinese stock companies last Thursday, affecting the entire market. It is now learned that the authorities originally had no intention of interfering with the legal trading of Chinese stocks. This incident was only due to concerns that the recent surge in stock prices seemed to involve speculation. The authorities have now completed their inspection, and a satisfactory resolution is expected within the next week. At that time, the Chinese stock market will resume normal trading.

### Ministry of Construction of the National Government Establishes Office in Shanghai

For the convenience of communication, the Ministry of Construction of the National Government has established an office in Shanghai, and appointed Mr. Lao Yinyu as its director. Mr. Lao has already taken office and assumed his duties, and has taken over the former office of the Ministry of Transportation in Shanghai, starting to adjust the organization and personnel of that office. Furthermore, for the convenience of business negotiations, the office has moved to Room 227, 2nd Floor, Xingya Building on the Bund, inside the Shanghai office of the National Economic Council.

### Leather Shoe Raw Materials Sufficient for Six Months

The current stock of leather in the Shanghai market is estimated by the leather shoe industry to be sufficient for six months. The current monthly consumption is 9,000 feet of grain leather and 6,000 pounds of sole leather. However, since rubber materials have been adopted for shoe soles, the use of sole leather will be greatly reduced, and it is said that the cost of shoe production can also be reduced by ten percent.

### "Guben" Soap Costs Ten Yuan Per Bar

Among daily necessities, the price of soap has been rising aggressively since the Lunar New Year. This is because general speculation is rampant, and those holding goods are firmly holding on, not giving up slightly, leading to an increasingly severe trend. For example, "Guben" soap has risen to 1,180 yuan per box, and the price per bar has been sold for ten yuan on the market. "Baixiangmao" costs 1,100 yuan, "Huangxiangmao" 1,000 yuan, "Scissors" soap 1,150 yuan, "Phoenix Brand" matches 6,200 yuan, "Beauty Brand" 6,200 yuan, "Golden Tripod Brand" 4,400 yuan, miscellaneous brands 3,000 yuan, "Price's Patent Candles" 800 yuan, "Monk's Cap Brand" 680 yuan, miscellaneous brands 540 yuan. The selling price of all goods has risen sharply.

### Allied Currency Falls Slightly

Yesterday morning, the interbank loan interest rate announced by the Bankers' Association was 18%, unchanged.

The Japanese military scrip continued to weaken. The inter-dealer price was 5.5524 yuan, and the buying and selling prices of small money shops and bank counters were also low, at 5.545 and 5.55 yuan. The decline in Allied banknotes was slight. Dealers sold at 3.40 yuan and bought at 3.35 yuan, a slight decrease of 3 cents compared to the previous day. The market trend remains sluggish.

### Government "Bing" Bonds Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the government bond market initially showed no signs of recovery, and prices remained sluggish. Later, due to multiple price increases, it rose sharply. "Bing" bonds rose linearly from 1.30 yuan to over 6 yuan. Most of the buyers were old "longs" adding to their positions to push up prices, or a way to find an exit. Other bonds also rose accordingly, but not as strongly as "Bing" bonds.

### Low-Price Matches Allocated Yesterday

In view of the continuous rise in match prices, the local match allocation association allocated a batch of low-price matches to large and small cigarette stores in the two concessions yesterday in order to curb the rising trend. The allocation was as follows: Grade A cigarette stores, six "tings" (i.e., one case); Grade B cigarette stores, three "tings" (i.e., half a case). The price was still 340 yuan in military scrip, so the retail price per small box at each cigarette store was still 30 cents in Central Reserve Currency, with a limit of ten boxes per person.

### Soybean Cake Market Stable

Yesterday, the miscellaneous grains market initially rose and then fell, with the market generally stabilizing. The details are as follows: "Chang Ji" cake, 10,000 pieces for March delivery, priced at 130 yuan. Also, two trucks of spot goods, priced at 129 yuan. "Fei Zi" cake, 5,000 pieces, priced at 130 yuan. Also, three trucks of "Yuan Long Si Pai" cake, spot goods, priced at 128 yuan. Also, "Li Zi" cake, 10,000 pieces, priced at 130 yuan. Also, two trucks of "Shanghai Ben Chang" cake, priced at 129 yuan, 128.5 yuan, and 128 yuan. Also, two trucks of "Hui Zi" cake, spot goods, priced at 128 yuan.

### White Lead Wire Strengthens

Although the trading of thick and thin white lead wire is not very active, the market is quite strong due to the shortage of goods. For example, "Tong Hua" grade is quoted at 26,000 yuan per ton, and "Shu Hua" grade requires a slight premium. Spot goods of new lead wire are even scarcer, with an appearance of having a market but no goods. Numbers 8 to 15 are priced at 35,000 yuan, and fine goods at 50,000 yuan.

### Bread Ration Reduced for British Prisoners

Reuters Stockholm, 27th - London Dispatch: The daily bread ration for prisoners in British prisons will be further reduced by two ounces, and four ounces of potatoes will be issued as a supplement.

### Sugar Merchants' Cooperative: Allocation of Fair-Priced Sugar

— Zhu Guilin

Organization and Management

Previously, in order to protect the sugar stocks of various members of the Shanghai Sugar Trade Association, the Material Allocation Combination for the Exchange of Chinese Central Bank Notes obtained permission to first register and centrally sell all the white sugar owned by Chinese people and jointly form a Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office to handle it. It was stipulated that any Chinese person, whether a firm or an individual, holding white sugar could participate in the public sale. The registered sugar was divided into six groups: (1) Granulated sugar, (2) Refined white sugar, (3) Brown sugar, (4) Raw sugar, (5) Dark brown sugar, (6) Rock sugar. The Cooperative Office would issue equity certificates to each participant, making them shareholders of the Cooperative. As for sugar that did not participate in the public sale, the military allocation authorities would be notified to purchase it at a fair price. The quota enjoyed by each sugar firm for implementing the allocation was determined separately based on their seniority and business volume at the time of participation. In order to smoothly allocate sugar, district management was implemented, merging the original sugar firms into 58 firms, and the allocation was implemented from February of last year.

Now, in order to manage the allocation more closely and meet the needs, the city's retail locations are divided into seven districts, with designated sugar firms responsible for the allocation and management of all matters. The sugar firms in charge of each district are responsible for supervising and managing the business of the Grade A and Grade B retailers under their jurisdiction in accordance with the following items, and may review their accounts and conduct investigations and records at any time. (Grade A) Retailers' compliance items: (1) Retail sales should be marked with a county price list in accordance with the official price; (2) Weighing should be based on balance scales; (3) Sugar products should not be adulterated; (4) Allocated sugar is only allowed for retail sales; (5) The daily inventory and sales volume should be reported truthfully. (Grade B) Retailers' compliance items: (1) Allocated sugar is only allowed to be used for processing food and is not allowed to be resold in its original form; (2) The daily inventory and sales volume should be reported truthfully. Violations of the above items will be subject to the following penalties: (1) Suspension of allocation for one month or more; (2) Requesting the police authorities to ban them in accordance with the law; (3) Cancellation of registration. As for the seven districts of retailers, the first district has 82 Grade A stores and 56 Grade B stores; the second district has 110 Grade A stores and 70 Grade B stores; the third district has 44 Grade A stores and 39 Grade B stores; the fourth district has 193 Grade A stores and 113 Grade B stores; the fifth district has 125 Grade A stores and 55 Grade B stores; the sixth district has 61 Grade A stores and 44 Grade B stores; the seventh district has 58 Grade A stores and 59 Grade B stores, totaling 1,109 Grade A and Grade B stores.

At that time, the amount of sugar participating in the public sale totaled 497,546 pieces, including 337,044 pieces of granulated sugar, 43,518 pieces of refined white sugar, 83,948 pieces of brown sugar, 9,900 pieces of raw sugar, 19,133 pieces of dark brown sugar, and 4,000 pieces of rock sugar. The sugar purchased by the Cooperative Office totaled 23,762 pieces and was allocated monthly to Grade A and Grade B retailers according to market needs. By the end of July of last year, the Cooperative Office had 269,345 pieces of sugar in stock. Subsequently, the military allocation authorities ordered a large amount of sugar, shipped from Taiwan in batches to Shanghai, and purchased sugar from the Philippines and acquired sugar stocks in Hong Kong, so the total amount of sugar in stock in Shanghai should be above 300,000 pieces. At the same time, considering that refined white sugar, rock sugar, and dark brown sugar are essential sugar products for Chinese people, which were originally shipped to Shanghai from Java, Hong Kong, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places, but are now in short supply and have no source, in order to regulate the people's food, various raw sugar materials such as granulated sugar, raw sugar, "Dong Wu" dark brown sugar, and "Qing Wan" dark brown sugar are issued to Zhen Ji, Jian Hua, Da Cheng, Da Hua, Yi He, Xin Hua, He Ji, Jin Xin, and other factories according to their needs for processing, so as to be allocated to the Grade A retailers for sale in accordance with the regulations.

Regarding the implementation of the allocation of sugar to Grade A and Grade B retailers, it is stipulated that retailers should accurately budget their monthly needs for various types of sugar and submit an application to the Cooperative Office each month. After review and approval, a purchase certificate will be issued before they can purchase from the sugar firms. The period for retailers to apply is from the 23rd to the 25th of each month, and the delivery date for sugar firms to sell sugar to retailers is from the 5th to the 20th of each month. Retailers should pay a cash deposit. As for the retail sales method for Grade A retailers, initially consumers were free to purchase, with a limit on the amount that could be purchased per person each time. Later, due to the illegal activities of those who resold for profit and the "sugar squeezing" gangs, it was difficult to maintain order. Therefore, the Cooperative Office tried to improve the system repeatedly, and finally decided to sell based on housing tickets. Although the situation of queuing and "sugar squeezing" has been eliminated, the disputes over sugar distribution among general sub-tenants and landlords are unavoidable. Therefore, with the approval of the military allocation authorities, a new system of sugar allocation based on population was implemented. It was decided that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council would be entrusted to issue sugar purchase certificates in the International Settlement (including Hongkou) and the French Concession, while the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative would be responsible for setting the selling price of allocated sugar and other matters. As for the allocation of sugar based on population in Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai, the Cooperative Office would handle it independently. Grade A retailers throughout the city are being re-registered and merged in order to centralize sugar sales.

The three most important issues of the implementation date, quantity, and price of sugar allocation based on population were discussed by the Sugar Trade Cooperative, the military allocation authorities, the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and other relevant parties. (1) The implementation date is approved to start in March, with the first sugar purchase date being March 11; (2) The quantity of sugar allocated based on population will depend on the total amount and needs approved monthly by the military allocation authorities. It is heard that the quantity for Chinese people in March is 8 ounces; (3) The price of sugar has been approved and will be re-determined and announced by the Sugar Trade Cooperative. It is heard that after the implementation of sugar allocation based on population, the black market for sugar will inevitably disappear, which is truly a blessing for the citizens.

### Concentrating Finances to Revive the Rural Economy - Wah Hsing Commercial Bank

The Wah Hsing Commercial Savings Bank held its fourth shareholders' general meeting the day before yesterday (the 26th). Attendees included all shareholders, Chairman Liang Hongzhi, Vice Chairman Washio, and members of the board of directors and supervisors. All proposals were approved as originally presented after deliberation. The bank was founded on May 1, 1939, with a capital of 50 million yuan. Since its establishment, its business has been exceptionally prosperous. Its daily operations focus on regulating finance and developing industries. After the old currency was banned from circulation last June, the bank cooperated in expanding the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes. It maintained the value of Central Reserve Bank notes, worked hard to purchase materials, and provided loans to revive the rural economy, achieving remarkable results. Even in terms of deposits and loans alone, there has been considerable progress. The main content of this year's duties focuses on expanding the circulation of finance and Central Reserve Bank notes within the group. Its branches and offices currently number eleven. It also plans to add branches and offices in Hankou, Jiujiang, Anqing, Changshu, Changzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and other places, and plans to lend 5 million yuan to cooperatives in various places at extremely low interest rates, in line with the bank's aim of reviving the rural economy. The full text of the business report submitted by Chairman Liang Hongzhi to the shareholders' meeting is recorded below for the reference of China's economic circles.

Dear shareholders, at this fourth annual general meeting, I am very pleased to report on the past year's efforts in economic construction in Central China, as well as the general situation of the bank's business in the past year.

The economic situation in Central China in 1942 can be summed up in one sentence: eventful and difficult. During the extraordinary circumstances of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, various policies implemented under the close liaison of the Chinese and Japanese authorities were sufficient to express the character of the first year of the Greater East Asia War, and its impression was also the most profound. Namely, the handling of British and American assets in China, the use of reserve notes as the basis of currency, the implementation of price controls, and the adjustment of distribution mechanisms were all epoch-making tasks. As time passed, they gradually changed from emergency measures to permanent implementation. At the outbreak of the war, the Japanese military authorities implemented enemy property management and material handling, and the general situation must have been well known, so there is no need to repeat it. From the perspective of construction, reviewing the changes in currency, finance, and prices over the past year, I will briefly state as follows:

First, in terms of currency unification, the withdrawal of the old legal currency and the promotion of reserve notes as the unified currency is a major event that should be recorded in the history of China's currency system. The details will be described later. Please first briefly explain the process of the sharp decline of the old legal currency before and after the currency unification period. On February 15th last year, the occupation of Singapore gave all parties a great shock. When the Japanese army entered Burma, the so-called Burma Road for aiding Chiang was completely cut off. As a result, the instability of the old legal currency, which was a major factor in weakening the Chongqing side, became more and more profound. For a time, people were agitated, and they exchanged goods in groups. The financial market showed a semi-panic state, and general prices also tended to rise. The National Government, in view of the sharp decline of the old legal currency, tried to reduce the damage suffered by the people within the possible range. Therefore, on March 31st, the anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, it declared that the new and old legal currencies were separated from the relationship of equal value. This measure had been studied earlier, but it had to be delayed because it was not fully prepared. When the prelude to the Greater East Asia War began, especially after the Burma Road was cut off, the future of the old legal currency was unimaginable. Therefore, before the separation of the new and old legal currencies, on March 9th, the official military ticket exchange rate against reserve notes was announced to stabilize the value of reserve notes. At the end of the month, it was officially declared to be separated from the equal value. At that time, the initial exchange rate between the new and old legal currencies was set at 100 yuan of the old legal currency for 77 yuan of the reserve notes, but the trend of instability of the old legal currency was still endless despite the regulations. In May, it became apparent. From the 19th of the month, it fell more sharply. The Central Reserve Bank started to revise the exchange rate from 74 yuan on the 20th, followed by 71 yuan on the 21st, 66 yuan on the 22nd, 60 yuan on the 23rd, and 53 yuan on the 25th, gradually lowering it to adapt to the actual situation of the market. On the 26th, it fell to 50 yuan, and there was even a risk of further decline. Unexpectedly, the exchange rate of two yuan of the old legal currency to one yuan of the new legal currency was produced.

At that time, in order to stabilize the livelihood of the people in Central China, the Chinese and Japanese authorities decisively implemented a comprehensive exchange on the premise of prohibiting the circulation of the old legal currency. On May 27th, the Ministry of Finance declared that a comprehensive exchange would be implemented in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, at the ratio of two yuan of the old legal currency to one yuan of the reserve notes, and clearly indicated the policy that once the recovery was completed, the legal currency nature of the old legal currency would be deprived, and it would not be allowed to circulate formally. As for the specific measures, on June 1st, four decrees were promulgated: "Regulations on Reorganizing the Old Legal Currency," "Measures for the Application of the Provisional Measures for Reorganizing Currency," "Regulations on the 1942 Financial Stability Public Bonds," and "Special Accounting Measures for the 1942 Financial Stability Public Bonds." It was planned to start recovering the old legal currency within two weeks from June 8th. However, after referring to the situation in various places, the eleven cities including Nanjing and Shanghai were extended for three days, and some cities in other cleansing areas continued to exchange until the end of the month, resulting in unexpected results and completing the comprehensive exchange.

After July, the recovery area was expanded from Central China to South China. On July 10th, the same measures were taken in Guangdong and Xiamen, and on August 10th in the Wuhan area. On the one hand, the National Government's currency unification was progressing steadily, and the currency war with Chongqing was further developed. The expansion of the circulation range of reserve notes and the increase in the amount of issuance became more and more significant. In order to enrich the issuance reserve, with the assistance of the Japanese government, the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan signed a 100 million yuan loan agreement on July 28th, making the Central Reserve Bank more solid and developed.

More than half a year has passed since the old legal currency began to be recovered. During this period, the circulation area of reserve notes has been expanded to the above-mentioned extensive areas. At the same time, from June 25th, the use of old legal currency was prohibited in Nanjing and Shanghai. The Jiangsu Province Qingxiang area, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Zhenjiang, and the first Qingxiang area in southeastern Taihu Lake were also decisively prohibited from using and carrying it in turn. The same measures were also taken in Xiamen City and Wuhan area of Guangdong Province. However, due to special circumstances in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, comprehensive prohibition of circulation could not be achieved. Therefore, from December 1st, the three provinces and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai not only absolutely prohibited the use and carrying of old legal currency, but also prohibited its preservation and possession. Therefore, from November 1st to 30th, strict exchange was carried out in the area again. At this point, the currency unification in Central China can be said to have reached the final stage. The old legal currency has lost its so-called currency function, and the unification of reserve notes has been realized.

Complementary to the efforts of currency unification is the financial control of the National Government, which has made extraordinary progress in the past year. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, British and American banking groups, including HSBC, absolutely dominated the local financial community. At the same time, the Chongqing government banking system under their protection also possessed considerable power. Therefore, the Central Reserve Bank's control over the financial community could not be immediately strengthened. However, with the outbreak of this war, the British, American, and Chongqing banking systems were confiscated by the Japanese military authorities. Therefore, the Central Reserve Bank became the only issuing bank in Central China, and its control over the financial community also progressed rapidly. On August 21st, the National Government promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions," and on September 18th, it promulgated the detailed rules for the implementation of the measures, stipulating the licensing system for the establishment of financial institutions such as banks and money shops, making the power to request the submission of business reports legalized, and ordering general Chinese commercial banks to deposit deposit reserve funds into the Central Reserve Bank. The financial control of the Central Reserve Bank became more powerful, and in essence, it already possessed the qualifications of a central bank. On the other hand, among the four Chongqing banking systems confiscated by the Japanese authorities, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, after September 1st, swept away the Chongqing color and operated under the banner of the Central Reserve Bank, which was well received by all parties. In addition, the Joint Reserve Committee, the financial adjustment mechanism of Chinese commercial banks, also adapted to the current situation, reorganized its internal structure, and expressed its cooperation with the National Government to carry out adjustments. In addition, the Shanghai Foreign Banks Association also followed suit to eliminate the British and American color, and restarted with Japanese banks as the center.

Secondly, regarding the implementation of price controls, the "Provisional Measures for Stabilizing Prices" promulgated on May 29th were implemented in conjunction with the previous currency unification policy, and gradually became more active. Subsequently, on July 3rd, the "Provisional Regulations on Stabilizing Prices" and the "Provisional Regulations on Combating Private Price Hikes" were promulgated separately. The crux of the price policy in the past, that is, the speculative behavior of using financial institutions, can be completely eradicated. Since September 1st, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have been carrying out comprehensive price countermeasures under close liaison, starting with general retail prices, with the prices at the end of May as the standard, prohibiting them from exceeding the limit. This kind of restriction on retail prices is a temporary emergency measure. Therefore, the parties concerned are fully considering fundamental countermeasures, including the consistent price control from raw material purchase to product distribution, the establishment of purchase and distribution mechanisms, and the adjustment of needs. However, due to the shortage of materials, the practice of hoarding goods and speculating has not been curbed. After mid-October, the rising trend of major foods such as sugar and oil, and cotton yarn and cotton cloth cannot be ignored. On November 19th, the authorities formulated the highest wholesale prices for cotton yarn and cotton city, the largest industrial products in Central China, which will be implemented from December 1st. In the past, price controls only focused on the consumer part, but this time it also covers the wholesale part, which can be considered to have great significance and can show the future trend of price controls.

In short, from the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War to the occupation of Singapore and the pacification of Burma, this period was a period for the rapid implementation of various emergency countermeasures on the economy of Central China. If we assume that this is the first phase, then the second phase from the separation of the new and old legal currencies to the end of November last year is the period for the recovery of the old legal currency and the implementation of construction plans in various aspects. The third phase after December began with the comprehensive prohibition of the old legal currency in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Since the chairman's visit to Japan, it can be seen that it has jumped from sharing weal and woe to sharing life and death. Under the above-mentioned environment, the bank's business situation in the past year has gradually become more solid and developed. The separation of the new and old legal currencies, followed by comprehensive exchange, and the reserve notes advanced to a unified currency. During this extremely historical period of change, the bank's increase in deposits and loans was not hindered by this. Compared with the same period last year, it is more than enough, which is truly commendable and gratifying. Now, reviewing the year-end balance of various deposits and loans, the total deposits were 270,191,000 yuan at the end of June and 320,552,000 yuan at the end of December. The loans were 202,322,000 yuan at the end of June and 261,463,000 yuan at the end of December. The net profit for the first half of the year was 1,400,000 yuan, and the net profit for the second half of the year was 1,835,000 yuan, totaling 3,235,000 yuan. The net profit for the previous year was 3,259,000 yuan (old legal currency standard). Although it seems to be slightly reduced when viewed as a reserve note standard, this is actually due to the suspension of foreign exchange, but it can still achieve the above-mentioned results, which can prove the increase in deposits and loans. Since the implementation of the foreign currency fund freeze order, the bank has focused on domestic finance as its business center and has been engaged in increasing the number of inland branches and offices. The implementation has come to an end. Last year, new offices were established in Nantong, Jiaxing, and Yangzhou. In January this year, the head office moved to the Gongrong Building (formerly the location of the Bank of Goodwill), and the Hongkou branch was established at the old site. Currently, in addition to the head office, there are a total of eleven branches and offices.

In January last year, two departments of savings and trust were added. The main purpose is to serve as a fund supply department for the bank department and to make side efforts. It also operates agency insurance, safekeeping for customers, sales of bonds, management of real estate, and various loans. With a special position, it has achieved considerable results.

Recently, our friendly country Japan established the Greater East Asia Province. At the same time, Mr. Okazaki Kaheita, the executive director of the bank, resigned due to his appointment as a counselor of the Greater East Asia Province. In addition to bidding farewell, we deeply remember that Mr. Okazaki has made outstanding contributions since the establishment of the bank and is an indispensable person for the bank. Only because of the Japanese authorities' earnest hope, he had to enter the official career. This matter was reported to the last shareholders' extraordinary meeting, but I am still reluctant to this day.

Finally, what I want to say is that the National Government has announced its participation in the war on January 9th. Due to this participation, the relationship between China and Japan has advanced from sharing weal and woe to sharing life and death. It should be known that the Greater East Asia War is not only Japan's war against Britain and the United States, but also the uprising of all oppressed nations in East Asia. In this new situation, a new prelude will be launched in economic policy, which can be reversed.

China's materials for construction have been largely imported from Japan in the past. In the future, it cannot rely solely on Japan, but must strive for self-sufficiency. Furthermore, China should mobilize all its resources and production to fight against Britain and the United States, and advance towards the completion of the war with close cooperation with friendly countries. Therefore, expanding productivity is the first priority. If we think of the great war of attrition currently unfolding in the southern waters, then the need for full cooperation between China and Japan is more urgent than ever. We firmly believe that now is the time for the two countries to work together to defeat Britain and the United States. Liang Hongzhi, Chairman of Wah Hsing Commercial Bank (February 26, 1943)

### Enjoying One's Profession

— Fei Hui

In this era, the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. Although there are many reasons for this, such as the depression of society or the decline of personnel, a large number of people are becoming unemployed. However, there is another important reason, that is, employed people often cannot enjoy their profession. No matter what a person does, if he is not interested in it, how can it succeed? Therefore, if an employed worker complains all day long, his work efficiency will be relatively reduced, and the impression he gives to others will also be bad. This is not being able to enjoy one's profession.

In fact, no matter what kind of profession, after careful appreciation, it contains great fun. The real fun is often buried in the center of difficulties, waiting to be excavated hard, and finally it will definitely be obtained. Therefore, employed people should take enjoying their profession as the basis and use patient hard work to overcome the general bad environment.

However, it is indeed too difficult for an employee who lives on a low salary to maintain his life. This will also make him feel that the work he is doing is boring. This requires mutual understanding. Employers should also try their best to reduce the pain of employees, so as not to make them have the mentality of "complaining about every line of work" and reduce work efficiency.

### Torment, Expectation, and Effort

— Hu Ruoliu

Many people feel tormented in life. They eagerly expect the coming of light, but light is not obtained from imagination. It must be obtained from effort. So without torment, there is no expectation. Therefore, torment is the motivation for expectation, and expectation? More importantly, there must be effort to make torment have a way out.

Many people say this: "Expectation is not the way out of torment. It is just a phenomenon of torment!" I think this sentence is very right. If you don't work hard in expectation, what's the use of expectation? So we must not hold the slogan of "relying on heaven for food." We cannot believe in the control of fate. We should remember the old saying "Heroes create the times." It is useless to rely on expectation and hope in torment. What is more important is effort.

We have read great biographies, and it seems that they have achieved success from torment, expectation, and effort. The reason for success is "having great ambitions from a young age." In fact, "great ambitions" are not valuable. What is valuable is personal effort. The failure of ordinary people is that they have torment and expectation, but no effort. So ordinary people are ambitious, but their lives are decadent and depressed. Although there is expectation, it is just a spring dream.

Friends! We should not fantasize about hope coming. We should carry the burden and walk forward. Although it is torment, can the beautiful scenery in expectation be achieved without effort? So we must work hard before we can succeed. We should not just talk about torment. We should not just expect. We must work hard to prepare. We must "carry the burden." This is the way out of torment!

### Vine and Zhang

— Zhou Xushang

The yard paved with stones is full of messy green grass. In order to make it neat and beautiful, it took a whole day to completely clean them up. At that time, although I was exhausted, I was happy to have completed a wish. But after a few days, they poked their heads in the stone cracks again. In a fit of anger, I took a small knife and iron shovel to dig them up one by one, even with the soil. But after a few days, they returned to their original state. After several attempts, I was unable to stop their vitality. At this time, I realized that human power cannot destroy the vitality of nature, just as evil forces cannot stop the angry tide of justice. The indomitable growth of green grass is more than ten thousand times better than those vines that cannot stand on their own without parasitism.

If we roughly distinguish the current human beings, we can also divide them into two categories: "grass-like people" and "vine-like people." The former rely on their own struggle to stand in society. The latter rely on inheritance or parasitize on exploitation and speculation. They often eat, prostitute, gamble, and enjoy themselves outside the labor line, regardless of whether their actions are harmful to the country and society. However, the high tower on the floating sand will collapse sooner or later. In the near future, there may be a storm to break their parasitic pillars." (End of quotation)

### Watching Li Yanxiu and Ji Yuliang's Opera

— Su Shaoqing

Since the beginning of spring this year and before the Lantern Festival, a total of half a month, I have not been to the opera house that performs Peking Opera. I have my reasons. Peking Opera has always been accustomed to performing two operas every night from the lunar calendar's New Year's Day. This year, a new emerging style has been added. The leading actors often perform a heavy opera, singing four operas day and night. Even people made of iron and copper will be tired, let alone flesh and blood? How can they not be tired to death? If we want to listen to opera, we naturally want to listen to good operas with concentration. Watching such teeth-grinding, dull operas does not feel comfortable, so there is no need to go. Besides, the people who watch operas in the New Year are another group of people, supporting the old and carrying the young, and the types are very mixed. There are very few connoisseurs among them, and it is more noisy than usual, and the ears are not clean.

February 19th happened to be the Lantern Festival of the year Guiwei. This is very strange. I did not see fireworks, but I saw heavy snow falling. I thought today was the time to listen to opera. So I braved the wind and snow to the Queen's Theater. Ji Yuliang and Li Yanxiu both had two operas. Ji's "Fire Bull Array" is "Golden Terrace." These two opera names are very far from the topic. - I didn't see them. Li Yanxiu's "Great Splitting of the Coffin" was performing mourning and matchmaking. The old "Four Geng" "250" and Xiao Shoushan's apprentice "Chunyun" were teasing each other. Both little clowns were good. In this scene, when Tian sees that Prince Chu is handsome, she asks him about his height and wants to marry him. The words of the two people's questions and answers are conveyed by "Chunyun" and "250." All the laughter belongs to the two little clowns. Tian and Prince Chu don't have any acting to do. Tian's acting is shown when she is working and her martial arts skills are revealed when she is digging the coffin. When I saw Li Yanxiu performing at the Updating Stage two years ago, I saw that her face and body were full of fat, and she was so fat that it was scary. The impression was not good, so I didn't pay much attention to how she was acting. Today, when I saw her dressed as Tian, her body has become much thinner, and the "patches" on her face are well done, and she doesn't look very fat. I looked at her carefully and saw that she had a pair of good eyes, long and big, and her eyes were dark. Sometimes her right eye squinted, making a look of charm. This is what I had not seen two years ago. If I don't look carefully today, I will have wronged her for this pair of good eyes. Below, "250" used a fan to flutter a pair of butterflies. Cao Sigeng did a very good job. His head and upper body were completely still, like a real paper figure. This scene is a "small material" - gimmick - added by the Bangzi Opera troupe earlier - and the role of Zou's chasing two male and female rats in "Fighting Wancheng" is the same, all are made up out of thin air and are digressions. However, Zhuang Zhou's transformation into a butterfly is a saying in ancient books, so it is not adding feet to a snake. But there is another meaning. The audience must know that the pair of flying butterflies symbolizes the mutual love of men and women. Only Zhuang Zhou, who is detached from the world, can lie in the coffin board and not move, can he avoid the trouble of "human desire." Li Yanxiu's Tian has a lot of explanation for sharpening the axe before splitting the coffin, which is much stronger than all the female actors who have played Tian in recent times. When she got on the table and split open the coffin and saw Zhuang Zhou suddenly resurrected and stood up, she should have chosen a somersault as usual. Yanxiu did not fall, I am afraid she was lazy. When Zhuangzi asked him this question, she rolled on the ground with her feet facing the sky. The name is "Double Dragons Twisting the Pillars." This hand is also a customary thing. However, when the female actors play this set, they are wearing short clothes and binding fake little feet. Others see it in their eyes, and they have a feeling of beauty and charm. No one will dislike it. After this opera, Tian committed suicide with an axe. Below, Ji Yuliang came with another opera, "Slashing the Yellow Robe." Liu Hongsheng is the best at singing this opera because the tune is high, the voice is round, and the opening "Gaga tune" is like firing anti-aircraft guns. Every bullet hits the skyscraper, loud and crisp. As for turning high, it is even more common. The local scenery is effortless and naturally wonderful, so he is famous for singing this high-pitched opera. Ji Yuliang's voice was pretty good in Golden last year. This year, I heard people say that his voice was broken. I didn't quite believe it. Today, I listened to him sing "Slashing the Yellow Robe," and his voice was indeed not good. The tune was not enough "six and a half tunes." It was not the tune of "Slashing the Yellow Robe" at all. The tune he sang was obviously coping. When he "looked at the details," the word "details" usually made a Gaga tune, but Yuliang made it, but the high point was not enough, and it was not wide enough. "Unbuttoning the robe" is another Liu-style tune, and Yuliang would not use it. Listening to this "Slashing the Yellow Robe," Yuliang was always perfunctory, with no highlights at all. His voice was empty, a tune lower than in the Golden Age. Did something go wrong? If he doesn't hurry up and kill a bloody path, I will worry about his future! Below, Li Yanxiu performed another opera, "Liang Hongyu Drums and Fights Jinshan." This is a martial arts opera. Yanxiu plays Han Shizhong's wife Liang, singing the Northern tune, revealing the "handle" and "bright image," which can also be seen, but it cannot be considered the most sophisticated opera, so there is no need to comment on it in detail.

### Life's Task

— Shi Han

Time is life's fair critic. It is an instrument for measuring the meaning of life. When you have completed a segment of life's journey, it will use the length of time consumed to measure the extent of your achievements, and then make a fair and selfless judgment on the meaning of your true life. Even if you are a world-renowned sophist, you cannot possibly place a beak over its judgment to stubbornly defend it.

The task of life is how to maintain an equal value, or even exceed it, under the measurement of time. To put it plainly, it means that in every stage of life, one must complete or exceed the subjects one deserves in order to keep the meaning of one's life in balance with time on the scales, or to make the side with time placed on it tilt upwards!

### Association. Fantasy. Ideal

— Zhong Shun

According to the explanation of psychology, association is a series of thoughts. When we experience things we have experienced before, we often bring out another thing related to that experience. As Chesterton said, "The brain becomes a wreck or a flea market." Gradually displayed. Therefore, association is really a sequential reproduction of past experiences.

Fantasy is different. Its biggest difference from association is a psychology of hoping for the future. The so-called "daydreaming" and "fanciful thinking" belong to it, and are usually called dreaming. This fantasy, in the process of thought departure, has no basis, but a kind of delusional self-psychological satisfaction, and the result of failure will occupy his whole life.

As for the ideal, his thoughts are based on something, progressing in order, and according to the law of the same cause produces the same effect, the "probability" of achieving the goal is very high. If there is no so-called "accidental" thing to hinder it, after some effort, it may be possible to achieve the wish. Therefore, his idea is definitely not a repeat of past experiences, nor is it like a fantasy without any basis, with mixed levels. Therefore, this kind of idea can be called an ideal. That is the so-called "Utopia" like Confucius's "Great Harmony".

As for the relationship between association, fantasy, and ideal. The three are each a part of thought. And here, the scope of association involves the past and focuses on the past; fantasy and ideal both focus on the future. To use people as an analogy, association is close to an old man familiar with anecdotes, fantasy is like an emotional youth, and ideal is also a youth, but he has rationality.

### Teacher of All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

(18)

He liked someone suggesting the idea. He felt too weak to bother conjecturing how it had happened—how they had got him upstairs, what Mrs. Wickett had said, and all the rest. But suddenly, there, by his bed, was Mrs. Wickett. Smiling. Ah, well, he thought, what’s she doing here? And in the shadow behind Mrs. Wickett he saw Cartwright, the new headmaster (though he’d been at Brookfield since nineteen-nineteen, he thought of him still as “new”), and old Buffles, commonly called “Roddy.” Queer, they were all here. He thought: I needn’t bother thinking anything more whatever. I’m going to sleep.

But it wasn’t sleep, and it wasn’t quite waking: it was a sort of in-between state, full of dreams, and faces, and sounds. Old scenes and scraps of tunes: that Mozart trio that Caldy used to play—cheers, laughter, and the sound of guns—and over it all, Brookfield’s bells, Brookfield’s bells. “So you see, if Præbus refuses to take Miss Betrishian, remember, you can, you cad. . . .” Jokes: rotten beef . . . jokes . . . You there, Max? Yes, come in. Any news from home? . . . O Miki Praeteritos . . . Ralston said I was slack and inefficient—but they couldn’t have managed without me. . . . Obile herec ago fotibus es in aro . . . Who can construe me that? . . . It’s a joke. . . .

Once, he heard them talking about him in the room.

Cartwright was whispering to Murifr. “Poor old chap—must have been rather lonely all these years.”

Murifr replied, “Not altogether lonely. You know, he was married.”

“Oh, really? I never heard that.” “She died. It must be—oh, fully thirty years ago. More, perhaps.”

“Poor chap. Pity he never had any children.”

Chips, hearing this, made a desperate effort to open his eyes wider and so attract their attention. It was hard to speak aloud, but he wanted to say something, something that would tell them. He gazed round the room, and then at each of them in turn.

He struggled, and said slowly, “You were saying—I rather thought—some one was—um—saying. . . .” (49)

### Promoting Group Weddings

— Ye Bincan

Marriage is the source of kinship and the cause of social organization. In the past, our country paid great attention to the form of marriage, and the rituals and etiquette were particularly complicated, such as the six rites of Zhou: Nà Cǎi, Wèn Míng, Nà Jí, Qǐng Qī, Nà Zhēng, and Qīn Yíng. Descending to later generations, the rituals gradually became simpler, and in Zhu Zi's Family Rituals, only the three rites of Nà Cǎi, Nà Zhēng, and Qīn Yíng remained. In modern times, customs have been followed, but they have not yet escaped the old form. However, in today's world of turmoil and people's livelihood difficulties, extravagance and waste are really unnecessary. If individual weddings are changed to group weddings, it can save a lot of money economically. For example, the hall needs to be borrowed separately, which costs a lot. If we cooperate, we can adopt a public hall system, and the bridesmaids can also adopt a joint system. Bands and all equipment can be shared. Therefore, group weddings are more economical than individual weddings in any aspect. Especially when many newlyweds gather together, the joy is naturally more pleasant in spirit. For example, the Dalae Group Wedding Service held a group wedding ceremony at the Xianle Dance Palace a few days ago, with Mr. Chen Yisheng as the officiant. The order was well-organized, and the ceremony was simple but solemn. Mr. Huang Jingwan sent congratulatory couplets: "Good couples must start from respecting and loving each other, and good families must come from diligence and thrift," which was particularly interesting. In this time of difficult material resources, this system can be promoted. Marriage only needs to comply with the requirements of the current Civil Code on Family Law that "marriage should have a public ceremony and two or more witnesses" to be legal. I hope that young men and women in society will be cautious when choosing a spouse in the future, and strive for simplicity in the form of marriage. Group weddings are an economical, generous, and legal marriage system, and should be advocated.
