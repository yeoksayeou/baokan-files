### On National Diplomacy

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, East Asian countries have entered an unprecedented new era, and the relationship between China and Japan has also entered a closer new stage. Especially after China's entry into the war, the historical mission of the two countries has become even greater. In order to achieve the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, it depends not only on the efforts of the authorities of the two countries, but also on the cooperation and struggle of the people of the two countries. Cooperation in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture requires the cooperation of the people of the two countries in order to achieve real results. Otherwise, no matter how hard the government authorities try, the result will inevitably be a case of getting half the results with twice the effort. The National Diplomacy Promotion Association will be established today, perhaps in view of this. However, if we don't talk about "national diplomacy," then so be it. Otherwise, the following points seem worthy of the attention of those gentlemen who are enthusiastic about "national diplomacy."

First, theoretically speaking, national diplomacy can supplement the inadequacies of government diplomacy. Therefore, in modern progressive countries, great attention has been paid to national diplomacy in peacetime. However, from the perspective of the relationship between China and Japan, there has been no so-called "national diplomacy" in the past. Since the launch of the peace movement, there has also been no genuine national diplomacy. Especially today, after China declared its participation in the war, close cooperation between the two governments is no longer a problem. Therefore, the main task of today's "national diplomacy" is naturally not to supplement the inadequacies of government diplomacy, but to adapt to this new situation in light of the current close relationship between the two countries, so that the mutual understanding and cooperation between the people of the two countries become even more important. Therefore, the focus of today's national diplomacy should be on enhancing the thorough understanding and cooperation between the people of China and Japan.

Second, in the past sixty years, due to the instigation of discord by Britain and the United States, suspicion and hatred have been created between China and Japan. Especially since the Sino-Japanese Incident, there has been an undercurrent of suspicion, and even hatred, in the minds of the people of the two countries, which cannot be denied. After years of efforts by the authorities of the two countries to advocate peace and then conclude an alliance, it seems that there can be some gradual changes in the minds of the people, from suspicion to understanding. However, in any case, this will inevitably require a considerable amount of time and the efforts of both the government and the public. However, to be honest, in the past, the words of friendship between friendly countries exceeded the facts of friendship. Therefore, people do not feel any value when they hear words of friendship. Therefore, if there is to be national diplomacy in the future, it must assist the authorities to change the past phenomenon, and it is especially hoped that the facts of friendship between friendly countries will exceed the words of friendship in order to achieve results.

Third, the authorities of the two countries are now advocating national diplomacy, which is the prelude to attaching importance to public opinion. In wartime, the only thing that national diplomacy can achieve is to harmonize emotions, and this alone is enough to be the starting point for the century-long cooperation between the people of the two countries. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities of the two countries will pay serious attention to this point and inform the people with more facts of friendship. For example, the food problem must be resolved reasonably and quickly to reduce the suffering of the people. As long as the sincerity of cooperation between China and Japan is demonstrated more in practice, the emotions between the people of the two countries can be truly harmonized, and only with the sincere harmony between the people of the two countries can the cooperation between the two countries be truly effective. It is hoped that those who advocate national diplomacy will not ignore this point.

Finally, we hope that "national diplomacy" will not become an empty slogan or slogan, but that we will do some practical things. In particular, it is hoped that the people of the two countries must be treated equally. We must know that the failure of the ethnic policies of Britain and the United States in the past was because they regarded themselves as superior races and regarded the inferior races in the colonies as our East Asian people, so they only aroused the resistance of the East Asian nations. Among our Eastern nations, especially between China and Japan, we need to set an example, reverse what Britain and the United States have done, and fully realize the ideal of "ethnic equality." Whether in China or Japan, whether to overseas Chinese or to the Chinese people in other occupied areas, we must fully express the spirit of equality, friendship, and love. Only in this way can we thoroughly change the past phenomena, and all of these are what those who speak of "national diplomacy" today urgently need to strive for.

### Mei Siping Talks About Mobilizing Materials But Not Manpower

Nanjing, 19th, Haitong News Agency – Minister of Industry Mei Siping, in an interview with a reporter from Haitong News Agency, stated that the National Government hopes that after the restoration of normal conditions, in addition to supplying Japan with materials, it will also supply the Axis countries in Europe. The National Government does not mobilize manpower for immediate combat, but only increases raw materials and industrial production. The mobilization of materials in China is proceeding smoothly. The full utilization of Chinese factories depends on the solution of transportation problems. China produced 20,000,000 (the number is unclear) bales of cotton annually before the outbreak of the war. At present, the price of cotton should be increased to encourage production. The British and American sides stated that Chongqing purchased materials from the peaceful areas. Foreign observers do not seem to understand this very well. We should remember that the demarcation between the peaceful and non-peaceful areas of China is not like the battle line between the occupied and non-occupied areas of the Soviet Union. Materials can still circulate, and the peaceful areas can also obtain items such as antimony and tung oil.

### Finance Minister Zhou Issues a Statement The Government Is Making Appropriate Financial Preparations

The government is now making appropriate financial preparations to meet the needs of Chinese industrialists during wartime and will enable Chinese manufacturers to obtain sufficient raw materials for their use. Therefore, the commencement of factories can be realized as much as possible. In addition, setting reasonable prices for goods will also encourage industrialists to engage in production. The government also pays special attention to the issue of China's agricultural output in order to enhance its combat potential. Regarding the issue of implementing special taxes to enrich war funds, Zhou replied that the government has not yet considered this for the time being, but the general tax and income tax will be increased. The government has not yet considered issuing war bonds.

### Deputy Minister Guo Broadcast Last Night

Nanjing, 19th, Central News Agency – Guo Xiufeng, Deputy Minister of Propaganda, delivered a radio address to the nation on January 19th, titled "Peace and Participation in the War," the gist of which was: Peace requires struggle, and war is the highest form of struggle. We want to achieve peace, defend East Asia, and participate in the war. Unless the Greater East Asia War is completed and the Anglo-American forces of aggression are eliminated, comprehensive peace between China and Japan cannot be achieved, and East Asia cannot be liberated. Participation in the war is the development of the peace movement. Peace and participation in the war are consistent. The instructions left to us by the Founding Father on his deathbed were: "Peace, Struggle, Save China." We must fundamentally eliminate the past erroneous concept of recognizing peace as complacency and raise the spirit of struggle, embark on the road of war, and do our best and shed our blood to realize peace between China and Japan, peace in East Asia, and world peace. In the midst of this evolution of the old and new eras, we can only fight until the final victory.

### Fierce Battles on the Entire Eastern Front for the Capture of Important Strongholds The Soviet Union Sends Newly Formed Reserve Troops to Break Through the Siege of Leningrad

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th, Central News Agency – The battles south of Lake Ladoga in the northern region of the Eastern Front are becoming increasingly fierce. In order to break through the siege of Leningrad, the Soviets are using newly formed reserve troops under Marshal Voroshilov, launching fierce attacks on German positions from three directions: west of Shlisselburg on the west bank of the Neva River and south of Lake Ladoga. German war bulletins also report that the German army is engaged in fierce defensive battles in that area, and that 229 enemy tanks have been destroyed in that area alone since the 12th, which is a testament to the fierce fighting in that area. At the same time, a telegram from Moscow on the 18th reported that the Soviet army, despite fierce German resistance, had occupied Shlisselburg, but there was no confirmation. The Soviet army also appears to have attacked repeatedly in the middle and upper reaches of the Don River. Soviet troops advancing southwest from Voronezh, ignoring fierce German resistance, are slowly advancing towards Kupiansk. According to a telegram from Moscow, other Soviet troops advancing south along the Voronezh-Rostov railway on the 18th recaptured Kamensk-Shakhtinsky and several villages in its vicinity. However, the activity of the Axis air force in that area is quite intense, and the Soviet army has suffered heavy losses. There are also fierce offensive and defensive battles in northern and central Caucasus. With the exception of important positions on the war roads, German troops in some areas appear to have withdrawn to new positions in the rear. A Soviet war bulletin said that the Soviet army had finally crossed the Manych River.

Pressure Increases in the Don River Region German Defensive Tactics Inflict Heavy Losses on the Enemy

Berlin, 19th, Haitong News Agency – Although the Soviet army continues to attack with a large army in the Lake Ladoga region, there is no doubt that it will use reserve troops to reinforce the offensive launched in the southern route two months ago. In the past few days, the war on the southern route of the Eastern Front has become increasingly fierce, and the pressure on the Soviet army in the Don River region has increased. However, the enemy's offensive has been repelled by the German and Allied forces. The German army's elastic defensive tactics have inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. In the past two months, the Soviet army has reported the loss of 6,000 tanks, most of which were lost on the southern route of the Eastern Front. In northern Caucasus, the Soviet army continues to attack fiercely. The German army besieged in Stalingrad is resisting the Soviet army fiercely. The German army's resistance in that area is very successful. There are only local wars on the central route of the Eastern Front. In the mop-up operations behind the front line, the German army annihilated 2,000 enemy troops.

German Headquarters, 19th, Haitong News Agency – This afternoon's German war report stated that German troops repelled enemy troops invading western Caucasus. Fierce fighting continues in northern Caucasus and the Don River region. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, 62 Soviet tanks were destroyed. In the Stalingrad area, enemy troops repeatedly invaded with fresh troops, and our army fought bravely. Southeast of Lake Ilmen and enemy troops in the central route did not succeed in their offensive. South of Lake Ladoga, the Soviet army attacked under the cover of heavy artillery, and the battle was extremely fierce. The enemy suffered heavy losses and retreated. In the above two war zones, 32 Soviet tanks were destroyed. Soviet aircraft engaged in air battles with the Axis air force, and 16 were shot down. German and Italian aircraft returned to their original defenses safely.

Snow Melting in the Caucasus Soviet Offensive Making Little Progress

Berlin, 19th, Haitong News Agency – The battle for important strongholds on the Eastern Front continued fiercely on Sunday. The German army's mobile defensive tactics have been successful everywhere. The snow in western Caucasus has begun to melt, and the Soviet army's offensive has not made any progress. The war in the Terek region of northern Caucasus is still in progress. The Soviet army's attacks on various points in Stalingrad did not succeed. In the area between the Volga and the Don rivers, the German army repelled enemy troops attacking north on the Kalmyk Plain. The Soviet army's offensive on the south bank of the Don River was also repelled. The offensive in the Don River loop is not as fierce as before. The German army destroyed 15 enemy tanks during the offensive and recovered many strongholds. The Soviet army's offensive in the central region of the Pakhra River was very fierce on Sunday, but it was eventually repelled. The war southeast of Lake Ilmen has subsided, and the Soviet army has been driven back by the German army's counterattack.

### German Army Plants New-Type Mines in Libya British Tank Corps Suffers Heavy Losses No Changes on the Tunisian Front

Berlin, 18th, Domei News Agency – Front-line news: The British Eighth Army launched a large-scale offensive in North Africa on the 15th of this month. By yesterday, the third day, it had lost another 20 tanks. In the previous two days, it had lost about 100 tanks. Although the British army's offensive is large-scale, the positions of the German-Italian Allied forces have not changed. The British army is advancing along the coastal road with a strong infantry force covered by tanks, and is concentrating the main force of the tank corps to attack the south side of the German army. However, this offensive has failed.

Berlin, 19th, Haitong News Agency – It is declared here that German engineers have recently used a new type of mine in North Africa, the structure of which can reduce the reaction that allows the British army to discover them during searches, and after being buried underground, it is extremely difficult to dig them up. According to military sources, when Montgomery attacked General Rommel's southern flank this time, his tanks suffered heavy losses in front of this new type of mine.

German Rearguard Force Vigorously Blocks the British Army

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th, Haitong News Agency – According to news from London, well-informed British sources warned the British press not to be optimistic about the situation in Libya. General Montgomery's troops will still find it difficult to occupy Tripoli. The British vanguard was blocked by the German rearguard force in Zliten. The main force of the German-Italian Allied forces is already 160 kilometers west of Zliten. The British army is advancing in three routes: the first route is advancing along the coastal highway towards Misrata, having reached Tawurgha; the second route has reached Dafna; the third route has reached Urid. London believes that General Rommel does not want to defend Tripolitania firmly, but wants to go to Tunisia.

Bern, Switzerland, 18th, Havas News Agency – According to news from the British and American sides, there have been no major changes on the Tunisian front recently. The Allied Headquarters' war report only stated that there were no major changes in the front-line war yesterday, and that it was not very active in the air due to bad weather. However, British and American aircraft bombed Axis transportation hubs near Gabès and the ports of Sfax and Sousse. French separatist troops have occupied new positions near Bou Arada and Pichon, wanting to replace the American troops in the area. Axis aircraft are also busy bombing Allied shipping and transportation lines in Algeria and the port of Bône. As for Libya, it is heard that, according to Rommel, the British Eighth Army plans to abandon the plan to attack Misrata and attack Beni Ulid to the east, and it is said that it can continue to advance in the desert area, thereby avoiding the mountainous positions held by the Axis forces.

British and Americans Attempt to Protect Maritime Transportation

Madrid, 19th, Haitong News Agency – A military correspondent for the Spanish "Luna" newspaper stated that the goal of the British and American operations in North Africa seems to be to recover the positions occupied by the Axis forces on the Tunisian coast and the Strait of Sicily in order to restore the sea route between Gibraltar and Alexandria. If the Allies want to maintain transportation in the Mediterranean, it is necessary to occupy Tunisia and Tripolitania. Europe and Africa are only a short distance apart, but this area is already under the control of the Axis forces. Therefore, the war in Africa is not a war for colonies, but a part of the European war. The Axis forces have already occupied a superior position in North Africa because their transportation lines are extremely short, while the British and American transportation lines are very far away and are threatened by the Axis naval and air forces along the way. Therefore, the urgent task for the Allies is to organize supply plans and unified command. The past chaotic and independent military actions of the Allies have created opportunities for the Axis forces to establish bases, and the Axis forces' air superiority has enabled the Axis forces to land in Tunisia.

### Ambassador Su Strenuously Argues: Food Shortage

Lisbon, 18th (Havas) - Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Litvinov, recently issued a call on American radio, strenuously arguing that Soviet food supplies are extremely scarce.

Finally, he requested that Britain and the United States send ships to transport food to assist the Soviet Union.

The fires that broke out in the London docklands area continued to burn until 3:00 AM the next morning. At that time, the second batch of German bombers arrived in London, and this air raid lasted for ninety minutes. The weather was clear that day, so the visibility for the German aircraft was extremely clear.

At around 10:00 PM that evening, enemy aircraft approached Berlin, and the German anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, preventing enemy aircraft from flying into Berlin from the southeast. Only a small number of British aircraft infiltrated the skies over Berlin to drop bombs. At this time, the enemy aircraft began to encounter a bad fate. Several British bombers had already been shot down on the way to Berlin. Only a few of the enemy aircraft participating in the raid managed to fly back to Britain. Most of the downed enemy aircraft were four-engine bombers, and only a few crew members were rescued. The damage caused by the British aircraft was very minor.

Berlin, 19th (Haitong Agency) - The responsible authorities stated yesterday that the number of deaths after the Berlin air raid on Saturday night has now increased to eighty-two, including fifty prisoners of war.

### Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry to Establish Committee; Return of Concessions and Abolition of Extraterritoriality Expected to be Fully Realized in Short Term

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry has decided to promptly prepare for the establishment of an implementation committee based on the agreement between China and Japan to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights, with the aim of quickly establishing the committee and appointing members by the end of this month.

Therefore, it is anticipated that the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights will be fully realized in the shortest possible time due to the appointment of committee members.

This time, in order to unify the organization, it is planned to reorganize. According to the new organizational measures, members of school service corps at all levels will also be members of the New Greater Japan Youth Corps. The state will train, guide, and supervise this unified organization. For the sake of effectiveness, it has been decided to set up inspection officials in various regions.

The Governor's Office's policy strives for self-sufficiency in materials and labor. Although we are currently focusing all efforts on manufacturing ships for the Hong Kong Governor's Office itself, we intend to undertake the construction of those needed in various southern regions. Hong Kong's shipbuilding industry will make more progress in terms of speed in the future. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, remittances from overseas Chinese had once stopped, but have now resumed from overseas Chinese in areas occupied by the Japanese army. As a relay port for the exchange of goods, trade is becoming increasingly prosperous, so we hope that this financial circulation will gradually become smoother. Regarding the integration of Chinese banks, we have not yet reached this stage. This year, Hong Kong has become a relay port for the exchange of goods. In order to prepare its infrastructure, we are rapidly organizing warehouses under military administration and adjusting and improving warehouse facilities so that we can make the most of Hong Kong's excellent harbor facilities and warehouses. Regarding the evacuation of the population, the predetermined goal for last year was 300,000 people, which has largely been completed. This year, we are considering continuing to evacuate 300,000 people. The current population of Hong Kong is about 1.2 million. If 300,000 people are evacuated in two years, it can be reduced to 700,000. These 700,000 people will be sufficient to undertake the mission of developing Hong Kong's commerce and industry or acting as a relay port in the future.

### Chilean Foreign Minister Reports on the Overall Situation; German Side Says It Knows Nothing About Severing Diplomatic Relations with the Axis

Chilean Capital, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - Chilean Foreign Minister Furnaldez will deliver a speech to the Senate today to report on the international situation. Afterwards, all cabinet members and senators will discuss the report.

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry here replied to inquiries from foreign reporters yesterday, saying that they had not yet received information that the Chilean government intended to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers on January 19. British and American news agencies had repeatedly reported this news, but Chile had not indicated that it would take this measure. We believe that the United States will put even greater pressure on Chile to achieve its goals.

### Bolivia: Miners' Riot

Argentine Capital, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - According to reports from La Paz, Bolivia, bloody riots occurred in Bolivia last month. Bolivian Interior Minister Chirvante only recently revealed this. It is said that on December 13, 1942, miners in the Catavi district, incited by the Revolutionary Committee, staged a strike. The government immediately declared a state of emergency in the area. On December 18, a large crowd of people, mostly striking workers and their wives and daughters, marched to the Catavi district. The military commander of the area, in order to avoid bloodshed, ordered the payment of overdue wages. On December 21, striking workers attacked the barracks, and soldiers were forced to open fire, killing four workers and wounding nineteen. After the workers received reinforcements, about 500 people attacked the train and damaged high-voltage power lines, shouting the slogan "Down with British and American imperialism." Chirvante continued, "This riot was an action of the Fifth Column." Opposition to democratic politics has always been a task of interest to the people of the Axis countries.

### Must Britain Abandon India? (Part 1) - Transferred from Macau on January 11

The American Saturday Evening Post published this India dispatch telegraphed from Bombay by Edgar Snow on September 12. The content is more concrete, and the material is quite extensive. It is translated here for reference. -Translator-

At present, in India, due to the increasingly close approach of two big pliers, (Germany is attacking the last bean-sized obstacle in the northwest, attempting to participate in Asia, while Japan is preparing to attack Bengal from the east.)

Especially because the Indian National Congress has opposed Britain's domestic struggle, India can no longer play merely a static role in world politics. India's non-violence is creating dynamic history.

The British answer to Gandhi's request to "Leave India!" was to arrest the leaders of the Indian National Congress, resulting in widespread disturbances and bloodshed, which are worse than any recent group conflicts in India. Therefore, the world's attention has to focus on this major political problem in the democratic camp.

Before the Bombay Conference of the National Congress resolved the "Leave India!" proposal, and before Britain planned to deal with the movement of disobedience with oppression, the place most able to feel the pulse of Indian nationalism was a small city called Wardha. The city is located in the middle of India's central provinces, at the intersection of two major railway lines, with a population of about 30,000 people.

Wardha is important not because it has anything particularly attractive. The temperature here is always around 120 degrees, and many people die of heat every year. The water is muddy, and when I visited the city, there was cholera, and many residents suffered from malaria. The land is mostly sandy, and the scenery is ordinary and monotonous.

After suffering in a primitive carriage called a "tonga," pulled by an old and emaciated horse, you can see dirty villages full of cacti. The villages look like something between a small farm and a refugee center. Walking in from the muddy path, you arrive at a straw hut that looks like other houses. The house is made of mud, covered with a little palm leaf as a roof. A wooden fence surrounds the outside of the house, and a "Charkha" (spinning wheel) is crudely sculpted on the mud wall. Gloomy cattle wander nearby—Indian cattle and camels have very bad tempers—and scrawny chickens strut in the yard. An old man sits barefoot on a mat floor, his body beautifully wrapped in several yards of coarse cloth. He is toothless, with an unexpectedly strong and broad chest covered with gray-white hair. There is a spinning wheel between his gaunt knees.

You probably already guessed that this old man is Mahatma Gandhi. And in the house where scorpions and snakes gather, among the chickens and cattle, there gathers a strange and kind staff and laborers who practice Gandhi's teachings. This is where Britain's main troubles lie, and this is what gives Churchill a headache. Here, Gandhi writes articles for "Harijan Weekly," the most influential political publication in India. As a journalist, Gandhi is like a mixture of Dorothy Thompson and Dorothy Dix (translator's note: two famous American female journalists). His claims on every issue are just as strong as those of the ladies. From admonishing young ladies on how their personal conduct should be, to recommending ways for Churchill to conduct the war, he discusses everything. If Americans followed the Dorothys as devoutly as Indians follow Gandhi, the world would be a different place.

Although, in fact, this chocolate-colored Mickey Mouse, (a nickname given to him by his longtime follower Mrs. Naidu,) is still the most important person in the world for India. If you don't understand Gandhi, if you don't meet him, you can't understand the actions of the Indian National Congress.

Before visiting Gandhi, I traveled from one end of India to the other. I attended a meeting of the All India National Congress in Allahabad and spent a lot of time there talking with leading figures and nationalists. After that, I traveled to Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay, and other places. In order to find opinions on political issues, I visited anti-war socialists, pro-war communists, student leaders, pro-Axis people like Subhas Bose, Muslims who sided with Jinnah, and important figures and industrialists.

However, there always seemed to be a lack of common opinion, and it was difficult to find a focus among these people. It was strange, and it finally convinced me that I had to visit Gandhi immediately, whom I had not seen for ten years. It was the Governor-General of India himself who said, "Without Gandhi, there is no National Congress. In the past, the National Congress was his organization, and it still is. Until he dies, the National Congress will always be his. The axis of the National Congress is Gandhi's political genius." This is indeed the case. As for saying that the National Congress is Indian nationalism, the Governor-General would not admit it—more on this later.

Gandhi's remarks rarely have pre-prepared answers. It is clear that he must think that others are good at the terms of materialistic politics. The content of his declarations is extremely ambiguous, which makes him seem like a political clown at worst, and at best self-contradictory. Here are a few examples:

A few months ago, Gandhi declared that India could never become independent unless an agreement was reached between the National Congress and the Muslim League. But now, he accuses the Indian Communist Party of insisting on the unity of the National Congress and the Muslim League, saying that it is wrong, saying that independence comes first, and unity will follow.

When he recently launched another "final struggle" to fight for complete independence, he said that this movement was extremely beneficial to the British. His proposal was "expressed in the most amicable spirit." Gandhi said, "Anti-British? Who is anti-British? Me? No, no, I am pro-British from head to toe."

### Dutch Parliament Convenes

Finnish Capital, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - The Finnish Parliament convened its first meeting after Christmas yesterday to discuss budgetary issues. The Finnish newspaper indicated that there would be changes in the cabinet. The Minister of Social Welfare, Mr. Fagerholm, was said to have resigned last year.

### After China's Entry into the War: A New Understanding of Sino-Japanese Cooperation

— By Kaheita Okazaki, Councillor of the Greater East Asia Ministry

Translated from the January 12th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun

The author of this article, Mr. Okazaki, is from Okayama Prefecture, Japan. He graduated from the Department of Political Science, Faculty of Law, Tokyo Imperial University in the second year of the Taisho era (1913). He then joined the Bank of Japan. After the outbreak of the China Incident, he was appointed as the head of the Foreign Exchange Division of the bank in November of the twelfth year of the Showa era (1937). In the fourteenth year of Showa, he joined the China Development Bank as a director. The bank was the only Japanese-cooperative issuing bank in Central China at that time. Since then, he has been dedicated to the settlement of foreign trade in Central China and has studied the finances of the Shanghai International Settlement. With the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, he joined the ministry as a councillor, a position he holds to this day.

The National Government's participation in the war is an inevitable conclusion after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. For the anti-Japanese regime, seduced by the demons of the United States and Britain, and destroying its foothold in East Asia, this should provide a final opportunity for introspection. At the same time, it clearly indicates the path that the Chinese people should take. Sino-Japanese cooperation will also be extremely demanded as a result. The basic concepts and methods of economic cooperation and other aspects of collaboration will also be renewed and consolidated.

The abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions were probably the basic diplomatic policies that Japan had already adopted before the National Government returned to its capital. With the return of the National Government to its capital, preparations are gradually being made for its concretization, and today it has taken the first step towards implementation. Japan has had many years of hard-fought experience in abolishing extraterritoriality since the Meiji Restoration. Therefore, the Japanese government and people, with "Taoism" as the diplomatic keynote, often sympathize with the position of neighboring countries. As long as a government that can cooperate with Japan and is trustworthy appears in China, it will surely take the lead in implementing this matter. This kind of idea has long existed and is a matter of course. I understand the true intentions of the Chinese and Japanese governments and people, so I sincerely hope that Chinese officials and people can support each other and work hard to build a new China, and wholeheartedly assist Japan's current national destiny to build a new East Asia and reject the great cause of American and British aggression in East Asia.

The revitalized China led by Chairman Wang should be able to show itself as a truly independent country. However, it has not been long since the National Government returned to its capital, and the people's love for it is not yet very strong. Moreover, while the Greater East Asia War is still in full swing, it is not easy to strengthen the government's strength and improve its organization. In addition, among the Chinese people, there are still many who are confused by American and British propaganda, and who are still hesitant and ambivalent. Therefore, I think it is not easy to expect them to have a unified national spirit immediately. In fact, the relationship between the Chinese government and the people is undoubtedly very different from that of Japan. For thousands of years, the idea of "revering those who cherish us and resisting those who abuse us" still lurks in various places. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly understand such political affairs, national character, and the current stage of the Chinese national economic organization. In the future, Japan must use practical methods that are in line with it and provide it with full assistance. Furthermore, Chinese officials and people must open their minds and seek advice and assistance from Japan at any time in order to move towards the path of enriching and perfecting their national organization.

Needless to say, the friendly cooperation between the two countries must be seen in both material and spiritual aspects. However, in the economic aspect, the tasks undertaken by the people of both countries are even more numerous. Since the people of both countries have been active within the scope of concessions and extraterritorial rights for many years, it will not be easy for them to adapt to the new situation for the time being. For the Chinese, the extraterritorial rights of concessions and foreigners can be said to be a safe zone for their lives and property in many ways, so it is understandable that they now feel a bit chilly. Therefore, the officials of both countries must give more consideration to this point and do their best to protect the people.

However, for the Chinese people, the most important thing is a correct understanding of the new situation. In other words, people of both countries must thoroughly understand the content of this world-wide reform, which should probably not be seen in history, and the significance of the Greater East Asia War unfolding before their eyes, and thus change their past minds. It must be known that old-fashioned minds will sooner or later be unable to adapt to the times, and the giant wheel of history will never turn back. It has long since raised its rumbling sound and is moving forward. If you keep this sound in your heart and listen carefully, you will unexpectedly understand that the new Sino-Japanese relationship starting from now has deep historical roots, and then a new understanding will naturally arise. This is a certain truth.

Regarding the various issues that will unfold under the new Sino-Japanese relationship, we now have various expectations and hopes for them. Now, let's take one of the biggest issues, namely economic cooperation, for example. In the future, Sino-Japanese joint ventures will continue to expand, and this must be the case. Because people from both countries work together and their interests are intertwined, the connection between the two countries will be firm. However, in this regard, the methods used by the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands as their colonial policies in East Asia, that is, cleverly suppressing China's own industry and preventing it from developing, so that China will forever be reduced to their commodity market, we will never follow suit. I think that people of both countries should reject this kind of American and British exploitation. Whether it is industry or agriculture, those who have been resisted and have not been developed, so that they are insufficient today, then whether it is technology, machinery, business operators, or capital, China should seek them from Japan. Japan should also provide them quickly as requested, complementing each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses, in order to make the economies of the two countries one and strengthen the economic power of East Asia. This is actually the substantial foundation of Sun Yat-sen's ideal of Pan-Asianism, and at the same time, it is to express the significance of this National Government's participation in the war and the new situation that follows, and it is also to conform to the requirements of history.

### Strictly Searching for Smuggled Grain / Unified Purchase in the Interior / Restricting the Inflow of Urban Funds into Grain-Producing Areas / The Food Department Plans to Adjust Supply in Shanghai

In order to control the work of purchasing food, the newly established Food Department plans to restrict the inflow of funds from various cities into food production areas. The result is worthy of attention. The Food Department's plan is intended to prevent the activities of unscrupulous merchants. If this measure is implemented, then food will not be purchased with cash. In this way, the expansion of currency in the interior can also be prevented.

Purchase from Production Areas / Food Rice Enters the Market

It is reported that the Food Department plans to purchase food rice from various production areas to adjust the supply of food rice in the Shanghai area. Taking Wuhu production area as an example, the local rice shops have a storage volume of only 100,000 shi. The Anhui South Office of the Food Department decided to purchase 60,000 shi from this survey (the purchase price is 266 yuan for the top grade and 262 yuan for the second grade), and the remaining 40,000 shi will be reserved for local people's food. However, because there is no restriction on retail prices, rice prices are becoming more and more expensive. As of the 14th, the price of top-grade rice in the area was 380 yuan per shi and the second grade was 320 yuan.

Relaxing Restrictions on the Movement of Materials

Well-informed sources said that although the prices of various goods in the interior are managed by the Local Price Countermeasures Committee and the Price Management Bureau, the lack of horizontal links between the local price management agencies has resulted in a situation where local prices are becoming more and more divergent. Taking Wuxi and Hangzhou as examples, the average price in the latter is twice as expensive as the former. Some say that the difference in prices between the two places is due to the different amounts of inventory. Officials believe that if they want to adjust this, they must relax the restrictions on the movement of materials in the peaceful area. Otherwise, although Wuxi has a large amount of inventory, merchants will definitely be unwilling to sell their inventory because the price of goods in Hangzhou is so high. Its impact will also make the listing of materials in Wuxi less flexible.

Strict Prohibition of Concealed Private Sales

Yesterday, it was learned from relevant parties that, in order to completely eliminate private sales and stabilize people's hearts, the authorities must conduct strict searches on anyone carrying bulky packages and trying to cross important areas. If any grain or its products are found to be concealed, the goods will be confiscated. In the four suburbs of Shanghai, such as Pudong, Jiangwan, Qibao, Hongqiao, and Xuhui, there are still illegal miscellaneous grain and rice shops that raise the prices of national rice and sell it to rice dealers, who smuggle it into the country, which hinders the entire controlled grain administration. Therefore, with the consent of the local authorities, it is absolutely forbidden for grain and rice shops to illegally sell rice and grain, and they have been banned from operating from the previous day in order to control them.

Bureau Rice Sacks Should Still Be Returned

The Public Works Bureau's Intelligence Department announced that regarding the matter of purchasing sacks, the Bureau has already announced it in Announcement No. 6237 on the 18th of this month. It is now found that the so-called purchase does not refer to the sacks used by the Bureau to deliver rice to various food stores, wineries, restaurants, factories, and other large supply groups. These sacks should still be returned to the Bureau's Sack Storage Office at 104 North Suzhou Road for verification.

### Nightclubs in Western Shanghai Sponsor Winter Relief

The municipal government is raising 2 million yuan to fund winter relief expenses. Nightclubs in western Shanghai support this move. Initiated by Keiberm, the owner of Aiqinting (Eve's Paradise), 10% of the total income will be taken out from January 20th for one week to fund winter relief expenses.

### Edible Oil to Be Sold in Bulk Before the Lunar New Year / Soybeans Have Been Ordered

The system of rationing edible oil based on population in this city has been discussed in detail by the Shanghai Edible Oil Wholesale Office for several times, and detailed measures will be ready soon. However, before it is implemented, the Wholesale Office, in view of the urgent needs of residents during the Lunar New Year, will sell edible oil in two phases from the 21st of this month in accordance with previous methods. It is said that it can be continuously supplied for eight days.

The Tongmeng News Agency reported from this port last night that the Japanese authorities recently allocated 6,000 tons of raw materials for oil production. Various oil factories in this port have processed and extracted oil. In addition, 10,000 tons of soybeans have been ordered in Manchuria, Jinan, Hankou and other places. Once they arrive in Shanghai, they can be allocated to oil factories. Therefore, the black market oil prices in Mupu (Shanghai) fell sharply yesterday. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil had risen to 2,500 yuan per shi, but have now fallen to 1,500 yuan. If the distribution is even in the future, it is expected that the black market will decline further.

### City Party Affairs Conference Concludes / Telegrams Sent to Allied Nations / Declaration and Telegram to Compatriots in Chongqing Published

The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) concluded its city-wide party affairs conference on the 18th. In addition to sending a telegram to the Chairman to pay tribute, the conference also sent telegrams to the people of the Allied nations of Japan and Italy, and a telegram to the compatriots in Chongqing.

### Demolition of Houses Prohibited Again in the Urban Area

Recently, the source of timber has been unsmooth, causing prices to soar. A small number of citizens often demolish houses for sale in order to make huge profits. However, everyone knows that this move is enough to hinder the revitalization of the urban area. In the past, the municipal authorities have strictly prohibited this. However, it has been found that after a long time, the wind of demolishing houses in the urban area has risen again. The Municipal Police Headquarters and the Public Works Bureau will jointly issue a notice to prohibit it. Those who dare to deliberately violate it will be punished according to the law.

### Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu Aoi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday / Discussing Official Affairs with Japanese Authorities in Shanghai / Chief of Intelligence Department Tomioka Arrived Here on Monday

Tongmeng News Agency reports from this port that, according to a report last night, Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday (Tuesday) afternoon to discuss official affairs with the Japanese authorities in Shanghai. This is the first time Shigemitsu has come to Shanghai since China's entry into the war on the 9th. In addition, Tomioka, the Consul General in Nanjing and Chief of the Intelligence Department of the Embassy in China, also arrived in Shanghai on Monday afternoon.

### National Diplomacy Promotion Association to Hold Inaugural Meeting Today / Minister Chu and Ambassador Shigemitsu to Attend and Give Speeches

People in Shanghai recently launched the National Diplomacy Promotion Association from the standpoint of the people because the National Government officially announced its participation in the Greater East Asia War and signed agreements with Allied countries on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. The purpose is to enhance friendship with people from Allied countries and promote China's international status, so as to jointly complete the construction of the new order in Greater East Asia. A preparatory meeting was held at noon yesterday on the 14th floor of the International Hotel. Wen Lanting, Yuan Fudeng, Lin Kanghou, Wu Kaisheng, Zhao Jinqing, Zhao Zhengping, Chen Binhe, Pan Dai, Chen Xishi, Liu Yunfang, Xu Yuanqing and others attended and discussed various issues. It was decided to hold the inaugural meeting at the Huamao Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road at 4 pm today, and respectfully invite Foreign Minister Chu Minyi and Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu Aoi to attend and give speeches. The order is recorded as follows: (1) Preparatory Committee Member Wu Kaisheng reports on the process, (2) Chairman Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, and Yuan Fudeng deliver opening speeches, (3) Minister Chu, Ambassador Shigemitsu, Mayor Chen, Italian Ambassador to China Dai Liangyi, and celebrities Zhang Yipeng and others deliver speeches one after another. There will definitely be a grand occasion at that time.

### New Tram Fares to Be Implemented from the 21st

Reader's Forum

### Please Pay Attention to Grain Rationing in the Urban Area

— Yong Yan

After this forum published an article by Mr. Bai Hong yesterday on improving the order of imports at the North Railway Station, there have been repeated letters from readers reporting similar matters, which shows that this issue is very important to travelers. Not only should the order at the railway station be improved, but the traffic order at bus stations and ferry ports should also be improved. I hope readers will give us the actual situation of the difficulties they have experienced and suggestions for improvement, so that we can contribute them to the relevant authorities for improvement.

Since the authorities absolutely prohibited the free movement of rice in order to suppress black market grain prices, the people of Shanghai have been looking forward to the authorities setting an increased quota for household grain rations, which is like looking forward to rain during a severe drought. Recently, it has been reported that the population grain ration in the two concessions has gradually increased. Although it has not been realized, it is enough to make the residents of the urban area outside the two concessions express 120,000 points of envy. I live in western Shanghai and work in Pudong, so I know more about the current situation of grain rationing in the urban area. I will now describe the pain and minimum hope I have suffered recently as follows:

(1) Determine the Date of Grain Rationing: The two concessions ration grain based on population every 10 days, and the quantity and price are announced in the newspapers in advance. Since November, the urban area (Nanshi, western Shanghai, Zhabei, Pudong, etc.) has followed the methods of the concessions and issued rice purchase certificates. However, the date of rice purchase is not determined. It is now mid-January, and the rice purchase certificates for January have not yet been issued. Most of the residents in the urban area are engaged in production, with workers and small vendors being the most numerous. Very few families have stored grain. Now, they not only have no ability to buy black market rice and miscellaneous grains, but also have nowhere to buy them. The official distribution is also far away, which is really extremely anxious.

(2) Increase Grain Rations According to Actual Needs

Although there was a rumor several months ago that the grain rationing plan for the urban area was 3 he per person per day, the actual distribution quantity is far different from that of the two concessions. The quantity obtained by each person with a rice purchase certificate in December is as follows:

First time (issued in mid-December): 1.5 he of brown rice, 4 he of broken rice; Second time (end of December): 1.45 he of white rice, 1.5 jin of flour; Third time (issued on January 7th and 8th): 6 he of brown rice, 7 he of broken rice.

Before November, it was repeatedly postponed and canceled. According to the current rice and flour issued by the two concessions every ten days, it is only enough for five days of needs, and the actual distribution in the urban area in December is even more insufficient. Since the authorities have the determination to suppress grain prices, it is hoped that the population grain rations will be increased according to actual needs.

In short, Shanghai is an important place for China's industry and commerce. If the grain problem is not solved, it will repeatedly cause psychological anxiety among workers engaged in production. The population living in the urban areas of Pudong, western Shanghai, etc. is also more than 1.5 million, most of whom are workers. Therefore, in order to consolidate the foundation of Shanghai's industry and commerce, it is hoped that the authorities will pay special attention to the acquisition of grain by residents in the urban area.

Finally, after I finished writing the article, I learned that Pudong will distribute the first population grain ration for January in the next few days, with a distribution quantity of about 2 sheng per person, without flour matching. There is no news in western Shanghai yet. The date is not accurate, and the distribution quantity is less than that of the two concessions. I have been working in a factory recently and have witnessed dozens of workers and their families suffering from the pressure of insufficient food. They are struggling on the line of poor life all day long. The problem is quite serious. Everyone's expectation of the authorities' active relief is extremely keen. I hope the authorities will make up for it so that they can work and work hard in production with peace of mind.

### Sugar Rationing in Nanshi Has a Fixed Date / February 10th

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, in order to protect the legitimate needs of citizens for sugar, has implemented a population-based sugar rationing system with the approval of the military distribution authorities. Recently, it has formulated simplified rules for population-based rationing, rules for managing retailers, and re-registering retailers who handle household sugar. The implementation date will be implemented after consultation with the relevant authorities. It has also been decided to start a pilot program in the Nanshi area from the fourth phase (ie, February 10th). After the implementation, sugar needed by various industries due to business needs will be specially allocated.

Retailers Divided into Groups for Management

The authorities have divided the 58 member sugar shops into groups, designated the baojia area, and are responsible for handling the matters entrusted by the cooperative business office and managing the retailers of type A. The distribution quantity and price of household sugar will be announced in the newspaper by the cooperative business office on the first day of each month. All retailers will be re-registered, numbered, and marked at the door for identification. After the population of each district is verified, a united guarantee will be used as the sugar distribution unit. The number of households in a united guarantee will be issued a sugar purchase certificate every month, which will be sent to the jiachang (head of a jia) by the sugar shop in the group, and then distributed to each huzhang (head of a household) by the jiachang, who can purchase sugar with the certificate. When the purchaser comes to purchase with the certificate, the retailer should check the baojia to which it belongs in order, and verify whether the seal affixed by the huzhang is consistent with the seal on the copy of the application form. If it is true, then the purchase is allowed.

### Conscription and Drawing Lots Are All Groundless / Citizens Should Not Believe Rumors Lightly / Police Chief Lu Ying Refutes Rumors

Central News Agency Shanghai News: Since the National Government officially announced its participation in the war, the atmosphere of British and American aggression in East Asia for a century has been completely wiped out. The 5 million citizens of this city are deeply supportive of this national policy of participating in the war. It has been found that rumors have been spreading in the urban area recently. The saying of conscription, drawing lots, and collective training is inconsistent, causing people to panic and be unable to live in peace. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Lu Ying, the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, yesterday to inquire about everything. He was welcomed and issued the following statement: "After the National Government officially announced its participation in the war, the East Asian axis was further strengthened, and the cooperation and cooperation with Allied countries became closer, which aroused the covetousness of treacherous people. The rumors of conscription and drawing lots were purely spread by these people. Their intention is obviously to disrupt social stability and divide the citizens' enthusiasm for cautiously participating in the war, which is very hateful. The central government has not yet considered the move of conscription and drawing lots. Therefore, what is spread from outside is absolutely incredible. I hope that citizens will not believe it and fall into the trap of traitors. They should live their lives in peace and not be impatient or panic. I am in charge of the municipal police administration in the urban area, and I will abide by Mayor Chen's instructions to stabilize the local area and maintain law and order, and work hard to maintain it. If anyone is found to be spreading rumors and causing trouble to confuse the people, they will be severely punished and will not be tolerated." According to another source, it is said that the National Military Commission has now sent an official telegram to Shanghai to refute the rumors, which shows that the rumors are absolutely untrue. I hope citizens will not believe them lightly.

### Public Concession Baojia Youth Department Selects New Members Again / No Political Role and No Military Goals / Letters Sent to Various United Guarantees Recommending and Hoping to Participate Voluntarily

Central News Agency Shanghai News: The purpose of the establishment of the Public Concession Baojia Youth Department is to gather outstanding youths in the city and give them training in intelligence, physical fitness, and group work to serve the society. Its organization has no political role and no military goals. It is purely a youth assembly group for intelligence and discussion. Therefore, since the start of the first phase of training, even on the cold winter morning, the members still receive training at dawn. The spirit of perseverance and perseverance is admirable. At the beginning of this training, some outsiders who did not understand the truth had all kinds of misunderstandings and speculations, and even far-fetched associations, thinking that this technical training was related to military affairs. In fact, this kind of science training is only to strengthen the physical fitness of the members and has no other purpose. Now that the official establishment is approaching, academic training will begin. In view of the insufficient number of members, it is necessary to supplement them. Therefore, it is scheduled to select new members again this month. The department has sent letters to various united guarantees recommending them, and hopes that youths from various districts of the city will voluntarily participate. The qualification is still a junior high school graduation or above.

### Large Quantities of Coal Continuously Shipped to Shanghai - Fuel Reserves Substantial - 4,000 Tons of Kailan Coal Arrive Recently - Coal Merchants Stockpiling Goods with Few Buyers

Considering the amount of bituminous coal used is no less important than essential items like food, relevant authorities in the city have been making efforts to actively source large quantities of domestic coal and continuously ship it to Shanghai for sale. Over the past few months, the amount of bituminous coal shipped to Shanghai has been increasing daily. Yesterday, a reporter learned from coal industry sources that the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's "Eikou Maru" arrived here on the 16th of this month from Qinhuangdao and berthed at the No. 29 and No. 30 pontoons in the Huangpu River. The ship carried approximately 4,000 tons of Kailan lump coal. This coal was ordered by the Shanghai Waterworks Company and was already being unloaded and used some days ago. The production cost is said to be quite low.

Coal Arrives in Shanghai - One After Another

The reporter also learned from other sources that coal shipments to Shanghai have become increasingly smooth recently, due to convenient water and land transportation. It is understood that, in addition to some coal arriving by water transport, some is transported by train on the Jinpu Railway and Hainan Railway. The amount transported each time varies. Most of this coal comes from coal-producing areas in North China, while the rest comes from Korea. Because local coal production is abundant and supply exceeds demand, prices are low. If coal merchants obtain goods there and resell them here at the limited price, they can still make a considerable profit.

Reserves Increase Daily - Market Situation Stabilizes

It has been observed that the use of bituminous coal in the city has decreased significantly compared to the past, partly because factories are saving fuel and partly because residents are economizing. This is due to the high price. As a result, sales are sluggish and reserves have increased sharply. According to someone familiar with the coal market yesterday, current stockpiles of bituminous coal in warehouses in Pudong, Hongkou, West Shanghai, and the French Concession total no less than several hundred thousand tons. Because usage is decreasing and sales are not as brisk as in the past, there are few buyers for spot coal. The market situation has become extremely stable. In summary, there is no fear of a coal shortage.

### Jianghai Customs Revises Unified Tax on Cotton Yarn and Matches

The Jianghai Customs issued a notice regarding the revision of the unified tax on imported cotton yarn and matches, stating that from the 16th of this month, the tax rates will be revised to 5% and 10% ad valorem, respectively. All merchants should be informed.

### Seamen's Special Party Department Reorganized - Wu Lanxi Makes Statement Yesterday

Mr. Kai Chen personally handled the handover. Wu and others immediately appointed Yang Shaozhi and eight original staff members of the Party Department to handle the inventory. Public business will resume as usual starting this morning, and reorganization will begin.

Statement Issued - Supporting National Policy

After taking over the Party Department yesterday, Wu Lanxi, a member of the reorganization committee of the Seamen's Special Party Department, made a statement to the Central News Agency reporter who visited, saying that there are a total of 800,000 seamen comrades. In this turbulent era, the tasks and missions undertaken by all seamen are extremely important. In the future, all comrades should unite to use the strength of 800,000 seamen to follow the national policy, support the leader, and complete the mission of participating in the war. As for the reorganization method, a step-by-step system should be adopted to strengthen the existing institutions.

### French Concession Shops Close Before 8:00 PM

Those who stay open past that time will be punished.

### Chairman of Japanese Chamber of Commerce Returns to Shanghai - Japanese Industrial and Factory Businesses Plan to Move to Shanghai for New Development - Shanghai to Become Financial Center of East Asia - Rebuilding Economic Fortress and Strengthening Cooperation

Mr. Takeuchi, Chairman of the Shanghai Japanese General Chamber of Commerce and Industry, returned to Japan on December 29th of last year to discuss planned economic affairs in the Shanghai area with domestic government authorities. He arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo some days ago and plans to convene a joint meeting of the Chinese and Japanese Chambers of Commerce and Industry within the next few days. In addition to taking the opportunity to state national policies, he will strive to obtain the cooperation of Chinese business and industrial figures to promote the economic structure of the Far East region after China's participation in the war.

Shanghai as the Economic Center of East Asia

After returning to Shanghai from Japan, Mr. Takeuchi gave an interview to the press, saying that Shanghai's economic construction is a basic condition for comprehensive cooperation between China and Japan. Unless Shanghai can focus on economic construction to achieve full economic control of China, it will be difficult for Japan to gain the hearts of the Chinese people and there will be no way to consolidate cooperation between the two countries. Generally speaking, within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Tokyo is considered the center of politics and diplomacy, while the center of economy and finance must be Shanghai. Therefore, Chinese and Japanese business and industrial figures in Shanghai must first recognize the importance of Shanghai's position and the importance of their own mission, and be willing to work together to overcome the difficulties of the times.

Japanese Light Industry Plans to Move to Shanghai

Mr. Takeuchi continued, saying that during his recent return to Japan, he had discussions with government authorities. Based on his personal observations, relevant government and business figures generally believe that "rebuilding the Shanghai economy" is a necessary condition for resolving the China dispute. Currently, various Japanese light industrial factories are planning to move to Shanghai for new development in order to take on the mission of economic revival. In this way, Shanghai will become the center of light industry in East Asia, and the economic development of the city can be expected to undergo an epoch-making transformation. In addition, in view of the close relationship between Shanghai and Japan's nationwide mobilization economy, Shanghai's economic structure must be built on a permanent foundation.

### Demand Deposit Reserves to be Paid in Two Installments - Inspection of Bank Operations and Assets Proceeding Smoothly and Well

The Central Reserve Bank's Financial Affairs Inspection Office, in accordance with the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions, is conducting inspections of the operations, assets, and liabilities of various financial institutions. The work is proceeding very smoothly. Currently, monthly operating statements from various banks, money shops, and trust companies in the city have been submitted for inspection on schedule every month since September of last year, and the results are good. The organization of these financial institutions has become sound and their operations have returned to normal. Regarding the required reserve funds for term deposits and special demand deposits of various financial institutions, they have all been consolidated in accordance with the provisions of 5% or more of the total amount, and have been paid into reserve accounts opened with the Central Reserve Bank. As for the reserve fund of 10% or more for demand deposits, it will begin to be handled after the end of the lunar new year general closing accounts. It is heard that the inspection office, in order to consider the actual difficulties of various financial institutions, will handle the payment of demand deposit reserve funds in two installments.

### Bean Curd Industry Petitions Authorities to Continue Allotment of Soybeans - If the Industry is Forced to Shut Down, Thousands of Workers Will Be Destitute

Local bean curd industry is petitioning because the authorities have expanded the scope of food rationing to include beans, which are temporarily prohibited from moving until allotment. The industry's limited bean stocks will not be able to meet market demand, and it is on the verge of closing down. Yesterday, it specifically submitted documents to the Public Works Bureau and the Grain Military Allotment Group, stating: "To whom it may concern, now that the authorities have controlled beans and prohibited their movement, the black market has disappeared. However, your office has not yet provided any allotment, and we have no way to purchase beans at this time. We are forced to shut down, and dozens of workers will directly suffer the pain of unemployment. Approximately tens of thousands of people indirectly depend on this industry for their livelihood, and they will inevitably starve to death, which will have a huge impact on the livelihood of ordinary people. The members of our industry have come to the association one after another, asking for ways to provide relief. Therefore, we have specifically written to your office to ask how the allotment matters should be handled, and we request a prompt reply so that we can report it to the authorities for record."

### Restructuring of Da Zhonghua Match Company Completed - Capital of 10 Million Shared 40/60 Between China and Japan - List of Founders and Managers Released

Since its establishment, it has strived to use the simplest method to distribute the funds as early as possible. Because there are many schools and faculty and staff receiving relief funds, and many changes have occurred in the past six months, in order to make the distribution procedures as perfect as possible and avoid future disputes, the committee is carefully compiling statistics on the number of schools and faculty and staff. It is learned that the committee has stipulated the points that schools applying for relief funds should pay attention to, as well as the faculty and staff forms, and has sent them to each school for reference.

Yesterday, he specifically generously donated more than 4,700 yuan. Mr. Li Ji works in the financial sector, is enthusiastic about public welfare, and is fond of doing good deeds. He is especially willing to do his best to help poor students. This generous donation is most admirable. Moreover, his unwillingness to announce his surname further shows his sincerity in doing good.

We should make a correction and express our apologies.

Notification Slips - We Urge You to Fill Them Out and Submit Them

The number of students applying is as mentioned above. The This Newspaper Readers' Scholarship Committee deeply believes that the scholarship funds are insufficient, which will cause excellent students to be unable to complete their studies due to the limited amount of scholarships. Not only will the committee feel guilty that the matter has not been completed, but it will also be a loss for society that cannot be compensated. Now, a donation notification slip is listed on the left. It is hoped that readers, when they have a kind thought, will immediately fill it out, send it to this newspaper, and donate any amount of money, regardless of how much or little. The enthusiasm for doing good is the same. With the wide readership of this newspaper and the dense population of Shanghai, if everyone can happily donate ten yuan, a large sum of money can be quickly collected. Donating only requires donors to lift a finger, while the beneficiaries will have unlimited benefits. Also, yesterday, Mr. Zhu Guangchi of the paper industry and Mr. Yang Yuanchao filled out donation notification slips, and this newspaper sent staff to collect them, which was a very simple procedure.

### This Newspaper Readers' Scholarship - 4th Donation Notification Slip

### Public Men's Basketball Division A - Xingren Team Eight Wins and No Losses - Defeated Monocle Last Night

The All-Shanghai Public Basketball Tournament, jointly sponsored by the Shanghai Sports Association and the Chinese Youth Association, held three games last night at 10:00 PM in the Chinese Youth Gymnasium. The first game was a women's division game between the Friends Team and the Liu Lingsheng Team. The former had strong talent, and Deng Xiangchun, Huang Mingyuan, Liu Zhenbao, Yan Weiwen, and others were exceptionally active. The Liu Lingsheng Team was unable to withstand the attack, and the game became one-sided. As a result, the Friends Team defeated the Liu Lingsheng Team with a score of 42 to 9. The team has already achieved a record of two wins in two games in the first round. The championship seems all but assured. In the second game of the men's division A, Lianxing defeated Tongren with a score of 47 to 31. In the first half, the score was 22 to 16, with Lianxing in the lead. In another game, Xingren faced Monocle. The former had seven wins in seven games and harbored ambitions of winning the championship. The latter had also defeated strong teams such as Giant and Lianxing, and their momentum was strong. Therefore, the first half of the game was very tense. Xingren relied on the efforts of Lin Wanli, Zhuo Guorong, and others to take the lead with a score of 16 to 13. In the second half, Xingren had smooth sailing, and Monocle could not reverse the situation. When time was called, Xingren defeated Monocle with a score of 36 to 21. The current situation in men's division A is that Xingren is in the lead with eight wins in eight games. There are still two games remaining, against the Ice Team and the North Wind Team. Based on past results, Xingren's victory should be no problem. The Red Team is currently closely following with seven wins and one loss, and can be expected to take the runner-up position. There are three games tonight.

### Chinese Stocks Have Hidden Strength - More Up Than Down

Yesterday's Chinese stock market turned into a spinning state, the base was solid, most stocks rose and few fell back. The cash sellers were absorbed by new and old investments, there was hidden strength in buying momentum, and sentiment remained bullish. Demand for Nanyang Tobacco Company shares continued to increase, rising from 124 yuan to 7.5 yuan and then another 4 yuan on the day. Great China Match also rose to around 325 yuan.

Rongfeng Textile lacked buyers and plummeted to below 40 yuan of premium, as low as 35 yuan. When Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing saw high prices, sellers also rose, falling back to 18.25 yuan. Kaili Silk and Satin had few supplies with demand at 14 yuan. Great China Weaving once exceeded the 10 yuan mark but immediately fell back. In the end, it and Hongsheng made some progress. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory lacked momentum for a price pull, falling slightly by 2.5 yuan. Xinya rose to 25.25 yuan, but was pushed back to 24.5 yuan by sellers.

### High Interest Rates on Loans - Government Bonds Difficult to Improve

The government bond market remained sluggish yesterday. Initially, there was a slight rise, but then it fell again. Observing this situation, the various parties seemed to want to push up the price in order to find a clever way to sell them off. Since the implementation of control, the various parties have been under too much pressure from interest rates. It has been a long time, and as the end of the year approaches, those with expiring bonds who are urging redemption are flocking in. Moreover, with loan interest rates reaching 2.8%, the burden feels even more worrisome. It would be fortunate if it could stop above 50 yuan within the year. There are few days left, and there are fears that there will be more drastic changes within days. Yesterday's market price was 0.7 yuan for Class B, over 9 yuan for Class D, 0.3-0.4 yuan for Class E, and Class C once rose to 2.2 yuan, but then fell to 1.7 yuan, and finally to 1.7-1.8 yuan. At present, the only difficulty is the economic problem.

### Impressions on the Central Bank's Interbank Short-Term Lending

— Also Speaking of

The Shanghai financial market, since December 15th of last year, has shown a phenomenon of tight credit. In recent days, due to the approaching Lunar New Year, all industries are carrying out settlements, and credit has become even tighter. Now, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, in order to regulate the positions of various banks, has resolutely launched interbank short-term lending. The method is that various banks can borrow from the Central Bank by pledging the following items: (1) real estate within the Public or French Concession, (2) public bonds and treasury bills issued by the Joint Reserve Board, (3) non-speculative and non-essential goods, (4) valuable securities recognized by the Central Bank, etc., with a maximum term not exceeding three months.

This move by the Central Bank is indeed what a national bank should do to fulfill its mission. Because national banks in various countries enjoy special privileges such as issuing banknotes, managing national reserves, acting as treasury agents, managing national settlements, regulating interest rates, and buying and selling gold and silver, their financial strength is extremely strong. Whenever market changes occur and various industries urgently need cash, the national bank uses its strong funds to assist private banks through discounting or mortgage loans, indirectly benefiting industry and commerce. As for directly contacting the industrial and commercial sectors to engage in ordinary deposit and loan business, most of it has been undertaken by commercial banks, and national banks in various countries rarely take this as their business.

According to the current tight credit in Shanghai, if it is not regulated for a long time, the harm to finance and domestic industry and commerce will be significant. Firstly, if credit continues to tighten, the demand for cash will increase, and as a result, the long-disappeared practice of discounting bills will reappear today, making the unified financial system prone to disorder again. Secondly, various banks, considering the tightening of credit and the lack of their own positions, will inevitably try to recover the funds they previously lent to various manufacturers, and as a result, ordinary factories engaged in production will face financial difficulties, and factories will be forced to reduce or stop work. If this continues, the shortage of materials will inevitably worsen, and the rise in prices will become more severe, which will have an adverse impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, the Central Bank's interbank short-term lending this time is the most appropriate method to stabilize finance and assist industry and commerce. And the general large and small banks can also develop closer ties with the Central Bank through this lending, further prompting the Central Bank to become a bank of banks.

### Military Notes and Joint Reserve Notes Rise Together

Yesterday, military notes remained strong, with interbank trading at $5.558, soon falling back to $5.556, but still rising slightly. Small money shops and silver houses quoted $5.55 and $5.56 for buying and selling. Joint Reserve notes rose another 2 cents, with operators selling at $3.77 and buying at $3.7. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's overnight interest rate remained unchanged at 1.7 cents.

Yesterday morning, the cotton cloth market continued to show a potential for firmness, but transactions were quite thin. "Four Gentlemen" calico rose from $9.45 to $9.57, an increase of 1.5 cents. Peach blossom lady's colored cloth from Linbu was $390.

### Soap and Matches Reach Record High Prices

The market for daily necessities is rising steadily, and by the afternoon, soap prices were shockingly high, with new record highs emerging endlessly. Gu Ben soap continued to rise to $720, Bai Xiang Mao $650, Huang Xiang Mao soap $800, and Scissors soap $680, an increase of $20 to $30 from the previous day. Such high prices are staggering, causing the general public to be unable to bear the burden. The match market also experienced a sharp price increase. There were rumors of the reopening of the Zhong Fa warehouse, which made general cargo owners rejoice. Phoenix brand reached $4,000, Beautiful brand $4,200, Golden Tripod brand $3,500, and miscellaneous brands $2,400, an increase of about $500 from the previous day. Candle prices were too high, leading to weaker demand and lower prices. White Leith's ship brand was $560, Monk's Cap $480, and miscellaneous brands $320, remaining relatively flat.

### Hua Yuan Distributes Goods, Cigarette Price Increases Settled

The cigarette market price increase has stabilized, as some profit-takers seek to sell. Hua Yuan distributed goods to small dealers yesterday, so the market sentiment has stabilized slightly. British Brand was $11,800, Old Knife Brand $10,300, Pin Hai Brand $7,700, Five Hua Brand $6,800, Fairy Brand $7,900, Japanese Tobacco Golden Gun Brand $3,150, Red Rose $2,750, Golden Building $3,800, All Six Brand $3,550, Twenty Sticks $3,250, and Compass Brand $2,850. National Tobacco Pyramid was $6,300, Beautiful Brand $5,850, Golden Mouse Brand $4,200, White Golden Dragon $4,200, and Golden Dragon $3,250, all showing weakness. It is rumored that the ad valorem tax will be implemented soon, and prices may not fall.

### Soybean Cake Trading is Quiet

Yesterday's market for miscellaneous grains remained unusually quiet. Soybean cake trading was also quite flat, and the market lacked luster. Kai Yuan Long soybean cake was priced at $93.75 per car, and Yuan Ji soybean cake was priced at $87 for 500 pieces.

### This Batch of Sugar Will Be Moved Soon

According to sources at the Joint Venture Office, the allocation of this batch of sugar has been signed, and purchase certificates have been issued. Movement certificates will also be processed, and goods will be shipped soon to meet the needs of the Lunar New Year.

### Dried Shrimp Returns Firmly After Extreme Fatigue

Yantai dried shrimp has been in short supply recently. It is heard that the subsequent batch is difficult to arrive in Shanghai, so the trend has tightened. Yesterday, the market price was $2,500, an increase of $300 from the previous month.

### Tinplate is About to Run Out

Yesterday, there was a great deal of interest in 180-pound double-linked and 90-pound/100-pound single-linked small tinplate, but because the inventory of this product on the market is very thin, there has even been concern about running out recently. It is not easy for general factories in urgent need to find it, and some have switched to processing company iron, narrow iron, green lead iron, and black iron billets, etc. Unfortunately, the number of raw materials for the above-mentioned products is also exceptionally scarce, and the asking price is high, and people in the industry are unwilling to sell easily. Currently, 90-pound and 100-pound single-linked iron are priced at $1,200 per box, and 180-pound double-linked plates are priced at $2,400 per box, but very few transactions have been made at these prices.

### Third Place in the Essay Contest - My Plans for This Year

— Sun Choucheng

Time flies like a white colt glimpsed through a crack. The thirty-first year of the Republic of China has already passed, and the thirty-second year is about to begin. My age is only one year less than a complete cycle of sixty. Recalling the past fifty-eight years, I first diligently studied day and night when the imperial examinations had not yet been abolished, hoping to gain fame and fortune, but only achieved the status of a lower-level scholar. Then, I abandoned my pen for the army, studying military strategy to serve the country, but only led troops to attack Ning. Finally, I came to Shanghai to make a living, handling association affairs and writing articles, and another twenty-one years have passed in a flash. In between, I sometimes studied medicine, sometimes studied law, and sometimes taught in schools. In short, I studied both literature and martial arts, but achieved nothing. How ashamed I am! According to the old customs of our country, nearing the age of sixty, one can stay at home and enjoy a life of ease, no longer working. However, although I have three sons and one daughter, they are still in school. My family has no inheritance, and the eight members of my family rely entirely on my writing to make a living. Even if I want to rest, I am constrained by my family's circumstances and cannot. Fortunately, my spirit is still strong. Every day, the place where I work extends east to Jiangxi Road, south to Longmen Road, west to Jing'an Temple Road, and north to North Mud City Bridge. I walk everywhere without taking a car and feel no fatigue at all. After work, I still enjoy scribbling to write articles. Now that I see the topic of the essay contest in Shen Bao's Free Talk: "My Plans for This Year," I am reminded of the things I have done in the past, drifting with the current, without any pre-determined plans. Therefore, I have been like a wandering horse, doing many things but not specializing in any, wasting years, and my temples are already gray, but I still have no achievements to speak of. Now I plan to take this opportunity to define my plans for this year as follows:

(A) Regarding society, divided into the following four points:

(1) For the various associations I serve in, I shall arrive on time for the stipulated office hours every day to set an example.

(2) For the official documents handled, I shall determine the order of drafting, writing, and distributing according to the order of arrival and the urgency of the facts, and shall not delay.

(3) For charitable causes, although due to my circumstances, I cannot provide financial assistance, I should adhere to the principle of contributing money if I have it, and contributing effort if I have strength. I should do my best to help with errands, because in this extraordinary period, Shanghai urgently needs to provide relief to the refugees. While there are many who suffer from their own deeds, there are also those who have fallen due to natural disasters and human misfortunes. As descendants of the Yellow Emperor with the same round faces and square feet, we cannot turn a blind eye to their freezing and starving. Not only will the nation be affected, but if we ask ourselves, it is also inexcusable. Mencius said: "Compassion is in everyone's heart." Although I am not rich, I am still well-fed and clothed, which is ultimately more comfortable than them. When meeting people, I should speak out, and I should convey my ideas in writing. Whatever I can do within my power is what we poor scholars should do and should not give up.

(4) When discussing proposals at meetings, I should be calm and study the facts, not giving in to personal feelings. If something should be approved, I should remove any difficulties to ensure its establishment and passage. If something should be rejected, even if there are requests for help, I should reject them to ensure its rejection and cancellation.

(B) Regarding family, divided into the following five points:

(1) Regarding household expenses, although I adhere to the principle of living within my means, last year, due to the increase in prices, like a runaway horse, it went straight ahead, and I had to increase expenses monthly. However, although food prices rose, the quantity decreased, causing the children to fall ill due to malnutrition. The required medical expenses were very high and exceeded the budget, which seemed unworthy. Therefore, this year, I should strive to choose foods that are cheaper and definitely beneficial to health. Being skilled in selection means that vegetables are not always inferior to fish and meat.

(2) Regarding clothing, because my residence in the Soviet district was almost completely looted, all the clothes, large and small, had to be remade. Compared to the prices of clothing materials and tailoring a few years ago, the prices last year were vastly different. Everyone regretted not making them earlier when prices were lower, and blamed me for adopting a laissez-faire attitude and not adding more clothes earlier when prices were cheap. However, I think this is a special situation and not a lesson to be learned. This year, I should still adhere to the principle of saving where possible and should not make more useless and redundant clothes just because prices are rising, in order to avoid waste. In this environment, being able to have warm clothes is already not easy. We must take a step back and think about the refugees who are now sleeping on the sidewalks without clothes or food. A few years ago, some of them were eating delicacies and wearing silks and satins. Not disliking old and worn clothes is the beauty of Yu the Great and Zilu. We should always adhere to their teachings and dare not forget them, especially in the current extraordinary period.

(3) The children are young and live in prosperous Shanghai, only knowing the surface and not knowing the substance. What they hear and see is easily influenced by the environment. I plan to cut out and compile news reports about young people who are weak-willed or frequent dance halls or gamble, leading to debt and doing dishonorable things: such as gambling away public funds, falsely reporting robberies, conspiring to kill dancers and steal their jewelry, etc., and place them on the desk for them to read as novels, so that they can understand that prosperity and evil sound similar and have a related relationship, recognize the lessons of the past, and be cautious and tread carefully, knowing what to avoid and daring not to try.

(4) Although the children are studying at university, they are still studying English, mathematics, and various sciences, and their grades are good, but they lack knowledge of Chinese studies, which seems to be a shortcoming. They even do not understand the meaning of extremely common allusions, and their explanations are often wrong. Therefore, this year, I plan to take advantage of the holidays to explain Chinese studies to them, choosing the common knowledge necessary for life and what is used in social interactions, and explain the origin and meaning of these allusions in detail so that they will not be misused in the future and cause ridicule.

(5) Since the Ming Dynasty, my family has moved from Yunnan to He, and generations have been scholars, with the old saying of "twenty generations of fragrance." The wise words and deeds of our ancestors are detailed in the family genealogy, which should be firmly remembered and practiced by descendants. After the Taiping Rebellion, the family property was lost. Fortunately, this genealogy was preserved by our ancestor Xunzhi Gong. When I was young, my father, Libo Gong, would choose a time to explain it. Eight years ago, due to years of insect damage, it was re-copied into two volumes and given to close relatives to copy. There have been changes in these eight years, and the dates of all the newly deceased and newly born people have not been filled in. If we wait a few more years, it may be difficult to investigate. Therefore, this year, I plan to create a table and send letters to each branch of the family, asking them to fill in the details so that we can supplement the information. I plan to separately record the family instructions of all the ancestors and have the children read them reverently during each sacrificial period, so that they can be imprinted in their minds.

(C) Regarding personal matters, divided into the following four points:

(1) In recent years, being forced by the pressure of food and clothing, I have been involved in too many things, and it is inevitable that there will be negligence in handling matters. Starting this year, I plan to stipulate a fixed office time. For things that should be done, I will adhere to the principle of not postponing what should be done today until tomorrow, and I will carefully implement this to avoid omissions.

(2) Recently, because my brainpower is weaker, and I hear too many things, I tend to forget the things that friends ask me to do in a moment. This year, I plan to specially compile a book and carefully record everything in it, like the "Diligent Pen Avoids Thought" wooden plaque hung in old-fashioned shops. I will place it on my desk, flipping through it every day and processing things in order.

(3) Reviewing the old and learning the new should not be neglected. In recent years, being burdened with too many things, I have had no time to read books. I have only output and no input, and my talent is about to dry up. Starting this year, in addition to reading the newspaper every day, I will stipulate that I read a sentence of a book every day to increase my knowledge.

(4) My income is limited, but my social interactions are too many. This year, whenever relatives and friends send red and white invitations, I will stipulate that I send a congratulatory poem and a small mirror frame for happy events, and write an eulogy on jade paper for funerals, without mounting them, adhering to the five-word secret of "a light gift with heavy meaning."

The above are the main points of the plans I have made. After implementation, I will still record them in my diary every day for inspection. At the end of the year, I will then carefully review how much I have been able to accomplish to encourage myself. (Note: Mr. Sun is 59 years old and is the secretary of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association.)

### Priestley—Letters from World-Renowned Scientists

— Translated by Sincoln Scougte Gu Xin

Previous Cause: Joseph Priestley was a non-conformist preacher, scientist, and politician who did not believe in the Church of England. He was also a restless dissident in both chemical research and religion. This world-famous chemist, the discoverer of oxygen, nitrous oxide, and sulfur dioxide, often made things difficult for himself, not only for his unorthodox views but also for his courage to speak his mind.

Born in 1733, he lived in Birmingham. When Edmund Burke denounced "terror" in his "Reflections on the French Revolution," Priestley vehemently opposed him and was therefore regarded as a citizen of the French Republic. Ordinary 19th-century defenders of the faith in Birmingham were enraged by his heresies and burned his house and church to the ground. His laboratory was also destroyed, his library devastated, and many valuable and irreplaceable manuscripts were destroyed. After this shocking act of barbarism, Priestley wrote this letter to his Birmingham compatriots.

"...We are sheep, and you are wolves." Text: My former compatriots and neighbors,

I have lived with you for eleven years, during which you have all known my peaceful behavior. I have only quietly paid attention to my professional duties and philosophical duties. I never thought that I and my friends would suffer such damage from you. But you are mistaken. You have heard non-conformists, especially Unitarian Dissenters, constantly being ridiculed and treated as enemies of the current government in both church and state, so you thought that any damage to me would be a meritorious deed: I did not receive better notice in time to take any measures.

When the "purpose" is correct, you think the "means" are always correct. Due to the speeches of your teachers, the cries of your superiors, the confusion and curses directed at me (everyone knows these are their usual habits), your superstition was aroused to the highest degree, and no one said anything to you to reduce your enthusiasm. Everything only added fuel to the fire to ignite your enthusiasm: therefore, you did not think for yourselves, nor for those who should know everything and teach you well. You were prepared to commit all kinds of atrocities, and they should really know everything and teach you well. You thought that the resentment and damage you had done to us were to uphold the government, especially to uphold the church. You were also led to think that by "destroying" us, "you" would "definitely" perform the most practical "service" to "God" and your country.

Fortunately, the British psyche holds a fear of "murder," so I hope you did not think of "this." ... But if you exhaust all means to make life unbearable, what is the value of life? ...

You have destroyed the most valuable and useful instruments among philosophical instruments, instruments that no individual has in this country or any other country. When I used them, I spent a lot of money every year, without any monetary ideas, just to promote science for the benefit of my country and mankind. You also destroyed a library related to those instruments, and the books in this library cannot be repurchased with money except for a long time. But what I am especially saddened by is that you destroyed many "manuscripts," which are the result of many years of hard work, and which I can no longer rewrite; and the person who suffered this kind of evil deed is someone who has never done or imagined any harm to you. ...

If you imagine that your behavior has any effect on your motives, or can hinder our motives, you are even more wrong. There is nothing that can maintain any religious system except "reason" and "logic." Answer our arguments, and your business will succeed: but you resort to "violence," which only proves that you cannot do anything good. Even if you destroy me, and destroy my house, library, and instruments, then another ten people with the same spirit and ability, or even more outstanding people, will immediately rise up.

In this matter, we are sheep, and you are wolves. We want to preserve our integrity, and hope you will change your character. In any case, we want to repay evil with good: pray that you will soon return to that diligence and sobriety with which the residents of Birmingham are known.

I am your sincere and well-wishing person. J Priestley

July 19, 1791, in London.

Aftermath: Because of this disaster, Priestley left Birmingham and went to London. He lived there for three years, and then sailed to America. As soon as he arrived in New York, he received a warm welcome. After that, he wrote a history of the church, continued to conduct chemical experiments in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, and died there in 1804. In the middle of the eighteenth century, few Englishmen did more work for scientific progress. (End of this article)

### The Paragon of Teachers

— By James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

What they took back with them was also a memory of a beautiful woman who received them and spoke to them, because several years later, during the First European War, one day, in a large military camp near Brockfield, a soldier came to visit Chips, saying that he was one of the players who first came to compete in football. Chips invited him for tea and chatted with him. Later, when shaking hands to say goodbye, this person said, "How is your wife, sir? I remember her very well."

"Really?" Chips replied enthusiastically. "You really remember her?"

"Of course? I think everyone does."

Chips replied: "They don't, you know. At least, not here. Students come and go, always new faces: memories don't last long. Even the teachers don't stay forever. Since last year—after old Gribble—he was the school's food manager—none of the people here have seen my wife. You know, she died less than a year after you came. In 1898."

"I was truly saddened to hear that, sir. At least two or three people in our team remember her very clearly, even though we only saw her that once. Yes, we remember her, that's right."

"I'm very glad. ... That was the happiest day for all of us—and it was a wonderful game."

"One of the happiest days of my life. I'd rather have those days than these days—that's what I think. I'm going to France tomorrow."

About a month later, Chips heard that this person had died in the Battle of Passchendaele.

Now, the situation is like a warm and vivid period in his life, radiating a glow, burning hotly in thousands of memories. The school bell has become a roll call bell, and the glow in Mrs. Wicket's house brings back those memories to him in a cloud of fog—Caterall walks along the stone cloister, ridiculing him for some "big mistake" in a paper he has corrected, taking the cello part from a Mozart trio for use in the school's music club, her creamy arms sweeping across the brown light of the cello.

### Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association Actively Designs Relief Work

The internal organization of the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association, in addition to the Executive and Supervisory Committee and the Standing Committee, also has a Design Committee, which designs relief work; a Review Committee, which reviews the use of donations; and a Custody Committee, which manages donations. All are enthusiastic public-spirited people from all walks of life. Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, the Design Committee held a meeting on the fourth floor of the Bank Association on Yihang Road. More than 20 people attended, including Chairman Xiang Kangyuan, Vice Chairman Chen Binhe, and Committee Members Wang Shuxian and Cai Renbao. It was resolved that there are many relief design matters, and the original regulations will still be followed to actively subsidize various charitable organizations to carry out work such as porridge distribution, clothing distribution, orphan education, disabled person care, medical treatment, and music therapy. However, thorough investigations and detailed statistics must be made, and the priority of relief matters must be distinguished, and concrete plans must be made. In addition, it is also planned to hold temporary porridge coupon distributions. The issue of donations has also been decided. The donations currently received are still far from the original target of 5 million yuan, and the distribution is really difficult to cover. All associations that have pledged donations must quickly urge payment so that they can be distributed to various charitable organizations as soon as possible, because the cold and hungry refugees in the middle of winter are waiting for relief urgently. For groups or enthusiastic people in society who have not yet pledged donations, fundraising will continue. The discussion adjourned at 6:45 pm.

### Mr. Wu Jiliang Donates Clothing

Yesterday, we received a letter from reader Mr. Wu Jigen stating: "I, being mindful of the harsh winter and the pitiful plight of orphaned and hungry children on the streets, and motivated by a sense of human compassion, have saved from my own meals to purchase four sets of children's cotton clothing. However, recognizing my limited resources and fearing the difficulty of managing charitable distribution, lest these clothes be resold by the recipients, thus betraying my original intention, I have enclosed four clothing vouchers, earnestly requesting your discretion in distributing them." (Editor's note: Besides expressing our gratitude to Mr. Wu, we will carefully select those in need for distribution.)

### Report on Famine Relief Funds

Mr. Zhang Junsheng: 100 yuan
Mr. Chen Yangzuo: 40 yuan
Yuan Ji: 20 yuan

Previous Balance: 13,743 yuan

Final Balance: 13,903 yuan

### Zhengzhong Girls' School Offers Reduced-Fee Studentships

Zhengzhong Girls' Middle School, located at 167 Da Tong Road, in consideration of the financial burden on students' parents, provides half-fee and full-fee scholarships for young women from truly impoverished families who are determined to advance their education. There are five studentships available in each grade from Junior Middle School Year 1 to Senior Middle School Year 3, totaling sixty studentships. For those with outstanding academic and conduct records, there are also scholarship opportunities, awarding a quarter to the full amount of tuition. Each semester, there are more than twenty such awards. This is truly good news for those who are ambitious. The enrollment date is the 22nd of this month.
