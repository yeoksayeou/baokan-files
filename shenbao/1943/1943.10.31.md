### Sino-Japanese Alliance and Overall Peace

On January 9th of this year, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, aiming to cooperate with Japan in eliminating the remaining forces of Britain and the United States and achieving the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Following this, Japan took the lead in advocating the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and gradually implemented them. This has brought Sino-Japanese relations into an even closer stage.

At the same time, in order to fulfill its commitment to assisting the freedom and liberation of various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, Japan successively promoted the independence of Burma and the Philippines, the establishment of the Provisional Government of India, and the removal of military administration in Malaya and Java, granting political participation opportunities to the indigenous people, thereby moving various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia further towards unity and co-prosperity.

On the one hand, due to the progress and establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and on the other hand, due to the deeper closeness of Sino-Japanese relations, from the nurturing of these two environments, it was naturally necessary to revise the previous Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty. Therefore, the signing of this time's Alliance Treaty is inevitably a result of objective circumstances.

The difference in significance between this Alliance Treaty and the previous Basic Relations Treaty lies in the fact that the former is due to the current Sino-Japanese cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, which has reached a point of sharing weal and woe and being as close as lips and teeth; while the latter only attempted to end the Sino-Japanese War, return to peace, and gradually adjust diplomatic relations. Therefore, there were various constraints in the Basic Relations Treaty and its annexes. Now, the Alliance Treaty not only abolishes all kinds of constraints but also abandons the right to station troops under the Boxer Protocol of forty years ago. This kind of moral concession requires us to once again recognize Japan's sincerity in seeking amity and cooperation with China. Unless one is stubborn and unyielding, those with preconceived notions should have a renewed understanding.

Looking at the content of the Alliance Treaty as a whole, it is no exaggeration to say that it aims for justice and equality. The original aim of the Chinese National Revolution was to strive for freedom and equality. Dr. Sun Yat-sen stated in his will: "Recently, the advocacy of convening a national conference and abolishing unequal treaties must be realized in the shortest possible time." For twenty years, the Chinese people have been seeking the abolition of unequal treaties day and night, but it was not easy to achieve. It was not until recently when our allied nation Japan returned concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights, that various countries echoed and implemented them. From then on, the unequal treaties that bound China were all abolished. Dr. Sun's earnest exhortations, although not realized in the shortest possible time, have finally been realized.

We believe that from the perspective of our ally, Japan, the goal of revising the treaty is to address the whole of China, therefore, we in China should also accept it from a holistic perspective. Fulfilling the treaty is of course the obligation of both parties, but we know that the purpose of the Alliance Treaty is to cooperate in winning the Greater East Asia War; and realizing comprehensive peace between China and Japan is undoubtedly a guarantee of strengthening the power to win the victory, therefore, how to achieve comprehensive peace between China and Japan is an urgent task. However, comprehensive peace can definitely not be promoted by Japan alone. We have always advocated that only by bringing politics in the peace zone onto the right track, establishing security, and stabilizing the people's livelihood, can we use these facts to win over the people under the rule of Chongqing, so that they will gladly return. In this way, the Chongqing regime will inevitably become an empty shell that has lost the hearts of the people and will definitely be unable to exist. Conversely, if we do not strive to win the hearts of the people, but want to complete comprehensive peace by negotiating with the Chongqing regime, it can be said that we are abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial.

### Cooperating in Building Greater East Asia, China and Japan Conclude Alliance Treaty; Troops Will Be Withdrawn When Comprehensive Peace is Restored

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – China and Japan signed an alliance treaty in Nanjing on the 30th, marking a new stage in the relations between the two countries. The relationship between China and Japan in the past three years has transformed from hostility to friendship with the Basic Treaty signed in November of the 29th year of the Republic of China. By December of the 30th year of the Republic of China, the Greater East Asia War broke out, and our Chairman Wang declared that he would share weal and woe with our friendly nation Japan and cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. On January 9th of this year, our country declared war on Britain and the United States, stating that in order to revive China and defend East Asia, we were determined to live and die with Japan. At the same time, Japan also declared its assistance to China in achieving autonomy and independence, and subsequently returned concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights, implementing a series of measures to assist China in achieving autonomy and independence. Today's situation in East Asia is different from that of three years ago. Sino-Japanese relations have also advanced to the realm of shared destiny, thus the Basic Treaty that formerly regulated Sino-Japanese relations was abolished due to the changes of the times. The conclusion of a new alliance treaty is indeed an inevitable trend of history. The establishment of this China-Japan alliance treaty will not only enable China to restore its sovereignty, but also make a great contribution to the construction of the entire Greater East Asia. The joint communique of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Propaganda is recorded below.

October 30th, 11:00 AM, Joint Communique of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Propaganda: At 10:00 AM today, Wang, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and Tani Masayuki, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Empire of Japan, signed the Alliance Treaty between the Republic of China and Japan and the related protocols, and exchanged official documents, which were completed at 10:40 AM. The full text is recorded below:

### Capital Citizens' Celebration Rally; Full Text of Chairman Wang's Address

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – At 10:00 AM today, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was concluded. At 11:00 AM, after the Ministry of Propaganda officially announced it, Chairman Wang personally attended the Capital Citizens and Youth Celebration Rally for the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and delivered an address. The full text is as follows:

A New Era Opens in Sino-Japanese Relations

The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has been signed today, marking the opening of a new era in Sino-Japanese relations and a new era in East Asia. From now on, China and Japan will stand on a completely equal and mutually beneficial footing and form a permanent friendly relationship to jointly devote themselves to the construction of Greater East Asia. The relationship between China and Japan, between nations and ethnicities, has lasted for more than two thousand years. During these two thousand years, there have been conflicts for a very small amount of time, only a few years to a dozen years, which is less than one percent. The remaining ninety-nine percent of the time has been peaceful. However, this is the first time that a treaty that completely bases itself on the Eastern spirit of morality and stipulates the friendly relations between the two countries has been established. This completely sweeps away the traces of the unequal treaties that China has suffered for a hundred years and completely restores the original face of our East Asian compatriots. From now on, the friendly relations between China and Japan will become stronger day by day, and the construction of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be expanded day by day.

Basic Relations Treaty Expires

Comparing this time's Alliance Treaty with the Basic Relations Treaty signed on November 30, 1940, we can see great differences. The biggest differences are two points: The first point is that the anti-communist stationing of troops in Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Basic Relations Treaty, the security stationing of troops in Article 4, and the stationing of troops "based on past practice" in Article 5 are completely abolished. In addition, Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Supplementary Protocol this time declares the abandonment of "all rights to station troops under the Beijing Protocol of the Boxer Rebellion and its related documents." Because this is a particularly detailed provision regarding the right to station troops, this special declaration is made. In addition, Article 3 of the Supplementary Protocol when the Basic Relations Treaty was signed stipulates that "Japanese troops, except for those stationed in accordance with the Basic Relations Treaty between the Republic of China and Japan signed today, and the existing agreements between the two countries, shall begin to withdraw their troops when the state of comprehensive peace and war between the two countries ends. The withdrawal of troops shall be completed within two years after security is established. The government of the Republic of China shall guarantee the establishment of security during this period." Article 1 of the Supplementary Protocol this time stipulates that "the Empire of Japan promises to withdraw its troops stationed in the territory of the Republic of China when the state of comprehensive peace and war between the two countries ends," completely abolishing the attached period and conditions this time (continued on the second page).

### Exchange of Notes

### Spare No Effort to Support and Promote the Construction of a New China: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Delivers Important Statement

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement regarding the signing of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty on the 30th, stating: "The conclusion of the Alliance Treaty between China and Japan today establishes a foundation for a new relationship between China and Japan, which is truly cause for celebration for both China and Japan. At the same time, the construction of Greater East Asia has taken another step forward, which is of great significance. The Empire has long desired that all countries in Greater East Asia respect each other's self-determination and independence, cooperate closely in the construction of Greater East Asia, and base themselves on a moral order of co-existence and co-prosperity, so as to contribute to the peace of the world. However, the ambition of the British and American empires to dominate Asia and their plot to sow discord among the East Asian nations have obstructed the realization of this ideal. In order to crush the ambitions of Britain and the United States and seek self-preservation and self-defense, the Empire resolutely took up arms. Recently, with the sincere cooperation of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia and with firm determination, we have been advancing towards the completion of the war goals and the construction of Greater East Asia. The relationship between China, Japan, and Manchukuo has become even closer, and the friendly relations between Japan and Thailand have also been enhanced. In addition, Burma and the Philippines have successively gained independence, so the old order of Britain and the United States has been expelled from Greater East Asia, and the great cause of reviving Greater East Asia is advancing steadily. At the beginning of this year, the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States, stating its determination to live and die with the Empire and jointly complete the war. The Empire expects to promote the healthy development of both countries based on the fundamental spirit of Sino-Japanese cooperation, hopes for China's autonomy and independence, and exerts political force to construct a new China. It also decided to return all the Empire's exclusive concessions in China, recognize China's recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Beijing Legation Quarter, implement the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and take various goodwill measures. All of the above have been completely new. At the same time, the more the Republic of China promotes the construction of a new China, the more it will gain the fruits of cooperative warfare. The smooth progress of Sino-Japanese relations has continued to this day. Today, we have fundamentally revised the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and concluded the Alliance Treaty. I believe that this Alliance Treaty is adapted to the new situation in Greater East Asia and stipulates the inherent relationship between China and Japan. The great war goals and the belief in victory have enabled the conclusion of this treaty. From now on, the Empire will spare no effort to provide all possible support to promote the construction of a new China, based on the fundamental spirit of this treaty, so that China and Japan can advance together to complete the Greater East Asia War and construct a new order in Greater East Asia."

Remarks by Toyama Mitsuru

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Japanese notable Toyama Mitsuru made the following remarks at his private residence regarding the conclusion of the Alliance Treaty between China and Japan: "Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China, was determined to drive out British forces from various regions of East Asia as soon as possible and build a complete East Asia, so that China could stand on the world stage. Now, as the ten hundred million people of East Asia unite and cooperate to advance the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, there is indeed no reason for the opposing side to object. Anyone may have emotional misunderstandings, so I hope the opposing side will quickly wake up and plan for the great cause of standing on the world stage. This great plan has now entered the right track, so from now on, we can only resolutely implement this goal. This time's Sino-Japanese alliance is the same as what Dr. Sun Yat-sen said before, so from now on, the people of China and Japan should sincerely and earnestly work together to annihilate Britain and the United States and then stop.

### Ambassador Tani and President Wang Deliver Speeches One After the Other

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to China Tani Masayuki delivered the following full text of his speech at the ceremony for the signing of the Alliance Treaty between China and Japan:

"Today, I am most pleased to sign with Your Excellency the Alliance Treaty between the Republic of China and Japan, which stipulates the permanent friendly relationship between China and Japan and the close cooperation for the construction of Greater East Asia, as well as the Supplementary Protocol, and to sign and exchange official documents.

Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the situation in East Asia has changed dramatically. China and Japan are not only no longer taken advantage of by third countries to engage in fraternal strife, but also cooperate with each other and return to the original relationship that should be followed on the path to coexistence and co-prosperity. This is truly a major turning point in Asian history. In order to adapt to this new situation, contribute to the integrity of the Republic of China's autonomy and independence, and promote its revival and prosperity, the Empire has decided to make efforts together with the two countries standing on the same position, so as to achieve the great cause of building Greater East Asia as a fundamental policy. Since the beginning of this year, we have been working hard to achieve its concrete realization. This Alliance Treaty is also a manifestation of the new relationship between China and Japan in the most solemn form. Therefore, I believe that the aforementioned fundamental policy of the Empire and the firm determination of the Empire to implement this policy can be fully expressed.

Due to the signing of this Alliance Treaty, the Basic Relations Treaty between the Republic of China and Japan, signed on November 30, 1940, and its accompanying documents, have all lost their validity. From now on, the basic relationship between China and Japan will be based on the provisions of this Alliance Treaty. Therefore, this treaty can be said to have epoch-making significance for realizing the new situation in Greater East Asia and the new relationship between China and Japan. The joint declaration of China and Japan on January 9 clearly stated the cooperative relationship between China and Japan in carrying out the Greater East Asia War. Now that we have concluded an alliance treaty that permanently and fundamentally regulates the relationship between the two countries, the two countries will surely have a great development unprecedented in history.

The great significance of this Alliance Treaty and its accompanying documents has been described above. It goes without saying that its brilliance will be further enhanced when comprehensive peace is restored in the Republic of China in the future. I am even more convinced that the people of the Republic of China will do their utmost to return to their original state and work together with the Empire in the great cause of Asia. The Empire will undoubtedly continue to make unremitting efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War with a sure-win attitude. There is no doubt that this common cause of China will gain epoch-making progress with the conclusion of this treaty. I sincerely hope that the Republic of China and the Empire can thoroughly understand the true essence of this Alliance Treaty, so as to strive for the construction of Greater East Asia and ensure stability, and promote the world historical significance of this Alliance Treaty. Today, at the signing ceremony of this historical treaty, I would like to briefly state my feelings as a tribute."

President Wang's Reply After Ambassador Tani's speech, President Wang replied:

"Today, Your Excellency and I signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and its Supplementary Protocol and exchanged official documents. I offer my deepest congratulations for the future of the permanent friendly relations between China and Japan and for the future of the construction of Greater East Asia.

I am deeply impressed by Ambassador's high-minded remarks. As Your Excellency said, the signing of this Alliance Treaty has epoch-making significance. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, your country has exerted its national strength to eliminate the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia, and at the same time, it has proclaimed the great meaning of East Asian co-prosperity and united the countries and ethnic groups of East Asia to work together to achieve the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the realization of Greater East Asian co-prosperity.

Our country and your country are originally fraternal countries. Your country has opened up a bright future for Greater East Asia. The National Government and people of our country are also working hard to share the responsibility for the construction of Greater East Asia. On January 9 this year, our country and your country issued a joint declaration, clearly stating our unwavering determination and belief to fully cooperate in military, political, and economic affairs to complete the common war against Britain and the United States.

Today, with the establishment of the Alliance Treaty and the exchange of documents in the Supplementary Protocol, the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty signed on November 30, 1940, and all its attached documents, have lost their effect. The National Government and people of our country deeply understand your country's kindness in assisting our country to complete its independence and autonomy, so that our country can further engage in restoration and make its national strength and people's strength more abundant, and our cooperation in the Greater East Asia War can be more freely exerted.

I firmly believe that from now on, the foundation of the permanent friendly relations between China and Japan will be strong and unshakable, and will continue to grow. I also deeply hope that the overall peace within China will be restored, which will accelerate its pace and lead to success. This Alliance Treaty has achieved extremely great achievements in Sino-Japanese friendship and in the Eastern spirit of righteousness. The National Government and the people can only fulfill the treaty with the most sincere and enthusiastic spirit, so as not to let down your country's kindness.

Your Excellency, since the beginning of the negotiations on the revision of the treaty, has used profound sympathy and far-sighted vision for the future of China, Japan, and Greater East Asia...[To complete this glorious mission, the enemy pays tribute to his admiration.]"

### Japanese Government Issues Statement

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) Following the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the Japanese government issued the following statement: The Imperial Government, on this 30th day, entered into the "Alliance Treaty between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China" with the government of the Republic of China. Upon the conclusion of this treaty, the "Basic Treaty Regarding Relations between Japan and the Republic of China" and its affiliated documents shall immediately lose their effect. The treaty relationship between China and Japan has thus seen an epoch-making development. The Imperial Government previously issued a statement on January 9 of this year, clarifying the Empire's policy towards China adapting to the new situation after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Empire has been implementing the matters specified in that statement. Currently, we are actively providing assistance for the rapid construction of a new China based on the autonomy and independence of China and the exertion of the political power of the National Government. At the same time, the National Government is responding to the policies of the Japanese government, striving for self-strengthening, and enhancing cooperation in the war. The new relationship between China and Japan is thus developing smoothly.

However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the situation in Greater East Asia has changed accordingly. When this war broke out, the United Kingdom and the United States engaged in many interventions in Greater East Asia. The Empire had to consider the brutal facts of the United Kingdom and the United States when concluding the Sino-Japanese Treaty. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, British and American forces have been driven out of Greater East Asia, and the National Government has also declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States. The two countries of China and Japan have removed all obstacles of the past and returned to the original state of friendly neighborliness. Now, in order to jointly ensure the stability of Greater East Asia and seek its revival, we aim to achieve the common mission of the two countries. Regarding the treaty relationship, it has been jointly recognized that there is a need to adapt it to the new situation and adjust it. This is the reason for the eventual conclusion of this new treaty.

The Empire has previously established close cooperative relations with Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, and other countries based on morality. Now, we are establishing a new foundation for cooperation between the Republic of China and Japan, ensuring a new order of coexistence and co-prosperity for the countries of Greater East Asia, which is progressing steadily. Here, the Imperial Government, in addition to expecting that the relations between the two countries will have an epoch-making development based on the fundamental spirit of the new Sino-Japanese Treaty, will spare no effort to provide all assistance for the completion of the autonomy and independence of the Republic of China, in order to jointly move towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia. I hereby declare to China and foreign countries what the Imperial Government believes.

### Chairman Wang's Broadcast Last Night to Help the Public Understand the True Meaning of the Alliance

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) China and Japan signed the Alliance Treaty on the 30th, from which the two countries formed a permanent friendly relationship, closely cooperating in the construction of Greater East Asia. Its significance is extremely important. In order to enable the national public to thoroughly understand the true meaning of the alliance, Chairman Wang made a national broadcast at 9:30 PM on the 30th, explaining the contents of the alliance. In the end, he encouraged the people of the country to advance bravely with a spirit of enduring hardship and to make persistent efforts to complete the mission of restoring and revitalizing China and defending East Asia. His words were extremely refined and earnest. After listening respectfully to the leader's instructions on the radio, the national public was extremely moved, and it was not until 10:45 PM that the broadcast ended.

### Ambassador Gu's Thoughts on the Japanese Reporters

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) After the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Gu Zhengzhi, met with the Japanese reporter group at 3:00 PM on the 30th and said as follows: The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was concluded by the people of China and Japan in a state of shared consciousness, without any interference from third parties, and with the same intentions. Today, during the signing ceremony, recalling General Abe and others who had devoted their efforts to the conclusion of the Basic Treaty, it is further understood that the satisfactory completion of the Basic Treaty in the complicated national defense relationship is the foundation for the conclusion of the alliance this time. This treaty can be said to be immeasurable. This is not a legal opposition like Anglo-American treaties, but a relationship of moral trust, so it will surely increase the extraordinary power of East Asia. As for how significant an impact this treaty will have, there is no need for us to elaborate. I feel like seeing the sun shining, and there is no need to ask whether the mountains, trees, and plants will benefit from it. In addition, due to the establishment of the new treaty, the organization and staffing of the embassy may undergo appropriate reforms, which is uncertain. However, from now on, we will naturally engage in everything based on new concepts. In short, in the development of the Greater East Asia War, the relationship between China and Japan today not only conforms to the principles of morality but has also clarified to the world that the term "alliance" in the treaty has confirmed that China and Japan in Greater East Asia are permanently friendly allies. Furthermore, the term "alliance" actually expresses the beauty of a blood alliance.

### Section 1.3 and the West Shanghai Police Bureau to Formally Merge Tomorrow: Summary of Measures

The First, Third, and West Shanghai Police Bureaus of this city, in order to complete the unification of police administration in Greater Shanghai, have decided to formally merge starting from the 1st of next month. The Third and West Shanghai Police Bureaus will be abolished from the 1st, and their respective sub-bureaus will be directly under the jurisdiction of the First Police Bureau. As for the summary of the merger, measures have also been stipulated, which were announced by the First Police Bureau in Police Order No. 1015 the other day. The original text is transcribed below:

Following the order of the Municipal Government: Effective November 1st, the Third Police Bureau and the West Shanghai Police Bureau will be abolished, and their respective sub-bureaus will be directly under the jurisdiction of the First Police Bureau. Now, the following measures are stipulated in accordance with the summary of the merger: Regarding the reorganization of personnel after the abolition of the two bureaus, it should be implemented in accordance with the following plan. For the sake of handling unfinished matters, an office will be established in each of the Third Police Bureau and the Fourth West Shanghai Police Bureau, named "Dispatch Office of the First Police Bureau" and "West Shanghai Office of the First Police Bureau." The personnel required for this office will only be from the remaining or dispatched personnel of each office, and no office director should be appointed. The deadline is the end of November. The Central Sub-bureau will be relocated to the McTyeire Road Sub-bureau, and the McTyeire Road Sub-bureau and the Xiaodongmen Sub-bureau will be abolished, and the Huangpu Sub-bureau will be newly established to administer the Central Sub-bureau and half of the McTyeire Road Sub-bureau area (east of Route Tenant de Mayran) and the Xiaodongmen area. The Central Sub-bureau should relocate to the McTyeire Road Sub-bureau as soon as possible starting from November 1st and form the Huangpu Sub-bureau. The organizational matters of the Huangpu Sub-bureau should be handled according to a separate plan. The remaining half of the McTyeire Road Sub-bureau area should be under the jurisdiction of the Avenue Joffre Sub-bureau on October 30th. The Xiaodongmen Sub-bureau will be renamed the Xiaodongmen Police Station of the Huangpu Sub-bureau starting from November 1st. The McTyeire Road Sub-bureau director should calculate the number of personnel in the four districts within Route Tenant de Mayran (excluding Route Tenant de Mayran) in advance and assign them to the Avenue Joffre Sub-bureau and the Fourth Pre-prepared Team of the McTyeire Road Sub-bureau on October 31st. Once the designated lodging is fully prepared, it should be discussed and incorporated immediately. After the West Shanghai Police Bureau is abolished, the First and Second Sub-bureaus will be merged into the Huashan Road Sub-bureau, located at the former site of the West Shanghai Police Bureau. The Third and Fourth Sub-bureaus will be merged into the Changning Road Sub-bureau, located at the former site of the Third Sub-bureau. The director of the Fourth West Shanghai Police Bureau should carry out the reorganization matters according to a separate plan on October 30th. The expenses for the relocation should be negotiated between the First and Third Police Bureaus and the Finance Department of the Public Works Bureau in the district. Other matters will be announced separately."

Commissioner Tojo Speaks

Deputy Commissioner Tojo of the First and Third Police Bureaus stated when interviewed by a reporter from The Times yesterday: The First, Third Police Bureaus, and the former Fourth West Shanghai Police Force will be merged on November 1st. However, the police system of the First and Eighth districts in the former concession era each had different foreign colors, especially the former French Concession, which was very similar to the French army system. In any case, today we will gradually replace it with a police system based on the Chinese government under the same ruling order. Regarding the resistance of personnel in each police district to orders issued under the new system, it will be prevented, but the advantages of the foreign system will still be retained, such as the system of the complaint room, which is one of them. Regarding the number of police officers, Mr. Tojo said that it is more than sufficient to cope with the situation. For example, Tokyo has a population of seven million, but the number of police officers is only 16,000. Based on this ratio, the police force in this city should be stronger than theirs.

### Alleviate Coal Ball Panic: Hoping to Raise Remedial Measures to Reduce the Burden on People's Lives and Alleviate the City

Coal balls, an indispensable item for cooking for residents, are currently in very short supply. It is not easy for residents to buy even a small amount of coal balls. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited various merchants selling coal balls. All the merchants, in order to meet the needs of retail sales, dispatched personnel late at night or overnight, carrying containers, to the manufacturers of waste products traded in the market, waiting to obtain coal residue from vehicles the next day. The amount of coal balls produced was only a few loads, or four or five loads at most. However, residents were already lining up in front of the store, and although they were limited to purchasing five yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes per person, the quantity was insufficient and quickly bought up. Residents, unable to purchase sufficient coal balls, tried various methods, resulting in a black market "trade." If this situation continues for a long time, it will not only hinder the people's livelihood but also affect the overall public security of society. We sincerely hope that the relevant authorities will adhere to their original intention and quickly devise remedial measures to immediately clarify this kind of illegal situation. Three Major Causes of Current Shortage

According to another source yesterday, there are approximately three major causes for the current shortage of coal balls: Manufacturers, citing high costs, requested a slight increase in the selling price, which was ultimately rejected by the authorities, thus reducing production. Distributors, due to the limited supply of coal residue obtained by vehicles and the high demand, and because the fixed profit was insufficient to cover expenses, sold on the black market to obtain illegal profits. The source of coal residue has slightly decreased, and the authorities are in the process of reorganizing the distribution mechanism, so the raw materials obtained by each factory are not as sufficient as in the past.

### Commentary: Employment Agencies

The previous discussion of the misery of unemployment is because increasing production depends on the simultaneous concentration of human and material resources. While the nation loudly calls for increased production, it cannot stand idly by and watch the unemployment of its people. Therefore, it is necessary to provide vigorous assistance to employment agencies and establish them widely. This can alleviate some of the severity of unemployment and solve some of the economic problems of the whole community.

Before, the city's employment agencies included the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute attached to the China Vocational Education Society, the Vocational Guidance Department of the YMCA, and the Vocational Introduction Section of the Chinese Students' Association of the World. These were all run by private organizations and had achieved considerable success. However, they were unfortunately suspended one after another due to financial constraints. Since the Greater East Asia War, the municipal authorities, recognizing the importance of the employment service, have actively shouldered the responsibility through the Social Welfare Bureau of the First District Public Office in order to solve the pain of unemployment for citizens, which is gratifying.

Allied Japan has a well-developed employment service and has achieved considerable success, which can be learned from. Other countries in the world are also paying attention to promoting it. China has been slow to implement it, and the public lacks understanding of it, so the process of development is slow. In the future, we should pay attention to guidance and strive for universal understanding. Contact with the industrial and commercial sectors is also essential. We must also change the traditional system of only using personal connections in the past and be able to select real talents, so that individuals and careers can benefit, in order to achieve the goal of matching the right person with the right job.

Under the current wartime system, it is necessary to concentrate all efforts to develop production. The issue of talent cannot be ignored. Universally solving unemployment and fairly selecting talents depend on the large-scale establishment of public employment agencies. It is hoped that all parties will do their best to advocate, promote, and develop such an enterprise for the welfare of the country and society.

### Tenth Period of the Month Completed

Today is the tenth period of the month for industry and commerce. Various firms in the banking and finance industries are handling maturing loans and new long-term credit loans separately under the principle of practical financial tightening. It has been completed as of yesterday. It is reported that the collection of credit loans maturing in the tenth period of the month is quite good, ranging from one month to six months. In addition, the interest rate for new loan agreements is renegotiated to be increased. It is said that the repayment rate for maturing loans is about 70%, while the accommodation extension rate is only 20% to 30%. Various firms granting credit loans still grant loans appropriately, but the application must be for a sufficient purpose and have reliable guarantors, and it is limited to those who develop production. Although the interest rate is determined by the market, it is generally about 30 yuan per month. It is said that the number of new loans concluded is not small. Today is Sunday, and various firms are closed as usual. All the procedures that should be handled for the tenth period of the month were completed yesterday.

### Trends in Chinese Stocks

### Interest-Free Discount of Yarn and Cloth Orders Should Be Handled Through Negotiation Between Both Parties

The National Commercial Control Association previously received reports from the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth No. Bank and Industry Associations, stating that since the National Government ordered the purchase of yarn and cloth materials, various yarn and cloth merchants had no cash reserves, and the banks immediately stopped granting credit. As a result, the number of banks forced loan repayment, and internal operating expenses were strained. The economic difficulties encountered were urgent. Furthermore, the salaries of various employees were used to support their families, totaling hundreds of thousands of people. Since there was no cash to pay them, the public was panicked and unable to resolve the current difficulties. They requested the Commercial Control Association to urgently seek relief from the Executive Yuan, and to approve interest-free discount of the special fixed-term deposit slips for the purchase of yarn and cloth, in order to maintain livelihoods. The Commercial Control Association forwarded the request to the Executive Yuan for review. It has recently been learned from reporters that the association has received instructions from the Executive Yuan, stating: "The loan discount granted by banks to cloth firms is based on the contract signed by both parties. The request to approve interest-free discount of the special fixed-term deposit slips for the purchase of yarn and cloth should still be handled through negotiation between both parties. The instructions should be forwarded for notification." After the Commercial Control Association issued the order, it was learned that it has been forwarded to the relevant associations and banking industry associations.

It is also reported that the special fixed-term deposit slips issued for the purchase of yarn and cloth have been approved by the Executive Yuan, with September 6th as the starting date.

### National Capital Rally: Chairman Wang's Address

Continued from the first page

The second point is Article 6, Section 2 of the Japan-China Basic Relations Treaty, which contains the words "North China and Jiang...", and the third section also has the same words, as well as the words "Lower Yangtze Region," which easily gives people the feeling that there are special zones within Chinese territory, and makes them feel that not only in the economic aspect, but also in the political and military aspects, there is a risk of division and disunity. Now, Article 3 of the Alliance Treaty completely eliminates this worry about special zones. The first point concerns China's freedom, and the second point concerns China's unity, both of which are extremely important. In addition, what is extremely important is that Article 5 of the Alliance Treaty stipulates, "From the date of implementation of this treaty, the Treaty on Basic Relations between the Republic of China and Japan, signed on November 30, 1940, i.e., November 30, Showa 15, and all attached documents shall be invalidated together." In the past, many people suspected that in addition to the Basic Relations Treaty, there were also so-called secret agreements, and even if there were no secret agreements, there must be undisclosed documents among all the attached documents. Now, seeing the provisions of Article 5, all doubts can vanish like clouds. Moreover, the Alliance Treaty signed this time, in addition to the attached protocol and one exchange of notes, does not have any other attached documents, which shows the utmost openness and uprightness.

Independent and Autonomous,

Becoming Increasingly Sound. Furthermore, it should be solemnly pointed out that the exchange of notes this time makes the meaning of the already established facts mentioned in the attached protocol to the Basic Relations Treaty even more clear and detailed. Article 1 of the attached protocol mentions the existence of so-called special circumstances, and Article 3 mentions the continuation of matters handled by the so-called established regime. For the past three years, the Japanese government has been frankly and openly discussing these two kinds of already established facts with the National Government, and has been adjusting them within the scope of possibility. Since the implementation of the new policy, in order to assist China in achieving independence and autonomy, it has been carrying out these adjustments more resolutely. Many adjusted facts have already been seen by the world. The exchange of notes this time fully expresses this determination. Of course, a complete adjustment can only be achieved when full peace is restored and the state of war ends. However, even while the state of war continues, adjustments can be made at any time through consultations between the two countries, as permitted by the circumstances. This is entirely in accordance with the purpose of this Alliance Treaty, to further strengthen the National Government and make China's independence and autonomy increasingly sound. Such kindness is truly moving.

Furthermore, it should be stated incidentally that Article 4 of the Alliance Treaty stipulates, "The details necessary for the implementation of this treaty shall be decided through consultations between the competent authorities of the two countries." According to domestic law, foreign affairs are handled by the central government. When local officials encounter foreign affairs, they must obtain the permission of the central government and act in accordance with its intentions before they can handle them. There are also some specific matters that the central government must go through the legislative procedures of the Central Political Committee and the Legislative Yuan. These are all provisions of domestic law and matters of course, so there is no need to explain them. I am stating this incidentally because I am concerned that some people may misunderstand.

Laying the Cornerstone for Permanent Friendship

At the time of signing the Basic Relations Treaty, I made a sincere explanation to the concerns of the people. I said that the provisions in the treaty have a lot of flexibility, depending on how we work hard. If we work hard, we can make it move in a good direction; otherwise, it will only move in a bad direction. For example, the length of time for stationing troops, the number of additional troop locations, the number of troops, and the amount of... are not fixed. If our strength can restore peace throughout the country and completely cure the disease, then the time for troop stationing will definitely be short, and the number of troop locations and troops will definitely be small. Conversely, there will be longer... and more troop stationing... Our economic strength is also the same. If the direction is correct, there will be many economic talents. If economic technology advances and rationalization is achieved, then the economy can achieve the goal of mutual benefit. Otherwise, it will only decline. I believe there is reason for this explanation. Since we have signed the treaty, we have an obligation to abide by it, and there is no other hope for improvement other than what I have said above. However, the Japanese government proposed the intention to fundamentally revise the treaty this time, and the drafts of the Alliance Treaty and the attached protocol and exchange of notes were also proposed by the Japanese government. The special rights that the Japanese side obtained in the previous treaty were abandoned, without any reservation. At the same time, all the points that the Chinese side was worried about were thoroughly eliminated.

Today, I openly tell my fellow countrymen that this revised treaty is entirely out of the goodwill of the Japanese government and people. For the sake of permanent friendship between China and Japan, and for the sake of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, based on the spirit of... and the feelings of compatriots, they have put forward such a bright and upright proposition, giving China the strength to be reborn from the dead. They have laid the cornerstone for permanent friendship between China and Japan, and have opened up a road to peace that is in line with justice for East Asia.

Consistent Ideals Fully Realized

Now I have a few more words to tell my fellow countrymen: Why does Japan have this determination and implementation this time? Speaking of the concept of "good-neighborly friendship," it was already evident in the Konoe Statement. However, at that time, the Greater East Asia War had not yet broken out, and the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States still existed within China, spreading to all aspects of politics, military affairs, economy, and culture. Those who generally... take the stationing of troops as an example. The Treaty of Nanjing after the Opium War already had a starting point, and it became increasingly serious after the Boxer Rebellion. In that case, if Japan wanted to abolish the so-called long-standing practice and act alone, it would not only... China's... but would also increase the danger of Britain and the United States becoming more arbitrary. The troop stationing issue is like this, and other economic issues are no exception.

At the time of signing the Basic Relations Treaty, Japan took this into consideration and had to make some arrangements. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the power of Britain and the United States in China was completely crushed, and this consideration was no longer necessary, so many arrangements were no longer necessary either. From the agreement signed ahead of schedule on January 9 this year to return the concessions and abolish extraterritoriality, to the recent fundamental revision of the treaty, the ideals have been consistent. Fellow countrymen, what should we do now? At the beginning of the outbreak of the China Incident, most of our fellow countrymen believed that resisting would lead to destruction, and not resisting would also lead to destruction. Holding this pessimistic psychology, they engaged in resistance. At the beginning of the peace movement, some people still believed that cooperation between China and Japan was hopeless, and holding this pessimistic psychology, they rejected peace. Over the past few years, although there have been various facts that can prove that peace is not hopeless, there have also been various contrary facts that have delayed the decision and action. Now, the Pan-Asianism advocated by the Father of the Nation has moved from theory to practice. The Father of the Nation's hope that Japan would assist China in abolishing unequal treaties has been seen in reality. The Father of the Nation's will, which called on comrades who died later to continue their efforts to abolish unequal treaties, has been thoroughly implemented. Today, we can only, based on the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, solidify the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows and sharing life and death since the Greater East Asia War as firm as gold and stone. We must concentrate the total strength of the nation until the Greater East Asia War is completed and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is accomplished, so that China's independence and freedom can be guaranteed.

Permanently Form a Friendly Relationship

Recalling the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Chongqing side once publicly said, "Peace can only be realized if we return to the state before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident." In today's state, it is not only returning to the state before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, but it has also exceeded it several times. Before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China had concessions, but now they have been returned. Before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China had foreign... The power to... Foreign people... and laws existed in China, but now they have been abolished. Every place within Lugouqiao was a transfer station for semi-colonies, but now the aggressive state of Britain and the United States... The unequal treaties of hundreds of years have been abandoned. Before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China and Japan had divergent policies and strained relations, but now they have consistent policies and a permanent friendly relationship has been formed. What is needed now is for the Chongqing side to abandon resistance and restore peace. This is beneficial to the overall situation in East Asia, and it is especially beneficial to China itself. Because on this basis, Japan will fulfill its withdrawal of troops, and the state of war within Chinese territory will end immediately. Various construction projects for peace and rehabilitation will begin immediately.

China is in a rear position in the Greater East Asia War. Of course, it should not forget to send elite troops to the front line to share the hardships of the allied soldiers. However, establishing security and increasing production are the urgent tasks of the rear. In this way, China will not only fulfill its rear obligations in the Greater East Asia War, but will also stimulate the recovery and improvement of various matters after the war. This is extremely beneficial to the restoration of China's vitality and the increase of national strength and people's strength. If the Chongqing side does not abandon resistance and restore peace at this time, then the so-called resistance of Chongqing is not resisting for China, but resisting for Britain and the United States. They not only want to provide their own territory to Britain and the United States as an air base, allowing them to bomb their own compatriots, but they also want to turn places that could have been settled and restored into... for Britain and the United States... At the same time, they also want to transport a large number of troops to the Myanmar region to be lackeys of Britain and the United States in order to resist... Those in East Asia who already have independent nascent states, such actions are not only traitors to East Asia, but also sinners of China. I hope that the generals, soldiers, and people of Chongqing will recognize this clearly and quickly determine the path they should take. There is still time at this time. Delaying it by one day will delay it by one day.

I remember that I led a small number of comrades, empty-handed, out of Chongqing, and have been running for the peace movement for five years now. Without virtue or ability, I have been able to receive such assistance from Japan, enabling China to fulfill its aspirations for independence and freedom. I sincerely thank the Japanese government and people for this kindness. At the same time, I think of my old companions on the Chongqing side, who have not yet come over. I am really heartbroken. I sincerely pray to the spirit of the Father of the Nation in heaven to silently... urge us to promote unity. We vow to use the spirit of courage, diligence, hard work, and perseverance to continue our efforts to complete the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia. (End)

### National Forum: Unjustified Shortages of Sugar, Rice, and Flour Coupons

— Ping Ming

The amount and duration of household rice in western Shanghai (areas beyond the settlement limits) are different from those in the first to eighth districts—the amount is smaller and the duration is uncertain. Last winter, it was issued once every six weeks. In the past, there was a relationship with the settlements, but now that the settlements have been recovered, the amount of household rice in western Shanghai is still less than that in the first to eighth districts; the first to eighth districts have at least one sheng, while western Shanghai has already received brown rice and broken rice of nine he three times; the distribution agencies for the first to eighth districts are the Economic Department, while western Shanghai is the Food Administration Bureau—this bad phenomenon is getting worse day by day.

At the beginning of last month, the Food Administration Bureau sent personnel to the first, sixth, and ninth Lianbao of western Shanghai to investigate households. One day, the Jia chief of my Bao came to my house and asked, "Each household must send a representative with their household registration certificate and the residence certificates of all family members to the Bao chief's office for inspection." The western Shanghai authorities stipulated that "residents aged sixty and above and ten and below do not need to obtain residence certificates." There were a total of twenty-three people, large and small, and six of them were under ten years old. Fortunately, they were all at home, so they brought seventeen residence certificates and household registration certificates to report. The staff member was silent during the inspection.

Around the 20th of last month, members of the Huixi Baojia Committee also came to investigate households. One of the investigators of the committee said to me, "Because the Food Administration Bureau wants to deduct the rations of three people, I have come to re-investigate the number of people in the household being deducted and how many residence certificates the whole family has, in order to facilitate negotiations." That afternoon, the Jia chief distributed the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th period rice coupons, and sure enough, three were missing. Three sixth-period sugar coupons were also missing. When I asked the Jia chief, he said, "That's how many the Food Administration Bureau sent." The next day, the 16th, 17th, and 18th period flour coupons were also issued, and three were missing. Some neighbors had one or two deducted, while others had none deducted.

Sixth-period household sugar has been sold in the first to eighth districts since the ninth of last month. Western Shanghai residents were eagerly waiting. They thought that sugar coupons could be issued by the fourteenth (Mid-Autumn Festival), but they waited until around the twentieth, and the sugar coupons were deducted before they were issued. This is puzzling.

On what grounds did the Food Administration Bureau deduct the sugar, rice, and flour coupons of residents? If it is a false declaration of households, why was the investigator silent during the inspection? Why was the number of oil coupons issued for the sixth period not reduced? If sugar, rice, and flour are not adequately distributed, why not announce it in the newspaper? Why are they reduced in Lianbao A but not in Lianbao B? Please investigate the authorities. If the authorities are determined to "purify the officialdom," "eliminate corruption," and "practice integrity," they must conduct a thorough investigation. This is what the residents of western Shanghai expect.

### Mr. Liu's Festival Banquet Benefits the Poor

Mr. Liu Liangcai wrote yesterday, "The 27th of this month is the day of my granddaughter's full-month celebration. All relatives and friends sent congratulatory gifts. However, thinking of the turbulent times and the widespread suffering, I would rather create blessings than spend extravagantly on a banquet. Therefore, I will hold a simple banquet on this day to entertain relatives and friends. I respectfully donate the 10,000 yuan saved from the banquet and the 10,000 yuan from relatives and friends, totaling 20,000 yuan, to charity. In addition to donating to the Ningbo Congee Distribution Center, Orphanage, Nursery, Nursing Home, Widow's Home, Tongshan Relief Association, Siming Orphanage, Siming Poor Children's Home, Shanghai Orphanage, Women and Children's Relief Association, Renji Shantang, Mingde Jiyi Association, Xinpu Nursery, Nursing Home, Tushanwan Orphanage, Xujiahui Nursery, Xinwen Bao Loan Scholarship Fund, and Museum Grain Fund, each 1,000 yuan, I now send 2,000 yuan in Central Reserve Coupons to help your newspaper's scholarship fund and the Shanghai Fuyou Institute, each 1,000 yuan. Please transfer them." Liu Liangcai bows respectfully. (Note: The money has been received. Thank you very much. We also hope that the Fuyou Institute will prepare an official receipt to be collected from our newspaper.)
