### How to Realize Total National Economic Mobilization

Total national economic mobilization plays a decisive role in the implementation of government policies after entering the war. This is because only through the complete mobilization of all economic forces in the country, under the reasonable and unified control of the government, can the task of participating in the war be accomplished. However, to achieve total national economic mobilization, if we rely solely on government decrees and government agencies, although some results can be achieved, it is a significant question whether these results truly align with the government's national policies. We believe that the government must obtain the cooperation of civil organizations to avoid disconnection between the top and bottom, and to achieve perfect results. Currently, such civil organizations have not yet been realized. In this period of transition toward a wartime system, this is a loophole. We hope that both the government and the public will pay attention to this and quickly establish civil organizations to promote national economic mobilization.

Civil organizations to promote national economic mobilization are naturally not executive agencies of national policy. Their main task is to conduct propaganda, explanation, guidance, promotion, and evaluation work among the people under the guidance of the government and its policies. Specifically, for example, regarding the handling of the currently severe problem of commodity prices, with such civil organizations, government planning can be completed quickly and effectively. In addition, regarding increasing production, economizing consumption, promoting public bonds, encouraging savings, levying taxes, purchasing provisions, increasing tax revenue, facilitating transportation, implementing food policies, mobilizing civilian labor, wartime economic laws and regulations, as well as promoting and facilitating general wartime life, they can all assist, promote, and evaluate the work. However, since it is not the executor of policy, it does not need to handle trivial matters. Its position is relatively detached, its observation is more genuine, and its effectiveness is more substantial.

The government has already decided on a wartime economic policy outline, and all wartime economic measures and countermeasures will be implemented in sequence. To achieve effectiveness and thoroughness, the first step is to awaken the people, to enable them to fully understand and participate in the implementation work. The relevant agencies naturally have their duties to fulfill, but there are also those in society who abandon righteousness and undermine government orders. It is not enough to rely solely on official persuasion and supervision, because these elements are mostly from the upper class and powerful local figures. They sometimes even have the power to make local governments helpless against them. As a result, the work of economic mobilization is affected. With civil organizations to promote economic mobilization, they can use their courage and integrity to report these violations and be a powerful assistant to the government.

In the work of wartime economic mobilization, local chambers of commerce and trade associations obviously also occupy important positions. However, in reality, these organizations have been very scattered in the past and rarely able to exert practical effectiveness. With civil organizations to promote economic mobilization, it is possible to strengthen local chambers of commerce and trade associations through civil voluntary methods, supervise cooperation, and jointly strive to advance government policies and mobilize national economic forces.

The effectiveness of the implementation of national policies depends on the degree of public understanding and the enthusiasm of public support. The public's understanding and support of national policies obviously cannot rely solely on laws and regulations. The promotion and facilitation of civil organizations have essential significance. At this time when wartime economic policies need to be actively promoted, we hope that the government will immediately pay attention to the great significance of civil organization assistance.

### The Path of India Towards Independence

The Indian problem is no longer an internal dispute between an imperialist country and its colony but has become a problem of world significance, inextricably linked to the development of the current world situation. The reason why the Indian problem has developed to this point is because the Indian people have clearly recognized the nature of this war.

As soon as India saw the outbreak of the European War, on September 14, 1939, the National Congress issued a lengthy statement on the war crisis, stating that India had nothing to do with this war. Why did the leaders of the Indian national movement issue such a statement? Because India knew that the British operations were not essentially different from the First World War. The only goal of Britain was still to maintain the status quo, protect imperialist territories, colonies, and vested rights and privileges. In this statement, the leaders of the Indian national movement expressed two resolutions: first, India would never fight for imperialism; second, they would eliminate all compromises and strive for independence and freedom. Because of this firm determination, no matter how much pressure or appeasement the British government applied, it never achieved any results.

What India is most concerned about is the nature of the new order created after the war. In the First European War, India fell for the trick of being able to "gain freedom" and participated in the war. It sent large armies to the front lines and supplied large amounts of materials to support Britain. However, Britain not only failed to fulfill its promises but also suppressed the Indian independence movement, arrested its leaders and imprisoned them, banned its organizations, and openly shot innocent people. This inhuman behavior was the price that Britain paid for India's participation in the war. Therefore, the Indian National Congress had to ask Britain to clarify the war aims. However, Britain did not provide a satisfactory answer.

The Indian people knew that the British operations were still to maintain their imperialist interests, so they awakened to the mission of the Asians and resolutely launched a national movement. What is the meaning of Britain supporting the Chiang regime to fight Japan? The Indian masses must think about this again and again. The United States, which is in cahoots with Britain, sent troops to India and spent huge sums of money to make India a base for the war, a powder keg for them. Their intention is not only to make India a colony of British and American imperialism but also to make the entire East Asia their colony. This is a fact that anyone can understand. The Indian people now know that the fate of India is entrusted to all of Asia. The Indian problem is one of the Asian national liberation movements.

When the British government refused to clarify the war aims demanded by India, Tojo's statement showed a deep understanding and sympathy for the Indian national movement and promised to provide practical assistance to India. Neighboring Burma, supported by Japan, is about to achieve independence. India does not need to worry about not having military power. As long as the Indian national movement recognizes the significance of building a new order in East Asia and stands on the position of sharing the common destiny of the Asian nations, then the path of India towards independence will naturally open up.

### German Troops Enter Near Donets, Slaviansk City, Soviet Troops Make Slight Progress West of Kursk, Soviet Offensive in Kharkov Area Halted

Berlin, 3rd, Havas News Agency: German troops in the southern part of the Eastern Front maintain an active position. The bridgehead on the Kuban River has become a base for attack. German tank formations outflank the Soviet troops, defeating an infantry division. Soviet concentrated attacks in Mais are also frustrated. The Soviet army switched to a defensive position the day before yesterday. German counterattacks west of the industrial area have not stopped due to the melting snow. German troops have reached the central part of the Donets River and are advancing towards Slaviansk. Soviet troops southwest and south of Kharkov also show signs of switching to a defensive position. Soviet troops advancing towards Konotop northwest of Kharkov are also defeated. Soviet troops have made slight progress west of Kursk, but this is not strategically important. The Soviet offensive in the Orel area has weakened. The Soviet army seems to be actively reinforcing, while the German army has rapidly advanced southeast with fresh troops from south of Orel. There are only small battles in the central part of the Eastern Front. Soviet troops are increasing pressure south of Lake Ilmen and launching fierce attacks, but have not yet succeeded. After the German troops withdrew from the Demyansk bridgehead a few days ago, their forces have been concentrated. Anglo-American propaganda of "a great victory in Demyansk" is only a planned withdrawal of four weeks.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 3rd, Havas News Agency: The most significant development on the Eastern Front yesterday was the German counterattack in the Donets area. According to the German High Command's war report, German troops have entered the railway hub of Slaviansk, near the Donets River. The Soviet side also admitted that the German troops were fiercely counterattacking in the Stalin-Voroshilov-Slaviansk triangle. In the Caucasus, a large force of Soviet troops transferred by the German army was defeated by German tank formations. Moscow Radio said that the climate there was extremely unfavorable for combat, with the battlefield muddy and knee-deep. The Soviet offensive in the Kursk and Kharkov areas has been halted.

Berlin, 3rd, Central News Agency: According to an official statement from the German authorities on the 2nd, Colonel Haimar, Chief of Staff of the German Air Force, was killed on the Eastern Front.

### German Troops Shorten the Front Line, Withdraw from Rzhev

Headquarters of the German Leader, 3rd, German News Agency: German troops counterattacking in the Izium area have advanced to the midstream area of the Donets River. Soviet troops continue to exert increasing pressure on the German positions southeast of Orel. Stubborn enemy troops northwest of that area have been defeated, and 16 enemy tanks have been lost. In order to shorten the front line, German troops have carried out a planned withdrawal from the city of Rzhev. The rearguard protecting the withdrawal blew up the bridges on the Volga River before retreating. The enemy's whereabouts are unknown. The central and northern sections of the Eastern Front are quiet with only local battles. German aircraft have destroyed the facilities of the Murmansk Railway.

Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd, Central News Agency: According to news from the Eastern Front, the temperature has risen in recent days on the entire front line from the Caucasus to Lake Ladoga, and much of the snow has begun to melt. The Kursk and Orel areas are muddy and knee-deep, but German and Soviet troops are still engaged in fierce battles everywhere. Soviet troops in Orel launched two fierce attacks on the German right-wing positions, but were repulsed by the German troops, who then seized several Soviet positions. There was also fierce fighting in the Kramatorskaya area northwest of the Donets Basin. The German forces in that area are very strong. The offensive and defensive battles between the German and Soviet troops have become a tug-of-war. However, the German troops occupying Kramatorskaya are in high spirits, and the battle situation is becoming more intense. In the battle on the 2nd, in addition to 700 deaths, the Soviet army lost 37 howitzers, 350 machine guns, and 70 anti-tank guns. German troops in the Izium area also continued to attack under the cover of the air force. On the 2nd, several units of the Soviet army were surrounded and annihilated, and many Soviet troops were captured. According to a statement from the German High Command, the body of Major General Rurke, commander of the Soviet army, was found among the corpses abandoned by the Soviet army in this battle. The activities of the German air force also strongly echoed the ground troops, attacking the Soviet army everywhere.

West of the Mius River, Soviet Troops Penetrating Deep are Annihilated

Berlin, 3rd, Havas News Agency: German war correspondent Honarga described the recent encirclement battle west of the Mius River, stating that the 4th Soviet Mechanized Guards Corps, under the cover of heavy tanks, broke through the German defenses west of the Mius River and penetrated 15 kilometers behind German lines. It stopped at a certain village to await reinforcements. The German army first approached the branch line of the main Soviet front line, defeating the Soviet troops that came to reinforce the tank corps, and then completely surrounded the tank corps. In the night battle, the Soviet troops failed to break through. Except for a part who surrendered to the German army when they saw that the situation was hopeless, the rest were completely annihilated.

German Reporter's Impressions of Inspecting the Eastern Front

Berlin, 3rd, Havas News Agency: Received a report from the Havas special correspondent Edelridge on his observations and thoughts on his return from inspecting the Eastern Front: After passing through the entire German defense line, I felt that everyone from generals to soldiers knew exactly how the Soviet army's combat power was. Even if the German army is forced to retreat, they are still confident that their combat power is superior to the enemy's. German soldiers firmly believe that the Soviet army cannot achieve final victory. The German army in the middle of Eastern Europe initially rushed into enemy territory and made rapid progress. Since reaching the muddy ground in the autumn of 1941, it has been inconvenient to march and began to retreat. Even if the enemy is numerous and we are few, the German soldiers are still not afraid to fight. I have talked to infantry, artillery, engineers, and air force personnel, and they all have this belief. Some of them had fought in Poland, France, or the Balkans, but they were not sure how superior the German army's combat power was. After experiencing the winter war, they realized that the German army was much stronger than the Soviet army. Every German general said, "I have witnessed a German squad destroying more than 100 Soviet tanks with grenades. Also, in other areas, I have witnessed thousands of Soviet soldiers die under the German machine gun fire within a day." Although the Soviet army is numerous and has a lot of ammunition, it cannot use its strength effectively. The German army is very morale, and it can often win more with less. Whether attacking or defending, the German officers and soldiers often adapt to the situation and act decisively, and they always gain the upper hand. In other words, the Soviet army is like a machine, stubborn but not alert, not like the German soldiers who have superior training and flexible thinking and are good at responding to the battle.

### In the Su-Huai Area, Chongqing Troops Suffer Repeated Heavy Losses, Important Strongholds are Recovered in Succession

Xinghua, 3rd, Central News Agency: A certain unit of the Xinghua Garrison, in coordination with friendly forces in the Su-Huai area, attacked the 117th Division of Wu Shuquan under the Chongqing troops and the Independent 6th Brigade.

Central China Army of Japan Announces Spring Offensive War Situation

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) According to a report from Domei News Agency's local branch, the Central China Army of Japan announced at 4:00 PM on the 3rd that the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China had launched a spring offensive, launching a main force annihilation operation against the 89th Army of Chongqing and the New Fourth Army in the Su-Huai area. The various units of the Central China Army began operations in mid-February, successively annihilating the Chongqing Communist forces and completely destroying major strongholds and military facilities of the Chongqing Communists such as Cheqiao Town, Caodian Baogu Village, Yilin Town, Dongkan Town, Dianhu Town, and Chenjiaji, completely eliminating the surviving forces of the Chongqing Communist Army in the Su-Huai area. Currently, it is still continuing to mop up scattered and mobile or hidden Chongqing Communist remnants in remote corners. With the success of the Japanese operation, the political power of the National Government has been expanded to the entire Su-Huai area, overturning the Lu-Su War Zone of the Chongqing side and the anti-Japanese base area of the so-called Central China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, strictly sealing the Chongqing side's smuggling routes, and at the same time ensuring the vast granary area of northern Jiangsu, contributing greatly to the political and military strategies of the National Government participating in the war. As of March 1, the losses of the Chongqing Communist Army and the war results obtained by the Japanese army are as follows: (1) The headquarters of the 89th Army of Chongqing and the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government collapsed (a part defected to the Japanese army units), (2) The 33rd Division of Chongqing was almost completely annihilated, (3) The main force of the 117th Division of Chongqing was annihilated, and a part collapsed and scattered, (4) The 112th Division of Chongqing and the Independent 6th Brigade collapsed and scattered, (5) The Central China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party and the Yanfu Anti-Japanese People's Base were overturned, and their command centers collapsed, scattered, and hidden. The battlefield buried 1,241 corpses of the Chongqing Communist Army, captured (including surrendered) 3,080 people, intercepted 7 mortars, 46 mortar shells, 1 mountain gun, 1 flat-firing gun, 6 13 cm anti-aircraft machine cannons, 21 heavy machine guns, 1,650 rounds of heavy machine gun ammunition, 50 light machine guns, 67 automatic rifles, 2,302 rifles, 29,516 rounds of rifle ammunition, 72 field artillery howitzers, 2,499 hand grenades. The main war results obtained by the National Government army are as follows: Approximately 1,500 people defected, intercepted 1 mountain gun, 1 flat-firing gun, 2 anti-aircraft machine cannons, 3 mortars, 10 mortar shells, 8 heavy machine guns, 12 light machine guns, 567 rifles, 12,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, 500 hand grenades. 34 Japanese soldiers were killed in action. The Army Air Force and the Navy gunboat unit closely cooperated with various units during this operation and achieved great war results. The National Government troops of Hu Guanjun, Liu Xiangtu, and Xiong Jiandong and other units also cooperated with the Japanese army to participate in the operation or form an outer encirclement circle to exert the practical effect of joint Chinese-Japanese operations. Especially during the attack on Cheqiao Town, their bravery and skill in combat were deeply admired by the Japanese army. The accompanying propaganda and pacification teams organized by officials and civilians in northern Jiangsu entered and exited the fierce artillery fire, either conducting propaganda to the enemy or pacifying and relieving the people, carrying forward the practical effect of the cooperation between the military and civilians of the National Government. Residents who had been temporarily misled by the Chongqing Communist Army's counter-propaganda and sought refuge in the countryside have now been convinced of the Japanese side's credibility and are returning to their hometowns one after another, advancing towards the road of protecting the homeland, pacifying the people, and building a bright northern Jiangsu. The surnames of the main cadres of the Chongqing Communist Army who were captured and surrendered are as follows: Wang Yunsheng, commander of the 198th Regiment of the 33rd Division, and the first and second battalion commanders, Liu Xuesheng, deputy commander of the 197th Regiment, Wu Caoquan, head of the 351st Rotation of the 117th Division, Cao Hefei, education director of the training class of the Military Police Supervision Department of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government, many senior cadres of the Civil Affairs Department of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government, Commander Huang of the Cheqiao Town Garrison, a certain puppet county magistrate of Shiying County.

### Japanese Army in Shanxi Annihilates Taiyue Communist Army

In this battle, Zhang Jiansheng, deputy commander of the Communist Army, was killed, and the chief of staff and the political director were captured. The Japanese army also annihilated the remnants of the army. As of today, it has been found that the Communist Army has left behind 305 corpses.

### Rumor that Chongqing Requests the Transfer of Air Force Authority

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to reliable sources, Song Ziwen, the Foreign Minister of Chongqing, who is currently staying in the United States, is proposing to the US government at the behest of Chiang Kai-shek to transfer the command of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing to the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission. Soong May-ling is also working from the side. The reason is that the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing was under the jurisdiction of the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission during the period when Bissell commanded the Volunteer Army, so it cooperated considerably with the Chongqing military operations. After the expiration, three-quarters of the US Volunteer Team were lost when it was disbanded. Last July, the US Air Force was reorganized and commanded by Chennault. It has not taken any action since then. It has almost no means of resisting the repeated attacks of the Japanese Air Force on its territory. The Japanese Air Force is active at will as if it were in no man's land. Moreover, in ground battles, the US Air Force does not cooperate with the Chongqing army and does not obey Chongqing's orders. Recently, the Chongqing people and newspapers such as the Central Daily News and Ta Kung Pao have also expressed dissatisfaction. Therefore, the Chongqing side is determined to take the opportunity to unify the command of the air force and intends to propose to place the US Air Force under its command. However, the US side is reluctant to this proposal and seems to have encountered difficulties. In addition to criticizing their evasive attitude, the Chongqing side also pointed out that the American military officers live too luxuriously. Those stationed in Merlin, Kunming, and other places even demand high-quality whiskey and tobacco. At a time when materials are scarce, the Chongqing side feels unable to cope.

### Axis Forces Make Progress Near Cape Serrat; Part of the Allied Forces' Retreat Cut Off; German and Italian Air Forces Active on the North African Coast

Swiss Capital, 2nd (Havas Agency) According to a war report released by the German High Command, the Axis forces have made further progress in Cape Serrat and Mejez El Bab, and have cut off the retreat of part of the enemy forces. The Allied forces' long-prepared plan to attack Bizerte and Tunis has been thwarted by the new actions of the German army. The Axis forces are also dominant in other parts of North Africa. Many enemy tanks were destroyed and many soldiers were captured. In addition, the Axis air force has been extremely active, bombing enemy communication lines and British and American ships along the coast of North Africa. In addition, the Allied High Command's war report stated that the air force on the North African front was active again. German aircraft were particularly active over the Eighth British Army's defense area near the Mareth Line. The activities of both sides' sentries were also more active than before. However, regarding land warfare, it only said that the Axis offensive on each line had been blocked, and that the vanguard of the British and American forces in central Tunisia had crossed Spetla by three miles. According to Spetla, it is twenty miles northeast of Gasserine. Because the British and American forces in that area may have an attempt to unite with the Eighth British Army to attack, the Axis forces withdrew from the Kasserine Pass a few days ago to prevent the British and American forces from joining forces, it is said.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to news from the Tunisian front, the Axis forces in northern Tunisia have recently made progress in the Cape Serrat area and the Mejez El Bab area. The British First Army is currently assembling a large number of powerful troops, as well as a large number of mechanized units and artillery units, etc., with the appearance of attacking the two ports of Tunis and Bizerte. In the past, the Axis forces had severely damaged the anti-Axis forces in the battle in central Tunisia. The damage inflicted on the British army and the French rebel army was particularly severe when they broke through the anti-Axis forces' position in Mejez El Bab on the 1st, cutting off the retreat of part of the British army and completely annihilating it. The German air force has been bombing the enemy's rear communication lines for days, and destroyed eight enemy armored vehicles, causing thirteen others to be repulsed. Rome Central, 3rd (News Agency) The Italian High Command announced on the 1st that Italian aircraft bombed an enemy convoy in the northeast sea of Algiers, sinking three enemy ships, totaling 17,070 tons. In addition, the Italian torpedo squadron sank an enemy merchant ship and severely damaged two others, it is said.

British Newspapers Value North African Battle Situation

Swedish Capital, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) The London Times published an editorial, advocating to speed up the Allied forces' actions in Tunisia, slightly mocking the Soviet army's actions, which have been blocked by the melting of ice and snow on the eastern front.

### German-Italian Economic Committee Meets in Rome; Agreement Reached on Clearance Methods Between the Two Countries

Rome, 3rd (Central News Agency) The German-Italian Economic Committee held a meeting in Rome on the 2nd.

Clearance methods between the two countries were discussed, and the views of the two sides were close to agreement.

Swedish Capital, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) According to the "Allehanda" newspaper, London political figures believe that Ribbentrop's visit to Rome is the Axis countries' response to the Casablanca Conference.

Lisbon, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) Newspapers here have published lengthy editorials, commenting on the Mussolini-Ribbentrop meeting. O Seculo newspaper stated that Germany and Italy are in complete agreement on the proposition of fighting to the end and eliminating the Bolsheviks. Novidades newspaper believes that the Axis countries' determination to establish a new order in Europe in the communiqué so that Europe can enjoy peace is extremely important.

The Significance of German-Italian Meeting is Significant

Berlin, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) Schmidt, Director of the Information Department of the German Foreign Ministry, who accompanied Ribbentrop to Rome, revealed today that the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Rome used the telegram from the German leader to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini as the principle of the conversation. Therefore, Ribbentrop's visit to Italy was not in the capacity of the German Foreign Ministry, but as the formal representative of the German leader. Schmidt continued to discuss the significance of the Rome meeting, saying that Germany and Italy decided unanimously this spring to exert all their efforts to drive out our enemies. The purpose of the enemy's convening the Casablanca conference was to make us surrender unconditionally. The answer in the German-Italian meeting was to thoroughly eliminate the enemy and then stop. Germany and Italy will not only build the latest weapons to engage in warfare, but also mobilize the human resources of the whole country to use these latest weapons. The highest principle is that whoever hates us cannot conquer us, on the contrary, they will make us stronger. The issues discussed at the Rome meeting were military, political and economic issues related to warfare, as well as plans for post-war Europe. Schmidt then refuted the rumors that Ribbentrop met with New York Archbishop Spellman, saying that London and Washington seemed to not know that the Italian official was Mussolini, not a representative of Roosevelt. After returning to Germany, the German Foreign Minister expressed satisfaction with his visit to Rome, because the people of Germany and Italy are working hard and are loyal to their mission, so they will never be defeated. The Italian people are determined to win and are willing to sacrifice, so we will achieve the final victory. British and American planes have repeatedly bombed Italian cities, and the result has increased the people's hatred of the enemy. Schmidt finally said that the German Foreign Minister hosted representatives of friendly countries stationed in Italy in Rome to discuss various issues of common interest, it is said.

Japanese Newspaper Comments on Rome Meeting

Tokyo, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) "Asahi Shimbun" stated that the Rome meeting recently held confirmed that Germany and Italy were in complete agreement. The enemy's claim that the two countries were at odds was self-defeating. All facts can prove that the attempt of the United Kingdom and the United States to alienate Germany and Italy will be difficult to achieve.

### Japan's New Policy Towards China to be Discussed and Decided in the Current Diet Session

Regarding the Japanese government's various explanations during the 81st Diet session concerning discussions on the new policy towards China, this newspaper has successively published reports. Now, seeing a more detailed account in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, we are translating and publishing it again to provide a comprehensive view.

On the first few days of the reconvened 81st Diet session on January 28th, Prime Minister Tojo, despite illness, ascended the platform to elaborate on his administrative policy. Concerning the China issue, he stated:

"On January 9th, when the Republic of China government declared war on Britain and the United States, Japan, in order to adapt to the new situation, immediately adopted necessary measures under the policy of establishing Japanese-Chinese relations, including the return of all Japanese concessions in China, recognition of the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Beijing Legation Quarter, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the handling of enemy property in China."

This statement indicates that Japan's policy towards China will undergo a drastic change. Subsequently, on February 8th, it was decided to transfer enemy property, and on the 9th, Japanese and Chinese commissioners were appointed to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. The Prime Minister's words were put into practice within ten days.

In the current Diet session, the operation of the newly established Greater East Asia Ministry and the review of policy towards China are naturally popular topics for discussion. The course of questioning and answering will be briefly described as follows:

The Development of Political Issues

To grasp the China issue, it is necessary to study it from all aspects. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, modern Chinese history has undergone a period of change. As Prime Minister Tojo stated in his administrative policy, the power of the great powers in China has been completely eradicated. In order to adapt to this new situation, the government has launched basic national policies such as enriching the National Government and strengthening Japanese-Chinese cooperation. The three principles of Konoe regarding the handling of the incident and the basic Japanese-Chinese treaty should be clearly explained. The essence of these important policies should be dissected, and through the Diet, their political significance should be imprinted in the minds of the people.

China has now been liberated from the aggressive forces of third countries. The poison of a century of semi-colonialism has now been eradicated from its roots, and the relationship between China and Japan has entered a new stage. Consequently, the following issues have arisen:

(1) The measures of abolishing extraterritorial rights and returning concessions contain the political significance of liberating China, and at this time, the people should thoroughly understand them.

"Rights and interests" such as concessions, leased territories, and extraterritorial rights have no meaning in the Co-Prosperity Sphere and have therefore been contracted to be returned or abolished separately. However, the idea of "rights and interests" in China, such as concessions, is deeply ingrained in the minds of the people and must be changed. The government should continue to earnestly advise them at any time.

(3) Analyzing the political inevitability of the newly established Greater East Asia Ministry is the best way to understand the structure of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, the current cabinet's plan for the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry has also promoted the free development of policy towards China. If the fundamental concept of why the Greater East Asia Ministry was established can be grasped, important policies towards China can be utilized very flexibly.

However, the attitude of the Diet is to regard the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry as a fait accompli, without mentioning it. Concessions and extraterritorial rights were rights and interests obtained with the blood of our ancestors, and the business rights of Japanese people in China were secured by them. Now that they are abandoned, how will their aftermath be handled? This question is extremely narrow-minded. Because this issue was raised in the Diet, the Diet was lifeless and lacked development.

Not Taking Chiang as an Opponent

Prime Minister Tojo, at the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, compared the relationship between Japan and its satellite countries to that of a father and son, and the relationship between China and Japan is naturally no exception. At the same time, Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry and Director Sato of the Military Affairs Bureau also said that they would never cease to suppress the Chongqing regime, the only rebel in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and would continue to adhere to the established policy of "not taking Chiang as an opponent," with absolutely no possibility of compromise.

Someone pointed out why the two sides fighting against each other both use the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. Sato replied that since the National Government returned to Nanjing, the dispute with Chongqing is a dispute within the family. Chinese territory should be regarded as one family, so the National Government naturally uses the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. Chongqing, confined to the western border, can use whatever national flag it wants, and the National Government does not need to pay attention to it. Someone also asked why the National Government abolished the anti-communist and pro-Japanese triangular flag and raised the question to the Greater East Asia Ministry.

Currency Countermeasures

Regarding China's currency system and exchange rate policy, Mr. Matsumoto Tadao, a fellow countryman of Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry, raised a question. Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry replied as follows:

(1) Last March, the National Government abolished the parity policy between the old legal tender and the reserve certificates, broke away from the old legal tender, and adopted a policy of maintaining the value of the reserve certificates. The exchange rate between reserve certificates and military scrip is fixed at 18 yuan and will not change in the future.

(2) The work of unifying reserve certificates is proceeding smoothly in important areas of China, such as Central and South China. The purchase of major materials can generally be paid for with reserve certificates without any obstacles.

(3) The methods of purchasing materials, such as cotton and other agricultural products that are directly related to the people, seek the cooperation of the Chinese side and make full use of the Chinese side's conscious responsibility and creativity.

(4) From the perspective of enhancing Japan's war power, the important materials that are required from the Chinese side include iron, coal, salt, fluorite, and cotton. The National Government is now doing its utmost to supply Japan with these materials.

(5) The policy of determining the Japanese-Chinese exchange rate is problematic because of how to adjust the trend of rising Chinese prices. Therefore, transaction adjustments and special accounts for exchange rate transactions will be adjusted, and a portion of them will become a new financial burden. In this regard, it must be considered that reducing the exchange rate would be the cause of promoting high Chinese prices.

(6) There are many arguments that China's inflation is intensifying. This is a big mistake if it refers to the increase in the amount of reserve certificates issued. From last June to the present, the work of replacing the old legal tender with reserve certificates is being carried out in various places such as the Su-Zhe-Wan triangle area, the Jiangbei area, the Hankou area, and Guangdong and Xiamen, and reserve certificates are growing very healthily.

Purchase Price of Materials

At the Committee on Trading Corporations of the House of Representatives, Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry clarified the government's established policy on the price of purchasing materials. The point that the Diet is most apprehensive about is that the purchase price of Manchurian agricultural products is fixed (very low), so the purchase of agricultural crops is not smooth. Even the purchase of cotton in North China has many difficulties because of the adoption of the fixed price system. Under the constraints of the wartime economy, there is a danger of forcing a scissors-like price difference in agricultural products.

The control of Manchurian agricultural products is handled by Minister Kishi of Commerce and Industry alone. In view of past experience, a fixed and unchanging price policy is not adopted in China. The price of Chinese materials, such as coal and iron ore, produced under Japanese control is very simple to determine. However, it is quite difficult to calculate the excessive price of cotton and other agricultural products produced by the Chinese. It is especially difficult to handle smoothly if the purchase is to be made at a controlled price. Therefore, the price of agricultural products should not be determined by the Japanese side, but should be determined by considering the local situation and purchasing at an appropriate price. Under this policy, the Greater East Asia Ministry is considering a plan to set the purchase price based on local conditions. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, February 22)

### New Endeavors in Sumatra: Establishing a New Budget for Construction, and Periodical Reorganization of Railroad Transportation

Shonan, 3rd (Central News Agency) - One year after the implementation of military administration in Sumatra, political power has penetrated into all aspects. The various policies are gradually moving away from the stage of dealing with urgent situations and are advancing towards adopting a policy of permanent administration. This can be clearly seen in the budget for the Malay Military Administration's revenue and expenditure for this year, which will be implemented from April. This budget has completely changed from the budget that was only formulated in phases to adapt to the rapidly changing situation in the past year, and has formally established a full-year budget. The planning in its formulation is very obvious. At the same time, last year's expenditure was based on measures to cope with urgent situations, so it focused on the restoration and maintenance of various facilities. This year, it has made further progress and is seeking to actively engage in construction. This is indeed the characteristic of the new budget, and it is also sufficient to indicate that the policy of local self-sufficiency to adapt to the long-term war has gradually been thoroughly implemented. Among them, on the expenditure side, maritime affairs expenses, industrial expenses, and civil engineering expenses account for the majority. Maritime affairs expenses are used to build wooden ships necessary for the exchange of materials between the two sides and to salvage sunken ships. This point is particularly noteworthy. Industrial expenses are used to actively increase food production. Therefore, this measure is necessary to complete the local self-sufficiency system and ensure social order, so the amount of expenditure is very large. Civil engineering expenses are used to maintain port facilities and road construction, so the amount is also quite considerable. In addition, the expenditure on welfare facilities is also large, which is used to handle the training of resident officials, the relief of refugees, the funding of education, and the establishment of medical universities. Next is the reorganization of the Shonan Rubber Association. This matter is now scheduled to be implemented on April 1 to reform the organization and remedy the various shortcomings of the past. In the past, the association was a mixed organization of rubber tree cultivation companies and rubber trading companies, so it lacked the spirit of innovation and integration. This reorganization will completely abandon the old system and change it into a controlled association. The association authorities will directly appoint members to be responsible for the cultivation and management of rubber trees, and the association itself will maintain its status as a control agency, responsible for retail, purchasing, trading, and distribution of materials. In this way, from April onwards, the enemy-owned plantations under the management of Malay Sumatra will be entrusted to the association for management. The association is composed of fourteen cultivation companies and six trading companies, and each company will operate separately according to its responsibilities. Its future development is worthy of attention. Next is the issue of land transportation. In the past year, the industrial development of Malay and Sumatra has been very rapid, and the restoration of transportation has been particularly rapid. From the first of this month, the Malay railway transportation time will be revised periodically. At the same time, the speed of the Malay Western Transverse Railway (between Shonan and Xingaoda) has also increased, shortening the time by six hours compared to the past, so it can complete the entire journey in 20 hours. Therefore, the exchange of goods and materials will be smoother, which goes without saying. Finally, regarding production, the increase in the production of castor oil, a special product of the South, has been actively implemented in mid-February. On the other hand, the Shonan Overseas Chinese Association has also dispatched trained agricultural instructors to various parts of Malaya to guide farmers in opening up farmland, improving agricultural tools, and cultivating methods in order to actively cooperate in increasing food production. All of this is enough to show the enthusiasm of the Malay Overseas Chinese in cooperating with construction and the progress of increasing food production in Malaya.

He said that the condition of German submarines is quite solid, but this does not mean that it cannot be weakened.

He could confirm this statement in a speech in Philadelphia.

### Sakanishi Announces the Inside Story of Germany: People Work Hard, Raw Materials Are Not Lacking

Tokyo, 3rd (Kaito News Agency) - Lieutenant General Sakanishi, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy in Germany, recently returned to Japan. He met with reporters in Osaka yesterday and said that all Germans, regardless of gender or age, are working for the war effort. This is true not only in Germany proper but also in German-occupied territories. In addition, there are 5 million prisoners of war helping with the work. Construction work in the occupied territories has progressed rapidly. He also said that Germany's supplies are guaranteed, and there is no shortage of raw materials. Not only is there no problem with food, but even high-quality wool and cotton fabrics can be purchased. No one is worried about working and there are no complaints.

### Finland's New Cabinet Difficult to Form

Stockholm, 3rd (Kaito News Agency) - "Stockholm Daily News" reports from Helsinki that Finnish President Ryti has ordered Speaker of Parliament Hakkila to form a new cabinet. However, there are doubts as to whether Hakkila will be able to carry out his work, as the Agrarian League is expected to refuse to provide the necessary support. Therefore, the political situation in Finland is still unclear and efforts must be made today. It is reported that Hakkila was born in 1882, is a lawyer by profession, was elected to Parliament in 1919, and was elected Speaker of Parliament in 1938. He also served as Minister of Justice from 1926 to 1927 and holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Philadelphia in the United States.

### New Economic Measures of the National Government by Ishiwatari Soutaro, Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government

After China joined the Greater East Asia War on January 9th, the National Government authorities devoted all their efforts to establishing a wartime system in political, economic, and military aspects.

Streamlining Political Institutions

First of all, the original political organization was extremely complex, with many people and verbose discussions, which caused considerable obstacles in the implementation of national affairs. After the reform of the administrative machinery, a National Defense Council was established, with only a small number of cabinet members allowed to attend. All important national affairs are decided by the National Defense Council and then implemented. In the past, the operation of international political affairs often wasted a lot of time due to the relationship with the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, and other bodies. In order to avoid this trouble, political affairs decided by the National Defense Council are immediately implemented. This is a kind of reform in the institution.

The various administrative departments have also been reformed accordingly, and their main purpose is to clarify the responsibilities of the departments. After various committees have been reorganized, they are either reorganized into departments or into bureaus, all of which are the responsibility of the ministers.

In this way, the operations of the committees have been adjusted, and national affairs are rapidly promoted directly under the responsibility of the ministers and bureau chiefs. The reorganization and merger of the various departments are all for this main purpose. As for the problems with military institutions, the organization of the Military Affairs Commission before the war will be changed. Since the establishment of the National Defense Council and the reorganization of the Military Affairs Commission, the wartime system of a small number of military cabinets has been established.

Reorganization of the Economic Committee

Next, looking at economic issues, related economic matters have now been reassigned to the four departments of finance, industry, construction, and food. In addition, the National Economic Committee, which was originally attached to the Executive Yuan, has now been reorganized into an organ directly under the National Government, bringing together people from the North China Political Affairs Commission who are related to the economy, Shanghai's top industrialists, and powerful figures in the financial world. The entire economy of Central China, North China, and South China will be discussed by the committee and then implemented.

On February 11th, the first National Economic Committee was held in Nanjing. Powerful figures from the industrial and commercial circles of North China and Shanghai, and those from the Nanjing government authorities, openly and sincerely discussed all day to establish a wartime economy.

Stabilizing National Defense Finance

After China joined the war, it devoted all its efforts to the Greater East Asia War with the aim of destroying Britain and the United States. In terms of materials, it is providing the maximum amount of assistance and devoting all its efforts to increasing the production of materials necessary for wartime. As for the financial situation of the National Government, the budget for the first half of this year, from January to June, has been decided at roughly 90 million yuan per month, including the budget for North China. The main item of the budget for Central China is military expenditure, which is a matter of course for maintaining a considerable number of troops. All national tax revenue and other actual revenue are used for military expenditure.

However, this budget was formulated before the war. After the war, the budget will increase considerably due to the increased production of necessary materials and other expenses. The National Government will formulate various plans for this, so the increase in the budget in the future is inevitable. If the amount is very large, other methods will have to be used to plan, but for the time being, the surplus from last year or future tax increases will be used to cope with it.

The most significant phenomenon after joining the war is that the generals who originally belonged to Chongqing have gradually shown goodwill to the National Government, so that a large number of them have come to join, and they all lead a considerable number of troops. In order to deal with these troops, there must be a considerable increase in the budget.

Circulation of Reserve Certificates

As for the circulation of reserve certificates, the Chinese people have widely used them since the full-scale exchange began last year. The circulation of the old legal tender is no longer seen in the peaceful areas. Chongqing has printed a large number of banknotes to enrich its finances, resulting in inflation. A countermeasure has been planned for this result.

The area of circulation of reserve certificates is expanding day by day, and the amount of circulation has also increased considerably.

Regarding the ratio of military scrip to reserve certificates, the Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry stated in the Diet that he would adhere to the policy of 18 yuan of military scrip to 100 yuan of reserve certificates. The Chinese side is also satisfied with this policy, and China's currency system will proceed in this direction.

New Situation in Economic Recovery

The Chinese people are extremely diligent, and the production of materials is extremely abundant, so there is no shortage. Therefore, there is no reason for pessimism about the recovery of the Chinese economy. However, at present, on the one hand, because the Shanghai market, which has the deepest economic ties with Britain and the United States, has been cut off from Britain and the United States since the Greater East Asia War, an economic situation that is different from the original economic relationship has arisen, and there is bound to be some confusion.

On the other hand, as a result of the blows suffered in the incident, considerable damage has been suffered economically. Therefore, the immediate problem is quite important.

In short, if many factories around Shanghai start operating as they were, the supply of raw materials cannot be relied on from the British and American and their colonial markets, so they must turn to the Chinese mainland to search for raw materials and then transport the products to the mainland. The recovery of the new situation in the Chinese economy must first find a way to eliminate the current inconveniences.

If a country with this kind of economic situation is viewed in terms of the abundance and greatness of its productive power, it will definitely not be pessimistic in the future after each transition period has been passed.

Reorganization of the Central China Revitalization Companies

At the time of the establishment of the Central China Revitalization Company, there was no thought of the establishment of the current government. The current situation is very different from the situation at that time. Therefore, in order to adapt to the new situation, state policy companies should of course be reorganized and reorganized. However, how to change it is a problem for the future and will be reviewed again in the future. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, February 25)

Thanksgiving prayer meetings were held in various parts of India before Gandhi's fast was completed. Indians have gone to worship in the vicinity of Pune. Gandhi's son, David, told the Indians that his father still needs to rest for a considerable period of time after the end of the fast before he can recover his health. He also said that he hoped that his father's comrades and friends would exercise self-restraint. The British government and the Indian Governor-General's Office have always expressed a cold attitude towards Gandhi's fast. However, the New Delhi correspondent of the Times said that the Indian Governor-General's Office is very concerned about Gandhi's fast and is willing to avoid Gandhi's suicide in front of the Indian Governor-General's Office within the possible scope. What the Indian Governor-General's Office values most is the promotion of the war. Since the beginning of the war, Gandhi has not only expressed his opposition verbally, but has also always obstructed the anti-Axis Allies' efforts in the war. The Indian Governor-General's Office cannot release Gandhi. However, Gandhi was extremely thin and weighed less than 100 pounds. Driven by the spirit of saving the motherland, he overcame two crises before and after. After starting the fast, within less than ten days, six famous Indian doctors all stated that if the fast was not stopped immediately, there was a danger of death. Now he has completed the 21-day fast. It is generally rumored that Gandhi prayed for God's protection during the fast, so the Indians believe that Gandhi's completion of the fast is evidence of God's will and will launch a more fierce independence movement. The New Delhi correspondent of the Times also said that Gandhi's fast caused a great response among Muslims. In the past, leaders who opposed Gandhi's policy also expressed their gratitude to Gandhi. Demonstration movements began in various parts of India on February 28. It is reported that British officials arrested many Indians in Petna, Allahabad, and other places. However, the British political circles also expressed dissatisfaction with the policies of the British government and the Indian Governor-General's Office. Recently, the Economic Weekly expressed its views as follows: Due to the British government's censorship system, the general public in India does not understand the Indian situation, so they cannot make a fundamental discussion. No matter how Gandhi's fast ends, the Indian problem is still a major one.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Gandhi's anti-British fast has reached its planned period of three weeks today (3rd). The Tokyo and Yokohama branches of the Indian Independence League will hold a commemorative lecture meeting at the Yokohama Public Hall at 1:00 PM on the 8th of this month to celebrate Gandhi's strong spirit and the final victory of the Indian people. They will pray for Gandhi's physical strength to recover soon and stimulate the determination of the Indian people to achieve complete autonomy.

### Increasingly Difficult to Resolve Soviet-Polish Dispute: British Observations

Stockholm, 3rd (Kaito News Agency) - According to London news, British political figures believe that the Polish government's publication of "radical messages" makes it increasingly difficult to resolve the Soviet-Polish dispute. British political observers claim that Polish people arouse Soviet suspicion. The Polish government uses the Atlantic Charter as a talisman, while the Soviet Union uses security as an excuse for territorial claims.

### Roosevelt No Longer Has Fever, Met with Welles Yesterday

Lisbon, 3rd (Domei News Agency) - According to reports from Washington, President Roosevelt previously suffered from enteritis. Although he had no fever yesterday, he was still resting and only met with a small number of guests. Undersecretary of State Welles was also one of them. The press conference yesterday afternoon was stopped on the doctor's advice.

### German Newspaper Accuses Britain of Assisting Balkan Guerrillas

Berlin, 3rd (Kaito News Agency) - The Eisenach National Daily, in a report from its correspondent in Agram, described the activities of the Yugoslav guerrillas, saying that Britain is unable to open a second front, so it wants to open an "invisible front." Its method is to provide gold, silver, and advisors to homeless people in the Balkan Peninsula, ordering them to engage in disruptive activities. These guerrillas extort and blackmail the villagers in every possible way, so the people hate them like they hate their teeth.

### Scramble for Affordable Soap

The Nanyang Soap Candle Company of this city, to ensure strict adherence to the authorities' price limits and to effectively supply residents, has been selling its soap at affordable prices on a rotating daily basis at its main office at 124 Avenue Edward VII, its first branch at 834 North Soochow Road, its second branch at 123 Avenue Edward VII, and its third branch at 71 Carter Road. Yesterday morning, at the Carter Road branch, customers lined up in two long queues, with men, women, old, and young totaling as many as 150 to 160 people. The urgent need for affordable soap is evident from this. The store also posted a notice stating that tomorrow (i.e., today) soap sales will continue at the first branch on North Soochow Road, north of the Old Zhabei Bridge, with a limit of two bars per person.

Charcoal Factory Improves Equipment, Requests Permission to Resume Operations

The charcoal manufacturing industry in this city was previously banned by the municipal government due to the crude equipment of various factories, which caused smoke to permeate the air during production, affecting the health of nearby residents, especially in the Hongqiao area in the west of Shanghai where most charcoal factories were located. Last year, the industry was ordered to improve equipment and temporarily cease production until improvements were made, with a ban on establishing factories east of the railway line. After receiving the order, all factories immediately stopped production and have remained closed for half a year.

Equipment Improvement

It is found that there are more than 8,000 charcoal factories in the Hongqiao area, employing no less than 3,000 workers. To continue production and maintain the livelihoods of their workers, the factories established the Charcoal Manufacturing Industry Association in January of this year to study production techniques and create scientific smoke removal devices to reduce smoke emissions during production to the minimum level, similar to ordinary household stoves. This has been largely successful. The association has urged all member factories to uniformly implement these changes, awaiting approval from the authorities to resume operations and continue production.

Request to Resume Operations

It is learned that after improving equipment, the industry submitted a document to the municipal government last month requesting to resume operations. The Social Affairs Bureau and the Hongqiao police station sent personnel to investigate and found the improvements to the factories' equipment satisfactory. However, the municipal authorities, concerned about the health of residents, recently dispatched experts from the Health Bureau to conduct a detailed investigation, which also found the improvements to be appropriate. Therefore, it is anticipated that the factories will resume production soon.

Shen Bao Fourth Scholarship Fund: All Matters Completed

Grateful for the Generous Donations from All Sectors, Achieving Significant Success

All Cases Designated by Donors Have Been Resolved

The fourth Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, thanks to the assistance of all sectors, has now been fully completed. In addition to the amount of donations received and the amount of scholarships disbursed, which were published in the newspaper two days ago, all cases designated by donors for this year's scholarship program were also finalized yesterday at a meeting of the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Office, bringing this year's scholarship activities to a close. The details are as follows:

In Memory of Mr. Dingfu: Scholarship Recipient List

The Gu Xin Yi Cheng Zhai brothers, in memory of their late father, Mr. Dingfu, established a scholarship fund for impoverished middle school students, providing five scholarships to cover tuition, fees, and book expenses for each student until their high school graduation. On January 19, they wrote to this newspaper requesting the selection of outstanding students. After investigation and assessment, the first-place winner of the junior high school entrance exam, Jin Jin Guan, the second-place winner, Liu Yan Quan, the third-place winner, Fei De Kai, the fifth-place winner, Wu Bi Chang, and the sixth-place winner, Zhang Li Zhen, were selected.

Mr. Chen and Mr. Tan Offer Scholarships and Plan for Future Prospects

This newspaper received a letter on February 12 from Mr. Chen Bingyun and Mr. Tan Xingbo of Dahua Bank, requesting the selection of ten outstanding high school students from the first, second, and third grades, and one student each specializing in agriculture, engineering, medicine, and accounting, with Mr. Chen and Mr. Tan covering their tuition and book expenses. Last Sunday, this newspaper sent personnel to meet with the fourteen selected outstanding students: Shi Chengyue, Zheng Youjia, and Huang Jianhai from high school first grade; Wang Shiwei, Ni Jiagu, Ding Chonggao, and Li Yueyi from high school second grade; Zhu Fajia, Yu Zongrui, and Chen Jianyuan from high school third grade; Zhu Chengyuan from the accounting department of the university group; Xia Fuxiu from the electrical engineering department; Tang Ye from agricultural science; and Gao Yunhan from medical science. Mr. Chen and Mr. Tan offered words of encouragement to the students, urging them to focus on their studies, strive for self-improvement, and not fail the expectations of society and the nation. They also stated that if the students work hard, they will continue to support them until they complete their studies and, within their capabilities, stabilize their lives. They are also considering future career paths. For the graduating middle school students of this year who wish to seek employment, they will employ them to the best of their abilities or introduce them to other opportunities. The spirit of Mr. Chen and Mr. Tan is greatly beneficial to impoverished students and of profound significance.

Generous Donations from All Sectors, Prudently Allocated by This Newspaper

In addition, (1) Ms. Yi Gongmu of the Young Women's Christian Association donated 10,000 yuan to support this newspaper's scholarship campaign. The association is currently investigating the family circumstances and academic performance of various middle school students. (2) Mr. Sheng Yudu, with the assistance of the Shanghai Municipal Council, generously donated tuition and fees for two high school graduates to attend university, 2,500 yuan per person per year, as well as scholarship funds from the Jing'an Temple Buddhist community, and Mr. Lao Qishi generously donated funds for the meals of outstanding students. These funds will be allocated according to regulations when students meeting the qualifications are selected. The Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Office has consulted and decided that only those meeting the original intentions of the donors will be allocated assistance.

Encouragement to Wu and Ni

The launch of this newspaper's readers' scholarship fund was prompted by letters from disaster-stricken children Wu Gengsheng and Ni Zhaoqi describing their difficult circumstances. Thanks to the generous donations from all sectors, not only were the disaster-stricken children benefited, but since the fourth session, impoverished students have also had the opportunity to continue their studies. Beneficiaries have numbered more than 5,000. This year, Wu and Ni were given tuition and fees according to regulations, and they were instructed to come to the newspaper office and urged to work hard in their studies, not to waste time or be idle, and not to fail the expectations of the donors.

Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday

The scholarship funds received yesterday totaled 250 yuan from Yang Shanyu, 200 yuan from Wang Zhizuo, 200 yuan from Banbutang, and 27 yuan, 8 jiao, and 7 fen (remaining funds) from the student body committee of Datong University, totaling 677 yuan, 8 jiao, and 7 fen. The remaining balance is 225,952 yuan, 3 jiao, and 9 fen.

Gratitude to the Central China Bank for its Enthusiastic and Responsible Handling of Scholarship Fund Revenue and Expenditure

This newspaper has been managing scholarship funds for four sessions. To ensure the proper expenditure of scholarship funds, it is stipulated that no cash is issued; instead, checks payable to the school authorities of the assisted students are used. The Central China Bank, where the scholarship funds are deposited in a special account, has been responsible for the revenue and expenditure for all sessions. This year, scholarships were issued to more than 1,700 students, and more than 300,000 yuan in scholarship funds were received daily from all sectors. During this short period, the Central China Bank handled the revenue and expenditure despite the cumbersome procedures. Its enthusiasm in serving the public and its assistance to this newspaper's scholarship efforts are deeply appreciated. In addition, the bank also donated blank checks. This newspaper, with gratitude, wishes to inform all those concerned about this newspaper's scholarship activities.

Retailers Must Adhere to New Sugar Prices

Must Not Sell at the Previous Month's Prices

Prices for Household Sugar and Oil Await Announcement

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, with the approval of the military authorities, has decided to implement sugar rationing per capita on the 11th of this month throughout the city. As for the sugar price, it was approved by the military authorities for a slight increase on the 28th of last month. As the per capita sugar rationing is about to be implemented, the office, to support the intentions of the rationing authorities, has temporarily reduced the sugar price slightly and has submitted it for approval, to be implemented from March 2nd.

Selling at Old Prices is Inappropriate

However, for the past two days, the prices charged by various Class A retailers have not been uniform, with most still selling at the prices set last month, leading to disputes with consumers. Therefore, the office has issued another notice to all Class A and B retailers, requiring them to strictly adhere to the newly set sugar prices and not to deliberately raise prices, violating the regulations. As for the retailers who have paid sugar fees at the newly set prices of last month, they can settle accounts with the office and calculate based on the date on the sugar tickets sold. Any outstanding payments must be paid promptly to ensure capital turnover. Violations of the above will result in the suspension of rationing and reporting to the authorities for punishment. Currently, the sugar sold by Class A retailers is a bundled sale of Dutch, red and green sugar, with a newly set price of 5.28 yuan per pound, excluding the two-cent retail donation.

Rationing Prices Await Announcement

Since the food administration authorities in the two concessions decided to implement a per capita rationing system for oil and sugar, and to issue additional miscellaneous grains, according to reports from Datong News Agency, they are currently actively investigating the inventory of these goods and conducting accurate statistics to facilitate equitable distribution. At the same time, it is learned that the authorities have not yet made a definite decision on the prices for the per capita rationing of sugar and oil. The currently prevailing sugar and oil prices are the prices at which the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office and the Edible Oil Wholesale Office sell their own goods. As for the prices set by the authorities for the per capita rationing system, although they may be the same as the current prices, the final decision awaits public announcements from the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council.

Shanghai-Qingpu Phase Two Cadre Training Institute: Trainees Begin Training

The Shanghai branch of the Qingxiang Committee, in view of the imminent start of Phase Two of Qingxiang in Shanghai, has established the "Phase Two Qingxiang Cadre Training Institute" to strengthen the cadre ranks of Qingxiang. Chen, the concurrently serving director, also serves as the institute's director, and Xu, the office director, serves as the deputy director. Li Wen, the director of the Youth Training Institute, serves as the education director, responsible for the overall training affairs of the institute. The majority of the recruited and admitted trainees have already reported on the designated dates (February 27-28), but some trainees have not been able to report due to transportation issues. It is reported that the institute has therefore extended the reporting date for trainees to the 3rd of this month. All trainees who have already reported began various academic and skill trainings on the 1st.

Dredger Hailong No. 2: Temporarily Moved Elsewhere, Returns to Chenjiazhui on the 15th

The Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Department announced that the Hailong No. 2 dredger of the Dredging Bureau was scheduled to work in the Chenjiazhui area, as previously announced in the department's Announcement No. 9 on October 16 of last year. The dredger has now been temporarily moved elsewhere and is scheduled to return to the Chenjiazhui area around the 15th of this month to resume dredging operations. All shipowners are hereby notified.

Readers' Forum: Guarantee Required for Issuing Identity Cards, Difficulties for Jia Chiefs; Cai Ji

The issuance of citizen identity cards in the French Concession has long been completed. When people come to Shanghai from the countryside and go to the police station to obtain an identity card, the police station requires a letter from the Jia Chief to act as a guarantor. The procedure is strict, but the method is not entirely satisfactory, and the Jia Chief often feels very difficult. If the person coming to Shanghai from the countryside is indeed a law-abiding and honest citizen, that is fine; otherwise, the Jia Chief will suffer for others, because these people are not related to the Jia Chief, and can even be said to be strangers.

My intention is not to say that the authorities' regulations on guarantees are unreasonable, but the guarantee should be the responsibility of the householder, because the landlord (householder) generally has some understanding of the tenant's behavior. If the tenant's behavior is found to be abnormal, the supervisory authority can be immediately notified to start an investigation, and the guarantor can also be relieved of responsibility.

Furthermore, the Joint Guarantee Office, which employs clerks with public funds, should not refuse the requests of illiterate people in the district (referring to the Joint Guarantee) to fill out movement certificates and application forms during their spare time. Although Jia Chiefs have the desire to "write letters on behalf of others," they are ultimately constrained by factory affairs and have the will but not the strength. Like me, I leave home early every morning and return late at night, and the procedures for signing and stamping movement certificates have to be handled by my daughter.

Reducing Household Movement Procedures: Movement Certificates Should Be Issued Promptly; Zi Ping

Since the establishment of the Baojia system, household movements within the concession must be registered within three days, and the original and duplicate copies of the movement certificate must be submitted to the Baojia office, which forwards them to the police station for filing, with a handling fee of one yuan, for which the police station issues a receipt. The duplicate copy of the movement certificate is stamped and returned to the Baojia office after being approved by the police station. The process of transferring the document takes a long time, often one or two months, causing much inconvenience to those who move. There are often cases where people leave Shanghai temporarily, have already returned, and reported their movement, but the certificate has not yet been signed. There is a need for revision. I believe that for temporary movements, registration with the Baojia office should be sufficient, and it is not necessary to fill out a movement certificate and submit it to the police station, or the person moving can directly send it to the police station for signing on the spot, which can avoid time-consuming transfers and the risk of omissions and errors. The above is the situation in the Zhabei district. Is it the same in other districts? I hope the authorities will reform this. (Moving expenses to support scholarships).

This City's Industrial Economy Last Year: From "Laissez-faire" to "Control"

(2) Other Weaving Industries: Two new factories were established last year to manufacture silk waste, which is supplied to woolen mills as a substitute for wool. Dyeing and weaving factories are following the trend of silk reeling factories by moving to silk-producing areas inland. Sales of hosiery factories have been sluggish due to a lack of export trade. Hat factories continue to ship goods using old hat bodies.

(3) Chemical Industry: Extracting caffeine from tea waste was one of the emerging industries last year, with rapid progress. There are currently as many as 40 such factories. Nine new bleach factories were established within the concession and ten in areas outside the concession. Sales of pharmaceutical factories have been strong due to the disruption of foreign drug supplies. There are currently more than 30 large factories manufacturing vitamins and endocrine products, employing more than 2,000 workers. Soap production has decreased due to the cessation of exports and rising raw material prices. Umami powder factories have not been active. Cosmetic factories had a successful year. The paint industry was average.

(4) Food, Tobacco, and Alcohol Industry: The beer manufacturing industry was quite active last year. Several flour mills have resumed operations because wheat can be obtained from inland areas. Oil pressing factories within the concession have temporarily ceased operations.

(5) Chinese Factories Manufacturing Machinery and Tools: Most of these factories stopped manufacturing these tools last year. Manufacturing bicycle and tricycle parts, as well as gas generators for automobiles, were emerging industries last year. The textile machinery manufacturing industry was fairly developed. The ironware industry was inferior to the previous year. Chinese boiler manufacturers have not been active.

(6) Other Industries: The papermaking industry was fairly active last year, unaffected by difficulties in obtaining raw materials and other supplies. Many glass factories suspended operations in the first few months of last year, but saw a slight improvement in July. Several Chinese rubber factories resumed shipping goods after receiving raw material allocations. Manufacturing rubber shoe soles to replace leather soles was quite developed. All coal briquette factories were busy shipping goods throughout the year to meet the needs of citizens. Clock factories have been converting to manufacturing phonographs, as there is a strong demand for phonographs inland.

Labor Conditions

After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Shanghai became an isolated island. The movement of various inventories and manufactured goods was restricted. Many factories suspended or reduced operations, resulting in the dismissal of entire factory workforces. At the same time, various factories managed by the military authorities, unless they were public utilities or of essential nature, were closed, which exacerbated the unemployment situation. In view of this, the authorities formulated measures for factories to pay severance allowances and implemented a plan to repatriate dismissed workers. Workers who wished to return to their hometowns were given an additional month's salary by the factory in addition to the usual severance allowance, which was remitted to the worker's home in their place of origin. At the same time, workers leaving Shanghai to return to their hometowns were entitled to half-price train and boat tickets. This bureau also cooperated with other authorities to set up an office for issuing return permits to sign and issue them.

Relief for Unemployment

To provide relief for unemployed workers, this bureau established a job placement section in the Industrial and Social Affairs Department to introduce unemployed workers. At the same time, many unemployed workers were employed in emerging industries, such as (1) after the cessation of motor vehicle transportation, various handcarts, tricycles, bicycles, etc., emerged to replace them. The increase in the number of these vehicles was unprecedented, so the factories manufacturing these vehicles were busy. (2) Vehicles need to be re-equipped due to the use of alternative fuels instead of gasoline. (3) The establishment of many charcoal kilns. (4) Manufacturing thick cardboard boxes to hold cigarettes, manufacturing celluloid tubes to hold toothpaste, and replacing the shells of thermos bottles with bamboo or wooden shells. (5) The establishment of caffeine factories. In addition, workers went to work in Central China, Manchuria, and other places.

2. Work Review of the Industrial Section

In January and February of last year, industrial section personnel were assigned to several temporary jobs, such as registering industrial raw materials, evacuating laid-off workers, and starting to enforce price limits. These personnel were not reassigned to their original positions until March.

A total of 352 reported accidental events occurred in various factories, including 30 fatalities. Personnel were dispatched to investigate 103 of these accidental events. After investigation, the factories were instructed to take preventive measures. A total of 59 fires occurred in various factories, injuring 19 workers and killing 10.

There were two cases of explosions of compressed air machinery in caffeine factories. This bureau subsequently issued a notice ordering all factory owners to have their compressed air machinery and steam boilers inspected by registered boiler engineers to ensure safety. Last year, 194 boiler inspection certificates were received, and 502 annual re-inspection certificates were received. Two new boiler manufactures were approved for registration, and nine boiler factory registrations were transferred. There were nine cases of violation of regulations on the use of compressed air machinery that were prosecuted in court (to be continued).

Shanghai Music Association: 20th Symphony Concert

The Shanghai Music Association is scheduled to hold its 20th symphony concert at 5:30 PM on the 7th of this month at the Lyceum Theatre on Rue Petain in the French Concession. The conductor will be Maestro Mei Baiqi, and the program will be quite exciting.

Charcoal Rationing Begins: Rationing Amount is 1,000 Dan, Wholesale and Retail Prices Remain Unchanged

According to a report from Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Charcoal Industry Association is currently carrying out rationing to supply charcoal for household use. The total amount to be rationed is reportedly 1,000 dan. The procedures are largely complete and are expected to be rationed in the next few days. The wholesale and retail prices will remain the same as before.

Hongqiao Sanatorium: Statistics on X-ray Examinations and Treatments for Half a Month, Tuberculosis Patients Account for Over One-Third, Examination and Treatment Certificates Still Sold by This Newspaper

The service department of the Hongqiao Sanatorium in this city has issued X-ray examination and treatment certificates to promote tuberculosis prevention and early treatment and to prevent transmission. Since work began last month, there has been a very enthusiastic response from all sectors.

Statistics on 385 Examinations are Reported as Follows: 114 people had normal cardiopulmonary findings, 129 people were found to have lung disease, including 49 people with bilateral pulmonary tuberculosis, 52 people with right-sided tuberculosis, 28 people with left-sided tuberculosis, of which 19 people had cavities, and 16 people had complications such as tuberculous laryngitis, fistulas, and peritonitis. 113 others suffered from deep bronchial shadows, including chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and bronchial asthma. 16 people suffered from pleurisy, 6 people suffered from cardiomegaly, 3 people suffered from pulmonary paralysis, and 2 people suffered from pneumonia. 2 people had deep hilar lymph node shadows. Among the tuberculosis patients, 26 were aged 15 to 20, 62 were aged 21 to 30, 30 were aged 31 to 40, and 11 were aged over 41, including 13 women.

From the above statistics, it can be seen that (1) those with pulmonary tuberculosis account for more than one-third of the total number of examinations, indicating the frightening hidden danger of lung disease; (2) those with right-sided pulmonary tuberculosis account for more than two-fifths; (3) the age of patients is most prevalent between 21 and 30 years old; (4) the number of female patients is not small; (5) the occupations of patients are mostly shop assistants and workers. They are all working and at risk of spreading tuberculosis at any time. The harm is truly unimaginable. It is reported that the X-ray examination and treatment are still ongoing. All those found to have lung disease will be assisted by the sanatorium with air treatment. X-ray examination and treatment certificates are still sold by the Shen Bao, priced at 10 yuan per certificate, and will be discontinued on the 20th of this month. It is hoped that all sectors will not miss this good opportunity to treat lung disease.

Sports News: Xuhui Charity Mini-Soccer Tournament; Xing Team and Bo Team Draw, Xuhui Beats Anhua

Referees from the mini-soccer referee association volunteered to officiate, and the results were excellent. The audience reached over 1,000. In the first game, Xuhui played Anhua.

In the second half, Anhua worked hard to improve, and Li Yao, with the help of Chen Zhuoguang, tied the score. Xuhui was unwilling to show weakness and launched a counterattack. Zhong Guiqing scored again. Xu Deming added icing on the cake. Xuhui defeated Anhua with a score of 3-1. In the final game, the Xing team gained the advantage of the kick-off and launched an attack. Meng Yiliang intercepted the route. The Xing team's generals withdrew midway. In less than ten minutes, Qu Yongfu of the Bo team suddenly rose up, with broad strokes, advanced alone, overtook Li Yichen, and made a wonderful pass to Wu Qixiang. Goalkeeper Zheng Yingquan was caught off guard and lost a goal. The situation of both sides entered a tense state, developing into a tug-of-war. The Xing team was unable to succeed. After the break, the Bo team was still not satisfied. Qu Fei and Wu advanced on three routes. Li Tiansheng of the Xing team desperately tried to block, but it was too late. Wu Qixiang scored again from 20 yards. Less than three minutes later, Sun Jinshun of the Xing team regained one goal. The Bo team suffered one misfortune after another. For a moment of carelessness, Song Sheng took the opportunity to break through and scored. The time ended. Both sides scored two goals each and shook hands to make peace.

Investment Status of Various Countries in Dutch Indian Agriculture (Unit: Thousands of Guilders)

--According to the Dutch Indian Department of Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry, 1931.--

Investment Status of Various Countries in Dutch Indian Mining (Unit: Thousands of Guilders):

The above table is based on the investigation by the Foreign Affairs Section of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office in 1937.

If we add the government's official investment and indirect investment such as issuing public bonds in addition to private enterprise investment, the total investment amount is 6 billion.

In addition to the above-mentioned industrial capital, international capital also has a decisive force in the financial sector of the East Indies.

International Investment Status in the Financial Sector of the East Indies:

The above table is based on Osaka Mainichi, "The United States and Britain's Influence on the East Asian Economy."

Japanese banks in the East Indies include branches of Taiwan Bank, Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui Bank, and Hua Nan Bank.

(V) Britain and the United States Manipulate the Dutch East Indies

The countries in the South Pacific are territories and colonies of the great powers and are politically dominated by their respective suzerain states. Their economic interests are mainly determined by political relations. The Dutch East Indies cannot escape this example. It is Holland's "unlimited treasure house" in the East and a source of economic development. Therefore, it is inevitable that Holland will support its economic power here.

Holland itself is a small country. Especially today, it has no real power in shipping and economics, and has to rely on the economic power of third countries. Therefore, in its colonies, while striving to support its own labor force, it has to adopt an open-door policy, implementing a relatively free policy on foreign capital, labor, and enterprises. This gives Britain and the United States an opportunity to take advantage.

The first to try to extend its power in the Dutch East Indies under Dutch rule was Britain. First, in terms of capital export and enterprise establishment, Britain resolutely suppressed other countries and strived for a superior position. Therefore, in special enterprises such as the sugar industry, which is exclusively operated by Holland, British capital has to compete with Holland, and in addition to investment figures, Britain has used the sale of networks to almost surpass Holland in reality. In trade, Britain has even greater dominance. So, in recent years, Britain's power in Holland has surpassed Holland.

The United States' activities in the Dutch East Indies were later than Britain's and its power was weaker, but the United States' economic position in the Dutch East Indies cannot be considered small. In particular, among the special products of the Dutch East Indies, such as rubber, tin, and quinine, are materials that occupy an important position in the industrial industries of the major powers, so the United States is also trying its best to support its power in the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, in order to open up the market for its own commodities, the United States will progress as soon as it finds a vacancy. The most obvious is the United States' oil enterprises in the Dutch East Indies.

International capital's invasion of the Dutch Indian oil enterprise started in 1883. Today, Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij (capital of 300 million guilders actually paid) is still the largest, with 60% of its funds belonging to Holland and 40% belonging to Britain. Second, N.C. Petroleum Company, affiliated with the US Mobil Oil Company, has a capital of 24.5 million guilders, with 10 million guilders actually paid, all of which is invested by the United States. In addition to capital, the company has a capital investment of about 100 million guilders. The third is the joint venture "Netherlands Indian Oil Company" between Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij and the Dutch Indian government, with a capital of 15 million guilders and 10 million guilders actually paid, with the Dutch Indian government and Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij each contributing half.

The Dutch Indian government has always given priority to its own country and Britain, and the United States has no room for activity. The only way that American enterprises have gained a foothold in the Dutch East Indies is in the last twenty years of the nineteenth century. By the 1930s, that is, in 1929, the United States' investment in the Dutch East Indies had reached 201.3 million US dollars, of which 135.1 million US dollars were invested in securities and 66.2 million US dollars were invested directly. Among the direct investments, 2 million US dollars were in commerce, 23.4 million US dollars were in rubber, and 40.8 million US dollars were in various enterprises including the petroleum industry. In recent years, direct investment has reached about 70 million US dollars. Mobil Oil Company dominates 40% of the Dutch Indian oil business, and its investment in the rubber business also ranks fourth. The increase in the United States' economic power in the Dutch East Indies also has political and military significance, which need not be explained.

In this world war, Holland was the first to collapse under Germany's attack. The Dutch Queen fled to London, and the Dutch government also moved to London, becoming a vassal of Britain. Due to the prolongation of the Anglo-German war and Japan's control of the Malay Peninsula, Holland naturally had no position to revive in East Asia. The United States took the place of Britain and Holland and extended its power in the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, although the politics of the Dutch East Indies are still in the hands of Britain, the economic guidance has been transferred to the hands of the United States. Thus, the Dutch East Indies' dependence on Britain has turned into dependence on the United States.

Japan has long been seriously watching the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch Indian authorities' policy of dependence on Britain and the United States violates Japan's true intention to build a Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. In this situation, Japanese-Dutch negotiations were conducted. Of course, these negotiations will not have any good results. Finally, the Dutch East Indies rejected Japan's request for "good neighborly friendship, coexistence, and co-prosperity." However, there have been no major changes in the relationship between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. When the Japanese army moved into Vietnam, the Dutch Indian government was stunned. Britain and the United States took retaliatory measures and followed the asset freeze order against Japan. The Dutch East Indies also announced the freezing of Japanese funds, namely:

(1) Exchange transactions between Japan and Holland are suspended.

(2) All exports to Japan, Manchuria, the occupied areas of China, and Vietnam must be specially authorized.

(3) Banks may not pay any money to Japanese people or receive any money from Japanese people without special authorization.

Since then, financial and commodity transactions between Japan and the Dutch East Indies must first obtain the permission of the Dutch Indian government, which is actually in a state of disapproval. On the other hand, Japan also implemented a trade control order, so transactions between Japan and Holland were completely suspended. This state did not end until the Japanese army entered the Dutch East Indies.

Economic Circle: Economic Translation and Discussion: Suggestions for Absorbing Surplus Purchasing Power

About ten years ago, Mr. Taniguchi Yoshihiko of Kyoto Imperial University published an opinion to supplement purchasing power, which was to discuss countermeasures for insufficient purchasing power. At that time, some people wrote articles pointing out his contradictions, but most people were very sympathetic, thinking that Mr. Taniguchi's sincere review provided scientific methods that were commendable.

Ten years later, it has become an inverse ratio. Especially in Central China, it is not only unnecessary to supplement purchasing power, but it is necessary to consider how to absorb purchasing power. Even Prime Minister Tojo of Japan said in the Japanese Diet that he wanted to absorb surplus purchasing power. This is true of Japan, and it is also true of China, especially in Central China. However, the difference is that the purchasing power in Central China is biased in one direction, and circulation is not smooth, but in any case, the effect of surplus purchasing power is consistent.

The tendency of speculation, hoarding, and scarcity in Shanghai is all stimulated by the increase in social purchasing power, especially the expansion of surplus purchasing power. It is expected that if purchasing power can be contracted, speculative hoarding will definitely be reduced. If the wind of hoarding decreases, then prices will naturally be stable, and rationing can naturally be smooth. So the question is how to absorb surplus purchasing power and how to eradicate commodity speculation.

What I am thinking of here is a measure, which is to issue commodity vouchers to absorb purchasing power. That is, use commodity vouchers to buy commodities that have become speculative targets. The commodity vouchers stipulate a certain year for redemption, and are repaid with physical objects or currency. When implementing this method, there must be some coercion, so that the purchase work has a possibility. Most of the purchased goods are transferred to the countryside as a means of exchanging for raw materials and food, and a part is sold at a fair price in the cities. If they are sold at a fair price in the cities, wouldn't they become the target of speculation and hoarding again? But on the one hand, we will use the means of absorbing currency to tighten their roots, so of course they will have no energy to buy and hoard. In this way, the two measures of currency and prices can be successful.

Judging from the recent situation, prices are rising step by step, the amount of materials on the market is gradually decreasing, and the pressure of life has reached its extreme. If we don't seek thorough and effective measures now and delay it, then even if we have a panacea in the future, we may not be able to revive it. Although I say this, I don't dare to presume that commodity vouchers are a panacea. In short, I hope that you can consider this point, and it may not be a powerful help.

### All Citizens Must Register Their Household at Their Place of Work to Prevent Evasion of Self-Defense Corps Duties and Dual Household Registration; Measures for Rationing Food Based on Population are Gradually Being Perfected, Fair and Just

According to inquiries with the Baojia (Neighborhood Watch) authorities, the scope of the Baojia system in the Public Concession has been rapidly expanding. Starting this Monday, registration of places of work has begun. Currently, the registered Baojia household records only indicate the individual's area of residence, or at most, the location where the resident is employed. However, in the future, the area Baojia household records where each resident works will also include the name of the employee. This measure aims to clarify the time that person spends working in the office or shop, so that appropriate times for self-defense duties can be scheduled. Another reason for this registration is to eliminate the phenomenon of dual household registrations, and to prevent the right to obtain double food rations. Individuals will only be allowed to obtain household registration certificates in their area of residence. Furthermore, according to Baojia personnel, some people work in this city, but their residences are located near Shanghai, where a complete Baojia system has not yet been established. Therefore, the authorities, for the sake of these people, will also provide them with food rations based on population, but will require them to undertake the duties of local self-defense members, so that obligations are equal to rights.

### Lieutenant General Matsui Sends Personnel to Inspect the Municipal Police

The Supreme Advisor to the National Government, Lieutenant General Matsui, has arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing. He was originally scheduled to inspect the Nanshi (South City) area yesterday and review the Municipal Police Force. However, due to being unable to spare the time for official duties, he temporarily dispatched Colonel Saito as his representative. The Commissioner of the Police Bureau, Lu Ying, personally received him, and a review ceremony was held in the large square of the Bureau. Lu accompanied Saito on a tour of the entire field before the review ceremony began at exactly 3:00 PM. The entire Police Force and personnel of the Bureau, as well as the chiefs of the three police sub-bureaus of Nanshi, Wang Delin and others, were fully armed and gathered in advance. The review procedures included a march-past and bayonet drill. The police participating in the review were neatly dressed, marched in formation, and were in high spirits. After the review, Colonel Saito expressed his appreciation and then delivered a speech on behalf of Lieutenant General Matsui, stating that the police were role models for the people. He noted that the skill and spirit of the police were rare in other places and highly commendable. He recognized Commissioner Lu's training and hoped that during this time of war, the maintenance of local security would rely on the cooperation of all officers under the leadership of Commissioner Lu to complete the task of protecting the area. Lu then delivered a reply, and the review ceremony concluded amidst the sounds of military music.

### The Registration Period for Radios in the Urban Area Will Not Be Extended; Over Five Thousand Have Already Been Registered

Lu Ying, Commissioner of the Municipal Police Bureau, has been tasked with handling the registration of wireless radios. The registration process began on May 15th of last year, originally scheduled for a period of two months. Later, due to the vast area of the urban district, the deadline was repeatedly extended with the approval of the Municipal Government, finally to the end of August. This was done to align with the registration procedures of the Public Concession. Finally, it was ordered that those who voluntarily completed registration within six months and provided sufficient justification would be exempted from punishment. However, the six-month deadline expired at the end of last month (February). It is now learned that the Municipal Supervisory Bureau yesterday received instructions from the Municipal Government that the supplementary registration measures should be abolished and no further extensions granted. The Bureau has ordered all sub-bureaus to comply. It is reported that over five thousand wireless radios have been registered in the urban area, excluding the Hongkew district.

### Shortage of Textbooks Makes Purchasing Extremely Difficult, Directly Hindering Educational Development; Urgent Appeal for Authorities to Find Ways to Remedy the Situation

According to Shanghai News Agency, since the outbreak of the Pacific War the year before last, due to a shortage of newsprint, bookstores have rarely printed large quantities of textbooks. They have only been selling what limited stocks they have. The stock of textbooks in the city is very limited and is gradually being depleted. Therefore, it has become very difficult to buy books in recent days. Without an introduction from someone influential or intervention by a school, not only are prices high, but it is difficult to buy anything. Primary and secondary schools have national textbooks that can be used, so there is still a remedy. However, high schools and specialized schools above that level simply have no books to use. Some schools issue lecture notes or have teachers lecture orally, with students taking notes. This is quite inconvenient for the students. As for original Western books, they have long disappeared, and booksellers are not daring to incur the huge cost of reprinting them. Under these circumstances, students can only buy used books. As a result, used bookstores are crowded, and the owners are taking advantage of the scarcity to arbitrarily raise prices. This situation is directly hindering the development of education, and the authorities should urgently find ways to remedy it.

### The Method of Exchanging for Noodle Products is Difficult for Bakeries to Follow; Very Few People Exchange for Finished Products

In order to thoroughly understand whether members have used the flour allocated by the Public Works Department and whether there is black market activity, the Bakers' Association sent personnel to conduct detailed investigations at various shops from February 20th. This was completed yesterday. According to the Association's investigators, most members, in order to comply with the authorities' intentions, had used a portion of the allocated flour to produce food for residents to exchange. However, in practice, business was very slow, and the food made with the flour suffered unwarranted losses. Therefore, under these circumstances, noodle shops in bustling areas are still struggling to purchase high-priced black market flour to make and sell food in order to maintain the livelihoods of their employees. However, shops in remote locations have been forced to close. This is the real situation, and there is no denying it.

### The Nanshi City God Temple Held a Terror Drill Yesterday, Cutting off Traffic for One Hour

Yesterday at 5:30 PM, a terror drill was held at the Nanshi City God Temple and Yu Garden Road. First, someone disguised as a terrorist threw a firecracker bomb that exploded near the Liyuan Tea House. Then, two shots were fired from the Lepu Lang Tea House before fleeing. The head of the Yimiao Precinct, Wang Baosui, the head of the Zhonghua Road Sub-Bureau, Jiang Ziyun, and the entire officers and police of the Xieqiao Sub-Bureau, along with a large number of detectives, surrounded the City God Temple to arrest the suspects. At the same time, all the iron gates were closed, cutting off traffic. As a result, a citizen named Hu captured a man dressed as a terrorist on Ninghui Road at 6:15 PM. The lockdown was lifted and traffic restored at 6:30 PM.

### Internal Organizational Structure of the Municipal Welfare Bureau

The Municipal Social Welfare Bureau officially announced its establishment on the 1st of this month. The newly appointed Director, Sun Mingqi, has assumed his duties. Following the resolution of the Supreme National Defense Council and the implementation order of the National Government, the Social Movement Committee and the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee have been merged, and the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau has taken over. The internal structure of the bureau has been set up with six sections and two offices, in accordance with regulations. The six sections are numbered sequentially, and the two offices are the Secretary's Office and the Chief Accountant's Office. The candidates for section chiefs and office directors are currently being selected and should be officially announced in the next few days.

### A Special Pass Will Be Issued During Special Blockades in the Hongkew Area for Use by Civil Servants; Police Will Make a Proposal to the Authorities

According to Shanghai News Agency, Pan Da, Chief of the Hongkew Police Bureau, told reporters yesterday morning that in order to avoid inconvenience for civil servants and to reduce difficulties for police officers, he will soon propose to the relevant authorities the issuance of passes for special blockades. This measure is intended to strengthen the implementation of special blockades but will not inconvenience personnel on official duty or with important tasks. In the Hongkew area, terror and air defense drills are frequently held, which greatly inconveniences civil servants who need to travel for official business. Therefore, it is necessary to issue special passes to prevent this kind of inconvenience. However, before this system is implemented, it is hoped that citizens will cooperate to reduce difficulties.

### Pan Da, Chief of the Hongkew Police Bureau, Addresses the Police, Encouraging Officers to Be Hardworking, Tolerant, Honest, and Self-Respecting, and to Strive for Survival in Difficult Times and Work Hard in Their Duties

Pan Da, Chief of the Hongkew Police Bureau, addressed the police yesterday, encouraging them to be hardworking, tolerant, honest, and self-respecting. His words were roughly as follows: "Comrades, every morning before starting our work, we gather in the training ground and hold a flag-raising ceremony. We should read the Bureau's service creed, and I hope everyone will be invigorated every day to work hard for the country and the people. Today, I have a few simple words to share with you. We have been serving as police officers in the Hongkew area for more than 20 months, from the establishment of the Special Police Headquarters to the current Police Bureau. In the beginning, Hongkew was called 'a land of rascals,' and we used great effort to eliminate opium, expel bandits, maintain order, and establish security, so that the citizens within the area could live and work in peace. To this day, this spirit of service continues to flourish, and I am well aware of it. The superiors and the community also feel it. However, we must not be complacent in our work, but must do it better and better. We must not complain about the meager material benefits, but should feel the joy of serving the public. Recently, I have heard police officers secretly complaining. Some say that we police officers receive a salary of 93 yuan per month. Single people can barely get by, but it is very difficult for those with families to support. Some wives can work as vendors or laborers to supplement the family income, but not all police officers' wives can do so, and they feel great pain in their lives. Others say, 'The Commissioner enforces the law too strictly and does not allow any police officers to engage in any corrupt behavior.' When I heard these two kinds of words, I felt infinite emotion in my heart. I have long known about the hardships of police life and express my deep sympathy. I often petition the superiors to comprehensively improve the situation so that everyone can serve with peace of mind. However, you must know that our salaries are determined by the government. During this time of war, everyone must be hardworking and tolerant, and strive for survival in difficult times. As for being honest, law-abiding, and self-respecting, these are the creeds that we public servants should adhere to. We must accept them with sincerity and absolutely strive to practice them."

### The Fire Department Tested New Fire Engine Ladders Yesterday, Which Can Be Raised to the Highest Floors of the International Hotel

In order to reform the fire-fighting services in this city, the Public Concession Fire Department has hired various technical experts, recruited firefighters, and actively trained them to be proficient in the latest fire-fighting techniques. According to the Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Fire Brigade recently manufactured several new fire engines and ladders. Yesterday morning (3rd) at 8:25 AM, it tested the lifting efficiency of the newly manufactured mechanical ladder in front of the International Hotel on Park Road, Jing'an Temple Road.

### Forging Cooperation Office Stamp to Illegally Obtain Household Sugar; Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment

Zhang Haibo, a rickshaw puller from Nanjing residing at No. 64 Pingjili Road, borrowed two housing tax receipts from Pan Yucheng, a police officer at No. 1301, on January 19th of this year. He forged the stamp of the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, stamped it on the housing tax receipts, and went with his friend Pan Agou to a sugar shop on McTyeire Road to buy sugar. They were discovered, and the arrest was reported. The above three people were detained, and Wu Bocheng, a clerk from the 39th Lienpao Office of the Mailan District, was also put on record and sent to the Second Special Court. They were prosecuted for the crime of forging seals. The trial has now concluded, and yesterday Zhang Haibo and Pan Agou were each sentenced to three months imprisonment. Pan Yucheng and Wu Bocheng were found not guilty.

### Civil Servants in the Urban Area are Limited to Seven Days to Automatically Cease Performing Legal Duties

The government has long explicitly stipulated that civil servants must not simultaneously perform legal duties. It is now learned that the Municipal Government believes that some civil servants in its affiliated agencies are still simultaneously performing the duties of lawyers, which is a disregard for government orders. If this is not stopped, there is a deep concern that it will easily lead to abuses. Therefore, it has ordered the various bureaus to instruct all their affiliated civil servants to comply. Those who are currently practicing law must automatically cease performing legal duties within seven days of receiving this document and submit the documents submitted to the Bar Association to the Municipal Government for review. No errors are permitted.

### Gandhi's Hunger Strike Ends; Minister Hirota Expresses His Opinion: Truly Opens a Glorious Page in the History of the Independence Movement

Indian revolutionary leader Gandhi, in order to resist the cruel oppression of British imperialism, spy on India's independence, and complete liberation, was arrested and imprisoned, fasting for three weeks, ending yesterday (3rd). Minister Hirota of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, at the usual press conference at 3:00 PM yesterday (3rd), expressed that Gandhi's firm intention in this hunger strike truly opened the greatest glorious page in the history of India's independence movement.

Deeply Moved by the Arduous Struggle

According to reports, Gandhi expressed his determination to fight for India's independence, fasting for three weeks, which is now completed. Despite his advanced age and frail body, Mr. Gandhi is still struggling hard for national independence and opposing British oppression. We are deeply moved by this and express our deep respect. Gandhi's firm anti-British repression, expressed through a hunger strike, aims to achieve the ultimate goal and truly create one of the greatest glorious pages in the history of India's independence movement. At the same time, the Indian people are also continuing to move forward towards the greatest goal of the independence movement, strengthening their resistance to the tyranny of British imperialism. However, Britain has stubbornly ignored this and continued its oppression of India as always. British Colonial Secretary for India Amery once made a statement on the oppression of India, stating that the British government would not change its policy towards India in the slightest due to Gandhi's hunger strike.

Japan Has Long Been Determined to Aid India

Since Japan initiated the Greater East Asia War to plan the restoration of East Asia and liberate the East Asian people, laying the foundation for victory, the Japanese government has long expressed its determination to aid the Indian independence movement. Since the National Government announced its participation in the war against Britain and the United States, and Gandhi's hunger strike occurred, the Chinese and Japanese authorities are now discussing mutual aid to liberate the Indian people from British shackles. Furthermore, look at the attitude of Chongqing towards India. On the surface, they sympathize with Gandhi's hunger strike, but in reality, they are taking the same steps as Britain to oppress India and force concessions to Britain. Finally, it is said that in order to restore East Asia, China, Japan, and India should cooperate closely to establish a new order in East Asia and ensure co-existence and co-prosperity, hoping that India will achieve independence soon.
