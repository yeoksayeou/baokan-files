### Suggestions for Expanding the Student Aid Movement

The nation currently needs a large number of new talents to implement policies, and in the future, it will need even more new talents to engage in construction. Moreover, all sectors of society, including industry and commerce, urgently feel the lack of true talent. However, on the one hand, a large number of young people are forced to drop out of school midway due to their inability to afford tuition fees. This is a phenomenon of social contradiction.

In order to eliminate this contradictory phenomenon, enable motivated young people to enroll in school, and ensure that the nation and society have an inexhaustible supply of needed talent, the most ideal approach is, of course: First, the government should universally increase the number of national schools at all levels, from elementary to secondary; Second, the government should increase the number of universities and specialized schools in each province, with free admission for all; Third, universally develop vocational education and increase the number of various vocational schools in each county and city to create the most needed types of talent. However, these are, after all, ideals that can only be hoped for in the future. In reality, the national treasury is depleted, and expenditures are enormous. It is impossible to fully rely on the government. Therefore, we are particularly focused on the efforts of the student aid movement, hoping to gather the strength of society to help young people obtain opportunities to continue their education as much as possible.

The student aid movement enables those who have dropped out of school to enroll, cultivating talent for the nation and society. It is both a social movement and a cultural movement, with a great impact on the future of the nation and society. Therefore, it is by no means something that a certain part of society or organizations can promote and complete independently. Therefore, we have always called on all parties to promote it. Today, we hope that the government will come forward to lead or assist, so that the student aid movement can expand from Shanghai to all parts of the country. Therefore, in addition to earnestly appealing to all sectors of society to provide more powerful assistance and co-advocacy for the student aid movement, we also earnestly expect the government authorities to consider the following three points:

First, most public and national schools, from elementary schools to secondary schools and even colleges and universities, have implemented a free education system. However, in reality, national and public schools are not only located in a few major cities, but also the number of students they can accommodate is a very small percentage compared to the number of school-age children and young people nationwide. Therefore, it is necessary to seek the assistance of private schools. However, private schools have limited sources of funding, the number of free places is extremely limited, and tuition fees inevitably tend to increase to cover expenses. In this way, the number of students that private schools can admit and cultivate for the nation is extremely limited. A large number of young people still have to wander outside the gates of schools. Therefore, we believe that if the government's financial resources cannot substantially and universally increase the number of schools at all levels, it must (1) supervise private schools to increase the number of free places and admit more poor students, especially for various specialized schools and universities, while also considering the actual situation of private schools and providing appropriate subsidies. (2) Specifically commend and reward those with foresight in society who are enthusiastic about the student aid movement and have made special achievements in contributing efforts or money, creating a temporary trend so that all sectors of society can recognize that "helping students is the best deed" and that everyone regards donating to help students as a supreme honor and responsibility.

Second, although there are no reliable statistics on the exact number of young people who have dropped out of school nationwide, judging from the facts that can be seen daily, the number must be very alarming. The main reason for dropping out of school is poverty and the inability to afford the cost of schooling. In ancient China, as long as one focused on learning, as long as one could borrow a few volumes of classics, studied by the light of fireflies and carved a hole in the wall, or pricked their thighs to stay awake while suspending themselves from beams, after ten years of hard study, it was not difficult to stand out and achieve high office. However, those who truly study knowledge already "spend their whole lives studying classics" and sigh when looking at history. Nowadays, affairs are becoming more complex, and the boundaries of knowledge have greatly expanded. Although there are still individuals who can be of great use to the nation and society through self-study outside of school, they are ultimately limited to a few outstanding geniuses. Generally speaking, one must still enroll in school. However, at present, families below the middle class are indeed unable to bear the cost of their children's education. Therefore, we hope that the government authorities will establish measures to help poor children study, so that children from poor families can have the opportunity to enroll in school. At the same time, special student aid and scholarship measures should be established, so that poor children with particularly excellent grades can receive awards in addition to receiving student aid. Student aid can be limited to one semester, and the period of student aid can be reduced for those with poor grades, while scholarships for those with particularly excellent grades and conduct can guarantee the completion of their studies for a certain period and even provide opportunities for further education. In this way, the effect of cultivating talent can be achieved.

In addition, we must raise the issue of the education of the children of current civil servants. Civil servants are intellectuals in our country. From the perspective of education and eugenics, their children are also more outstanding. However, in terms of the actual lives of current civil servants, those in the lowest salary grades earn only 150 yuan per month, including subsidies, which is just as difficult to afford the cost of their children's education. As a result, outstanding children are forced to drop out of school. We hope that the government will establish special student aid measures for the children of civil servants. In addition to completely free education in national and public schools at all levels, those who study in private secondary schools, specialized schools, and private universities should have clearly stipulated official funding for student aid. We believe that this will, on the one hand, prevent civil servants from being distracted by their children's education in their official duties, which can improve political efficiency, and on the other hand, allow a large number of outstanding children to study with peace of mind. The future gains for the nation and society are immeasurable!

### Japanese Ambassador Tani Masayuki Returns to Nanjing: Progress Expected in Policy Towards China, Fundamental Treaty Revision, Further Cooperation, Handling Various Issues on an Equal and Reciprocal Basis

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, recently returned to his country, repeatedly held important discussions with government authorities on promoting policy issues, and has reached a complete consensus of opinion. He arrived in Shanghai on the 20th and held various official discussions with Ministers Horiuchi and Tajiri in Shanghai, as well as with Shanghai Special Mayor Chen Gongbo, National Government Supreme Economic Advisor Shotaro Ishiwata, and President of the North China Development Company, Takashima, on many important matters. He will take a flight from Shanghai to Nanjing at 2:00 PM on the 22nd, accompanied by Councilor Ota and Secretary Shimizu.

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Since Japan dispatched Tani Masayuki as the new ambassador to China in order to closely cooperate in implementing policies towards China, the people of our country have expressed great welcome to this friendly measure. Ambassador Tani recently returned to his country for duty and policy direction towards China. After completing his official duties, he returned to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 22nd. During his return to the country, Ambassador Tani held cordial talks in Shanghai with Mayor Chen, Ministers Horiuchi and Tajiri of the Japanese Embassy, National Government Supreme Economic Advisor Ishiwata, and President of the North China Development Company, Takashima, and the results were quite satisfactory. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese government's policy towards its overseas envoys is completely consistent, and there will be rapid and concrete progress in both the political and economic aspects of its policy towards China. The important content of the so-called policy towards China has been explained by Prime Minister Tojo at the 82nd extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet, that is, fundamentally revising the Sino-Japanese Treaty to further advance the cooperative system between the two countries. From this, it can be seen how important Ambassador Tani's mission is on this return to his country. It is expected that China and Japan will handle further issues on an equal and reciprocal basis, such as abolishing taxation in the extraterritorial rights in China, adjusting national policy companies, and handling the Shanghai International Settlement, so as to further strengthen the strength of the National Government. Therefore, Ambassador Tani's return to Nanjing to handle issues such as future policies towards China is expected to be quite effective.

### Executive Yuan Meeting Yesterday Passed: Restoration of National Zhejiang University and Passed Draft Measures for Reforming the Handling of Official Documents

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Executive Yuan held its 167th meeting on the 22nd and passed many important cases. The following is an excerpt: (1) The President submitted for discussion, according to the Administrative Efficiency Promotion Committee's signed presentation, in order to implement the Outline for Promoting Administrative Efficiency, stipulating the first phase of the work plan, a draft of measures for reforming the handling of official documents. It was resolved to pass the case and ordered by the Yuan to be promulgated and implemented separately. (2) The President submitted for discussion, according to the signed presentation of the Administrative Efficiency Promotion Committee for formulating the "Outline for Improving Central Administration" and the "Outline for Improving Local Administration," and asked for review, etc., and asked for a resolution. It was resolved that the Central Outline was passed, and the Local Outline was still submitted to the committee for supplementation. (3) The President submitted for discussion, regarding the case previously submitted by the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting the restoration of Zhejiang University, and successively instructed the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance to submit opinions. With the approval of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Secretariat of the Yuan signed and presented opinions. It was resolved to pass the restoration of National Zhejiang University, and all preparatory matters were handed over to the Ministry of Education for handling. (4) The President submitted for discussion, the preparatory committee of the Third Congress of the East Asian Medical Association, headed by Chairman Chu, submitted the organization rules of the preparatory committee and the budget for preparatory expenses, congress expenses, and medical research expenses, and requested public review. It was resolved to pass the budget for review.

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Executive Yuan held its 167th meeting yesterday and passed a draft of measures to reform the handling of official documents in order to promote administrative efficiency. According to the format of official documents in our country, the procedures are cumbersome. Although the format was stipulated since the beginning of the Republic of China, it is still not in line with the modern rules of documentation. Therefore, it still retains the official habits of the Ming and Qing dynasties, which is more backward than general academics. To date, it has failed to use faster scientific methods such as typing, copying, and duplicating. The procedures through which official documents pass, such as initiation, discussion, drafting, submission for approval, judgment, writing, stamping, and sealing, often delay time until they are sent to and received by the receiving agency. On the one hand, the transportation agencies have failed to develop, which makes the exchange of official documents even slower. The accumulated abuses not only reduce work efficiency but also affect the spirit of civil servants. The secretaries of official offices are like the assistants in the Qing Dynasty. When Chairman Wang was the President of the Executive Yuan before the Incident, he once proposed reforming the format of official documents in an attempt to improve administrative efficiency, and many changes were made for a time. After the Incident, the old habits were restored, and the use of form was especially emphasized. This reform plan is expected to greatly benefit administrative efficiency. Moreover, under the current wartime system, everything should be based on speed and economy. The current method of official documents in our country is neither fast nor economical in terms of paper use, and reform is really necessary and cannot be delayed. Recently, things related to shop signs and all things related to official documents should be treated in the same way. To change the old habits, the passage of this case by the Executive Yuan is expected to greatly benefit administrative efficiency and the spirit of civil servants. People from all walks of life hope that the authorities will thoroughly implement it to conform to the wartime system.

### Count Kuroda Discusses Issues of Sino-Japanese Cultural Exchange

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Count Kuroda Kiyoshi, a director of the Japan International Cultural Promotion Association, came to Nanjing again on the afternoon of the 17th for the sake of communicating with East Asia and revitalizing Chinese international culture. Count Kuroda had previously come to Nanjing to host the Exhibition of Modern Japanese Paintings. This time, he came to Nanjing specifically to visit various parties, connect and communicate on Sino-Japanese cultural matters, and presented two huge modern Japanese books to the Chairman. At 3:00 PM on the 22nd, Count Kuroda went to the Chairman's residence to pay respects to the Chairman. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Count Kuroda to explore the future tasks of the International Cultural Promotion Association. Count Kuroda answered the questions raised as follows: (Question) How is the current stage of work for promoting international culture? (Answer) Promoting international culture is to promote the emotional integration between countries and to promote it to become world civilization. In 1939, the European War spread and the global cultural industry was at a standstill. Therefore, promoting international culture is a matter of urgency. The current stage of work often starts with China and Japan. The current stage of work is how to complete the cultural exchange between China and Japan, and during the Great East Asia War, the cultural exchange between China and Japan is extremely important. The Association will devote all its manpower and material resources to this important mission. In the future, it will often send staff to Nanjing to carry out various Sino-Japanese cultural exchange activities. Regarding the Sino-Japanese cultural exchange work, it is currently being promoted with the Japanese Ambassador to Nanjing and Councilor Ito, who is also the Minister of Culture, and hopes that all sectors of China will assist. (Question) How is the preliminary work for building the Greater East Asia culture? (Answer) Promoting international culture starts with building the Greater East Asia culture. The preliminary work for building the Greater East Asia culture is to complete the Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. The so-called Greater East Asia culture has two aspects: one is to strive to promote the culture of one's own country, and the other is to absorb the culture of other countries and integrate it into the Greater East Asia culture that adapts to the times. Both China and Japan have a long history. China can strive to promote its inherent culture of more than 3,000 years of history, while also studying the latest academic knowledge and promoting China's unique and brilliant culture. Japan should also strive to promote its culture of more than 3,600 years since its founding, and then join its friendly country China in advancing towards the construction of the Greater East Asia culture. Because the culture of China and Japan has had its glorious existence in history, with its long history helping each other, the completion of the Greater East Asia culture is not far away. (Question) What are your impressions of the state of Chinese culture during the war? (Answer) During the war, China is actively promoting the New National Movement, and the promotion of the New Movement is also closely related to Chinese culture. Its main goal is to revive China and defend East Asia, and to promote wartime culture, we must first start by training young people. In building the Greater East Asia culture today, we have great hope for the New National Movement. The close cooperation between modern young people in China and Japan is what we seek. Finally, Mr. Kuroda also explained that the East Asian Renaissance is based on moral spirit and is vastly different from European utilitarian thought.

### Bose's Radio Speech in Japan: Resolved to Strive for Indian Independence

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Indian patriot Jiang Tela Bose gave a speech on the radio here last night, saying in essence: The Japanese army has achieved brilliant results in Hong Kong, the Philippines, East India, Malaya, Singapore, and Myanmar. At present, its mighty army is suppressing the Indian border. This reality in East Asia cannot be ignored no matter how the British and American sides promote it. In the history of British rule in India, the British any general has probably not considered when the eastern border of India will be threatened by the enemy. As far as India is concerned, the most important thing at present is the current state of India's environment." Prime Minister Tojo has repeatedly stated on behalf of the Japanese government his determination to drive British and American forces out of India, especially the recent statement by Prime Minister Tojo on actively assisting India is extremely important. Moreover, Britishism's policy towards India has a direct and important relationship with India, and there has still been no improvement, because the growth of the British Empire is inseparable from India, and Britain's existence today is caused by the invasion of India's wealth and resources. As far as Britain is concerned, they currently believe that India will forever be a territory of the British Empire, and the purpose of Britain's current war is to try to preserve India. Therefore, they believe that recognizing India's independence is tantamount to losing the glory of their empire, and therefore Britain will do everything in its power to try to ensure India. Therefore, I can frankly state that the refusal of British politicians to recognize India's independence is not a crazy move, and it is a true madness for us to expect the British to one day automatically abandon the idea of ruling India. Britain has lost a part of its territory in this war, and therefore Britain's only hope to try to fill this loss is to squeeze India even more after the war. In short, Britain's position is becoming more and more deteriorated due to the war, and in the future, it will be more necessary to ensure India. Although there are flaws in Britain's imperialist policy, it cannot be considered that it will change, and it is not known whether Britain has thought of establishing a compromise policy with India. What I want to solemnly point out here is that Britain's intention to adopt a compromise policy towards India is by no means to recognize India's independence, but to try to divert the direction of the Indian people's struggle for independence, and its ultimate attempt is to eliminate the will of the Indian people. You must know that those who are independent do not recognize any compromise. We must fight to win true freedom. Therefore, to achieve this goal, we must pay a bloody price. Therefore, we should continue our struggle with firm contentment and immovable belief until we build an independent India from the ashes.

### Germany is Seeking New Ways to Fight the Soviets on Military and Political Fronts Asahi Shimbun Examines the Current Stage of the War

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) The 22nd marks the second anniversary of the German-Soviet war. The Asahi Shimbun published a Berlin dispatch yesterday, thoroughly examining the current stage of the German-Soviet war. The gist of it is as follows: Half of June has passed, and the German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front still face each other with large forces, showing no intention of launching a large-scale offensive. Both sides are only mutually promoting "the enemy is approaching a major offensive." This kind of promotion may be to wait for the other side to start the attack, or it may be for other purposes. From the German side, it has actually consumed one and a half months of valuable time since the beginning of May, when it could have launched its favorite mobile warfare. Inferring from this point, it is impossible not to use the subtle effect different from last year's European war situation as a basis for judgment. Because militarily speaking, last year's Eastern Front was only one front of operation, which was OK. This year, after the retreat from Tunisia, in order to prevent the British and American forces from landing in Europe, it is necessary to build a "Fortress Europe" in Europe, so it has now formed a two-front operation. Therefore, it is impossible to say whether Germany's current move to concentrate its forces on the Eastern Front is beneficial. In addition to the changes in the military situation, there is also an important reason, that is, Germany's operational policy against the Soviet Union has gradually changed in the political aspect. The so-called change is the comprehensive strength of the land, resources, manpower and spiritual power, etc., delivered by the Soviet Union, that is, the so-called "resource power of the Soviet Union." Germany has begun to re-examine it. The decisive battle against the Soviet Union, which was previously aimed at solving it militarily, has also changed its angle and incorporated a strong political nature. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the German-Soviet war, this is indeed a very thought-provoking issue. The two years of deadly struggle between Germany and the Soviet Union have now reached a new stage. As the war situation has progressed to this day, Germany must strengthen its understanding of the following points: (1) It is difficult to use blitzkrieg warfare against the Soviet Union, which has such a huge combat power. (2) Because the Communist Party organization is unexpectedly strong, although the German army has achieved considerable great results, it still cannot expect the political collapse within the Soviet Union. (3) The occupation of vast territories and the large-scale destruction of Soviet troops and weapons have indeed dealt a major blow to the Soviet Union, but it cannot be concluded that the Soviet Union's resistance has declined. (4) Because the Soviet Union is a communist dictatorship, it does not care about personal life and property at all, so it is thoroughly carrying out a tragic modern total war. The Soviet Union really has the most suitable national organization for this. (5) Because the Slavic nation has a different character from ordinary Europeans, and the result of the combination of this new Soviet national character and the inherent Russian patriotism has formed a special combat spirit of the Soviet soldiers. This spirit is not understandable by ordinary Europeans. It is natural that Germany has strongly reflected on the above lessons learned from the past two years. Therefore, Germany's new policy against the Soviet Union in the future, whether military or political, will naturally be generated by this reflection.

### Germany Praises Japan's Policies and Has Begun to Study Them in Detail

Regarding this matter, the National Socialist Party's organ newspaper, "National Newspaper," published an article on June 4th entitled "Transformation." This article was written anonymously by a reporter who served in the Eastern Front. He clearly pointed out that Germans' previous understanding of Russia was wrong, and hinted that Germany's policy towards the Soviet Union had changed. Since the start of the German-Soviet war, the German newspapers have shown a view of the Russians. At that time, they did not observe the surface, but said that the Russians were savage and beastly races. It is the first time to criticize the value of the Soviet people with such a calm nerve in the German newspaper, so this discussion is quite noteworthy. In addition, in order to thoroughly resolve this anti-communist front, Germany is now seeking new ways to fight the Soviet Union in both military and political aspects. What is particularly interesting is that Germany has always paid attention to Japan's method of resolving the Manchurian Incident, its policy on handling the Sino-Japanese Incident, and its various policies in the occupied territories in the South. Recently, it is determined to start researching them, especially after Prime Minister Tojo declared in the temporary Diet this year that the Philippines would be granted independent honor. The reaction in the German media was particularly significant, praising "Japan's policy of governing occupied territories." Moreover, looking at the various policies recently implemented by Germany in the eastern occupied territories, such as dissolving the Soviet-style forced labor and collective agriculture, recognizing private ownership of land, preparing to grant land guarantees to surrendered Soviet prisoners, providing for the lives of wounded and sick Soviet soldiers, planning to rebuild destroyed cities and villages with German currency, and releasing criminals previously convicted by the Soviets, all of which are manifestations of Germany's new policy towards the Soviet Union. Therefore, if we say that the first year of Germany's operational policy against the Soviet Union was to annihilate the main force of the Soviet field army, and the second year was to occupy Soviet land and resources, then the characteristic of the third year will be to solve this Soviet war, which still has many difficulties, with political power.

The German-Soviet War Has Been Going on for Two Years The Soviet Union Urges the Opening of a Second Front

Moscow, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) On the occasion of the second anniversary of the German-Soviet war on the 22nd, the Soviet Information Bureau issued a lengthy declaration entitled "The Second Anniversary of the Patriotic War," demanding that Britain and the United States immediately form a second front in Europe. The gist of it is as follows: It has been two years since the start of the German-Soviet war. In the summer of 1941, because the Soviet army's war preparations were not perfect, it had to allow the German army to achieve considerable success in the war. In addition, the anti-Axis countries that shared interests with the Soviet Union also failed to fully assist the Soviet Union with a large number of modern weapons that the Soviet Union did not yet produce. During this period, the Soviet people and the army have been tested and worked hard to defend against the German army's attacks until the end of 1941, when the German army's advance was stopped. From the summer of 1941 to the spring of the following year, the Soviet army was able to take advantage of natural conditions to counterattack Germany. By the summer of 1942, the German army took advantage of the failure to form a second front in Europe and launched another offensive, eventually occupying many strategic strongholds. However, with the help of Heaven, it was finally able to hold Stalingrad. In the past two years, the Soviet army's losses, including those who are missing, totaled 4,220,000 people, 35,000 cannons, 30,000 tanks, and 23,000 aircraft. However, it is difficult for the Soviet army to win the victory by fighting alone, so the formation of a second front in Europe as soon as possible is the key to winning the victory. If the second front is not formed, it will not be possible to defeat the German army, and because there is no second front, the German army will be able to leave a large number of troops with surplus, and repeat the mistakes of last summer. Therefore, the delay in the formation of the second front is a great damage to the common operation of the anti-Axis, and it only prolongs the war and increases the sacrifices.

### The Posture of German Wartime Enterprises (1)

— Iijima Masayoshi

The German Enterprise View

First, let's explain how the German enterprise situation differs from that of Japan. The Nazi Party organized the German Third Reich, and in 1934, it promulgated the so-called Labor Charter, and in 1937, it implemented the new Company Law. What these many regulations show about enterprises is very different from the previous concept. An enterprise is not a so-called profit-seeking organization. An enterprise is composed of a leader and many employees, and is a place to work hard for the welfare of the country and the nation. Therefore, working in an enterprise and producing goods is not necessarily for the purpose of making a profit for the capital of the enterprise, but for the profit of the country and the nation. The enterprise itself monopolizing profits is denied. All employees, except for the leader, the president, etc., do not work only to realize profits, but their purpose is to improve the welfare of the German country and the German nation. Therefore, if anyone violates this purpose, they must be subject to social sanctions. This is the unique point that differs from the previous concept.

Trusteeship Committee and Labor Management Officer

Because of this situation, the enterprise itself has an organization that can be called a Trusteeship Committee. Depending on the size of the enterprise, representatives are selected from the employees to serve as an advisory body to promote the enterprise's own enterprise purpose. These committee members, selected from the employees, become assistants to the president and participate in planning on measures such as improving labor conditions and increasing production efficiency.

This Trusteeship Committee has the right to demand the publication of the enterprise's profits as needed. Regardless of whether it has obtained considerable profits, if there are no welfare facilities for the employees, it can request correction and the operation of splitting into groups outside the company.

In order to properly use the above-mentioned enterprise purpose, of course, there is a need for a monitoring organization. Therefore, in each economic region, each region has a so-called Labor Management Officer who issues advice to each enterprise and has the right to accuse the entire employees from the president to the employees of places that do not conform to the enterprise purpose. Because the accusation is not a so-called criminal offense, it does not go through criminal trial, but goes through each court set up in each economic region.

The name belongs to the court and is a two-instance system. The first instance is in each economic region, and the appeal is in Berlin. Here, the Labor Management Officer accuses from the position of prosecutor. For example, if an employee is too lazy, they will be accused and tried by the Court of Honor. If the crime is minor, they will only be given a warning or ordered to be cautious. If the circumstances are serious, they will be dismissed from their position, and the leaders at the president level will be stripped of their powers. Once the headquarters and employees of the company are stripped of their powers, they cannot be employed again in Germany. As a result, they lose the necessary food for life and are subject to social sanctions. But in fact, people who have been subject to this kind of social sanctions have hardly been seen so far, which is due to the silent power of the Court of Honor.

How about in the aircraft industry? Raising the funds needed for the rapid expansion is a major problem. Relying solely on private capital will not be able to establish the aircraft industry after all, and will have to rely on government funds. There are two ways to do this: either the government pays off the construction funds in ten or fifteen years, or the government pays all the funds from the beginning. The US's plan to mass-produce 50,000 or 80,000 aircraft cannot be borne solely by the private sector, so private capital is raised under the guarantee that the government will pay it off in five years. In Germany, the policy of extending the repayment period as much as possible is adopted. If the enterprise is unable to repay, the government will bear 90% of it, and the enterprise will only bear 10% of it, setting up so-called credit lending. Now, most of the capital of a certain German aircraft company can be said to be government capital, but in fact, it is not built by relying on the government's own expenditures. The government is only guaranteeing its repayment.

Secondly, we should recognize the differences between the American-style and German-style enterprise forms in the aircraft industry. Most of the people engaged in building the German aircraft industry are those who went to the United States to engage in the American aircraft industry after World War I. They personally experienced the shortcomings of the American aircraft industry. After returning to Germany, they worked hard to study and remove its shortcomings, and created the current German aircraft industry. First, they created a manufacturing plant for manufacturing parts, then there was a department for assembling parts, and then there was the so-called aircraft general assembly department. In the American-style enterprise form, these three are all departments borne by the aircraft company. A part of the parts is manufactured by small private workshops and subcontracted workshops. But it is very difficult to calculate the overall balance with this method, and there is a risk that the needs of the aircraft will be known to the private sector. So how did Germany build its aircraft industry? Both parts manufacturing and parts assembly are borne by the aircraft industry. This is the case of two shifts, and the general assembly department can be completed in one shift. In the part of one shift, because there is surplus working capacity, the scale of its workshop can be expanded to a two-shift system in wartime. The Military Supply Supervision Office plans a mobilization plan for the entire manufacturing workshop, and as soon as the war starts, the two-shift system is implemented, attempting to double its work capacity. Specifically speaking, the eight-hour, one-shift work system in peacetime is changed to a ten-hour, two-shift work system after the start of the war. However, because working at night cannot improve work efficiency, it is quite difficult to achieve twice the productivity of peacetime. So civilian factories are requisitioned again, making them like the cooperative factories in Japan now. So as a result, the work efficiency reaches 1.7 times the production volume in peacetime.

Even with this, there is still a lack of a repair part. So in the workshops that manufacture parts and assemble parts, a certain proportion of auxiliary products are produced. How many aircraft and engines can be manufactured each month, and at the same time, a certain proportion of parts for repair are also made to have the ability to produce in parallel. This is very beneficial for guiding the flow operation. For example: if 30 aircraft are manufactured each month, the production plan adopted also manufactures parts equivalent to 300 aircraft. If it manufactures unsuitable items, it will issue an urgent red paper ticket to another workshop, so that it can catch up with the delayed project and allow the general assembly department to proceed smoothly.

One Factory, One Machine Principle

Therefore, the scale of these manufacturing plants does not have to be too large. Because from the perspective of mass production, the principle is to reduce the types of products of each manufacturing plant as much as possible. Therefore, in German aircraft manufacturing plants, each manufacturing plant manufactures one type of airframe or one type of engine, and does not exceed two types even in unavoidable cases.

From the perspective of defending the territory, it is an absolute condition to disperse the manufacturing plants that manufacture the same type of machine parts in two or more places in the country. In the case where a large-scale manufacturing plant manufactures several types of aircraft, if the manufacturing plant is bombed and stops working, it will obviously cause great obstacles in combat. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain two or more manufacturing plants that manufacture the same type of machine parts in the country. In the current situation, the same type of machine parts is being manufactured by six or seven manufacturing plants at the same time, so the damage suffered when an aircraft manufacturing plant is bombed can be reduced due to the decentralization.

Due to the above situation, the appropriate scale of the workshop should be small. In the military, the scope that a commander can command has its limits, and a commander cannot command tens of thousands of soldiers.

From this point of view, the most reasonable workshop scale in Germany should be five or six thousand people. If the number of employees is above this, it will be difficult for one president to command. At the beginning, the number of employees in each workshop was only about 3,000. As of last year, manufacturing plants with 5,000 to 6,000 employees accounted for the majority.

This matter is a necessary condition in terms of national land planning, especially in Germany. Assuming that Berlin is as lively and large-scale as Tokyo, and one-tenth of the total population is concentrated in Berlin, then even the food problem may become uneasy. Because the transportation agencies for concentrating food cannot only be free in wartime, but also because of the air raids, most of the land transportation agencies have to stop. How can they supply the large population of the big cities if they stop for a few days? Therefore, Germany is now considering that each city relies on the products produced nearby to support itself, so each manufacturing plant is also dispersed near each city and town that can obtain its employees.

As the war progressed, production efficiency gradually declined. The acquisition of employees has reached the end, and the lack of materials has also become a problem, so production cannot be increased. Therefore, how to increase production without increasing personnel and equipment has become an urgent task at hand. Therefore, the only way is to thoroughly implement technical exchanges. This was strongly requested by the German government to the people from the beginning of the war against the Soviet Union, but the speed of open technical exchange did not progress as the government had hoped.

So last year in February, Speer, who took over as Minister of Munitions after Todt, implemented national management of the munitions industry in May. Its content is that the state only manages production, and the enterprises themselves plan and manage the joint operations. Therefore, manufacturing plants that produce the same type of military supplies are gathered and organized into a production group. Each production group is officially appointed with one leader. From the outside, the production leader is like the president, and all the manufacturing plants of the same military supplies are gathered under his command, just like organizing a company.

This production system is not only implemented in the direct military supplies production sector, which is the material consumption sector, but also in all material supply sectors, such as steelmaking and other metal supply sectors, power supply sectors, fiber sectors, etc.

This production leader, although he is officially appointed, is not a government official or a soldier. He is selected from the manufacturers who are considered to have the strongest national consciousness, the clearest understanding of the current situation, and the most excellent technology. The salary of this production leader is paid by the company to which he belongs. As far as his work is concerned, he is under the command of the president of his own company. Therefore, according to the authority granted by law, he can freely investigate all the manufacturing plants under his control, so that technology can be openly exchanged. If necessary, he can transfer technicians or employees from poor manufacturing plants to excellent manufacturing plants for training and research. Or he can transfer skilled workers or technicians from excellent manufacturing plants to poor manufacturing plants to take responsibility for improvement.

At the same time, the production leader expresses his opinions to the military on the required quantity and delivery deadline. Unreasonable needs will naturally not be delivered in the required quantity within the prescribed delivery deadline. So he defines it himself, and delivers the quantity of the required quantity promised before a certain period. In this way, the production responsibility system of the munitions industry is established.

### Household Population and Grain Quantity and Price List Concerned With the Entire People's Livelihood Urgently Request Lowering of Price Limits and Increasing Allotments

The Second Special District Party Department, in view of the recent soaring prices, which have had a huge impact on people's livelihoods, yesterday submitted a request to its superiors, to be forwarded to the Central Government, to increase the city's food ration and suppress prices to stabilize people's livelihoods. The original text is excerpted as follows: It is found that food is of the utmost importance to the entire people's livelihood. Our government, concerned about the people's hardships, has repeatedly issued strict orders and admonitions to investigate and prohibit hoarding. Public sales have been held in various places, price limits have been widely implemented, and implementation has been earnestly carried out, achieving considerable results.

Prices Have Risen Sharply This Month Unexpectedly, since June, prices have soared, and the cost of living index has skyrocketed. Public officials, school teachers, and shop employees who rely on fixed salaries to make a living all feel unable to cope. Investigating the source of the price increases, unscrupulous merchants have all voiced the same opinion, claiming that the high price limits on rationed food and supplies (such as flour and cooking oil) are an excuse. In recent days, the price limit for household rationed rice in Shanghai has increased again, and the prices of various goods are bound to rise further. At this level of living, people will be unable to survive.

Increase Allotments and Lower Price Limits In order to protect people's livelihoods, this association proposes that the municipal authorities quickly reduce the price limits for household food rations and daily food products, and increase the allotment quantities. At the same time, reiterate the ban and impose effective and severe sanctions on unscrupulous merchants who hoard and exceed price limits. This matter has been recorded in the minutes of the 26th Executive Committee meeting of this association. We are submitting a document requesting your approval to forward it to the Central Government, explicitly ordering all provincial and municipal governments to suppress food price limits, and separately send letters to the municipal government and friendly authorities to quickly reduce the city's food price limits and increase allotment quantities to curb the price increase and stabilize people's livelihoods.

Various Industries Call for Full Allocation The various industry trade associations in the city, in order to adapt to the wartime system, have reorganized in accordance with the laws and regulations of the authorities, and have successively convened founding congresses, elected the first board of directors and supervisors, and are responsible for managing the association's affairs. It was learned yesterday that the recent handling of association affairs by various industry associations is very tense. However, the scope of their work is estimated to be the following points, and the steps taken are recorded as follows: (1) Appeal to the relevant authorities to fully allocate raw materials and finished products to the members of the same industry, and to approve the issuance of movement permits for the purpose of transporting them to the market or for processing and production. (2) Form a valuation committee to evaluate the prices of members' products and to review the quality of products. (3) Investigate whether the businesses of members of the same industry are legitimate and process the necessary documents. (4) Study how to improve members' products, how to produce them, and how to sell them. (5) Resolve various disputes between members and strongly urge them to conduct legitimate transactions and not to participate in black market transactions to avoid misunderstandings and unexpected entanglements. (6) Request the government or relevant parties to protect the legitimate rights and interests of members of the same industry. (7) Handle the registration of members of the same industry.

### Rice and Grain Joint Operations Agency Key Tasks Centralized Procurement and Allotment Per Capita Grain Distribution Remains the Same Grain Joint Operations Agency From the Shanghai Area

Since the establishment of the Grain Joint Operations Agency in the Shanghai area, there have been rumors that the per capita grain distribution in the two concessions and the urban area will be taken over by the agency. This rumor is actually untrue. Although the Central China Yu Gu Cooperative has transferred the right to supply household rice to the agency, the per capita grain distribution is still handled by the Baojia and military and political authorities in accordance with past practices. The focus of the agency's task is the procurement and transportation of rice and grain. The rice and grain in the producing areas are purchased by the agency and transported to Shanghai, and then distributed to the Public Works Bureau (Public Works Department) and the Municipal Food Bureau.

### Bail for Prisoners Exceptional Clauses Five Types of Criminals Not Allowed to Be Released on Bail

Regarding the recent promulgation of the Provisional Measures for Bailing Prisoners by the Ministry of Justice Administration, which was received by courts at all levels in the city, prisoners who exceed the budgeted quota or whose cells are insufficient may be bailed in accordance with these measures. The situation was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to inquiries, Article 3 of the Provisional Measures for Prisoners stipulates that those who commit the following crimes shall not be bailed: (1) Those who commit crimes stipulated in Chapters 1 to 3 of Part 2 of the Criminal Law. (2) Public officials who commit the crime of dereliction of duty or embezzlement of public funds. (3) Those who commit the crime of theft, robbery, or banditry as a regular occupation. (4) Those who commit crimes with a minimum sentence of imprisonment of seven years or more. (5) Those who commit crimes against the Special Criminal Law for Wartime. Those who commit the crimes stipulated in the preceding paragraph shall not be allowed to be released on bail under any circumstances.

### Cotton Products Supplied at Cost Adopting a Registered Allotment System Japanese Residents to Implement Next Month Allotment Quantity Calculated in Points

The Japanese residents in the Shanghai area have a cotton product distribution system based on alliances. The planning committee has drafted measures that have been approved by the Japanese Consulate General and various related bureaus, and will be implemented from July 17. Active preparations are currently underway, and specific details are being negotiated by officials and civil groups. The distribution method follows a system of registered comprehensive points allocated to each person per year. The total consumption limit for each person per year is set at a certain number of points, and each type of item is also assigned a corresponding number of points. The total number of points for various items consumed by each person throughout the year must not exceed the limit. The distribution price is 30-40% cheaper than the market price. The distribution targets are divided into four categories: general, adult men (over 8 years old), adult women (over 8 years old), and young children (under 7 years old). For example, one person per year is allotted two towels and four pairs of socks. Women are allotted three pairs of cloth socks. Special allotments are also prepared for pregnant women. The annual allotment is worth about 5 million yuan. If calculated at the current market price, it would be around 8 million yuan. Therefore, merchants earn a difference of 3 million yuan. It is also understood that after the low-priced distribution of cotton products, the same measures will be taken for cosmetic soap and other daily necessities.

### Public Concession Hotel Industry Preparing to Organize a Special Self-Defense Force

Hotels Divided into Five Grades Based on Size The Public Concession Police Headquarters is actively promoting the organization of special self-defense forces within the concession to assist the police in maintaining law and order. It is stipulated that all public venues must be organized and established by a certain date. The hotel industry is complex, and the quality of travelers is uneven, so it is even more necessary to organize a special self-defense force. The authorities have instructed the industry association to be responsible for the organization, and the measures have also been stipulated, roughly as follows: (1) Hotels are divided into five grades based on size: A, B, C, D, and E. Grade A has 40 people, Grade B has 30 people, Grade C has 20 people, Grade D has 12 people, and Grade E has 4 to 6 people. (2) Each hotel is a unit, with one squad leader and two team leaders per hotel, and the number of members is determined by grade. (3) The manager serves as the squad leader, the receptionist or accountant serves as the team leader, and the tea boy or shop clerk serves as the member. (4) The special self-defense force serves three hours per shift, with two shifts rotating day and night. (5) Each member must prepare three photos, fill out a member roster (one for each hotel), assign a number, and report details such as age, place of origin, and position. (6) Each hotel must draw a flat drawing of the construction equipment, and the drawing paper must be the same size as the member roster for binding. It is also heard that the age of the members is limited to 20 to 45 years old, and only those with some knowledge are allowed. The hotel industry association is currently organizing it by a certain date. Once everything is in order, service will begin immediately.

Since the organization of special self-defense forces in the Baojia districts of the Public Concession, various public venues in the French Concession, such as Avenue Joffre, have long been ordered to organize "special auxiliary police." The armband on the right arm is different from that of ordinary auxiliary police. The armband of the special auxiliary police has the three letters "GSC" in Western characters, and below are the four Chinese characters "特別民警" (Special Auxiliary Police). However, this special auxiliary police is not directly under the command of the relevant Lianbao office.

### Shanghai Qing Branch to Conduct Land Survey Failure to Report or Underreporting Will Be Deemed as Abandonment of Rights

In order to understand the current land situation in the Qingxiang area and to reorganize land administration, the Shanghai Qing Branch has launched a land survey, starting with the three districts of Nanhui, Fengxian, and Beiqiao in the first phase of the Qingxiang area. Regarding the survey procedures and various regulations, the association has issued the following announcement: "In order to understand the current land situation in the Qingxiang area and to determine the actual acreage, so as to reorganize land administration, this association has launched a land survey. All land survey matters in the three districts of Nanhui, Fengxian, and Beiqiao in the first phase of the Qingxiang area of this association shall be conducted from June 18 of this year to July 31 as the period for declaration and investigation. For all land in the above three districts, whether it is farmland, ponds, rivers, mountains, tombs, roads, bridges, residences, or other land for use, the owner or legal agent shall apply for survey and report in accordance with the regulations. Those who fail to report within the deadline or make false declarations will be deemed to have abandoned ownership of the unreported or underreported land, and the competent authority will handle it in accordance with the measures for managing public property. When handling the application procedures, a registration fee of one yuan per mu shall be paid, and any amount less than one mu shall be calculated as one mu. No other fees will be charged. It is hoped that the property owners in each district will go to the land survey office in each township to handle the application procedures within the prescribed time limit. This matter concerns the rights and interests of the property owners, so please do not wait and see and make mistakes. In addition, if any property owner conceals or makes false declarations, the public may report it secretly to this association or the land survey office in each district. Once verified, a bonus will be given. The regulations for handling land surveys by this association are hereby announced for everyone to know."

### Material Investigation Work Conducted by Chinese and Japanese Organizations Investigation Officials Appointed by the Chairman

The Material Investigation Committee held its founding meeting on the 19th of this month. Chairman Chen, in his opening remarks, stated that "it has been decided to appoint investigators from both China and Japan, and the committee and the investigators' office will be established immediately. The investigators will start working soon." It has been learned from relevant sources that the investigators will be appointed by the chairman from among the staff of the participating organizations. The organizations included in the committee are the Municipal Government and the Public Concession Public Works Bureau on the Chinese side, and the Embassy Consulate and military and police authorities on the Japanese side. The investigators selected will be four from the Chinese Municipal Government and two from the Public Works Bureau, and six from the Japanese side. The investigation work will be carried out by the offices for Chinese and Japanese residents respectively, from handling registration to inspecting public and private warehouses and private storage, all within the authority of the committee, and will be carried out thoroughly. The basic task of the Material Investigation Committee is to investigate hoarded materials and to deal with the hoarded goods and hoarders in accordance with the "Regulations on Punishing the Crime of Hoarding Commodities." Therefore, non-industry members or industry members who engage in illegal business, those who provide money for others to engage in improper business, resulting in manipulation of market prices and disruption of the market, and public officials who hoard or protect others who hoard, once discovered, will be subject to fines or imprisonment for minor offenses, and life imprisonment or the death penalty for serious offenses. All relevant bureaus participating in the Material Investigation Committee will cooperate.

### Wu Wenkui and Others Assault Petition Police in the Market

(Central News Agency) In view of the fact that tens of thousands of vendors enter and exit the Central Market every day during the ten markets, and the quality of these vendors is uneven, the market has issued registration certificates to ensure that the police are able to conduct random checks so as to prevent undesirable elements from entering the market. At 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, the petition police of the market were conducting routine checks of registration certificates when Wu Wenkui, Xu Miaogen, and others from the local goods association, as well as no less than sixty or seventy vendors, assaulted Chen Guanxing, the 44th petition police officer of the market, injuring his head and internal organs. He was immediately sent to Tongren Hospital.

### Leprosy Relief Association Raises Funds Hopes for Assistance from Philanthropists

The original fundraising target of the China Leprosy Relief Association's fundraising campaign was 300,000 yuan. As of now, only about 180,000 yuan has been received. It is heard that many leprosy hospitals in other cities have sent letters requesting subsidies, especially in North China, which is particularly urgent, and has sent representatives to Shanghai twice to request assistance. In terms of the expenses of the Shanghai Leprosy Sanitarium, more than 30,000 yuan per month is needed. In this difficult situation, it is hoped that philanthropists will provide assistance. It is also heard that the association will continue to broadcast Peking Opera performances by famous actors and actresses at the Soviet Theater the day after tomorrow (the 24th) in the afternoon.

### Su Yizhi Case Continued Hearing This Morning

The case of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at the Sacred Heart Elementary School, who was beaten to death by Liu Wangshi, the mother of student Liu Zhijun, has been transferred to the Special First Court by the Yu Lin Road Police Station. Due to the fact that the autopsy of Su's stomach and intestines has not been completed, the case has not yet been prosecuted. The autopsy report from the Public Works Bureau and the forensic examination report have been submitted separately. According to the forensic examination, Su's death was determined to have been caused by a concussion to the ears and pancreas due to being beaten, resulting in cerebral congestion and bleeding. The court has scheduled a continued hearing for this morning. It is said that Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Bureau, will formally file a drinking suit, citing Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, which states that "a person who commits the crime in the preceding paragraph (i.e., injuring another person's body) resulting in death shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for seven years or more."

### Eliminating the Tendency to Seek Selfish Interests

Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, in their speeches to the Diet, clarified Japan's policy toward China, promoting it with unwavering determination, and stated that Japan is prepared to revise the current treaty as Sino-Japanese relations develop. Establishing good neighborly relations between Japan and China and building the center of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is something that everyone believes without doubt, and the facts before our eyes have gradually proven this.

At this time, Chinese officials and the public must understand Japan's true intentions, help each other, and save the situation. However, frankly speaking, the understanding and sincerity of the Chinese side in this regard seem to be insufficient. For example, the tendency to seek selfish interests that surrounds the Commercial Control Council must be cleared up as soon as possible, otherwise it may cause future harm. The organization of the Commercial Control Council is certainly not to deny the legitimate profits of merchants, but rather to provide merchants with a guarantee of legitimate profits. Its aim is to streamline the procurement of materials and promote healthy commercial activities. At the same time, as the new commercial control mechanism, the council bears an important responsibility that must be fulfilled in the economic construction of the new China. The Commercial Control Council can only fully exert its performance when these two tendencies can be harmonized without any contradiction.

Recently, within the Commercial Control Council, there has been a dangerous tendency to misunderstand its own important tasks and to promote the Commercial Control Council to become an organization that unscrupulously pursues private interests. We believe that this is only limited to a part of the phenomenon, but it is said that the council does not allow cotton yarn and cotton cloth to be moved to the interior, and in fact recognizes the black market's attempts to gain illegal profits. If what is said is true, then the good intentions of the Chinese and Japanese authorities in setting up the Commercial Control Council can be said to have been completely trampled upon. This situation not only limits the promotion of Japan's policy toward China, but also goes against Japan's ethical spirit.

Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the Commercial Control Council, stated in his last speech that the Commercial Control Council and its lower-level organizations must be "fair and honest" and should adapt to the current situation and each give full play to the spirit of service. In particular, during wartime, the work of handling control should always be treated as a social service. What we want to say is already included in Tang's short words, and there is no room for us to say more. The operation of the Commercial Control Council, in a sense, is a touchstone for judging whether China's participation in the war and Japan's promotion of its policy toward China can succeed. We sincerely hope that the parties involved in the Commercial Control Council will realize the importance of their work, suppress the tendency to arbitrarily pursue private interests, and be able to promote the function of a truly sound commercial self-government control organization. (Yun Peng: Translated from the June 22nd commentary in the Continental News)

### Rising Prices for Several Days The Problem Lies in Merchants Only Caring About Their Own Small Interests Talk by Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the Commercial Control Council

(Exclusive Interview with This Newspaper) Recently, prices have suddenly risen again, and the trend of suppression is quite sharp. The general public has been feeling the heavy burden of life for many years, and it is really chilling to hear this. The government and authorities seem to be quite active in adjusting materials and prices, such as the recent establishment of the Material Investigation Committee and the evaluation by the Economic Bureau. The National Commercial Control Council, which was established more than three months ago to adjust materials, should theoretically have its effectiveness in direct proportion to the stability of prices. In the past, the council worked very hard, but at present, prices are rising day by day. In order to solve the doubts, the reporter of this newspaper specially visited Mr. Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the National Commercial Control Council, yesterday. Mr. Tang happened to be on sick leave, but he accepted the interview despite his illness and made a brief statement as follows: "The control of materials is currently handled by commercial self-governing organizations. Its success or failure directly affects the future of commercial self-government and is indirectly related to the entire economy. The general public should have a deep understanding of this and should recognize the environment and must not only seek the interests of the individual, but ignore the interests of the public. This view has already been repeatedly advocated in society. However, I have heard that the situation in the market recently is that prices are rising and becoming more severe. From some facts, it can be proved that this is definitely not a matter of supply and demand. The reasons for this can also be stated without going into detail. It is also rumored that some people are requesting to raise the price limit to more than 100 percent. I am currently ill and unable to investigate in detail, but I think that this kind of action is still nothing more than thinking about seeking the interests of the individual. However, this has created a situation of social unrest, which is not only a matter of conscience, but also a matter of imbalance in everything, which is likely to cause serious consequences. I sincerely hope that merchants with a long-term vision will recognize the position of self-government and use the power of the group to correct and curb this situation, so as not to cause themselves trouble." At this point, the reporter excused himself.

### Procedures for Applying for Moving Out Cotton Textiles

Regarding the transportation of various cotton textiles, such as socks, underwear, handkerchiefs, towels, bed sheets, and shirts, to other cities, it is necessary to obtain a visa and permission from the National Commercial Control Council. Since the establishment of the Cotton Textile Factory Industry Association of this city and the Joint Association of Cotton Products Industry of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the procedures for applying for moving out cotton textiles have been formally stipulated. All cotton textile manufacturers who have materials to be moved to other cities can send them to the Cotton Textile Factory South Industry Association of this city and the Cotton Products Joint Association for official seal certification, and then send them to the Material Movement Permit Office of the Commercial Control Council to request permission. However, the materials to be moved out are limited to actual needs. This permit is absolutely forbidden to be transferred. The situation has been good since it was handled, and manufacturers have found it convenient.

### Meeting of the Trade Association Reorganization Committee Held Yesterday for the Seventh Time

The Reorganization Committee of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce held its seventh meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd) at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry. Attendees included Director Yuan Yuquan, Committee Members Wang Zhigang, Sun Mingqi, Shen Tong, Yu (represented by Committee Member Zhang Jun), Xiang Xun, Sun Zuji, Chen Zhong, and Zhang Jun, totaling nine individuals. The following important matters were discussed and resolved:

(1) Regarding the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau's submission of supplementary reasons for the artificial silk industry's request to independently organize an association, which was returned for reconsideration, a public decision was requested. (2) Regarding the Shanghai Special City Silk Thread Industry Trade Association's submission stating that the two initiators of the artificial silk industry, Yuan Jingbang and Ding Bingyao, had not attended the preparatory meeting due to their prior application to maintain the original organization, and requesting instructions on whether the artificial silk industry should participate in this trade association or form an independent association, a discussion was requested on how to handle this matter. (1) and (2) were discussed together, and it was resolved to approve the independent organization of the artificial silk trade association and to submit a request to the Ministry, through the Silk Industry Trade Association Joint Committee, for verification and instructions. (3) Regarding the Shanghai Special City Coarse and Fine Pigment Sundries Trade Association's resubmission of reasons for not merging with the Western Pigment Industry Association, which was returned for reconsideration, a public decision was requested. It was resolved that the Pigment Trade Association be allowed to split into the Pigment Trade and the Dye Trade two trade associations and to submit a request to the Ministry for verification and instructions. Additionally, it was requested that the Ministry order local competent authorities to adjust the already established Pigment Trade Association. (4) Regarding the Shanghai Dacheng Tire Firm Manager Shen Kun and others' request to organize the Shanghai Special City Rubber Tire and Transportation Materials Trade Association, a public decision was requested on whether to approve it. It was resolved to approve the independent organization of the Tire Trade Association and to join the Rubber Industry Trade Association Joint Committee. A request should be submitted to the Ministry for verification and instructions. (5) Regarding the Shanghai Special City Machinery Industry Federation's request to establish the Machinery Industry Trade Association Joint Committee and to separately establish (1) Machinery Factory Industry, (2) Machinery Commerce, (3) Foundry Industry, (4) Blacksmith Industry, (5) Hardware Factory Industry, (6) Screw Factory Industry, (7) Bicycle Factory Industry, (8) Knitting Machine Factory Industry, (9) Air Conditioning Factory Industry, (10) Electrical Industry, (11) Machinery Model Industry, and (12) Safe and Steel Utensil Industry, totaling twelve trade associations, a public decision was requested on whether to approve it. It was resolved that there was no need to organize them separately. (6) Regarding the Shanghai Special City Match Factory Trade Association's submission requesting to change its name to the Regional Match Factory Trade Association, verification and discussion were requested. It was resolved to change it to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Match Factory Trade Association and to submit a request to the Ministry for verification and instructions. (7) Omitted. (8) Regarding the Ministry of Finance's letter requesting that the Shanghai Special City Chemical Industry Raw Material Factory Industry and Chemical Industry Raw Material Trade two trade associations be placed under the jurisdiction of the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau, verification and discussion were requested. It was resolved that (1) the trade association is an industrial and commercial organization, and its supervision and management includes matters such as distribution and sales, which is broader than the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau's scope of management of saltpeter and sulfur; (2) furthermore, the materials managed by these two associations are not limited to saltpeter and sulfur, and the management rights of other materials should not be transferred to the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau solely based on the relationship of saltpeter and sulfur management. Based on the above two points, these two associations should still follow the original procedures stipulated by the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau for the saltpeter and sulfur portion. The Economic Bureau's right to guide and supervise the association should be submitted to the Ministry for verification. (9) The task of reorganizing industrial and commercial trade associations assigned to this committee has been completed, and it is proposed to submit a request to the Ministry for approval to conclude the committee. A public decision was requested and it was resolved to approve and submit a request to the Ministry for verification and instructions.

### Stock Market Trends in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were stimulated by various parties, and advanced across the board to new highs. The textile industry was the most vigorous, with Wing On Textiles breaking through major levels, and Yu Sheng rising significantly. Dasheng Mills No. 1 and No. 3 continued to rise, and Rong Feng was still leaping forward. The leap of Xinhuo Yarn Factory was even more intense. In the department store industry, Wing On, Sincere, and National Products Company all rose step by step. Underwear also saw a sudden rise, with King Lun Shirts and Socks selling well outside the customs. King Fook Shirts and Socks were firm. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Co. advanced rapidly. Great China Match and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco were firm and consistent. Guansheng Water & Electricity and China General Edison Electric stopped rising and tended to stabilize. The new medicine industry did not deviate from the steady trend. Zhongxing Timber was sought after by buyers. Baoan Glass traded at increasingly higher prices. Conyuan Manufacturing had demand exceeding supply.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds: In the gray market, all five types of Unified Government Bonds, A, B, C, D, and E, rose.

Gold and Silver: Silver ornaments were sold at market stores based on the limited price per tael, but the procedures were more complicated than before. Transactions were sparse both within and outside the industry, and prices rose again. The official price of sycee silver remained unchanged, but the market price still exceeded the limited price.

Yarn and Cloth: The yarn market was prosperous due to demand exceeding supply, and prices were firm. 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix, 32-count double-strand Fairy Peach, 20-count Green Single Horse, and 10-count Red Double Horse all saw increases, but transactions were not numerous. The cloth market opened this morning with a firm upward trend. Due to demand exceeding supply, prices rose steadily, reaching new highs. As a result, the fine cloth "Four Gentlemen", Peach Blossom, Lady Lin, White Cat Floral Cloth, Three Sheep Serge, and Qin Liangyu Bleached Cloth all rose significantly compared to yesterday.

### Dynamics of Various Trade Associations

Banking and Money Industry: The Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Trade Association, in accordance with the government-promulgated Provisional Regulations and Implementing Rules for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, has decided to implement reorganization to adapt to the wartime economic system. The original executive committee system will be changed to a system of directors and supervisors, with one director-general and several executive directors each. The association's articles of association have been revised in accordance with the new laws and regulations. It is learned that: (1) The Shanghai Special City Banking Industry Trade Association has scheduled a general membership meeting on the 26th at the association to implement reorganization, elect directors and supervisors, and approve the articles of association. (2) The Shanghai Special City Money Industry Trade Association will also hold a general membership meeting on a scheduled date to elect directors and supervisors and approve the articles of association.

Tea and Pastry Industry: Since its establishment, the Tea and Pastry Industry Trade Association has been actively handling association affairs. Its internal organization includes a secretariat, divided into general affairs, investigation, procurement, and allocation departments, each responsible for their respective duties, with a sound structure. On the one hand, it is handling the review of members and classifying them into different grades. On the other hand, it is contacting the establishment of special district branches in Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, and Jiading. In order to comprehensively protect the rights and interests of the industry, it is deeply concerned that there are still a few members who have not completed the membership procedures, and has specially extended the deadline to the 26th of this month.

### The Editor Candidate Examination of Shen Bao

— Ruo Wen

I saw my name in the Shen Bao on June 6th and only then learned that I had passed the preliminary review for the Shen Bao editor candidate examination. It said that the examination would be held that afternoon, so I hurriedly ate lunch, took a tram, and went straight to the Shanghai East Public Association on Fourth Road. Fortunately, it was still early, but there were already many people there. They were all energetic young people. Later, we were assigned numbers, took our seats, and the examination began at two o'clock sharp. The first test was composition. There were two topics, and we had to choose one. One was "My School Life" and the other was "My Family Life". After receiving the topics, the entire room was silent, and everyone buried their heads in writing. The proctors were sharp-eyed and very strict. After the composition was completed, the general knowledge test was given. Because I handed in my paper earlier, I had time to copy down all the test questions as follows:

(1) What is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's most important proposition regarding the Principle of Livelihood?

(2) In what ways is the Yangtze River basin superior to the Yellow River basin?

(3) Where are the largest producers of wool in the world? Where are the largest producers of rubber?

(4) Why is Sichuan called a prosperous region?

(5) What are the main differences between newspaper supplements and special editions?

(6) Which provinces are the most severely affected by the North China drought? What is the name of the organization in Shanghai that is providing relief to North China?

(7) List the names of the Chairman of the National Government in Nanjing, the heads of the five branches of government, and the governors of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces.

(8) Where is Singapore located and what is its current name?

(9) List the main countries of the Axis powers and the Anti-Axis powers.

(10) What are the names of the current Japanese Foreign Minister and Ambassador to China? Who is the Chinese Ambassador to Japan?

It is said that an oral examination was originally planned, but because it was already late, we will be notified after the written test has been passed.

What deeply moved me about Shen Bao's recruitment of editor candidates this time was that the requirements included the following provision: high school or above, or those with equivalent academic ability, do not need diplomas, but those who question their own academic ability should not try... lobbying and pleading will not be considered. This kind of fair and just examination should be emulated by various institutions and organizations in society, so that those who do not have real knowledge but do not have diplomas will not sigh in despair at the recruitment, and so that a group of young people who do not have high-ranking relatives to introduce them to jobs will also have a chance to support themselves.

### From Manchuria to Shanghai (2)

— Hashimoto Kanun

The Majestic Forbidden City

The beauty of Beijing's streets lies in the grandeur of the Forbidden City and the city walls. But recently it has been gradually declining. Most of the city has now been opened, so I have the opportunity to visit it again. It is indeed the palace city of emperors who ruled over more than four hundred states. I don't know when someone said that, compared to the British attitude towards Buckingham Palace in London, with dormitories, sanatoriums, etc., although the scale of the palace is grand, the Forbidden City will never give people this impression.

Every year on the way home from the south, flying from Saigon via Guangdong to Shanghai, overlooking a corner of Central and Southern China, I saw the changes between the past and the present. When I faced the north again, it rekindled my memories.

Love for the Water Towns

From the north, the changes in colors that are constantly shifting are extremely dazzling. Flying from the gray and yellow soil of the north to the green fields and water towns of the south, the ingenuity of nature that enters our field of vision within a few hours gives us countless inspirations.

I landed in Jinan for a short break. Jinan is a place I have visited before, but I was unable to revisit it this time due to the distance within the city. Flying over the mountainous area of Shandong Province, the flight was extremely high, and in the unbearable cold air, I even put on a coat. In Beijing, the climate was completely summer-like, so many people were unprepared. Soon, Mount Tai was between my fingers, with overlapping mountain houses and a magnificent atmosphere, almost like ascending to heaven.

The Yangtze River is Feminine

Looking down at the Yangtze River from the plane gives an incredible feeling. It is vast and boundless, truly difficult to grasp. It is said that Confucius, upon seeing Lao Tzu, said, "Lao Tzu is like a dragon!" This saying can be used to describe the Yangtze River.

Li Bai's line "White hair three thousand feet" can represent it. However, if you ask what it is like beyond that, there is no way to answer. I have seen the Yangtze River several times and crossed the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River seen from the plane cannot be fully expressed no matter how exaggerated. Last year, flying over the volcanic area of ​​Java, I was amazed by its majesty, but compared with the Yangtze River, in terms of color perception, it can be said to be feminine, no, the Yangtze River transcends all kinds of feminine or masculine beauty. The joyful feelings that Da Yu had when he created the world can be imagined. Over Shandong, looking down at the Yellow River, compared with the Yangtze River, it is just a ditch. The jungles of Sumatra can be compared to it.

Riding a Green Ox Out of Hangu Pass

In my Shanghai Miscellany, I said that even in China, some people say that Li Bai was Turkish or Siberian. Thinking of Lao Tzu, perhaps we should think that Lao Tzu was also one of the displaced people. When he was alive, his hair was white, and his appearance depicted above, and the posture of riding a bull south, did not look Chinese. Confucius said he was like a dragon, perhaps because the language was not very clear? However, his appearance is somewhat like Tolstoy. There are also commonalities in the belief in thought. Its origins are three thousand years old, which, if pondered, has some suggestive possibilities.

My Shanghai Miscellany, published in the Shen Bao, which has a long history in Shanghai, has received some responses. There are many places that even the Chinese themselves have never talked about. And the reason for being published seems to have some common feelings. I am very happy about this. (Source: Western Daily News)

### Struggle

— Jian Feng

The cruelty of society,

The baseness of human feelings,

Don't be afraid of their ferocious faces.

Sighing, weeping…

Don’t be afraid of the thorns ahead,

Worrying and hesitating on the rugged path;

The future is bleak!

Wipe away the tears from your eyes,

Throw away the compassion in your heart,

Hold fast to your truth,

Sharpen your perseverance,

Struggle!

Go break through this evil consciousness,

So that they no longer survive,

Ah!

Destroy that hazy darkness, break through that dangerous atmosphere, open up your future, and strive for the coming of light! (Recompense)

### Discussion on Curing Tuberculosis with White Ginkgo Soaked in Rapeseed Oil

— Jiǎng Yǐlán

My wife has suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis for nearly two years.  We have been through both Chinese and Western medical treatments, but there is no way to completely cure it.  Recently, I received a letter from a friend in Beiping saying: "The experiments in the Pingjin area on the treatment of tuberculosis with white ginkgo soaked in rapeseed oil are deeply appreciated.  The method is to soak 100 fresh virgin white ginkgo fruits with the cyan skin (i.e., the first fruits produced) in rapeseed oil. After 100 days, two fruits can be taken out each time, and eaten with the skin and kernel.  Take it two or three times a day.  Although the taste is bitter, the effect is very significant.  It is said that people who have been cured, after X-ray examination, are completely like healthy people.  Therefore, there are people in the Ping area who use this method for treatment," and so on.  I have not tried the treatment method mentioned above, because I have not heard anyone mention it in the southern area.  I think there is no shortage of people in Shanghai who study medicine and pharmacy, so I specially bring it up for discussion.  If it is indeed effective, it would be a savior for those suffering from tuberculosis.
