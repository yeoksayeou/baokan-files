### A Self-Disturbing Fool

Shanghai, due to its diverse population from all directions, has always been a "breeding ground" for rumors, given the exceptionally complex social situation. It tends to systematically fabricate various rumors in accordance with the evolution of international and domestic affairs, even "creating waves out of thin air," so that a small number of speculators and adventurers can take the opportunity to "fish in troubled waters." In the past, all sorts of market disturbances were initiated by the rumors fabricated by Europeans, Americans, and a portion of local speculators and adventurers. Naturally, our country is the one harmed by these, especially the vast majority of city residents, who are deceived by the rumors and act rashly, becoming self-disturbing fools. As a result, countless individuals have gone bankrupt. Although the Shanghai concessions have now been returned, the deeply ingrained germs of a century and the complex social content of Shanghai make it difficult to fundamentally eradicate the source of rumors. Moreover, we are now in wartime, a period when the world war has entered its decisive stage, and the enemy is still making every effort to infiltrate the rear and carry out various disruptive conspiracies.

Today, those who attempt to take advantage of Shanghai's past special nature and social complexity to create various rumors at any time are naturally international spies and the covert activities of British and American agents. The second are Chongqing elements stirring up trouble and calling a stag a horse. The third are the general speculative merchants in this city, who pursue their own private interests and personal wealth. Their only capital, it could be said, is the skill of "spreading rumors." They rely on spreading rumors to disrupt the market and take the opportunity to carry out disguised robbery.

Whether it's British and American spies, Chongqing elements, or speculators, rumors are ultimately just rumors. Rumors can never be compared with facts. The reason rumors can play a role lies not in the rumors or the rumor-mongers themselves, but in the attitude of the citizens towards rumors. If everyone can recognize that rumors are just rumors and remain unmoved, then no rumor will affect the market, and the rumor-mongers will be defeated without a fight and their schemes will fail.

Recently, various rumors have surfaced intermittently in the market. These rumors strive to connect with the international situation and the government. For those with clear eyes, they can naturally dismiss the rumors as soon as they hear them, but the general public, ignorant of the situation, often becomes suspicious and falls into the trap of rumor-mongers. In fact, from the current international situation, the stability of the East Asian situation, whether militarily or politically, has already been established on an unshakeable foundation. Not only will the "counteroffensive" of Britain and the United States not succeed, but also any evolution of the European war cannot affect East Asia. On the contrary, now in the world, no matter which aspect, it is impossible not to require the cooperation of East Asia. The Soviet Union has always maintained neutrality towards Japan and refused to participate in the Quebec Conference, which can be seen as a negative proof of the stability of the East Asian situation.

All the facts in East Asia and China demonstrate that any rumors in the market are ultimately rumors without any factual basis. We have an old saying, "Rumors stop with the wise." Today, we hope that everyone will use their reason, recognize the reality, and not be self-disturbing fools. Because the facts cannot be shaken by any rumors, and ultimately all rumors will be eliminated. If you willingly suffer losses due to being manipulated by rumors, you will not receive any compensation.

### Britain, America, and the Soviet Union Contend Overtly and Covertly in the Balkans

The Balkans, due to their geographical location, are extremely important in the current stage of the war. The three points that attract the most attention are as follows:

The defense and offense of the Romanian oil fields.

The political relations between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria and Serbia. The enemy's offensive attempts on the Aegean and Adriatic Seas.

The first question

First, the Romanian oil fields centered on Ploiești produce 7 million tons of crude oil annually. According to British and American calculations, if they are completely destroyed, Germany's war power will be reduced by 50%. Therefore, Britain and the United States believe that attacking the oil fields is more important than the Eastern European front. Britain and the United States have been preparing heavily in this regard for several months, expanding air force bases in Syria and Palestine. Finally, on the 1st of last month, they launched the first air raid with a large formation of 200 aircraft (according to British announcements).

The second question

As for the second question, it is one of the main points of the Moscow Conference. In the midst of the Soviet Union's demand for a second front, the Soviet Union's position in the Balkans is easy to imagine. On the Soviet side, opening a second front is naturally desirable, but on the British and American side, they advocate destroying Germany's fuel supply bases and warehouses in addition to bombing northwestern Germany, demanding a decisive battle in Europe in the Balkans. According to a certain expert, the British and American military preparations for invading the Balkans were underway four weeks ago. However, Sicily was launched first. This is because the mutual power struggles of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union in the Balkans have not yet been resolved. This relationship can clearly show the three countries' Balkan work.

The British and American policy is to unite Bulgaria, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Romania to form an anti-communist alliance, and to drag Turkey into it. The Soviet Union's policy is to carve out Romania, control the mouth of the Danube, and win over the Bulgarian and Yugoslav nations under its influence, in order to obtain a passage from the west coast of the Black Sea to the Adriatic Sea via the Aegean Sea. This policy naturally conflicts with Turkey's Dardanelles Strait, which is why Turkey's Balkan policy converges with that of Britain and the United States, demanding guarantees against the Soviet Union's threats. According to reliable sources, Soviet Minister to Bulgaria, Lavrishchev, told the Bulgarian authorities in talks about the British and American attempts, saying: "The Soviet Union is determined to prevent Britain and the United States from entering and exiting the Balkans. It hopes that Bulgaria will not have any concerns and will cooperate with the Soviet Union to resist Britain and the United States." This shows that the Soviet Union is giving verbal guarantees to the pro-British and pro-American Bulgarians who fear the landing of Britain and the United States in the Balkans, so as not to turn to the British and American side, while implying an attempt to oppose both Germany and Britain and the United States. With the progress of British and American preparations for landing in the Balkans, the Soviet Union itself is also independently conducting preparations for landing in the Balkans in the Caucasus coastal area. This is another proof of the Soviet Union's opposition to Britain and the United States. The anti-Axis forces along the Adriatic coast, such as Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro, one is related to the Communist Party, and the other is pro-British, and the two forces are mutually opposed, which is another example. There is also a similar tendency in Greece. In Romania, the tendency to pursue Britain and the United States among the anti-Axis elements is more dominant.

It is quite doubtful whether the current Moscow Conference can resolve these issues regarding the Balkans. In short, the British and American plan is to take advantage of the Soviet Union's food difficulties to make the Soviet Union recognize the second front in the Balkans as an exchange condition for strengthening food supplies, even to the point of allowing the Soviet Union to participate in the administration of the Balkan occupied territories, determining the scope of labor, in order to gain the Soviet Union's understanding.

The third question

As for the third question, what are the enemy's offensive attempts on the Aegean and Adriatic Seas and the German countermeasures? The British and American counteroffensive preparations based on the island of Cyprus are currently progressing. The British and American invasion of the Balkans cannot be seen as the result of Britain and the United States reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union on the Balkans, but rather as a situation where Britain and the United States cannot reach an understanding with the Soviet Union and forcibly land in the Balkans, creating a fait accompli for the Soviet Union.

On the other hand, we can also view it this way: The British and American side has determined that the Soviet Union's resistance is gradually coming to an end, and therefore, they are anxious to act in the Balkans. As a result of the counteroffensive, even if the Soviet Union is unwilling, it cannot but rely on the British and American Balkan policy.

In response to this situation, Germany's defense of the Balkans is progressing smoothly. Germany's military position in the Balkans, from the unification of the command system, the preparation of the rear, the strengthening of the positions, and weapons, is stronger than before. A strong defense line has been formed against the British and American landing attempts. (翔: From the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, August 28th)

### Chairman Wang Yesterday Inspected the Situation of Clearing the Countryside in Zhenjiang Area The People Cheered Along the Road with Extremely Enthusiastic Emotions

Nanjing, August 29th, Central News Agency Telegram The Propaganda Department issued the following communique at 11:00 AM on August 29th:

Chairman Wang of the National Government, in order to inspect the situation of clearing the countryside in the Zhenjiang area, departed from Nanjing to Zhenjiang on the morning of the 28th of this month and returned to the capital on the evening of the same day.

(Central News Agency News) Chairman Wang, along with his entourage, arrived in the Zhenjiang Rural Clearing area on a special train from the capital on the 28th to inspect. Governor Li also arrived in Zhenjiang at the same time, and Director Yuan, Deputy Director Zhang, and all the chiefs of the special districts and representatives of the people were all present at the station to welcome him respectfully. The chairman arrived at the station amidst the melodious music of the provincial government band. The chairman was wearing an army general's uniform, looking heroic and refreshed. After getting off the train, all the personnel gave their utmost respect, and the chairman smiled and frequently returned the salute. Then, he took a special car to inspect the city. The people of Zhenjiang were extremely excited to hear that the chairman was visiting Zhenjiang for inspection. The streets were full of pine and cypress arches and banners proclaiming support for the supreme leader. Wherever he went, Chinese and Japanese residents alike cheered along the road, their voices resounding like thunder, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic.

Then, he returned to Yuntaishan for rest. At noon, Governor Li hosted a banquet for Chairman Wang and all the personnel at the Japan-China Club.

People Hold a Grand Welcome Rally

At 2:00 PM, the Chairman personally attended the Zhenjiang All-Circles People's Welcome Rally and reviewed the Self-Defense Corps. The rally venue was the large military parade ground, which was decorated extremely grandly. All the people were lined up waiting respectfully, numbering no less than tens of thousands.

Chairman Visits Jiaoshan Scenic Spot

After the Chairman and various Chinese and Japanese officials, along with Governor Li and Director Yuan, arrived at the naval dock, they boarded five naval gunboats and sailed straight to Jiaoshan in the blue waves of the Yangtze River. Jiaoshan is located in the center of the Yangtze River and is a natural fortress, with a dangerous terrain. After the Chairman landed, all the monks greeted him with their palms together to welcome him. The Chairman went straight to Huayan Pavilion for a rest. Then, in front of Huayan Pavilion, he inspected the situation of the Yangtze River with Naval Minister Ren and others, looking extremely pleased. After a short rest, a public banquet was held in Huayan Pavilion to entertain the various officials. During the banquet, the Chairman delivered a speech. Then, Major General Shibayama gave a speech, wishing the Chairman good health and China's national fortune prosperity. Everyone raised their glasses to salute the Chairman. At that time, the music was melodious, and the evening breeze of the Yangtze River gently caressed, and the atmosphere of the whole venue was extremely harmonious.

Governor Li and Director Yuan led all the people to the East Station to respectfully send him off. The Chairman left Zhenjiang amidst the melodious military music.

Chairman Answers Questions from Reporters

Nanjing, August 29th, Central News Agency Telegram All the newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai specially sent reporters to Zhenjiang to inquire about news of the Chairman's visit to inspect rural clearing. The Chairman graciously granted them an audience, and the reporters specifically raised questions about participation in the war and rural clearing work, the relationship between the national government's economic policies after the recovery of the concessions and the rural clearing areas. The Chairman gave sincere answers as follows:

Regarding the first question, the Chairman replied: Last year, during the first anniversary of the Rural Clearing, I said that the purpose of the previous Rural Clearing work was to seek the realization of overall peace, but now the purpose of the Rural Clearing work is to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. Because China is located in the rear in the Greater East Asia War, it should think for the Allied soldiers on the front line step by step. Rural Clearing has two major goals: one is to establish security, and the other is to increase production. The former is to make the soldiers on the front line have no worries about the rear, and the latter is to enable the people to increase agricultural production in the countryside and increase light industrial production in the cities, and contribute their income to the Greater East Asia War.

Regarding the second question, the Chairman replied: This time China recovered the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession, all thanks to the Allied powers' generous assistance. We not only express our gratitude, but also deeply reflect. The Allied powers know that China must complete its independence in order to have the strength to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. Returning the concessions is a factual expression of the Allied powers' assistance to China in completing its independence. The old Shanghai concessions and the mainland have always had a very large gap. For example, in the past, when war broke out in the mainland, the concessions were prosperous. It can be seen that the situation in the concessions and the mainland was completely opposite. Taking rice and cotton as examples, those that are produced are the rural areas, and those that eat rice are the 5 million citizens of Shanghai. Those that plant cotton are the farmers in the rural clearing areas, and those that spin yarn and weave cloth are the Shanghai factories. The official price of cotton cloth in January this year was 5,800 yuan per package of 20 count yarn, but the black market price in Shanghai was as high as 40,000 yuan. The cotton farmers worked hard to plant cotton but could not afford to buy cloth, and the rice farmers worked hard to harvest rice but could not afford to buy cloth. All of this proves the separation between the Shanghai concessions and the mainland. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the government should actively promote a unified economic policy. Under a unified economic policy, Shanghai and the rural clearing areas will share weal and woe, and live and die together. The rural clearing areas have agriculture, and Shanghai has industry. Heavy industry cannot be discussed now, but light industry can be very developed. We should make overall plans to develop the agriculture of the rural clearing areas and cooperate with the development of light industry in Shanghai. Agriculture is what the rural clearing areas should strive for, and industry is what Shanghai should strive for. I firmly believe that after the concessions are recovered, a unified economic policy will be successfully promoted. This time, the government purchased cotton yarn and cloth. I went to Shanghai twice to convene various industrial and commercial circles to explain the significance of the purchase and obtained the support of all circles, so it could be carried out smoothly. In short, all of China's problems today are concentrated on how to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. Whether it is the citizens of Shanghai or the people of the rural clearing areas, or the people of other places, we often say to them that apart from victory in the Greater East Asia War, China has no second way to survive. China should concentrate all its spiritual and material strength on this point.

Nanjing, August 29th, Central News Agency Telegram Chairman Wang departed from Nanjing at 9:00 AM on the 28th to inspect the rural clearing area in Zhenjiang. He returned to Nanjing at 9:30 PM on the 28th. Many officials from the government's various ministries and commissions respectfully welcomed him at the station. The Chairman then boarded a car and returned to his official residence.

### Advisor Ishiwatari Discusses "Participating in the War China"

Tokyo, August 29th, Central News Agency Telegram Mr. Ishiwatari, the highest economic advisor to the National Government, arrived here a few days ago to discuss specific measures with the Japanese government after Japan implemented its new policy towards China. Now that his official duties have been completed, he departed from Tokyo Station on the 29th to return to his post. Before his departure, he discussed "Participating in the War China" in general as follows: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese people had already seen through the Chongqing side's futile resistance, which was nothing but a conspiracy by Chiang Kai-shek and his party members, compradors, and financial magnates to sell China and even Greater East Asia to Britain and the United States. Therefore, the hearts of the people all turned to the National Government, and China's trust in Japan progressed from sharing weal and woe to living and dying together. China suddenly declared war on Britain and the United States, which was a manifestation of the people's will. Taking this as an opportunity, Japan returned the concessions, completely abolished extraterritorial rights, implemented a new policy towards China, assisted China in completing its autonomy, and cooperated with the National Government to strengthen its political and economic power. All of these things made the Chinese people increasingly recognize the significance of the Greater East Asia War, and the people were all sincerely convinced of the essence of Chairman Wang's nation-building efforts. What the Chinese people felt had already exceeded imagination. After receiving the Shanghai concessions, Chairman Wang immediately issued a statement in Shanghai calling on the people to unify their thinking, take on the responsibility of the industrial base, and complete the Greater East Asia War together with Japan, and clearly stated the National Government's future policies and determination to explain that the Chinese people were determined to stand on a common front with Japan, and would not hesitate to annihilate those who had not awakened from their dreams, while actively stabilizing the people's livelihood and increasing production to achieve the supreme mission of China as the industrial base of the Greater East Asia War. Soon after, he resolutely implemented a policy of unified control and purchase of Shanghai cotton yarn and cloth. Due to the strong promotion of the national policy and the absolute support of the Japanese side, the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth was extremely smooth. Since its implementation, prices in Central China have fallen, and the export of materials to various places has gradually become smoother, so the people's livelihood has been stabilized and production has been increased, which is of great benefit to China's path of participating in the war. The security of peaceful areas is quite good due to the success of the rural clearing work, especially in Guangdong, as a result of the establishment of security, the abundant rice production in the Pearl River Delta area has been transported to various parts of Guangdong, which has not only stabilized the people's livelihood in Guangdong, but also provided great assistance in solving the food problem in North China. In short, all peaceful areas are now full of bright hope, etc.

Kaifeng, August 29th, Central News Agency Telegram General Sun Liangcheng, Director of the Kaifeng Pacification and Commander-in-Chief of the Second Route Army, personally went to the defense area a few days ago to strengthen the military appearance and complete the decisive battle system. In addition to strictly instructing the various units under his command, he also informed his subordinates one by one of the international trends after our country's participation in the war and the points that everyone should strive for under the current situation. After hearing this, all the officers and soldiers were extremely excited. In addition, since the Communist bandits are using the green gauze tents to cause trouble everywhere, Mr. Sun, with the will to eradicate evil, immediately ordered his headquarters to severely suppress them. In several battles, a total of more than 1,000 bandits were killed and more than 130 were captured, as well as a large number of spoils of war. The bandit side suffered heavy casualties and immediately fled in scattered groups.

Visited Various Newspaper Offices and Paid Respects to Mayor Chen Yesterday

At 10:50 AM, the group visited the Shen Bao, followed by the Continental News, the New Shen Bao at 11:15 AM, and the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency and the Allied News Agency at 11:50 AM.

Mayor's Public Banquet

Director Liang delivered a speech, followed by a response from Cai Tian, the head of the reporters' group, summarized as follows:

Director Liang's Speech

Distinguished journalists from North China: Today, Mayor Chen is unable to attend the banquet due to other matters, so I am representing the Shanghai Municipal Government to host you. Your visit from afar allows us to feel a profound sense of kinship and comradeship, and we extend a most sincere welcome.

Shanghai's economy and culture have always been able to influence the entire country. It can be said that Shanghai is no longer Shanghai's Shanghai, but the Shanghai of all of China. After the recovery of the concessions, we are establishing an even better foundation in the process of building a new China. However, the poison of the concessions over the past hundred years will not be easily eradicated overnight. You are all the backbone of the intellectual community in the North, and we hope that you will provide us with more opinions on building the new Shanghai for our reference. In the future, we will need to maintain close contact, uniting and working hard under one country, one government, and one leader to achieve the goal of restoring China and defending East Asia.

Group Leader's Response

Under the guidance of the Propaganda Department of the National Government, we have come to Nanjing and Shanghai for study. Our itinerary in Nanjing and Suzhou has been successfully completed. Last night, we arrived in Shanghai, where we were warmly greeted by Commissioner Fang of the Propaganda Department and President Xu and Vice President Yan of the China Daily News, among others. My colleagues and I feel exceedingly honored. Today, we are also honored to be treated to a grand banquet by Mayor Chen, who offered earnest encouragement. I extend my deepest gratitude on behalf of the entire delegation.

The purpose of our visit can be divided into two points: First, to report to the 100 million compatriots in North China on the new political facilities implemented in the three years since the National Government's return to the capital. Second, to bring the authenticity of the new Shanghai, based on what we have seen and heard, to North China and provide a thorough introduction to all levels of society. As for the first point, the new political situation implemented in the three years since the National Government's return to the capital naturally includes many departments. Since the authorities and our colleagues have provided us with as much convenience as possible, I believe that we will not fail in our mission. As for the second point, the so-called new Shanghai, our friendly nation Japan, based on morality, has removed all specialized concessions in China and returned them to our country unconditionally, opening a new chapter for the return of concessions. This bright and shining act of returning the Shanghai International Settlement to its rightful owner has been celebrated by 100 million compatriots in North China for weeks. Therefore, there are many people who want to know about our country's construction plans and the reality of Shanghai after the return of the concessions. For this reason, the significance of our visit is very different from that of ordinary tourism.

My colleagues and I, in addition to expressing our respect to Mayor Chen and other officials, raise our glasses and wish Mayor Chen and Director Liang good health, and sincerely express our determination to fight forever to all of our colleagues present.

The National Business Unification Association Notifies Businesses to Comply

The National Business Unification Association was ordered by the Executive Yuan to handle the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in the Shanghai area within a specified period of 15 days (from August 23rd to September 6th). This has been published in the newspapers, notifying all merchants to comply. The person in charge of the Business Unification Association has indicated that once this period is set, it will not be extended.

### Strict Crackdown on Setting Up Stalls to Sell Rationed Cigarettes

Since the implementation of cigarette rationing by the Central China Tobacco Distribution Cooperative in this city, all retailers have been able to sell at the prescribed price. However, cigarette scalpers are quite active, setting up stalls along the roads to sell cigarettes at prices several times higher than the prescribed price, which is illegal. Therefore, the police authorities have decided to crack down on this and prohibit setting up stalls. However, an investigation into the source of these stall cigarettes reveals that, in addition to scalpers buying and reselling, some retailers are also privately raising the price of rationed cigarettes. The police authorities have been conducting a thorough investigation, and once verified, they will be severely punished. The public is also encouraged to report truthfully to comply with the law and stabilize prices.

It is said that these undercover inspectors, in addition to investigating ticket sellers for fraud, also prevent some passengers from taking advantage of their positions related to the officialdom to ride for free.

Entrusted to Ben Gu Company for Distribution

In order to supplement the food supply for the residents of this city, the military distribution cooperative has successively purchased large quantities of soybeans and yellow beans to Shanghai for distribution at low prices.

### A Visit to the Notre Dame des Missions in Yangjingbang (6)

A Serious Problem

What kind of magical power do the nuns of Notre Dame possess to found and support such a difficult undertaking? Apart from a pure heart of faith and zeal for preaching, the nuns have nothing else. They have no backing, do not promote themselves, do not engage in social activities, and refuse any praise from the secular world. They rely on the cooperation of Catholics all over the world. They never solicit donations in Shanghai or anywhere in China. Moreover, in the past, their expenses were small, and the nuns were frugal, yet the cause flourished. However, since the outbreak of the war, the situation has completely changed. The sources of donations from abroad and from various foreign firms in this city have been cut off, but the rising prices have caused their expenses to expand continuously. In various primary and secondary schools, there are many free or half-price students, and it is already very difficult to barely maintain operations. Other purely social relief undertakings are in danger of collapsing due to economic difficulties. The most serious of these is the food problem. Taking only the Notre Dame orphanage and educational institution as an example, they need at least 4,000 catties of rice per month. The amount provided by the household registration is naturally far from sufficient. The Renshan Yuyingtang orphanage in the city needs at least five bags of rice per month and is now almost relying on borrowing rice to get by each day. The porridge, rice, and bread needed to feed the poor at the entrance of Notre Dame cost at least 100 yuan per day. The second problem is the difficulty of obtaining medicine. The medical and pharmaceutical services they provide are extensive and involve many units. Sun Mumu, of the Renci Clinic on Datong Road, said: "We need at least 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per month for medicine. Last month, we spent 900 yuan on scabies medicine alone. And the scattered consumption of injections, medicinal alcohol, ointments, adhesive plasters, cotton, gauze, etc., adds up to a considerable sum each day. The price of medicine continues to skyrocket, and they are unable to afford essential items such as glycerin, Vaseline, sulfur powder, and medicinal alcohol. It is questionable whether they will be able to continue providing medical and pharmaceutical services in the future. In addition, they are experiencing difficulties in almost every aspect of education, relief, and other expenses. They have applied to the Shanghai Municipal Poor and Sick Relief Association for assistance. After investigating, Committee Members Yao Equan and Ji Zhendong expressed their satisfaction with the services provided by the hospital and were impressed by the nuns' dedication and spirit of sacrifice. They have provided a total of 50,000 yuan in subsidies, which has helped to alleviate some of the difficulties. However, the soaring prices and increasing expenses are about to crush the nuns. This is a very serious situation! In order to maintain such a perfect undertaking, how can enthusiastic women not find ways to lend them a helping hand? (The End)

### Financial and Industrial Market Conditions in Shanghai Last Week Tended Towards Normal Stability

Financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai last week tended towards normal stability. The phenomenon of tight capital has been substantially alleviated. After the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth began, the Commodity Price Investigation Committee, in addition to investigating the inventory of major commodities in the market, has further investigated the reasons for the rise in prices of food and cloth, making it impossible for merchants hoarding inventory and manipulating market prices to operate. Therefore, the prices of both commodities and food have declined. Interest rates remained stable last week, and no one changed them. Stock prices fell across the board. The black market initially fell and then rose. Official prices were stable. Silver and money firms accepted discounting as much as possible for legitimate needs, so the capital of legitimate silver and money firms was very flexible. In industry and commerce, the trading of yarn and cloth on the large market was stalled, but the prices in various retail stores have been reduced. The prices of various commodities have stopped rising and turned flat. The black market for food rice has also declined. Most food items are subject to rationing, and the holders of goods want to sell them off, so prices are lower than before. However, there have been instances of quantity reductions or delayed distribution of rationed rice, oil, and sugar. People from a living perspective feel uneasy. Factories in various industries that have sufficient raw materials have been adding shifts to resume production, while a considerable number of factories that lack raw materials have stopped production.
