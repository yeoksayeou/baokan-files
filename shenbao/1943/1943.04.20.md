### Thorough Investigation of Hoarding and Two Requests

We deeply feel that recently, prices of goods and the value of currency are rising incessantly, and the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult. At the same time, we have repeatedly received letters from various sectors expressing their distress about being unable to bear the burden of life and reporting the madness of speculators who hoard goods. They hope that we will voice justice and advocate on their behalf. We are filled with joy and gratitude, which cannot be expressed in words. Based on our observations, we convey public opinion and offer suggestions from various aspects, all to support the government's policies and alleviate the severity of high prices to win the trust of the people. However, after half a month of developments, we still believe that this major public case cannot be casually concluded. Perhaps the government currently has some unavoidable obstacles and is temporarily remaining silent. Before the government decides on a solution, we will speak frankly and directly, without any reservations or concealment, to earnestly seek the government's adoption. This is our attitude. Therefore, regarding this investigation of speculation and hoarding, we can only wait for the government's final and decisive action to be announced to the public.

There are still things we must say. While we will wait patiently for a solution, it is necessary to quickly establish measures to prevent speculation and hoarding in order to learn from past mistakes. If the investigation of hoarding involves too many parties and cannot be decisively dealt with, the following two matters can be implemented immediately:

(1) Separation of Officials and Merchants: Simply put, if you are an official, you are not allowed to engage in commerce; if you are engaged in commerce, you are not allowed to be an official. Some people serve in the Ministry of Finance while directly or indirectly participating in commercial banks. Or, some people work in national banks while also holding positions in commercial banks. This is just one example. Even if those who are officials and also engage in business are not suspected of speculation and hoarding, they still contradict the government's decree that "civil servants are not allowed to engage in business," leaving no room for excuses or explanations. Therefore, we sincerely request the government to issue a strict order, setting a deadline, and requiring civil servants to examine themselves and voluntarily resign from either their official or commercial positions, focusing on one area. Those who do not resign by the deadline will be subject to disciplinary action once discovered.

(2) National Banks Should Have Standards for Lending: The scope of business operations for national banks is clearly defined in the "Central Reserve Bank Law." Article 26 of the law provides restrictions on operations, with Section 2 stating: "The total amount of loans, rediscounts, or other advances to private individuals, companies, or other private legal entities, and the purchase of their drafts, checks, or other negotiable instruments, shall not exceed 500,000 yuan per entity..." Section 7 states: "No credit loans or overdrafts shall be made." Section 8 states: "No operations of a speculative nature shall be conducted." In recent years, many new small banks have been established in Shanghai. It is rumored that many of them have credit loans and overdrafts with the Central Reserve Bank due to certain special relationships, and the amount of these loans reaches millions or more. We ask, what standards do these newly established small banks meet to obtain loans? After obtaining loans, are they used to support industry and commerce or to engage in speculation and hoarding? We certainly have no way of knowing the actual business and accounting situation of the Central Reserve Bank and cannot definitively say that this is happening. As the saying goes, "There is no smoke without fire." We would like to borrow a common phrase from official documents: "Correct it if it exists, and be vigilant if it does not." We hope that the bank will be cautious in its lending. At the same time, we hope that the government authorities in charge will closely investigate the bank's lending operations to ensure they are legal and supervise them at all times to ensure compliance.

The Control Yuan, the highest supervisory body of the central government, has the power to impeach and audit according to law. Control Yuan members may individually propose impeachment for illegal or derelict behavior by civil servants. We hope that the Control Yuan authorities will pay attention to this investigation of hoarding. When necessary, based on the special powers granted by the government, they should not be afraid of trouble or show any hesitation, and after confirming the facts of the matter, they should file an impeachment, using the Control Yuan's independent position to exert the effectiveness of the supervisory power and fulfill the supervisory responsibility.

We firmly believe that if the government wants to strengthen its political position, it must first gain the unanimous trust of the people. Gaining the people's trust can only be achieved by improving their livelihoods. Currently, solving the price problem is the most effective way to improve the people's livelihood. At the same time, cracking down on speculation and hoarding is the most urgent and effective way to solve the price problem. We believe that the wise authorities have long understood this. Today, we must reiterate two points: First, we await the results of the thorough investigation of hoarding to reassure the public. Second, we must strictly prevent the recurrence of speculation and hoarding in the future to avoid causing great suffering to the public.

Commentary

### Desperation of Enemy Tactics

Our Japanese people need no further examples from foreign countries to prove how base and cruel the enemy's methods of warfare are. However, the bombings that the enemy is now inflicting on European countries not only demonstrate their increasingly exposed cruelty and inferior national character, but also show that in order to reverse their losing situation to their advantage, they are resorting to methods that are condemned by both gods and men. They are carrying out brutal blind bombing not only against Germany and Italy, but also against France, the Netherlands, and Belgium. No, it cannot simply be called blind bombing; it is simply a planned bombing of non-combatant civilians. Judging from the bombing targets they are currently implementing in Europe, it is so. Judging from the behavior of the American planes that attacked Japan around this time last year—for example, indiscriminately bombing schools knowing that they were schools—it is also so.

According to recent reports, the British Air Minister, Sinclair, recently made the outrageous statement that "the results of the British Air Force's war are determined by the extent of the damage to residential areas." People often thought that the British were cruel, which was common knowledge, but that no matter how cruel they were, they were still a step behind the Americans. However, after hearing Sinclair's words, one must realize that there is absolutely no difference between Americans and British, and there is no room for doubt. If the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy were to retaliate with the same methods when the United States and Britain resorted to such extremely despicable methods of attack, there would be nothing wrong with it. However, what justification can be given for the fact that the United States and Britain are planning to bomb civilians who are neutral, like the French? For example, after the French military authorities declared Paris a non-defended city, even the German army, which was at war, respected it. However, the British Air Force began bombing Paris after France had returned to a neutral position. Furthermore, the number of cities targeted for bombing is increasing daily. The damage suffered by the western and northwestern cities below Rouen is extremely tragic. Moreover, this trend has intensified recently, and news has come that they are indiscriminately bombing residential areas in Paris again. It is only natural that the French people are expressing hatred and anger over this, and they have filed a complaint with the International Red Cross in the name of the nation, questioning the intentions of the United States and Britain toward France. Furthermore, judging from the bombing of innocent civilians in small countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands, is this the war morality practiced by great powers?

The United States and Britain are now disregarding war morality. During the previous World War, the American army was completely ignorant of war morality, and this opinion was shared by both enemies and friends. But today, the British army has also become like the American army, indiscriminately disregarding war morality. Their bombing of France, the Netherlands, and Belgium is not only due to their cruelty, but also a means with a certain purpose. That purpose may be to drive these people to revolt, or at least it is a foolish plan to incite great chaos, or perhaps they are foolishly thinking that this will somehow be advantageous to their landing operations on the European continent. In short, there is no doubt that it is out of some purpose.

Expediting the opening of the current war situation is an urgent matter for the United States and Britain. The German-Soviet front will continue in its current state and enter the summer war. The northern front will soon enter the hot season when fighting is impossible, facing a bleak future. Therefore, their anxiety is clearly visible. However, it is also foreseeable that as their anxiety increases, they will increasingly resort to desperate violence. We can also infer the enemy's plans to invade the sacred land of Japan according to the standards mentioned above. Therefore, we should have a deep awareness to prepare for it, and we should remember that the enemy does not care about war morality, and no matter what they do, we must not regard it as unexpected.

### Japanese Aircraft Active in the Pacific, Guadalcanal Island Bombed, Australian Prime Minister Curtin Appeals to the United States, Current Air Force Strength Insufficient for Defense

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency): According to Washington reports, the U.S. Navy Department announced yesterday that Japanese planes attacked U.S. military positions on Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands on Friday night, causing significant property damage and casualties.

Buenos Aires, 19th (Central News Agency): According to news received here, the Australian government recently echoed the call of Allied Supreme Commander MacArthur, requesting the Washington Joint Chiefs of Staff to send air force units to reinforce Australia. However, the U.S. government repeatedly insisted on the measures agreed upon at the Quebec Conference and did not comply with the request. As a result, the opinions of U.S. Navy Secretary Knox and MacArthur became increasingly divergent. In a broadcast address to the nation on the evening of the 18th, Australian Prime Minister Curtin pointed out the threat of the Japanese army, saying that Roosevelt and Churchill had decided on a global strategy at the Quebec Conference, and Australia would immediately act in accordance with this decision. As a result, Australia consumed a great deal of resources and combat power in various aspects, and mobilized as much as possible in other departments. Therefore, the people should know that the difficulties in the future will definitely increase and should redouble their efforts. I would like to reiterate to the Allied nations that the Australian government highly approves of the global strategy decided at the Quebec Conference, that is, we agree to use Australia as the base for launching offensives after defeating the German army. However, this does not mean that the amount of military supplies and especially military aircraft shipped to Australia is small. Even the current amount is good for a protracted war in the Southwest Pacific. For example, when Japanese planes bombed Milne Bay last week, although the Allied Air Force took off to counterattack, many Japanese planes ignored the Allied planes' interception and finally flew over the target area to complete their mission. The so-called mission was to sink our valuable ships. Although the Allied forces want to launch a counterattack against the Japanese army, there has been no opportunity to do so. Moreover, each Japanese air raid makes Australia feel deeply threatened, and the increase in air force strength is also being depleted. Therefore, Australia is facing a great crisis, which the people should not ignore.

### Allied Air Force Ace, MacKay Killed in Action

Buenos Aires, 18th (Central News Agency): The Japanese army's continuous fierce bombing of Allied bases in the Southwest Pacific has caused the Allied forces to be extremely panicked. Recently, it has been rumored that Allied bombing ace Major General MacKay was killed in an airplane collision on Yuga Island. Regarding this news, the Australian Allied Command Headquarters recently issued the following statement: Major MacKay, the bombing king of the Southwest Pacific, recently died in battle for no reason. It is said that when MacKay set off for a bombing mission last week, a team of aircraft from Yuga flew off the runway and collided with his plane, causing the plane to immediately overturn. All the bombs on board exploded, so Major MacKay and all the pilots on board were killed in the explosion.

Statement Before Leaving Manchukuo

Dalian, 19th (Central News Agency): Zhou Fohai, our country's Special Envoy to Manchukuo, issued a statement before leaving Manchukuo to return home, clarifying the determination of China, Japan, and Manchukuo to cooperate in completing the war. The gist of the statement was as follows: "During my visit to Manchukuo, I received a warm welcome from the government and people of Manchukuo, as well as the Kwantung Army, and was immediately granted all kinds of conveniences for my inspection, which enabled me to complete my mission. I am truly grateful. I previously issued a statement upon my arrival in your country, stating that my mission in visiting your country was twofold: (1) to promote the unity of China and Manchukuo in order to cooperate with our ally Japan in completing the Greater East Asia War, and (2) to inspect the state of your country's economic construction over the past decade. Although I was only in Xinjing from the 9th to Dalian on the 16th, for only eight days, I gained a great deal, which was unexpected. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the government and people of Manchukuo, as well as the Kwantung Army. The completion of the Greater East Asia War requires both spiritual and material strength. Now I know that Manchukuo, like China and Japan, has the same determination and belief to strive for victory with the Axis powers, with one heart and one mind, united as one. This is proof that Manchukuo already possesses spiritual strength. I have visited Jilin, Harbin, Fengtian, Lushun, Anshan, and other places and witnessed the scale and progress of the military industrial facilities in those places. This is proof that Manchukuo already possesses material strength. The East Asian Axis has such great and powerful spiritual and material strength, and I am confident that the final victory will belong to us. During this visit, I believe that our future prospects are unlimited and that we can achieve a bright future. Therefore, we must continue to work harder to achieve the final victory as soon as possible."

Talk to Reporters

Beijing, 19th (Central News Agency): After our country's Special Envoy Zhou Fohai and his entourage arrived in the ancient capital, he met with newspaper reporters at the Qin Zheng Hall in Zhongnanhai at 4:00 PM and issued a statement, the gist of which was as follows: "North China must be North China of the Central Government, and the Central Government must be the Central Government of North China. The people under the rule of the National Government, regardless of region, should hold firm to their beliefs and move forward courageously, especially at a time when the final victory of the Greater East Asia War still requires our efforts. We should unite externally and unify internally. We must thoroughly realize that dispersion leads to weakness and concentration leads to strength. If our country cooperates with our ally Japan with dispersed strength, the effect will be minimal. Therefore, in order to fulfill the sacred mission that China bears, we should adjust the form of separation and dispersion and create a situation of national unity to become a strong partner of our ally Japan and a strong link in the Greater East Asia Axis. We must not only understand the current situation in East Asia and the world, but also understand that this war is a sacred war fought by our Axis countries for justice and righteousness. Our ally Japan, based on a spirit of righteousness, took the lead in returning the concessions and leased territories in our country and abolished extraterritoriality in China, allowing us to complete our mission of striving for independence, freedom, and liberation, making us feel that the future is infinitely bright. Today, seeing the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun fluttering in the area of the former embassies of Great Britain and the United States in China is especially encouraging. However, the remaining forces of Great Britain and the United States have not been completely eliminated, and the final victory still requires our efforts. I dare to tell my compatriots that if we want to achieve this goal, we can only strive for unity externally, making the East Asian Axis as strong as iron and stone, and use all the manpower and material resources of East Asia to carry out the war. Then, the surrender of Great Britain and the United States can be expected, and the victory of the war can be expected. As for the country, if we can cooperate strongly and work together with Japan to liberate East Asia, we can only make up for the shortcomings of fragmentation and dispersion and become a unified country that lives up to its name. We dare to believe that the people of the country will agree with this. Wise men in China and Japan may ask me, what is the Central Government's plan for the construction of the North? I dare to answer that the Central Government has never forgotten everything in the North. However, in the past, due to lack of strength, it has not been able to provide much support for the construction of the North. In the future, regarding the exchange of materials and the regulation of finance, as long as the Central Government is able to do so, it will do its best to improve the lives of the people in the North. I have not been to the North for three years. This time, I plan to exchange views with the authorities in North China and the allied authorities in North China on issues such as stabilizing the people's livelihood in China and strengthening China's combat power so that China can fulfill its responsibilities in the Greater East Asia War, and the people's livelihood in China can become more stable day by day. This time, I was sent to visit Manchukuo and was warmly welcomed by the government and people of Manchukuo. I am deeply grateful. After inspecting various places, I saw the rapid progress of their various constructions and deeply respect the painstaking efforts of the authorities. At the same time, I also feel that the urgency of developing our country's industry is becoming more and more urgent."

### Germany Appoints Wörmann as Ambassador to China, Vice Foreign Minister Zhou Expresses Welcome

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency): The German government's appointment of Dr. Wörmann as the successor to the Ambassador to China proves that the relationship between China and Germany has become even closer. Zhou Longxiang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, expressed a warm welcome to Mr. Wörmann's appointment to our country and issued the following statement: "Our ally, the German government, has appointed Dr. Wörmann as the Ambassador to China, and we are very happy to welcome him. Dr. Wörmann is highly experienced and respected and has served in the German diplomatic service for a long time. His vast experience is rich. His appointment as Ambassador to China will surely make the relationship between China and Germany even closer. In the past, Ambassador Stahmer and Chargé d'Affaires Göthe had a deep understanding of the East Asian situation and made great contributions to promoting friendship between China and Germany. Now, Dr. Wörmann, who succeeds as Ambassador to China, will also be able to use his experience and knowledge in the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promote the increase of friendly relations between China and Germany. At present, our ally Germany is bravely fighting against communism and British and American imperialism in Europe and has achieved the foundation for victory. At the same time, the construction of the new order in Europe is also progressing under the efforts of our ally Germany, in order to promote the world's permanent peace. Since our country declared war on Great Britain and the United States on January 9th this year, we have been working closely with our ally Japan to eliminate the forces of British and American aggression in East Asia over the past century and to advance the construction of the new order in Greater East Asia, so that the world's overall peace, which is in line with justice, will be established at an early date. Both sides' efforts are completely consistent, and it is deeply believed that after the new Ambassador Dr. Wörmann comes to China, he will be able to make great contributions to the cooperation and communication in the construction of the new order in the East and West."

### Communist Self-Defense Corps Leader Leads His Troops to Defect

Nantong, 19th (Central News Agency): The Communist bandits have a joint defense office in Tonghai, which is under the command of Wen Wenwei. The director of the office, Tang Jingyan, who is also the leader of the people's self-defense corps, has always been quite dissatisfied with the Communist Party's deceptive policies. Since the start of the "Purification of the Countryside" in northern Jiangsu, Tang has decided to break away from the Communist Party and join the peace movement.

### Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industries Speaks on Wartime Industrial Facilities

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) – Recognizing that the Ministry of Industries' responsibilities are closely related to the people's livelihood, the reporter visited Yuan Yuquan, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industries, to understand relevant industrial issues during wartime. He answered the various industrial questions as follows:

(Question) How can industry be revitalized to adapt to the wartime system? (Answer) To revitalize industry, a reasonable system of control is essential. The government's priority is to adjust past control methods to make them more reasonable while strengthening industrial and commercial organizations, such as trade associations. The recently established National Commercial Control Association is part of the adjustment efforts. The most important aspect of industry is solving the people's clothing and food problems. The Ministry's primary focus will be on increasing the production of cotton, hemp, wool, and other fabric products to meet the people's clothing and food needs.

(Question) How should our country revitalize the military-managed factories returned by friendly nations and resume production? (Answer) Regarding the factory issue, the authorities are currently developing a comprehensive plan, with the restoration of factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places as the first step. However, the two major problems of raw materials and fuel must be resolved first, so the government is actively seeking ways to increase production to solve the fuel shortage. Although raw materials for various paper industries are currently difficult, we must also actively seek to increase production. However, at present, we can only strive to ensure a self-sufficient supply of industrial raw materials.

(Question) How can prices be suppressed and illegitimate business practices such as speculation and hoarding be stopped? (Answer) The authorities are currently working on adjusting commercial institutions while guiding idle capital in the market to engage in productive enterprises. The urgent task is to bring the movement of funds in the market onto the right track, and the speculative atmosphere can be gradually eliminated.

(Question) The cooperative business of consumer co-ops seems to be insufficient at present. What countermeasures does the authorities have to adjust it? (Answer) At present, general prices are too high, and the purchasing power of the general public is weak. The palliative measure is to have economical consumption. As for the fundamental solution, of course, we must quickly enrich rural finance and increase production so that the supply and demand of living materials can be balanced, and prices can be stabilized.

### Mr. Takesha Koya and Mr. Tanigawa Depart from Tianjin to Return to Their Country

Beijing, 19th (Central News Agency) – Japanese cultural envoys Takesha Koya and Tanigawa Tetsuzo attended the second conference of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in Nanjing. After the conference, they came here to conduct an inspection. They took a train to Tianjin at 4:00 PM on the 19th and are scheduled to depart tomorrow morning to return to their country via Manchuria.

### The Japanese Financial Control Association Holds its First General Meeting

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Financial Control Association held its first general meeting at the Banking Association Hall here at 10:00 AM today. More than 250 officials and members attended the meeting. Minister of Finance Kaya, Director of the Banking Bureau Yamagiwa, and other related officials from the Japanese government were present. First, Chairman Yuki reported on the business and accounting situation for the Showa 17th year (1942). The meeting began at 11:00 AM. First, a resolution of gratitude to the Japanese army was passed, followed by a speech by Chairman Yuki. Then, Minister of Finance Kaya delivered a financial and fiscal speech. After the speech, everyone had lunch and adjourned at 1:00 PM. In his speech, Chairman Yuki stated that the Financial Control Association has been studying and implementing various measures to improve the operations of financial institutions, especially regarding the centralized settlement of domestic remittances, which will soon be implemented by the Bank of Japan. The centralized settlement of domestic remittances in Japan will be implemented starting April 1st of this year. Here is a summary of Minister of Finance Kaya's speech: The government set a savings target of 2.3 billion yen for the Showa 17th year last spring. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the national people, the results exceeded the target. The target amount for the Showa 18th year (1943) is 2.7 billion yen, of which 2.1 billion yen will be digested when various financial institutions and government agencies absorb funds. To increase national savings, the government is implementing various bills passed by the 80th Diet. The government's reason for allowing ordinary banks to engage in both savings bank business and trust business is also to increase national savings. The government, facing the increasing importance of enhancing savings and appropriate bank funds, will not adhere to past policies and will reform financial institutions that should be reformed to maximize the functions of financial institutions. During this decisive phase, the economic situation is constantly changing, and the financial sector is constantly facing new problems. Therefore, each financial control group should mobilize subordinate agencies to cooperate with the government and quickly establish solutions to these problems.

### Macau Correspondence A Glimpse of Zhengzhou, Xuchang, and Luohe, Three Important Towns in Central Henan on the Pinghan Railway

— Xian Zhang

Henan, formerly known as Zhongzhou, is a land of four battles. Zhengzhou, Xuchang, and Luohe, the three military towns in central Henan along the Pinghan Railway, are at the crossroads of east-west and north-south traffic. During the times of military conflicts throughout history, the safety and gain or loss of these places often determined the future of the overall situation.

Before the war, Zhengzhou was the largest commercial port in Henan. After the outbreak of the war, although it was affected by the Yellow River breach and the dismantling of railways, the average value of goods imported from the east bank of the Yellow River every day last spring was over 10 million yuan.

Before the war, Xuchang was the export hub of tobacco from Xuchang, Xiangcheng, Jiaxian, Wuoyang, Yexian and other areas. After the war, although the railways were dismantled, on the other hand, Xiangcheng, because it is located on the south side of the Ru River, ships can directly reach Bengbu, taking over Xuchang's pre-war position. However, there are as many as dozens of machine-made cigarette factories in Xuchang, which are still second to none in the counties of central Henan. Yucheng Tobacco Factory, famous for making Lingjian brand cigarettes, had a capital of only 2,000 yuan at the beginning of the war, but has now accumulated to 20 million yuan, and pays tens of thousands of yuan in taxes every month, which is really a ten-thousand-fold profit.

Luohe and Yancheng (ancient Shaoling) face each other across the Sha River. Because it and Zhumadian are distribution centers for soybeans and sesame in the counties of central Henan, after the Pinghan Railway was opened to traffic, in just thirty or forty years, it and Huiyuanzhai to the south of the station merged into one, developing into a city that stretches for five li. Because it is located on the Sha River, ships can directly reach Jieshou and Bengbu, and cars can also go east to Jieshou, Fuyang, Guoyang, and Haocheng, northwest to Luoyang and Xi'an, and southwest to Fuyang and Laohekou. Therefore, after the war, it replaced Zhengzhou's position and replaced it. In the 29th year of the Republic (1940), the average daily transaction volume reached about 5 million yuan. The old railway platform has all become bustling commercial areas.

Since Zhengzhou was lost once last autumn and material blockade was intensified, the function of the three towns as supply lines to the rear has gradually been lost. Zhengzhou has become a dead market due to the strict blockade of the river by both sides. Many shops in Xuchang have also closed, and Luohe shares the same fate with Jieshou. In addition, Henan has suffered from two seasons of famine this year, especially in central Henan. Local trade has also declined sharply. Looking back at the prosperity of the three towns a year or two ago, it really feels like a different world.

Traveling in the central Henan area also evokes a sense of nostalgia. Zhengzhou and Xinzheng were the sites of the ancient Zheng state and the focus of the Jin-Chu rivalry. The small country was located between two major powers, and its situation was very pitiful. Xuchang is where Cao Cao forced Emperor Xian of Han to move the capital. To this day, the altar where he received the abdication and the sign where he received the abdication still exist (recently, the local people burned four-fifths of the bottom of the stele because the officials ordered them to copy it without restraint). The bones of Cao Cao and his sons have already decayed. Going west from Xuchang to Xiangyang and Yexian, there is the place where Guan Gong挑锦袍, 　谷旧地, Yingkaoshu's tomb, Li Ying's tomb, Changju and Jieni plowing together, the place where Zilu asked for directions, the former Yingchuan county to the south, and the tombs of the Han Xun family's eight dragons to the north, full of ancient charm, like a person in a historical scene. Compared with traveling in the south, which is richer from an economic point of view, it is as interesting as seeing 横波沙 at the time of the Han Dynasty from an archaeological point of view.

### Axis Forces Meet in Tunisia Preparing to Launch a Fierce Counterattack The Northern Part Has Completed a Strong Defense Line

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Today's Berlin news: The Axis forces have greatly increased their strength, and all anti-Axis offensives in the Bega and Mejez El-Bab areas of Tunisia have been repelled. A surprise attack by German and Italian forces has defeated the concentrated enemy forces. The Axis forces have captured a total of 63 people, 2 anti-aircraft guns, and many heavy infantry weapons. There have only been small-scale offensives in other parts of the front, and the Axis positions have continued to be strengthened. According to the communication from a British visitor in North Africa, the Axis counterattack will soon be realized. German Lieutenant General Arning has transferred a large number of reinforcements to the Mejez el-Bab area, and the Axis forces are now preparing to launch a large-scale offensive from this area. There is fierce fighting along the road from Fondouk to Tunis. The German army has skillfully set up a machine gun network, and the British and American forces have suffered heavy losses. Eisenhower told British reporters that the German army has laid hundreds of thousands of mines in the war zone, making anti-Axis operations difficult. It is reported that the British Eighth Army is currently moving along a front of about 30 miles between the mountains and Enfidaville. Both sides' air forces are very active due to the clear weather.

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – The front-line correspondent of the German News Agency reported on the Tunisian war situation on the 18th as follows: The Axis positions in Tunisia are becoming increasingly strengthened, and the Rommel and Arnim armies have completed joint operations. Due to the meeting of the two armies, the new combat power of the Axis forces has been greatly strengthened. On the 17th, in addition to repelling the anti-Axis forces in the Benghia and Mejez El-Bab areas, the French rebel forces who attacked the Axis positions were completely repelled. The Axis combat units, with the close assistance of dive bomber squadrons and fighter squadrons, have completed a strong defense line and closely monitored all anti-Axis attack attempts. According to the German military authorities, German fighters engaged in a magnificent air battle with the anti-Axis air force bombing fighter formation over the Mediterranean Sea on the 17th, resulting in the downing of eight enemy aircraft, including five four-engine bombers.

### A Naval Battle Occurs in the Mediterranean Sea One British Destroyer Sunk

Rome, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Italian military headquarters announced on the 18th that after the Italian escort convoy's fast艇隊 attacked two British destroyers and sunk one of them, the Stefani News Agency published a detailed report on the battle, stating that two Italian fast艇十五日were escorting transport ships to Tunisia at night when they suddenly discovered two large enemy destroyers. They started attacking them regardless of everything and launched a fierce naval battle. As a result, one Italian fast艇struck an enemy bullet and sank. At the same time, one enemy destroyer was severely attacked by the Italian艇and was unable to move. According to the reconnaissance by Axis Italian aircraft on the morning of the 16th, it was proven that the ship exploded and sank near the battlefield. Another enemy destroyer was hit by several bullets and sailed towards Malta. The Italian escort convoy was not hindered in any way and arrived in Tunis at the scheduled time. In this battle, in addition to one Italian fast艇sinking, another was slightly injured and safely returned to base.

### Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Explains The Political Goals of the Axis Powers Nationalities of All Countries Should Respect Each Other and Cooperate Realize the Freedom of Economic Development

Rome, 19th (Central News Agency) – Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini delivered a speech yesterday at the Fascist Party's cabinet meeting discussing the budget: The political goal of the Axis powers is to implement the rights of all nationalities to respect each other and cooperate, and to seek free development based on the fair distribution of raw materials. The importance of the meeting between the two leaders of Germany and Italy is well known. Italy, which is fighting, is not seeking new solutions or striving for abstract ideas. We have no real freedom if we do not have the freedom to work according to our needs. Our goal is to strive for this freedom, which is our right.

### The Results of the German-Hungarian Talks Shatter the Dreams of Britain and the United States

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – The German leader's headquarters announced on the 18th that Hungarian Regent Horthy visited Hitler's headquarters on the 16th to exchange views on military, political, and other issues. The talks lasted for two days.

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to Haisong News: The summit meeting between the leaders of Germany and Hungary has confirmed the traditional friendship between the two countries and their spirit of fighting together. The two countries have now decided to fight until victory is achieved, and the general suspicion of Hungary's attitude by enemy countries can also be dispelled. In the past, Reuters of the United Kingdom repeatedly spread rumors that once the United Kingdom and the United States invaded Southeast Europe, the Hungarian army would not fight against the United Kingdom and the United States; or that after the United Kingdom and the United States landed in Southeast Europe, Hungary would withdraw the Hungarian army fighting on the Eastern Front. The British side also made empty promises to establish the Balkan Pact, which also included an independent Hungary. This kind of divisive trick was the same as dealing with Yugoslavia, with Mihailovic's rebel army as the vanguard of the anti-Axis invasion army. However, since the complete failure of the rebel army, the enemy's wishful thinking of Hungary's separate peace has been shattered. Then, the United Kingdom and the United States made other attempts, saying that although Hungary was willing to resist Bolshevism, it had no intention of resisting the British and American armies. After Hitler's meeting with the Hungarian Regent, the enemy's various plans completely failed. The enemy's political conspiracy can never divide the strong front of the Axis powers in Southeast Europe. Hungary, Italy, and Romania have now made it clear that they will not stop the war unless victory is achieved. Moreover, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are the same enemies, because their goals are to destroy Europe.

### US Aircraft Bomb Sicily German Aircraft Attack Algiers

German infantry units in the southern area of Lake Ilmen and the Volkhov area have broken into Soviet positions in several ways, destroying many of their tank fortifications. The German army is still continuing to bombard Leningrad with long-range artillery. On the 17th, the German artillery concentrated its fire on the Soviet canal and factory area, and continuous fires were expected.

### Swedish Foreign Ministry Denies Mediating the European War

### The Wanren Tomb Case: Requesting the International Red Cross to Investigate the Truth

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Regarding the German authorities dispatching Poles to excavate the remains of Polish officers near Smolensk, it is reported that the names of over a hundred generals have now been identified. Upon receiving a detailed report, the Polish government-in-exile in London convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the 18th, despite it being a Sunday.

### Japan is Filled with a Spirit of Unity: Must Complete the Greater East Asia War - Ba Maw Expresses Impressions of Visiting Japan

Rangoon, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After returning to Burma from a visit to Japan, Burmese Administrative Chief Ba Maw visited the Shwedagon Pagoda and convened a meeting of ministers to prepare for national construction. He also spoke to reporters about his impressions of visiting Japan, saying: "I am deeply grateful for the warm welcome I received from all levels of Japanese society during my visit. I have long admired the great spirit of unity among the Japanese people under His Majesty the Emperor. This time, I was able to truly experience this characteristic, which is a beauty of Japan. When I visited the Ise Grand Shrine, I saw the simple wooden shrine and recalled that it has been praised as the most sublime building in the world, and I deeply agree. Japanese women have an unadorned beauty, and their clothing colors are extremely harmonious. The tea ceremony and dramas during banquets are also exquisite. All this unadorned beauty, as a result of its development, forms the true Japanese concept of morality. As for Japan's strength, I found the reason among the youth in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and other places. For example, when I visited a factory in Tokyo, I saw industrial soldiers working diligently under accurate and disciplined training. When I visited the youth school in the factory, I saw thousands of young people immediately marching in orderly columns upon hearing the teacher's command. I was deeply amazed by such training. From this, I know that Japan is invincible not only in its military, but also in its young industrial warriors who bear the heavy responsibility of production. This kind of national unified group training is the best proof that Japan has the strength to complete the Greater East Asia War."

### Isogai Talks to Reporters about Hong Kong's Vigorous Construction

Hong Kong, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Governor Isogai of Hong Kong met with a group of reporters today and spoke about the state of Hong Kong's construction, saying: "As a person in charge of Hong Kong's construction, there are still unsatisfactory aspects. However, the recent construction has improved, which is a fact. (1) 'Hong Kong's position as a liaison port in the Co-Prosperity Sphere' Since April, all materials transported to various parts of South China have been unloaded in Hong Kong first, and then transferred to Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and other places. Therefore, we are actively preparing warehouses and port facilities. Currently, the materials concentrated in Hong Kong are rice, flour, and coal, but we want Hong Kong to become not only a liaison port for South China, but also to develop into a liaison port for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. (2) 'Return to Hometown Work' The return to hometown work implemented to disperse the surplus population in Hong Kong is still progressing smoothly. So far, the results of returning to the hometown are not very significant in terms of numbers, but there has been great progress in terms of quality. Furthermore, the previous tendency for special technical personnel needed in Hong Kong to leave has completely disappeared. (3) 'Construction of Machinery Sailing Ships' The first sailing ship built here is fully equipped and has already set sail. Now is the time to increase transportation capacity, so it is gratifying to have this transport ship set sail. (4) 'Efforts to Achieve Self-Sufficiency in Machinery' The most necessary thing for the construction of various industries is machinery, so we must first make every effort to achieve self-sufficiency and then establish pharmaceutical factories, using South China iron ore and planning to manufacture machinery."

### The Relationship Between China, Japan, and Vietnam is Becoming Closer

Hanoi, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the beginning of this year, various agreements have been successively concluded between Japan and Vietnam, so the relationship between the two countries is becoming closer. It is generally believed that after the return of Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Yoshizawa, the ties between the two countries will be further strengthened in politics, economy, and culture. After Ambassador Yoshizawa's return to office, he declared that the relationship between Japan and Vietnam would not change, so the friendly relations between the two countries would be further enhanced in the political field. In addition, the problems between China and Vietnam and other issues are still waiting for the cooperation of Vietnam. In the economic field, the economic agreement concluded on March 4 of this year can be applied, and at the same time, trade between Vietnam and China can be reopened, and rice can be transported to China, and trade to the south can be opened to create a new situation for the Vietnamese economy. In addition, regarding Vietnam's production undertakings, on the one hand, production can be increased, and at the same time, cooperation with Japan can actively revitalize enterprises and light industry.

### Japanese Red Cross Ship Attacked by Air

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from a Japanese frontline base: A Japanese Red Cross ship, while sailing on the South Pacific on the 15th of this month at 3:30 am, was attacked three times by enemy aircraft from the front and rear, and was hit by five bombs dropped at close range. The news of the ship after the bombing is currently unknown. The ship had the Red Cross markings stipulated by international treaties, which were very easy to identify. This illegal act by the enemy has not only aroused the indignation of Japanese soldiers, but also exposed the evil nature of the British and Americans.

### The Truth About British and American Propaganda Strategies

The enemy's British and American propaganda strategies, after five years of war and more than a year of the Greater East Asia War, have now become a wing of the so-called political offensive, revealing their sharp edge more and more. Since the beginning of this year, they have spread so-called postwar border issues, economic, monetary, food issues, national issues, etc. to the world. The countless hundreds of "postwar plans" are, needless to say, large-scale strategies of the British and American factions. During the First World War, they drove their so-called "Fourth Army" of propaganda strategies. Regardless of the continued defeats of the army, navy, and air force, they finally used the power of this Fourth Army to overthrow the Second German Empire. Based on this experience, they still hope to use this Fourth Army to achieve "final victory." How is their Fourth Army disguised now, and how are they using cunning tactics to manipulate the world? Below, we will expose the lineup and tactics of their Fourth Army, so that we can strengthen our ideological war and counterintelligence war.

### British Propaganda Strategies: New Tactics Using Radio Waves and Leaflets

(Special Correspondent Hishiya from Stockholm, Sweden, 9th) Since Lord Northcliffe during the First World War, the British strategy headquarters, which has become the so-called official propaganda strategy base, is now located in the Ministry of Information, and is under the full control of the veteran journalist Brendan Bracken. This Ministry of Information advertised the quick victory in North Africa last year, but due to Rommel's preemptive strike, taking the lead over the anti-Axis forces and occupying the key point of El Alamein, it made a mess and caused a major reshuffle of the headquarters. Now, under Bracken's leadership, they are deploying a tightly knit formation. The main work of the Ministry of Information is to engage in radio broadcasting, manage news, and carry out propaganda strategies for Axis-occupied areas and neutral countries.

The Only Weapon of the Fourth Army - Radio Broadcasting

Now, Britain is using radio broadcasting as a weapon to spread its strategic radio waves to West Asia, East Asia, Central and South America, North America, Africa, etc. The BBC (London) broadcasting station for Europe uses the languages of about 20 countries, speaking tirelessly from morning to night. Among the British broadcasts to Europe, the most ingenious and vicious strategies are the following three:

First, the so-called "Gustav Siegfried Eins" broadcasting station. In fact, it is broadcast by the BBC broadcasting station in London. In short, it is said to be "a secret transmitting device installed somewhere in Germany or its occupied territories," but in fact, it is using the same wavelength as German domestic radio to spread rumors in an attempt to disrupt and shake German rear forces. Of course, the German people will not be fooled by them. However, their persistence is indeed terrifying.

Second, the evil plan of Catholic broadcasting. To give an example: Recently, targeting listeners of Catholic broadcasts in Germany, they suddenly impersonated Vatican (Roman Papal See) broadcasts, making great speeches slandering German leaders, and also interspersed with classical music embellishments. This kind of mischief, rather than making pious believers angry, makes them dumbfounded. Their vicious impersonation and pretense have caused the Vatican to deeply detest them.

Third, the BBC uses the national languages of a batch of German-occupied areas, such as French, Norwegian, and Flemish, to broadcast. In the middle of these broadcasts, they often suddenly announce important news, or say that the exiled emperor of the occupied country "will return home tomorrow morning," or say that "British and American troops will land somewhere in the German-occupied territory on a certain day." This kind of nonsense is a bit like secret communication, hoping to confuse the people's minds in the occupied territories.

Air Dropping Forged Meat Purchase Vouchers

British newspapers, under the instructions of the authorities, often write extensively with text that stirs up the people's awareness of resistance to war, but they have always used the reason of defaming Germany to talk nonsense about their German air force's full-scale air raids on the British mainland, which has instead relaxed the people's awareness of resistance to war. Now they also feel that this method is not right, so they have launched a movement to incite the people, and recently put forward the slogan of "long-term war," saying that "our future is more and more eventful," and changed their attitude of editing guidance.

They have already learned that the old method of using airplanes to drop leaflets over occupied areas is not very effective, so recently they have started to use bundled leaflets to throw. These leaflets say: "The threat of German submarines has recently been greatly reduced, so the food transport to the British mainland is extremely smooth, and this cream is distributed to you," etc. They also drop forged meat ration vouchers from the air in an attempt to disrupt the rationing front.

British and American embassies in neutral countries are issuing daily propaganda bulletins and other pamphlets, revealing information favorable to the anti-Axis countries. The British side has also set up special agencies for cultural propaganda, especially importing books and holding gatherings of famous musicians, scientists, and writers as a new means of appeasement. The propaganda power of British and American films should not be ignored either.

A famous British diplomat who attended the Versailles Conference once lamented:

"Although propaganda is a powerful and indispensable weapon for victory, it cannot be easily overlooked that propaganda has greatly harmed postwar peace on the other hand. That is because the exaggeration of propaganda has made the enemy's hatred between the nations deeply rooted, and can never be eliminated." This is his criticism that during the last war, the British propaganda camp created the absurd rumor that "Germans even eat the meat of corpses because of insufficient food," which planted the roots of postwar disaster. Now, the British (and of course the American) propaganda camp, regardless of such lessons, is still indescribably vicious; in order to win, they can say anything extremely evil, exposing the Anglo-Saxon demonic nature to the fullest.

The General Staff That Plots Conspiracies and Assassinations

In addition to the above-mentioned Ministry of Information, Britain also has a special agency called the Intelligence Bureau. This Intelligence Bureau can be regarded as the central hub of British anti-enemy strategies, not inferior to the Ministry of Information, but jointly governed by the diplomatic, naval, and air forces. Apart from the director, Vansittart, probably no one knows its organization. On the eve of the outbreak of this war, the British Foreign Office was kept in the dark about major events such as the German-Soviet non-aggression pact and Yugoslavia's participation in the Tripartite Pact until the countries concerned announced them, and was severely attacked by the parliament. Therefore, Britain has devoted extraordinary efforts to strengthening the Intelligence Bureau since then, and now it can boast of being "the first in Europe." Its appearance can be easily imagined from the following events.

The attempted assassination of Führer Hitler in Munich in November 1939 at "Bürgerbräukeller." In 1940, British merchant Rickman and advertising agent Bicks conspired to blow up Swedish steel factories and port facilities in an attempt to prevent Swedish steel from being transported to Germany, and were discovered and imprisoned. In 1941, the luggage of the Yugoslav embassy in England suddenly exploded in a hotel in Istanbul. None of these were not espionage activities by the British Telegraph Bureau. According to a report by the Swedish newspaper Folkets Dagblad last autumn, the London Intelligence Bureau headquarters is divided into foreign, colonial, and domestic departments according to political divisions, and into army relations (managed by Colonel Waldgrave Cairn), naval relations (managed by Admiral Goodfield), air force relations (managed by Major Baron Waral), news relations (managed by Sir Cocril), painting and photography relations (managed by Lawson Bram), code relations (managed by Sir Irvine), etc. according to functions. In addition, there are consular departments and offensive departments. The offensive department even recruits legal or financial experts as cadres to engage in active international espionage activities. Such as assassination, incitement, and sabotage, all of which are carried out under the secret orders of this department. Inside the headquarters, there is also a powerful agency like the General Staff. In addition, there are three specially established teams directly under the Prime Minister's Office, which are local activity agencies of the Intelligence Bureau.

First, regarding strategy and diplomacy, it is responsible for the collection of political and economic intelligence, riots, incitement, sabotage, etc. Second, regarding tactics, that is, the military attachés belonging to the army and navy foreign embassies. Third, the so-called spies. With such a large organization, its funds are of course very large. In 1939, the expenses of the Intelligence Bureau headquarters, only used in army and navy intelligence relations, reached 2.3 million pounds. The subsequent expenses will naturally continue to increase.

Unscrupulous Espionage

During the last war and after the war, Montagu Norman, the governor of the Bank of England, and American magnate Morgan, jointly bought newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals, as well as politicians in neutral countries, etc., to collect secret information and squandered a lot of money. In 1914, the famous Irish Liberal Party fighter Sir Roger Casement was assassinated by British spies in Norway on his way from the United States to Germany. During the last war, Romanian King Carol was assassinated for insisting on neutrality, which resulted in Romania joining the Allied forces. These are all well-known facts. Mohamed Hachoutraci's work as a British spy is also a famous fact.

The facts of British espionage activities in the previous war are too numerous to mention. Following this example, then in this war, in the ingenious and vicious espionage activities of the British Intelligence Bureau, the results achieved are how many and how great, it is not difficult to imagine. The British spy's slogan is "The World is the Enemy," and in the world's political, economic, social, or war methods themselves becoming increasingly complex, the activities of spies are also becoming increasingly complex, subtle, difficult, and important. In the occupied territories, conspiracies, anti-Axis incitement and instigation, assassinations, sending Morse code signals by flashing lights on rooftops and in chimneys to guide the flight of night-time aircraft, engaging in extremely sinister anti-Axis propaganda through secret short-wave transmitters, etc., the more unfavorable the situation, the more profound the way British spies act. Moreover, the magic hands of the British Intelligence Bureau are by no means limited to Europe, which must also be understood. (Translation from the Yomiuri Hochi, April 12)

### Implementing Warehouse Inspections: Strictly Managing Commercial Warehouse Operations - Warehouses Must Cautiously Accept Consignments

In order to crack down on hoarding and suppress price increases, the authorities, based on the loan account books of various banks, thoroughly investigated hoarders. The Chenghua Company, which operated hoarding without registration, and the Jutong Bank, which was suspected of major involvement, were investigated rigorously. In order to take effective measures, in addition to ordering warehouses belonging to various banks and storage facilities set up by companies, firms, and individuals to report stored goods, the inventory of various warehouses and storage facilities was also inspected for investigation and prosecution.

Strict Management of Commercial Warehouses

### Fire at Guizhou Road: Trial Begins Yesterday; Chen Jinshan Admits to Arson Out of Hatred for His Uncle

Regarding the case of the fire at the Chen Taichang Car Rental Company at 124 Guizhou Road on the 9th of this month, which resulted in multiple fatalities, the Lao Zha Police Station has placed great importance on this matter. Initially, the owner of the car rental company, Chen Haiyuan, was suspected of arson. However, upon investigation, the value of the goods Chen had stored was over 500,000 yuan in national currency. The fire insurance he held with the Sin Sin, China United, and Ning Shao companies totaled only 20,000 old French francs. Given these circumstances, it was determined that he had no motive for arson to claim insurance money. Subsequently, a worker at the car rental company, Yao Yinquan, stated that at the time of the fire, he had gotten up to urinate and saw Chen Jinshan, the owner's nephew, carrying bedding and leaving in haste. At that moment, a fire broke out under the stairs, and the flames rapidly severed the handrail. Investigators suspected Chen Jinshan and detained him for strict questioning at the police station. Chen Jinshan confessed that he was 37 years old and the nephew of Chen Haiyuan. He worked as a painter at Chen Taichang. In January of this year, he was severely reprimanded for stealing 100 yuan that his uncle was supposed to remit to the Public Works Bureau as a business tax. Then, on April 6th, a gallon of turpentine was stolen from the shop, and he was again accused of the theft, with threats of reporting him to the authorities. Resentful of his uncle's ruthlessness, he harbored a grudge. On the night of the 8th, after going to bed at 10 p.m., he suddenly thought of revenge. Around 1 a.m., he got up and poured half a gallon of turpentine on the bamboo strips under the stairs, then set it ablaze. He then took the opportunity to flee, first spending the night at his aunt's place at the New Big Meat Shop in Tangjia Nong, and the next morning went to his brother's noodle shop, Ding Tai, on Pudong Dong Road, before returning home, where he was arrested. Yesterday morning, the case was brought before the Special Number One Court for questioning. The police charged Chen Jinshan with arson and murder, requesting that he be severely punished according to the law. When questioned, Chen Jinshan's account of the facts matched the police's findings. The court, noting that the autopsy report was still needed, ordered Chen Jinshan to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing.

### Ten Trade Associations in the City to Complete Reorganization by Month's End; Actively Recruiting Members to Strengthen Structure; Businesses Not Joining Will Be Suspended from Next Month

Trade associations in the city are being reorganized in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Associations" as ordered by the Ministry of Industry. Their internal structure and operations will soon undergo a complete transformation to facilitate the smooth control of national resources under the wartime system. The ten trade associations that have already had initiators designated—cotton, yarn, knitwear, cloth, coal, coal briquettes, new medicines, industrial oils, tobacco-matches-soap-candle, and tobacco leaf sales—are actively planning adjustments to complete their organizations by or before the 25th of this month. Businesses that have not joined these trade associations will be prohibited from operating from May 1st. In addition to actively adjusting their organizations and formally establishing themselves by the deadline, the trade associations are re-registering existing members to promote the welfare of their members. At the same time, to strengthen their ranks, they are soliciting non-member businesses to join within the specified period to avoid suspension. Businesses applying for membership must obtain a membership application and registration form from the association.

The Joint Federation of Cotton Products Industries in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has been established as ordered. All cotton product industries (including yarn factories, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, dyeing, knitting, native cloth, underwear, bedsheets-towels, handkerchiefs, and other related cotton product industries) in all counties and cities in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, in addition to those that have already joined, should complete the membership procedures in accordance with the regulations. Those who have not yet joined should immediately prepare the following documents in accordance with the regulations: (1) Membership letter of intent; (2) Certificate of organization approved by the competent authority, or notarized proof of registration; (3) Curriculum vitae of directors and supervisors; (4) List of members; (5) Articles of association; (6) Member asset survey form (capital amount and number of machines for production members); (7) Member business status survey form (historical production volume or sales volume), two copies each, and invite two members as introducers to apply for membership.

Cotton Businesses Must Register by the 21st

The Shanghai Cotton Trade Association has been approved by the Shanghai Economic Bureau to adjust its existing structure in accordance with the wartime economic policy guidelines, and Wu Renqing, Chen Qingzheng, Zhang Qiliang, Feng Junsheng, You Boqin, Li Ruifu, He Changqi, and others have been designated as initiators of the trade association. The initiators have already convened the first meeting and decided to adjust the association to strengthen its structure in accordance with the wartime system. It was also resolved to conduct a re-registration of members. All cotton businesses in the city must apply for membership, regardless of whether they were members before. They must re-register, fill out a membership application, and the person in charge must provide a letter of authorization from the business. However, old members do not need this procedure and only need to re-register. The deadline is three days, ending on the 21st. All cotton shops must join the association. This concerns their own business rights, and they should not hesitate. Late registrations will not be accepted.

### Plain Clothes for Female Police Officers in the City

Since the restoration of the female police officer system in the city, the trend of criminals using women to carry contraband has been curbed. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has now readjusted the uniforms for female police officers. From today, they will all wear plain clothes. The standard style is temporarily set as a blue cloth cheongsam, black shoes, and black socks, with a separate armband for identification. The original female police uniforms will be collected by each branch and must not be left outside to prevent abuses.

### 200 Pickpockets Arrested in One Week

The Police Department launched a second anti-pickpocketing campaign, and 200 pickpockets have been arrested in one week. The large number of arrests demonstrates the success of the police's surveillance network. The police will now offer rewards to those who report pickpocketing activities.

Female Thieves Used to Practice Tricks

The police have also discovered interesting facts during the arrest of pickpockets. According to the confession of a juvenile thief, the theft gang he belonged to was led by two major thieves. The gang was divided into two factions and operated in entertainment venues. They would first have a young female thief lure the target to an inconspicuous place and engage them in interesting conversation. Then, the gang would send someone to steal the target's wallet. This gang earned an average of 500 yuan per day. Another entire gang that was arrested specialized in robbing passengers at the wharves. As for the other arrested individuals, most did not belong to a fixed gang and committed thefts on public transportation.

Six Repeat Offenders Arrested Six Times Recently

At 6 p.m. on the 9th of this month, the Police Department learned that a large number of pickpockets were hiding in the shacks in the area of Seymour Road, Macau Road, and Xiaoshadu Road. They immediately went to the address and arrested six unemployed suspects: He Yongkang, nicknamed Xiaoshandong, 28 years old, from Xuzhou; Zhou Songlin, nicknamed Xiaokouzi, 16 years old, from Jiangbei; Liu Jiujinzi, 12 years old, from Jiangbei; Liu Songming, also known as Huamian, 16 years old, from Jiangbei; Yang Wengan, nicknamed Xiaolaizi, 12 years old, from Taizhou; and Yang Xiushan, 26 years old, from Jiangbei. Upon arrest, it was discovered that they had committed multiple pickpocketing cases in the concession. They were sent to the Special District Court for interrogation. During the investigation, they confessed that they had two accomplices at large, Yang Sanhouzi and Xiaosanzi, who jointly organized a pickpocketing gang, divided into two teams. The first team was led by He Yongkang, and the second team was led by Liu Songming. They stole valuables in the concession and shared the proceeds. At the time of their arrest, 285 yuan in cash was seized.

### National General Chamber of Commerce for Commodity Control: Six Service Creeds; Director-General Convenes Staff Meeting

The National General Chamber of Commerce for Commodity Control has been established for one month. The internal organization, except for the professional departments that will be established separately based on industry after the establishment of various industry federations, has been largely completed for the various sections and groups of the administration department. The Commodity Movement Permit Office in Hamilton Mansion, originally entrusted to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry to receive and handle on its behalf, has also been taken over by the Chamber's staff since the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at 8:30, Tang Shoumin, the Director-General of the Chamber, held a meeting at the Chamber to address all staff members. The main points of his address were as follows: "Our Chamber was established on March 15th, and the administrative departments and personnel have been arranged and are performing their respective duties. What I want to say to everyone today is that to accomplish anything, one must be impartial, selfless, and strive to be responsible. All colleagues in the Chamber have been rigorously selected and employed, and I believe that they can all put the above two points into practice without further ado. However, the Chamber is just starting, and it is a pioneering effort, and few people have experience. Therefore, I must hope that everyone will work diligently and conscientiously so as not to fail the expectations of the country and the people. To ensure that everyone has a standard to follow, I would like to present the following items that I want to say from my heart as the creeds for myself and everyone to serve this Chamber. I sincerely hope that colleagues will supervise and encourage each other and work together in a spirit of division of labor to help me shoulder the arduous mission of this unprecedented undertaking." The six creeds are listed below: (1) Impartiality and integrity are the main tenets of this Chamber; (2) Recognize that this Chamber is a purely commercial, collective, and autonomous organization, and there should be no bureaucratic habits; (3) Working together in the same Chamber requires a spirit of mutual supervision and joint responsibility; (4) Handling affairs must be quick and accurate, and courtesy and politeness should be shown to outsiders; (5) Do not accept any solicitations that violate the controlling spirit of this Chamber and affect the reputation of the entire body; (6) All matters of this Chamber must not be disclosed before they are officially announced. It is hoped that all colleagues will strictly adhere to these six rules and pay attention to them at all times. Any violation will result in dismissal or legal sanctions. I hope that all colleagues will be public-spirited, law-abiding, and supervise and encourage each other. This will be fortunate for the Chamber and fortunate for the colleagues."

### Reader's Forum: The Necessity of Increasing Police Salaries

— Zheng Yiming

All citizens hope for local peace and tranquility so that they can live and work in peace. Shanghai is a major commercial port where Chinese and foreigners live together. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, police administration has improved, and theft cases have decreased significantly, for which we sincerely pray.

Defending the territory requires the army; maintaining local order relies on the police. The police are indispensable protectors of our citizens every day, so we should provide them with sufficient salaries to maintain their livelihoods, to reassure them, and to encourage their spirit of service.

However, according to my recent investigation, the monthly salary of a patrolman in the concession is 285 yuan, while the police in Western Shanghai and the city receive less than 100 yuan per month. It is really difficult to live in Shanghai on these salaries. If we calculate based on the cost of living index, these meager salaries can only support one person for ten days! Everyone knows that the police have heavy responsibilities, so we must ensure that they can not only maintain their own livelihoods but also support their wives and three children. Now, society only knows that the police take advantage of their positions and behave improperly, but they do not know that their salaries are indeed meager. I say this not to defend the police who cannot maintain their integrity, but to thoroughly eliminate their corrupt behavior and to address what our citizens should pay attention to.

I run a factory on Jessfield Road. In a small house next to the factory lives a police officer with a junior high school education. He is very loyal. Last month, he came to the factory and asked me to take in his son as an apprentice. He said that his monthly police salary was only 93 yuan, and he had to pay for his own meals. He has parents, his wife, and two children to support. His monthly expenses are at least 500 yuan. Fortunately, his wife sells vegetables and can earn more than 400 yuan to supplement the family income. Now that prices are soaring, he cannot expect his son to graduate from elementary school and is eager to have him work in the factory, as long as he gets food, regardless of any stipend.

Hearing this, I realized that police salaries are so meager. I never imagined that those who protect us citizens every day are treated worse than the apprentices in our factory. Because the apprentices' meals are provided by the factory, and they receive a stipend of 50 to 60 yuan per month and annual bonuses.

Writing this, I dare to publicly appeal to the government authorities and the citizens. It is absolutely necessary to greatly increase police salaries. To stabilize the lives of the police is to ensure social security, and I hope everyone will pay attention to this matter.

### City Health Authorities Actively Launch Epidemic Prevention Campaign; Implementing Inspection of Epidemic Prevention Certificates Next Month

Starting today (the 20th), widespread epidemic prevention vaccination campaigns have been launched in all districts of the city. In addition to establishing health sub-offices at designated locations to vaccinate residents, the health authorities are encouraging hospitals and Baojia chiefs to automatically set up free vaccination points to prevent some residents from being left out. In the next month, the authorities will not enforce the inspection of epidemic prevention certificates, but will inspect them on various roads after late May, requiring every resident to have a citizen's certificate. In addition to epidemic prevention vaccination, the health authorities are also actively launching epidemic prevention matters. It is said that public and private epidemic hospitals have been planning to open in the near future, and precautionary measures have been taken for isolating plague patients and rescue methods. The epidemic prevention publicity campaign will likely be held at the beginning of next month. In addition to health workers, school students, Baojia youth group members, and hospital doctors and nurses will be invited to participate. The publicity program will not only encourage the public to get vaccinated but also make them understand various epidemic prevention methods, with particular emphasis on fly eradication.

French Concession Actively Promoting

The epidemic prevention work in the French Concession has been actively carried out since the 12th of this month, with more than 60 doctors and personnel providing vaccinations in various districts within the concession every day, assisted by Baojia personnel. It is estimated that 15,000 people are vaccinated each month. Doctors have also been sent to various schools and groups to provide vaccinations. According to accurate statistics, more than 75,000 residents within the concession have been vaccinated. Starting from the 3rd of next month, additional personnel will be deployed to expand the work, increasing the current number by more than half, with more than 100 people going to various districts to carry out epidemic prevention work and vaccinate residents, with the goal of completing the vaccination in May to maintain public health in the summer.

City Health Meeting

The Shanghai Health Bureau held a bureau meeting in its auditorium yesterday morning at 11 a.m. to discuss various measures for launching the epidemic prevention campaign, with particular emphasis on the promotion of hygiene and cleanliness in Nanshi.

Western Shanghai Vaccination of Shantytowns

Since the Western Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Corps established 11 epidemic prevention vaccination teams on the 16th of this month, they immediately set off to carry out vaccination in the shantytowns in the Western Shanghai district for three days. The mission was originally scheduled to be completed on the 18th, but due to insufficient time, they continued to carry out vaccinations in the Xujiahui, Hujiazhai, and Lu Xuezhai Xinchang factories in the Western Shanghai district from the 19th. Starting today, they will continue to carry out comprehensive vaccinations at various entrances and exits in the Western Shanghai district as usual.

### Sports: No Fighting in West Union Football League; Friendship League Leads

In the 1942-1943 West Union Football League, there were no battles on the western front this week. In the future, Jiaozhou Park may be open to the public. The West Union Standing Committee must find another stadium to complete the season smoothly. In Group A, if the scores are equal, there will be a replay of the finals. (In the past, if the champion had equal points, the ranking was determined by the number of goals scored.) This will be decided by the committee. Currently, the Friendship League leads with seven wins and four draws. Although the Italian Navy has 16 points, it is second to the Friendship League. However, it has played one less game. In terms of actual ratio, the two teams are tied. Donghua helped others last week by forfeiting to the Friendship League. The third place remains unchanged. The fourth place Jewish team has four wins, two draws, and four losses, with 10 points. The Portuguese Chamber of Commerce closely follows, followed by St. Francis. Although Socell has fought many battles and lost, they have always gone all out.

Yesterday's newspaper was released at 7 o'clock.

### Business World

Since February of this year, the total amount of soybeans purchased from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and transported to Shanghai has reached 40,000 tons, which is solely for the use of oil extraction plants. Therefore, the supply of edible oil is expected to gradually increase in the future.

### Commentary: Mergers and Additions

It is strange that Japan's wartime economic system is now in inverse proportion to China's wartime economic system.

Take the merger and addition of banks, for example!

The number of ordinary commercial banks in Japan has decreased from 376 in Showa 12 (1937) to 149 in Showa 17 (1942) since the outbreak of the war. The number of savings banks has also decreased from 72 in Showa 12 to 69 in Showa 17. In January of this year, two major banks (Mitsui and Dai-Ichi) merged to form the Imperial Bank. This is the outline of mergers in the Japanese banking sector to adapt to the wartime economic system.

What about the banking sector in China? In recent years, not only has it not been able to merge and reduce like its eastern neighbor, but it has sprung up like mushrooms after rain. The authorities managing financial institutions seem to have adopted an attitude that the more, the better, and they are freely adding to the number of institutions. Taking Shanghai as an example, in recent years, 91 newly established banks, trust companies, money shops, and others have been approved and registered, and there are 74 more under review, making the financial institutions in Shanghai as numerous as carp crossing the river. Some have joked that they are "bank stalls."

It would be fine if bank stalls did not hinder people's livelihoods! However, it is said that the main business of newly established small banks and money shops is speculation and hoarding to make huge profits, disregarding the livelihoods of ordinary people. The distance between them and the wartime economic system is probably tens of millions of miles!

Let bygones be bygones, and the future can be pursued. I hope that both the government and the public will quickly clean up this deformed "small bank and money shop stall," otherwise, the entire Shanghai will collapse!

### Various Food Industries Begin to Organize Associations

In addition to rice, the food materials managed by the Ministry of Food include flour, miscellaneous grains, livestock products, sugar, oils, tea, vegetables, fruits, seasonings, canned foods, aquatic products, brewing, and others, totaling 13 departments. Among them, flour and six other industries are related to people's livelihoods and should be controlled. The Ministry has ordered them to be listed as important food materials and has instructed the Ministry's staff stationed in Shanghai to promptly promote their reorganization. All preparation directors, deputy directors, and preparation staff of the major food materials federations and associations have also been assigned. The internal personnel issues of each association have been handled and resolved by the Shanghai office's staff at all levels. It is only waiting for the Ministry of Food to approve the organization rules of each association before convening an establishment meeting and electing officers. As for the future business policies of each industry and how to cooperate with relevant commercial groups in friendly countries, they are currently under discussion. As soon as each association is established, it will begin operations. The Ministry's Shanghai office held a discussion meeting at 4 p.m. on the 19th, attended by all Shanghai staff and the preparation directors, deputy directors, and preparation staff of the six major material industries, totaling more than 20 people. The meeting adjourned at 6 p.m. It is expected that the industry associations in the Shanghai area and the federations in various regions for these six industries will be organized by the end of this month at the latest.

### Food Groups Ordered to Reorganize

Unsound Institutions Will Be Banned; Due to the unsoundness of the existing institutions in the food industry in the city, a reform movement was launched by people in the industry, and the Ministry of Food of the National Government was telegraphed for instructions. It is now reported that an order has been received from the Ministry to reorganize them immediately. Miscellaneous grains, edible oils, and other industries have separately appointed preparation committees. The previous unsound institutions will be abolished.

### City Economic Bureau Denies Organizing Chinese Stock Review Committee

Yesterday, the Gu Bao newspaper reported that "The Chinese Stock Review Committee has been established by the City Economic Bureau in conjunction with Chinese stock merchants, and all payments for Chinese stock transactions are transferred to banks," according to a Central News Agency reporter. Yesterday, a special inquiry was made to the City Economic Bureau to ascertain the truth. According to the person in charge of the bureau, although the establishment of the Chinese Stock Review Committee and the transfer of payments to banks are stipulated in the Provisional Regulations issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to ban the buying and selling of Chinese company stocks by Shanghai stock merchants, the implementation has been temporarily suspended by order of the municipal government and with the approval of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. These two regulations will be formally announced by the government when it is necessary to implement them. The reported details are completely false and are obviously rumors fabricated by illegal merchants in an attempt to confuse the public. It is hoped that all sectors will not be deceived.

### Central China Revitalization Corporation Expected to Begin Operations This Month with a Budget and Capital Reaching Over 240 Million Yuan

Chinese Side to Be Responsible for Match Company

This event will be realized after the Match Industry Federation is formally established.

### Hong Kong Authorities Stipulate Exchange Controls for Trade in Specific Regions

Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th – The Hong Kong Governor's Office, in order to crack down on exchange remittances to specific regions, promulgated a Governor's Order and Notice on the 19th, stipulating detailed procedures. The authorities also issued a statement explaining the policy of the crackdown, which stated: "It is hereby stipulated that the Empire of Japan (including the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Seas Islands), the Republic of China, the Empire of Manchuria, Thailand, and French Vietnam are designated as specific regions. Anyone wishing to transport or transfer goods to the above-mentioned regions must, within 20 days after the fact, process the yen exchange for the full value of the goods at the designated Hong Kong branches of Yokohama Specie Bank and Bank of Taiwan. However, regarding (1) goods worth less than one hundred yuan, (2) hand luggage or moving luggage, (3) fresh and salted fish, goose meat, vegetables, and fruits, (4) if all or part of the value of the goods is not to be processed for exchange, an application must be submitted to the Governor for approval. (If it is difficult to process the exchange, an application must be submitted for exemption.) It is hoped that exporters will cooperate more to ensure the smooth operation of these regulations."

Mr. Mitsuda Kazuo, the preparatory director of the soap department, is the person in charge of the soap section of the Mitsubishi Trading Company's miscellaneous goods department. He has been involved with soap in Manchuria and Shanghai for about ten years and is an authority on the soap industry. His views are as follows:

Soap is a daily necessity. In terms of its price, type, and timing, it seems to have become a serious problem today. This is primarily due to anxiety about the shortage of raw materials. Although the structure of the general association's lower-level organizations has been changed, it cannot proceed smoothly unless raw materials are also controlled at the same time. The consumption of soap in Central China is about 0000 boxes. Japanese companies account for 80% of the production capacity, while Chinese companies account for 20%, which can be considered quite sufficient. The biggest problem is raw materials. Before the war, tallow was imported from Australia, and coconut oil and coconut kernels were imported from Southeast Asia. Since imports have been cut off, raw materials are naturally quite scarce now. Although Central China also has tallow and crude oil, the attempt to increase tallow production cannot be done quickly because the increase in cattle production is not something that can be done immediately. Moreover, tallow is also used as edible oil, so it seems impossible to use it in large quantities as a soap raw material. Therefore, it is not considered essential in wartime economic policies. Similarly, importing coconut kernels and coconut oil from Southeast Asia through risky means is not being considered for the same reason. As for crude oil, which is extracted from the seeds of crude oil trees, it can be used as a soap raw material because it cannot be used as food. The seeds of crude oil trees are collected from wild crude oil trees in the mountains, and no artificial cultivation is required, so there is no hope of increasing production. The raw materials originally produced in Central China are only enough to supply half of the necessary amount, so the production volume of soap is also only half, and there is no hope of producing more. The only way is to find ways to reduce consumption. Whether soap made from raw materials that can be procured locally can be distributed to various places is a problem. Here, I would like to especially remind everyone that the oils and fats in soap raw materials are edible oils. If a lot of soap is consumed, it is equivalent to consuming a large amount of edible oil. However, the amount of soap consumed by Japanese people in Shanghai is three to five times that of the home country, which is probably mostly due to the environment. As for the problem of hoarding, the soap currently existing in the concessions is enough for one year's use, and most of it is hoarded by Chinese people. Because soap does not spoil within half a year to a year and does not take up much space, it is easy to hoard, thus becoming an object of speculation. The current soap countermeasures include raw material subsidies, eliminating hoarding, and reducing consumption. The purchasing agency for raw materials should be centrally purchased, maintaining close contact with manufacturing agencies and consumption agencies, and saving consumption, making distribution smooth, so that all places can benefit equally. As for the organizational structure, I think that a joint Sino-Japanese organization would be best, but there is an atmosphere of opposition from the Chinese side, because they are afraid of being monopolized by the Japanese side. It is still necessary to explain to them so that they can understand. (Continental News, April 17)

### Misunderstanding "Doing a Favor"

— Wen Zhong

When I see someone in trouble, whether they are relatives, friends, or even a "brother" from anywhere in the world whom I don't know, I always do my best to help them with money or labor. Even using a few "words of advice" to encourage a friend and promote their progress and success is an example of "helping." Mutual assistance is originally a duty that humans should fulfill; asking for help is, of course, a just and honorable right!

In fact, many people misunderstand the true meaning of "doing a favor." For example, a student asks the person sitting next to them for help during an exam, and the person next to them allows them to copy out of "courtesy." Or, a pedestrian is found to have contraband by the police and may whisper, "We are all family, let's talk it over... Please be accommodating and do me a favor..." and secretly hands over banknotes to settle the matter. Examples like these are endless. In short, both parties misunderstand "doing a favor."

Most of the corrupt and dark things in society arise from improper favors. The reason why certain figures can speculate and defraud and still get away with it is also because someone is "helping" behind the scenes, isn't it?

Remember that our "helping" and "being helped" should be just, honorable, and have a sense of justice!

### "Facts" and "Imagination"

— Jie Hui

"Facts" are the living, real things that exist now. For example, the current "rice is like pearls, firewood is like cassia," as well as "rationing by head" for rice and sugar, are all facts. "Imagination" is the formation of a special, false conscious representation based on past memories and experiences. This kind of representation does not necessarily match the "facts." For example, someone who is used to eating bitter things wants to eat some sugar, or a beggar "racks their brains" to imagine becoming an official, riding in a car, and taking a concubine is also a kind of "imagination."

Some people, because the "facts" are too bitter, too poor, and they have nothing to eat, are frowning all day long, clamoring that they cannot survive, wanting to turn things around, wanting to live better, "imagining" their stomachs full, walking without stumbling, "imagining" their clothes no longer tattered, to avoid being looked down upon, but "facts" are still "facts." Now they are still hungry, cold, and being looked down upon. "Imagination" must wait for the "future" to be realized. The concern is that when that time comes, the current "imagination" will still be the "imagination" of that time.

"Imagination" is something that everyone must have, has to have. It is the expression of "desire." The most beautiful and unrealistic castles in the air that are "imagined" easily become "utopias" and "fantasies," and the result will inevitably "run counter" to reality, leading to the most painful and unimaginable "facts."

The rich are good at "imagining," imagining more money and women. The poor are even better at "imagining," seeking happiness and sweetness in "imagination," and trying to "reduce" and "eliminate" the pain of reality in a "sudden enlightenment" manner. As one novel puts it: "... He, Shi Lunka, often dreamed of bread. Once, he dreamed of countless loaves of bread piled up in his thatched hut, the entire courtyard covered with pastries... He ate delicious pastries all night long. In the morning, his wife said gruffly that they would never eat rye bread again. Oh, it's better not to wake up at all, it's better to sleep, it's better to sleep, he thought." This is similar to a certain story: "There was a person who worked hard all day long but still didn't get any benefits. He said, it doesn't matter, I dream of being an emperor every night."

A country woman poured out her bitter half-life to the abbot and asked him for help. After listening, the abbot replied: "Endure it, heaven makes you suffer in life, and you will surely be blessed after death." Impractical "imagination" is only like being "blessed" after death – the "imagination" becomes "fact" in the grave. Isn't the beggar's unreasonable delusion of becoming an official, riding in a car, and taking a concubine like this?

However, "imagination" that is grounded and has a realistic basis, as long as it is coupled with strong perseverance and an indomitable spirit, is not difficult to become a "fact," because his "imagination" also contains the elements of "fact."

Therefore, floating and false "imagination" will deceive you into running into detours and dead ends. See clearly, grasp the objective "facts" of "imagination," and add subjective efforts, and you can create a brand-new life!

### Viewing Bai Jiao's Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition

— Liu Hanruo

The Bai Jiao and his disciples' painting and calligraphy exhibition opened on the 19th at the Da Xin Gallery and will last for a week. On the morning of the opening day, the author took the time to visit, and it was already very crowded with visitors, showing that there are many people who admire the art of Yun Jian.

The exhibition features a total of about 300 pieces, with paintings accounting for one-third and calligraphy being the main exhibits. Bai Jiao has always been deeply engaged in calligraphy, and his writings on calligraphy are already familiar to us. Among the exhibits, couplets are the most numerous, while screen strips and vertical scrolls are fewer. Older works are more numerous than newer works, but they are all masterpieces. The vertical scroll of Zhuge Wuhou's Admonition to His Son combines intention and brushwork, both of which are excellent. Most of the couplets are collections of sentences, mostly works that admonish the world and please the mood and temperament.

Among the paintings, there are mostly orchids, bamboos, and rocks. Several ink orchid paintings have a transcendent and unconstrained layout, seemingly written by the author in the silence of all sounds, and are truly masterpieces. The orchid and ruyi painting in collaboration with Tang Dalang is also a masterpiece that should not be missed. Jin Xueyi, a disciple, presents new brushwork in the red plums, flowers, branches, and stems, which are beautiful, simple, fresh, and delightful.

There are only a dozen fan leaves on display, with many fine works. The page of Returning Home is especially lovely, and there are also many fine works in the album leaves.

The prices of the works are not high. Ink orchids, bamboos, and rocks, and a regular script album leaf, are jointly mounted into a vertical scroll, with a price tag of only 200 yuan, which is probably an old work. Otherwise, based on the current high cost of mounting, the cost would be more than 100 yuan, leaving little profit.

### A Beautiful Personality

— Hui Ren

A lofty position and vast wealth are by no means the most worthy objects for young people to strive for. A beautiful personality is the most worthy of respect.

People who value utilitarianism too much often use the grand banner of career to gloss over their tricks and deceptions, declaring that tricks are necessary means for doing business and that deception is an appropriate expedient for doing business, sparing no effort to destroy their pure personality. They don't think that they can also do business without resorting to tricks and that they can also achieve success without using deception.

Moreover, if they must resort to tricks and use deception to achieve professional goals and win respected reputations, then they would rather give them up to preserve their own personality, because a foundation based on tricks and deception is very unstable, like a mirage in the clouds that will soon collapse and disappear. Wouldn't the defilement of this personality be in vain!

Building a career on a foundation of upright and honest character is solid and firm, like a thousand-year-old tree standing upright in a deep valley, which can last forever. Therefore, everyone must maintain their own upright and honest character, even at the cost of their lives.

Perhaps you can remember that "a beautiful personality is the greatest career in the world."

### Ninth Place in the February Essay Contest: How to Read Books? What Books to Read?

— Zheng Zhiping

There have always been scholars who "buried their heads in hard study under the window for ten years," but the result is "the more they read, the more foolish they become" and "the more they read, the more confused they become." There are also "excellent individuals" who claim to have superior qualifications, pretending to have "read extensively," but once examined, they reveal their fox tails, knowing nothing about anything. This clearly tells us that if we don't know how to read and what to read, even if we spend all our efforts, it will be in vain. How to read books?

(A) Techniques (1) Balanced Activity of Various Organs — Ancient people only emphasized memory when reading books. They memorized classics, histories, and collections, but they were indifferent to the content. What is the use of reading like that? Therefore, when we read books, we should use our brains, eyes, hands, and mouths at the same time. Use the brain for memory, association, and deduction; use the eyes to practice speed reading; use the hands to underline and take notes; use the mouth to recite important sentences. (2) Close Reading and Skimming — There are so many books that they can fill houses to the rafters. Unless one is a fool, one would use the same energy and time to read all books. Therefore, for the most basic and valuable books on a certain aspect or problem, we should read them carefully. As for less important books, we only need to "get a general idea." (3) Criticism and Doubt — It is not enough to just understand when reading books. We should go further and cultivate a spirit of criticism and doubt. (4) Research and Writing — It is easy to suffer from "indigestion" if one does not apply what one has read. Therefore, in addition to reading books, when we encounter problems that we do not understand or are interested in, we should collect relevant materials and conduct a systematic study. If we are interested, we might as well write the results of the research into an article. (5) Collective Learning — Reading books alone often has the disadvantages of being biased, ignoring difficulties, and lacking persistence. To avoid them, organizing or joining a reading group is a good remedy.

(B) Environment We certainly don't have to aspire to a "bright window and clean desk," but if we can pay a little attention, it will always be helpful.

(C) Time Generally, the brain is at its healthiest in the morning; using this time to read more difficult books (such as philosophy) is most effective. It is not advisable to overwork the brain after meals; we can read some literary works. It is best to leave lighter tasks such as taking notes to the evening.

What books to read?

There has always been much debate on this question. The "opening a book is beneficial" school claims that all books are worth reading; the old conservatives argue that only "the books of sages and worthies" that can teach us to "understand reason" should be read, and that all others should be discarded; and friends who read books to death believe that school textbooks are the whole world... Who is right? None of them! For us, knowledge is a weapon used to guide action and reform the world. Therefore, we should read living, useful books. Any book that violates this premise can be kicked aside!

Which ones should we read? (A) From General to Specific: (1) In the early stages of reading, we must accept all basic knowledge and understand the connections between them. It is absolutely impossible to be careless. If we don't do this, we will feel congenitally deficient in whatever we do in the future. (2) When learning each subject, we must proceed step by step. For example, when learning social sciences, we should first read some introductory books, courses, and outlines (of course, we must choose good ones) to understand the general outline.

(B) From Modern to Ancient Old knowledge is also useful in a certain sense. However, this must be after we have laid the foundation of modern knowledge and cultivated the habit of criticism.

(C) From Good to Bad There is no absolute standard for the quality of books. For example, the "bad books" that were banned in past dynasties are no less valuable than the officially designated "holy books" in our opinion. Moreover, the same book may be harmful to A but very useful to B. We only need to adhere to our correct position.

If we can dissolve what has been said above into a scientific reading plan, coupled with a Kant-like regularized life, a Gorky-like spirit of struggle, and a Lu Xun-like tenacity, then success can be expected.

Finally, I must remind you: integrate with practice!

### Resurrected Poor Woman in the Southern City Describes Her Illness

I am living my life for the second time. I had died, but now I am resurrected. Are you surprised, sir? Can a dead person be resurrected? Now I will tell you the whole story:

My husband's name is Gao Weiren, and he is a silversmith in a jewelry store. Because prices are high, his income is not enough to cover expenses, so I often help with living expenses. Also, because I am physically weak, coupled with the sudden cold and heat this spring, I fell ill half a month ago. At that time, we didn't even have money to buy rice, let alone money to see a doctor, so we could only wait for the arrival of the god of death. I fainted once on the Cold Food Festival. At that time, I went to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road, but they refused to admit me. Therefore, I died at seven o'clock on the morning of April 10th. My husband sent me to the funeral home in the southern city because he still had to raise money for the coffin, so he was not by my side. At two o'clock in the afternoon, I suddenly woke up. Although I drank the melted snow in the funeral home, the dangerous period had not yet passed. Later, my husband came, and of course, he was very happy to see me resurrected. He immediately wanted to ask a doctor to diagnose and treat me, but because there was no suitable doctor and no money, Mr. Hu of Shen Bao introduced me to Hongren Hospital on Avenue Haig. They also refused to admit me, so I had to go back. However, they insisted on charging five yuan for registration. I thought it was unreasonable for them not to admit patients but to charge five yuan for registration. On the way home, I passed Xu Fu's traditional Chinese medicine store at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Wenmiao Road. There, I thought that traditional Chinese medicine might be able to treat me, so I asked them to introduce me. As a result, a Ningbo doctor named Shu Shuyun (clinic at No. 3 Anle Lane, Zhonghua Road) acted righteously and treated me. He said that it was a spring febrile disease. He prescribed a prescription and told me that it was not serious and that I would definitely be out of danger after two or three times. He also said not to refrain from taking medicine and seeing a doctor because of lack of money. I told him about the situation I encountered in the hospital the previous two times. He said it didn't matter, come to me in the future, and I won't charge you a penny. This is how I got the opportunity to take medicine. The next day, I felt much better and still asked Dr. Shu to diagnose and treat me. After doing this three times in a row, my condition improved. Now I can eat some porridge and can stand and sit. I think the dangerous period is over. Dr. Shu also told me that the dangerous situation had passed and that I only needed to rest well to enter a good state.

Sir, I have been given the right to live my life again. I have suffered all the hardships of the world. The first thing I need to do to be able to be resurrected this time is to thank Dr. Shu Shuyun, who acted righteously, and I am also grateful for the enthusiastic assistance from all sectors. Respectfully, Gao Ruan, a poor woman, residing at No. 19 Puyu Lane, Huangjia Que Road, Southern City.

Donations from All Sectors After Gao Ruan's resurrection, various sectors have donated funds. Yesterday, we received 200 yuan from Mrs. Song and 100 yuan from Chen Juquan (for maintaining the fetus), which has been collected on their behalf. Someone was sent to the hospital to hand it over to the person. At the same time, we received a letter from Mr. Lu Peihan, stating that Gao Ruan's medical treatment process was slightly different from what was reported. It is claimed that: "After returning home from the funeral home, Gao Ruan was still ill and was sent to various hospitals for treatment, but the hospitals were only interested in profit and refused her treatment. I was saddened when I heard this, but my ability was insufficient. I happened to talk to Miss Zhou Hanying about this matter, and Miss Zhou also wished to help, so I asked Mr. Zhuang Yaosheng to donate 100 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, and Mr. Zhuang asked Mrs. Pan to ask Mr. Xie Jiaqian, a director of Renji Hall, to send a letter to Pingmin Hospital, which was generously accepted by the hospital and provided free diagnosis and treatment."
