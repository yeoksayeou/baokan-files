### Editorial on Materials Mobilization

Materials mobilization is an important part of total war participation, the significance of which and the principles of mobilization have been discussed yesterday. However, in order to achieve the greatest efficiency in mobilization, it is still necessary to pay attention to the fundamental ways. Because the materials stored by the country and the people are ultimately limited; and the consumption of military and civilian needs during wartime will increase day by day, inevitably leading to a situation of supply falling short of demand. Some people think that our country's distribution is uneven, circulation is uncoordinated, and consumption is not subject to appropriate restrictions, then the exhaustion of resources will be a matter of time. Moreover, in fact, in the six years since the incident, our country's materials have been in a state of being stretched. Now, please briefly describe the positive and negative countermeasures as follows:

On the positive side, it can be divided into two points: First, we must seek to increase materials, and first rely on the promotion of production. In addition to government agencies seeking production on their own, we must also encourage private production. Whether it is agriculture, industry, or mining, all that can be produced by the private sector should be vigorously encouraged and supported, and provided with convenience in terms of politics, finance, transportation, and sales. To be more specific. (1) For existing factories, workshops, and farms, we must urge them to make full use of their production capacity; if there are factories hoarding raw materials and not producing, or some landlords occupying fertile land and letting it lie barren, these phenomena must be quickly and reasonably guided to restore production. (2) Expand the industrial rationalization movement, that is, the rationalization of various industrial departments, regions, operating items, raw material acquisition, industrial management, product distribution, and mutual cooperation, etc. (3) Promote rural handicrafts and use rural idle labor to increase material production. (4) In order to encourage people to produce, the government should, when necessary, provide low-interest funds, provide equipment on behalf of the people, provide raw material guarantees, facilitate transportation, and introduce excellent technicians, and send personnel to guide them on a tour. However, the people's capital is limited, or they are unwilling to take risks, so for some industrial sectors, the government must operate them, but in view of the past failures of state-owned enterprises, in principle, "government supervision and private operation" should still be the main focus. Second, the circulation of existing materials and increased production materials is also an important issue: Within the peace zone, we must seek to balance surplus and deficiency, so unnecessary inspections should be eliminated, and taxes that only increase production obstacles should also be reduced.

On the negative side: The first is the issue of material distribution. The urgency of shipment and the amount of freight should be determined according to the needs of various regions and the importance of materials. Traffic tools should be used under the overall plan to rationalize material distribution. Secondly, our country's economic organization is scattered, especially among middlemen. Except for a few large cities, the amount of materials in stock and sales, wholesale prices and retail prices cannot be statistically analyzed. Therefore, the work of price stabilization is not easy to start. In order to adapt to this situation, it seems that certain daily necessities should be sold exclusively by the government or by merchants specially licensed by the government, so that the output, inventory and consumption of materials can be clearly understood. However, if the monopoly is implemented, there must be a private supervisory mechanism to avoid private fraud. In addition, the most worthwhile thing to promote is the cooperative movement, which can reduce the profits of middlemen and avoid price increases, and can eliminate the hoarding and manipulation of middlemen; it is not only beneficial to consumers, but also helps the material control agencies. The second is the issue of material consumption. The use of military supplies with very low inventory or output should be prohibited for the general public, and the quantity and use of materials that are not sufficient in output and have the possibility of shortage should be restricted for the people. For example, food should not be used for brewing alcohol. For improper or non-essential items, such as planting opium on land and the rotting of grain stored in warehouses, clear penalties should be stipulated. As for the conservation movement of public and private materials, efforts should be made to promote it.

Finally, all legislation and administration related to material circulation must first have a comprehensive and thorough investigation and statistics, and after sufficient research, can the results be perfect. And the simplification of wartime laws and regulations is a principle that cannot be ignored. Secondly, the material mobilization agencies must unify their powers and avoid mutual restraint; and the effectiveness of the implementation of government orders should be assessed in a timely manner, and rewards and punishments should be clearly defined. Materials mobilization is a major item of "total war participation," and we sincerely hope that government authorities and relevant parties will pay attention to it.

### Achievements of the Japanese Diet This Session

This session of the Japanese Diet passed a budget案 with a total expenditure of 47.4 billion yen, a new record in Japanese fiscal history (including 27 billion yen for temporary military expenditures), and also established 89 important bills such as the Wartime Special Exceptions Act. These many bills are necessary to adapt to the current decisive battle stage and reform and replace the necessary domestic system, which are not only epoch-making measures during wartime, but also important cases that should be resolutely implemented one by one in peacetime.

The most timely harvest of this session of the Diet was the elucidation of the road to victory in politics. At the beginning of the Diet, Prime Minister Tojo's policy speech on strengthening the government's guiding spirit of combat power, hoping that 100 million people would concentrate all their strength and fully utilize it, completely eliminated all complex intentions and concerns about the domestic system and united under a unified organization. At the same time, the government's clarified independence policy for Burma and the Philippines, as well as the epoch-making transformation of its China policy, are the basic national policies of the Japanese government, which were announced to the world by this session of the Diet.

In view of the achievements of the Diet, we keenly feel that the authorities and the people should encourage each other, be self-disciplined and self-motivated. The achievements of the Diet have established the moral politics and moral diplomacy internally and externally. In the pursuit of war, moral politics and moral diplomacy are often misunderstood as a retreat or even a weakening. However, when the Prime Minister implements wartime administration, he does not launch power, but completely trusts the people's self-consciousness and loyalty. Because the Prime Minister is convinced that the people's self-consciousness and loyalty are better than using power to promote them, and are the foundation for enhancing combat power. The true realization of the achievements of the Diet depends on the guidance of the authorities and the practice of the people. As for the diplomacy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the expansion of the spirit of morality and fairness and clarity is only half done, and the remaining half depends on the complete destruction of the United States, Britain, and the Chiang regime. In addition, the bills passed this time should be given special attention, such as the Wartime Administrative Special Bill, the Metropolitan System Bill, the Municipal and Village System Amendment Bill, and the Wartime Criminal Special Law Amendment Bill, etc. Their true value does not lie in the fact that they are established and completed, but in how they will be used in the future? In short, although this Diet has completed its mission, in order to make its achievements the foundation of the decisive battle system, the authorities should take the lead in demonstrating and leading in the future, and the people should follow and practice in the rear, and move forward.

### German Headquarters Announces Reoccupation of Belgrade; Soviet Troops Annihilated Southeast of Kharkov; Fierce Fighting Continues in Chuguev

German Headquarters, 19th, Havas News Agency: The German military communique this afternoon stated that our troops unexpectedly recaptured Belgrade, which is north of Kharkov and also a key railway junction. German troops northwest of Kursk are also advancing. The remaining Soviet troops surrounded southeast of Kharkov were annihilated yesterday. The "Greater Germany Infantry Division" repelled the attacking Soviet troops at Borisovka and advanced eastward again, destroying 47 Soviet tanks. South of Orel, the Soviet attacks on Vyazma and Staraya Russa were unsuccessful, and the enemy suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources. Within the Vyazma area, the Soviet army lost 93 tanks. German troops assisted the German army in batches in combat.

Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency: The targets of the German counteroffensive on the southern route of the Eastern Front are known only to the German High Command. The claim by the Soviet High Command, British, and American visitors that the German army will advance to the Donets Front and then plan to break through the Donets River is purely speculation. The enemy has recently been publicizing the German army's plans for a large-scale offensive, the purpose of which is to confuse the public and cover up their defeat. Since the Soviet army's flanking actions on the Donets and Dnieper rivers have completely failed and the German army has reoccupied Kharkov, there are now no traces of the enemy on the Donets Front. A large number of troops southeast of Kharkov have been surrounded and annihilated by our army. Now the battle for Chuguev is underway. Further north, the vanguard of the German army has reached the upper reaches of the Donets River.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 19th, Havas News Agency: Fierce fighting continued in the central sector of the Eastern Front yesterday. In the Donets River basin, the German army, assisted by fresh troops, is launching fierce attacks in the vicinity of Izyum and Chuguev, which may expand into a pincer offensive against the city of Kupyansk. The Red Army is resisting strongly and counterattacking continuously. According to announcements by Moscow Radio, there has been "significant improvement" in the Red Army's positions in the Donets River basin. Further north, there is still fierce fighting on the Kharkov-Belgorod railway. The Red Army has received cavalry reinforcements. The battle launched near Seversk is now expanding. The German army's goal is to clear the 80-mile Red Army salient west of Kursk. The final goal is the city of Kursk. The two armies are deadlocked in a decisive battle. On the Orel front, the Red Army is constantly launching fierce attacks. South of Vyazma, the German army is still adjusting its lines to avoid contact with the Red Army. According to Soviet sources, the Red Army's target is the city of Kirov, a railway hub on the Vyazma-Smolensk line.

### Japanese Cultural Delegation to Visit China at the End of the Month; To Attend Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Conference; To Present "Great Unity Song" to Chairman Wang

Tokyo, 19th, Domei News Agency: It was learned today that the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association has scheduled a three-day national congress in Nanjing in April to celebrate the return of the capital by the National Government. Ten Japanese representatives will participate. These ten people are dispatched by the Japan International Cultural Relations Association and represent the cultural, scientific, and educational activities of Japan during the war. The association has also invited Ryozo Hiranuma, a veteran of the Japanese sports world and a member of the House of Peers, and the famous military writer Hino to attend the meeting. It is reported that the Japanese ambassador to Nanjing, Shigemitsu, is quite concerned about this plan and has asked the Greater East Asia Ministry to help him succeed. The delegation is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing at the end of March to attend the cultural conference and will also participate in round-table conferences and lectures in Nanjing and neighboring cities to promote cultural relations between China and Japan.

Tokyo, 19th, Central News Agency: Dr. Atsushi Shioya (Professor Emeritus of Tokyo Imperial University), head of the Japanese cultural delegation to China, and his party will depart for Nanjing on the evening of the 22nd. Dr. Shioya is carrying a treasured copy of the "Great Unity Song" to present to Chairman Wang and Foreign Minister Chu Minyi and the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association. The book is the posthumous work of Dr. Shioya's great-grandfather, On Yain Shioya, and was carefully written by Dr. Shioya's father (former professor of the First Higher School), Tokitoshi Shioya, so it is extremely valuable. The so-called "Great Unity Song" means "Emperor's Song." The entire text is in classical Chinese, with four characters per line, and records the events of the successive emperors of Japan, starting from Emperor Jinmu and ending with Emperor Komei, detailing the names of the emperors and the great meaning of loyalty and filial piety, and expounding the origins of the Japanese national polity. It can be called an immortal masterpiece. During the late Tokugawa shogunate, it was popular in rural schools, and every household recited it. After the Meiji era, Sinology gradually declined, and it was gradually forgotten, only treasured in the Shioya family's library. According to Dr. Shioya, "I am convinced that it is most appropriate to introduce the Japanese national polity with this book. My great-grandfather, On Yain, carefully wrote this book up to the generation of Emperor Komei and passed away in the third year of Keio. Therefore, the generation of Emperor Meiji was respectfully supplemented by my father, Aoyama (Tokitoshi Shioya's other name)."

Tokyo, 19th, Central News Agency: Tetsutaro Kawakami, a member of the Japanese cultural delegation to China participating in the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital and a representative of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, recently discussed the purpose of his visit to China before departing the country, saying, "Our party will soon participate in the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital as Japanese cultural envoys and attend the congress of representatives from various regions of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association. I still remember that when the first Greater East Asia Writers' Conference was held, Chinese and Japanese cultural figures had intimate talks and exchanged various opinions on the issue of Greater East Asia culture. Many proposals were made at that time, and it is necessary to realize them. I hope that the exchange of writers' works and the establishment of a joint Sino-Japanese literary research institution can be realized as soon as possible. I have heard that China is planning to establish a literary institution like our country's Literary Patriotic Association. I believe this matter will be realized soon. After arriving in China, I plan to have more contact with Chinese cultural figures, have frank discussions, exchange opinions, provide spiritual assistance, and form good friends in the Greater East Asia literary world. Today's Sino-Japanese cooperation is a rare phenomenon since the Russo-Japanese War. Therefore, the cultures of China and Japan should trust each other and strive to build a Greater East Asia culture. Therefore, I plan to take this opportunity to visit China to promote the awareness of cultural figures in Chongqing and to enable them to participate in the Second Greater East Asia Writers' Conference to exchange views on the issue of Greater East Asia culture."

### Takashima Discusses Sino-Japanese Relations: Mutual Reliance Is Essential

Tokyo, 19th, Domei News Agency: The newly appointed President of the Central China Development Company, Kikujiro Takashima, recently stated that Sino-Japanese relations should be based on mutual trust and harmony, not just a military alliance. As practical developments have shown, the close relationship between China and Japan is like that of a married couple. Both are now doing their best to win this historic war. He is determined to move his entire family to Shanghai on this trip and devote himself to completing his mission, and hopes to be buried on the mainland in the end. Takashima also said that from now on, Sino-Japanese relations should be based on mutual trust, not just a military alliance. It is reported that Mr. Takashima has served in the Japanese industrial world for more than 50 years and is an expert on Chinese issues. He is also friendly with important figures such as Chairman Wang.

### Conflicts Between Chongqing and the Communists Worsen

Guangzhou, 19th, Central News Agency: According to reports, Chongqing is currently actively carrying out the so-called "Centralization" work to speed up the development of the Northwest. However, due to frequent frictions and conflicts between Chongqing and the Communists, its attempt to develop the Northwest has been greatly hampered. Because the Chongqing Party and the Communist Party are vying for power in the Northwest, disputes often arise. Recently, the disputes between the two sides have intensified due to the issue of developing the Northwest, which has a great impact on the war situation. In order to ease the conflict between the two sides, Chongqing Chiang sent Feng Yuxiang to meet with Mao Zedong and Zhu De, intending to mediate. However, because the Communist Party hates the Chongqing Party to the bone, its attitude is also extremely tough, so Feng Yuxiang's trip yielded no results. After returning to Chongqing on the 10th, he reported the process and the Communist Party's opinions to Chongqing Chiang.

### Japanese Air Force Raids Chongqing's Sixth War Zone Military Strongholds; Prestige of US Air Force Stationed in Chongqing Gradually Lost

Hankou, 19th, Central News Agency: On the 16th and 17th, the Japanese Air Force thoroughly bombed Wanxian and Laohukou, the key point of the 5th War Zone of the Chongqing Army. On the 18th, it dispatched again to attack the military resistance strongholds of the 6th War Zone of the Chongqing Army, such as Gong'an, Shashi, the area around Zhangtiansi south of Huarong, Jiangbodu, and the west side of Ouchikou, destroying the Chongqing Army's attempt to resist. At the beginning of this month, the Japanese Air Force realized that the 6th War Zone of the Chongqing Army continued to stir. On the 18th, it launched a large-scale air raid on various areas of the Chongqing Army and machine-gunned the Chongqing Army in various places such as the area around Huarong, the west side of Ouchikou, and Jiangbodu, defeating about 500 Chongqing troops west of Ouchikou and about 100 Chongqing troops at Jiangbodu. It destroyed the Chongqing Army's positions around Huarong and achieved great results. Another team continuously attacked important strongholds such as Zhangjiachang, Wudahe, Zhangtiansi, and Tuokou, 50 kilometers south of Shashi, from a certain aspect, dropped many bombs, destroyed the Chongqing Army's military facilities, and safely returned to base.

Guangzhou, 18th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Air Force has recently intensified its activities, not only inflicting heavy blows on Chongqing, but also causing the prestige of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing to suffer significant damage. According to information received here indirectly, the commander of the 14th Air Force of Chongqing, Major General Chennault, boasted on March 15 that "Let us wipe out the traces of the Japanese Air Force in the Chinese sky." This was the grand statement he made at a banquet in front of the leaders of Chongqing when he took office. At that time, all the leaders were moved by his courageous words, but in the past few days, Japanese aircraft have bombed Wanxian in Sichuan and Guilin in Guangxi, as well as other forward bases of the US Air Force, every day, dropping countless fierce bombs. According to later reports, the military authorities of Chongqing are now severely criticizing the US commander's attitude, exaggerating and not living up to his words, and pointing out that when Japanese aircraft recently attacked, no US aircraft dared to rise up to fight the Japanese aircraft.

Jinan, 19th, Central News Agency: The Shandong Provincial County Garrison Force often cooperates with the Japanese army to launch annihilation battles in various places to wipe out the remaining bandit troops of Chongqing and the Communists.

### British Attack on Northern Section of Mareth Line Repelled; German Troops Penetrate Deep into British Positions in the North

Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency: The British Eighth Army attacked the coastal area along the Mareth Line twice on Tuesday evening and Wednesday, and were repelled both times. The enemy suffered heavy losses. The enemy had two purposes for this attack: (1) to clear the minefields of the German and Italian forward positions; (2) if successful, the enemy could penetrate deep into our positions as a preliminary step to launching a general offensive on the entire line. However, this objective was not only not achieved, but also suffered a strong counterattack by the German army, resulting in the loss of the positions previously occupied by the enemy. General Montgomery had to withdraw his general offensive order. The British army is now concentrated in the Calonlai area to prevent the flanking attack of the Axis forces. The terrain in this area is difficult and desert-like, and is not suitable for large-scale battles by the enemy. On the contrary, this type of terrain is very conducive to the mobile defense tactics of the Axis forces.

Lisbon, 18th, Domei News Agency: There were no major battles in Tunisia on Wednesday. In the past twelve hours, it had been windy and rainy, and the ground was muddy, which greatly hindered the actions of the Allied forces and the Axis forces in North Africa. However, the elite troops of the British Eighth Army attacked the coastal defense zone of the Mareth Line from Tuesday night to the next morning and on Wednesday, and were heavily damaged and retreated. It is reported that the attacking British troops were infantry units, with no tanks to assist them. However, heavy artillery was used to bombard them before the attack. After the British army slightly invaded the Mareth Line, the German army launched a counterattack. The British army suffered heavy casualties and could not maintain the occupied territory. The entire offensive was terminated. However, the British army's cessation of the attack is probably only temporary in nature. The British artillery is still bombarding the German positions.

Central Tunisia: Change of US Commander

Tangier, 19th, Havas News Agency: News from Algiers, Allied Commander-in-Chief Eisenhower has now appointed Lieutenant General Patton as the US Commander in Central Tunisia. Lieutenant General Patton is known for commanding tank operations. When the Allied forces landed in French North Africa in November last year, it was Patton who commanded them. Later, he was appointed as the US tank commander in North Africa.

Bern, Switzerland, 18th, Havas News Agency: On the central front of Tunisia, according to the war report of the Allied Headquarters in North Africa, the US troops advanced from Feirianna to Gafsa yesterday afternoon and did not encounter any resistance. They crossed six miles beyond Gafsa and occupied the city of Lora in the southeast corner of the Galorechi Mountain. They are now carefully observing El Guettar, which is twelve miles from Gafsa. The German army has probably established a position there. When the German army abandoned Gafsa, it was filled with mines and traps, and the US engineers were very busy clearing them. According to German sources, fresh American troops are being concentrated west of Osertia and Bison.

Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency: Responsible sources in military circles here declared that the German army launched an offensive towards Abariit in the coastal area of northern Tunisia yesterday, penetrating deep into the British positions. The British army urgently dispatched reinforcements to the front line, and the trucks they were traveling in were continuously attacked by German aircraft. In addition to defeating most of the British and American troops, the German army also captured a large number of prisoners of war and spoils.

### Bhamo's Party Arrives in Tokyo; Paid Respects at the Imperial Palace Yesterday Morning; Myanmar Actively Reviving in Various Regions

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) After arriving here on the 18th, Myanmar's Administrative Governor Bhamo and his party, at 10 AM on the 19th, proceeded from the Prime Minister's annex to the Imperial Palace to pay their respects. After departing from the palace, they returned to the annex to rest.

Yangon, 19th (Central News Agency) The news of Governor Bhamo's party's arrival in Tokyo on the evening of the 18th coincided with the first day of the Shwedagon Pagoda Festival, the largest festival in Myanmar. The breaking news spread throughout Myanmar, and the people were exceptionally jubilant. Governor Bhamo, Interior Minister Dakhin Mya, Finance Minister Dai Yinmo, and Myanmar Defense Army Commander Major General Aung San, the four leaders of the new Myanmar, departed from an airfield on the morning of the 10th at the invitation of Japan. Few knew of this, so the sudden announcement from Tokyo of Governor Bhamo's party's arrival in Japan filled the people of Myanmar with joy and gratitude amidst solemnity.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Myanmar, with the help of the Japanese army, was liberated from the shackles of Britain and the United States. Now, the new Myanmar has become a wing of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, with a future full of limitless hope. As Governor Bhamo of Myanmar visits Japan, here is a brief account of the revival of Myanmar as an introduction. Myanmar is currently at the forefront of the Greater East Asia War and is also the western gateway to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It borders Thailand and Vietnam to the east, Yunnan to the north, and India across the Arakan Mountains to the west. Therefore, Myanmar is no less than the heart of the Southern Sphere. After the Japanese army captured Singapore, Yangon became a stronghold for Britain, the United States, and Chongqing. When Dr. Bhamo heard in Moghdat prison on March 8th last year that the Japanese army had captured Yangon, he was overjoyed, believing that the liberation of Myanmar would be completed. After the military administration personnel arrived in Yangon on the 25th of that month, they immediately began security work in southern Myanmar. Subsequently, on June 8th, after the Japanese army pacified all of Myanmar, Lieutenant General Iida, the highest commander of the Japanese army in Myanmar, announced the commencement of military administration and appointed Dr. Bhamo and others as preparatory committee members of the central administrative organ. When the British-Indian army retreated, they set fires and plundered various places in central and northern Myanmar, turning major cities such as Mandalay into ruins. However, through the efforts of the Japanese army and the people of Myanmar, Mandalay was the first to be revived. Now, major markets and shops have all been restored, and railway stations and Irrawaddy River docks have also been rebuilt, with prosperity unchanged from the past. The central part of the city, Taunggyi, was spared from the ravages of war. After transportation was restored, various places near the area transported large quantities of vegetables and other goods to various places in southern Myanmar. Prom, a key location on the banks of the Irrawaddy River, and towns downstream such as Pyay, have also been restored as rice distribution centers. When the Japanese army occupied Yangon, Mawlamyine and other places had already been revived, and residents gradually returned. The city's situation is no different from the past. Various cities such as Lashio, Taungoo, Myitkyina, and other provinces are also actively reviving.

### Muslims Enthusiastically Celebrate the Prophet Muhammad's Birthday

Jakarta, 19th (Central News Agency) Today is the birthday of Muhammad, the founder of Islam. Javanese Muslims are fasting, abstaining from food, or going to mosques to pray, or going to the suburbs to pray remotely to Mecca. They are all enthusiastically rejoicing. However, the significance of this year's celebration is completely different from the purely religious rituals of the past. Various ceremonies are filled with wartime colors, demonstrating the vigorous spirit of striving to complete the Greater East Asia War and build the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. When the Japanese army swept across Java in February last year, they were liberated from their shackles, so they welcomed the Japanese army with food and drink and did their best to cooperate in post-war reconstruction. The Japanese army also extremely respected their Islamic faith. Even in the midst of the war, they cooperated in protecting mosques everywhere. This made them exceptionally grateful. On March 7th last year, the Japanese army issued Proclamation No. 2, clarifying the Japanese army's determination to respect the religious beliefs of the residents and decided to actively assist in the healthy development of Muslims. They believed that cooperation with the Japanese army must begin with self-discipline among Muslims. On Fridays, believers gather in mosques and pray fervently, with absolute trust in the Japanese army. After the Greater East Asia War entered its second year, in addition to enthusiastically cooperating in the construction of Java, Muslims also paid close attention to the Islamic dynamics in various parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. When they received the news of the death of General Hayashi Senjūrō, the former chairman of the Japan Islamic Association, Javanese Muslims were deeply saddened and sent a telegram of condolence from the headquarters of the Indonesian Islamic Supreme Council to General Hayashi's family. On the anniversary of the Japanese army's landing on the first of this month, a grand convention of Islamic representatives from the entire island was convened in Jakarta to hold a grand victory prayer. After hearing that Japanese Minister for East Asia Aoki and various foreign ministers clarified Japan's fundamental policy towards Muslims in the south in parliament last month, they immediately sent a telegram to express their gratitude. In short, Javanese Muslims are now echoing Muslims in various parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, exerting their full strength to complete the great mission of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Makassar, 19th (Central News Agency) Three thousand Muslims in and around this area held a solemn ceremony here on the 19th to celebrate the Prophet's birthday. Amin and Akya, professors of Islam, delivered speeches expressing their gratitude for the Japanese army's kindness in protecting Muslims and emphasized that Muslims should fully发挥their inherent spirit and actively assist Japan. The participating Muslims were deeply moved.

### Women in London Painting Legs Will Temporarily Disappear This Summer

Bern, Switzerland, 18th (Havas) In recent years, British and American women have been exposing their legs in the summer and adding colored drawings to their legs as leg decorations. However, according to a London dispatch, British women will not be able to paint their legs this summer. Last summer, due to the difficulty of buying stockings, many women painted their legs. A certain company sold 864,000 packages of leg painting powder in three weeks. This year, in order to save resources, the Ministry of Commerce has refused to allocate leg painting raw materials to manufacturers, so women "painting legs" will temporarily disappear this summer.

### Comprehensive Review of This Session of the Japanese Parliament; The Guiding Power of the Cabinet is Increasingly Strengthened

About four weeks have passed since the reopening of the 81st Japanese Parliament. Amid internal and external scrutiny, various parliamentary matters are being conducted: the House of Representatives completed all bills on the 8th, and the House of Peers also completed all remaining bills on the 10th, and adjourned on the 11th. This parliament coincides with the year of the decisive battle, so its significance is rarely seen in previous parliaments, and its achievements are also rare in previous parliaments. Judging only from the established budgets and bills, the total expenditure of the next year's budgets is 47.4 billion yen, including 27 billion yen for temporary military expenses, which is an unprecedented decisive battle budget in Japanese financial history. In addition, as many as 89 laws under the wartime special exceptions bill are landmark measures related to enhancing combat power in the midst of changing the domestic system. Therefore, at a time when world war is in full swing, the direction of decisive battle politics based on the Japanese spirit has been clarified due to the establishment of these bills, which is the greatest gain of this parliament.

Prime Minister's Clear Explanation

Since the Manchurian Incident, successive cabinets have tried to rebuild Japan's politics in the direction of carrying out the war. Such as the unity of command and state affairs, the strengthening of the Prime Minister's administrative powers, the unification of central and local administrative institutions, as well as reorganizing parliamentary forces into a supportive form, strengthening economic control, and planning domestic unity, all these attempts, although also driven by the world trend in turbulent times, are undoubtedly what the recent Japanese cabinet has been committed to. At the same time, it is also the goal of the various bills submitted in this parliament. What kind of basis is this shift to war politics really based on? Is there a risk of leaning towards dictatorial politics? Are there drastic changes in administrative institutions and corresponding enterprise forms? Such questions and concerns were raised by members of parliament. In response, Prime Minister Tojo clearly explained the government's beliefs. At the beginning of the reopening of this parliament, Prime Minister Tojo stated the government's basic attitude towards decisive battle politics in his policy speech: "Regarding the enhancement of combat power, the government's guiding spirit is to expect the vigorous power of 100 million compatriots to be fully utilized." And in the budget general meeting of both houses and the wartime administrative special exceptions bill committee, he strongly stated the following points:

(1) The government's attitude in implementing wartime administration is not to launch power, but to thoroughly trust the people's awareness and loyalty.

(2) The strengthening of the Prime Minister's powers is not dictatorship. According to the Japanese national polity, there is no room for considering other countries' dictatorships.

(3) Drastic reforms of the cabinet system and administrative institutions are detrimental to enhancing combat power and will not be adopted.

(4) When strengthening economic control, such as national management of important industries, reform of economic forms, etc., will not be implemented, and the creativity of the people will be utilized as much as possible.

(5) Promote the spirit of rewarding merits and punishing demerits in official circles.

Under the severe war situation of this continuous war, single-mindedly promoting Japanese politics suitable for the national polity, thereby firmly uniting the whole country to cope with this next war period, the great road of this winning politics can be said to have been revealed in principle.

However, this decisive war political Japanese character is by no means weakening the government's war-fighting posture, is by no means allowing arbitrary actions by a part of the political forces, and is by no means causing a temporary retreat in the progress of economic control. The following four points make this clear. Namely, (1) Prime Minister Tojo strongly stated in the House of Representatives the completeness of the political and military posture, and expressed his determination to concurrently serve as Army Minister, (2) Stir up the discussion of the wartime administrative special exceptions law, and reveal the outline of strengthening the Prime Minister's powers and the administrative unification of super-priority industries, (3) In the House of Peers, it was stated that malicious rumors that disrupt domestic unity will never be borrowed and will be cracked down on. (4) Minister of Commerce Kishi further made the following assertion: "In the future, in order to increase production, strengthening control and making production more planned is absolutely necessary."

The True Meaning of Decisive Battle Diplomacy

At a time when Japan's domestic and foreign affairs are being unified with the Greater East Asia as the axis, Japan's promotion of war politics is not only limited to the domestic political sphere, but also in the administration of occupied territories and in the diplomacy of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and is progressing with groundbreaking policies based on the spirit of national founding. This policy has been specifically clarified through parliament. Prime Minister Tojo's major statement on the independence of Myanmar and the Philippines in his policy speech has given great impact to the regions and ethnic groups under occupation. Furthermore, the Japanese government's morally based statements to the countries within the Co-Prosperity Sphere are guaranteed by the policies currently being implemented, enough to make them understand Japan's determination and true intentions.

Especially regarding the policy towards China, with the Guomindang government's participation in the war as an opportunity, Japan's policy has undergone a groundbreaking transformation, such as the complete abolition of extraterritoriality, the return of concessions, and the ongoing political, economic, and other strong support. The government's statement in parliament has attracted great attention. As for Minister Aoki's policies on currency and exchange rates, and Director-General Sato of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau detailed explanations on Japan's measures after the policy transformation and its profound impact in Chongqing and other enemy countries. In short, thoroughly respecting China's autonomy and independence, supporting the National Government to strengthen its political power, so that Japan and China become one, and marching towards the path of completing the Greater East Asia War, Japan's fair attitude has been proven in fact and clarified at home and abroad.

On the contrary, "the only rebel in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Wang Jingwei regime, can only be resolutely annihilated," this is the response of Minister Aoki and Director-General Sato in parliament, and it must not be forgotten. Also, the Prime Minister's statement: "For the countries within the Co-Prosperity Sphere who are willing to cooperate with us, we will always support them with parental affection and sincerity, but for those who do not understand our true intentions and are willing to be messengers of Britain and the United States, we will take resolute measures," can be said to reveal the true meaning of decisive battle diplomacy, and it can be expected that it will consistently advance the politics of Greater East Asia in a grand manner based on Japan's principles, both internally and externally.

The Organizational Law of Political Promotion

Most of the important laws passed and established by this parliament can be said to be organizational laws that strongly promote this kind of politics, so those who are in official positions should恪遵the original intention of the legislation and respect the government's statements in parliament in order to reflect and be vigilant and apply them appropriately. Only in this way will the people's loyalty be further ignited, and the new politics of decisive battle breakthrough will be more firmly established.

This parliament is the second regular parliament under the Greater East Asia War. The previous 79th regular parliament was held amid the brilliant victories of the initial battles. The people's attention was focused on the progress of the war, and the bills submitted by the government were limited to the urgent measures of the present, with little room for discussion; however, this time it was held in the second year of the war, in the decisive battle period, when all enemy strongholds in Greater East Asia belonged to Japan, and the stage was set to build a long-term winning domestic posture. The number of government proposals was far more than before, and their content was centered on enhancing the combat power of the people in the rear, involving many points. The government officials who are at the forefront of the application of these laws, how they are expected, from the position of smooth public opinion, it is natural that the discussion will be boiling, which can be said to have been expected at the beginning.

Activities Surrounding the Yokusan Political Association

It should not be forgotten that this parliament is the regular parliament held since last spring's general election and the so-called "gathering of domestic political forces". The Yokusan Political Association, the only political association, was established recently, and only in terms of the great unity of the whole country, the control has not been meticulous and the cohesion is not strong. Although there is no disagreement in its basic direction of cooperating with the government and trying to carry out the war, its various activities on individual issues have surfaced before the parliament. Moreover, the political mechanism called the government, the Yokusan Political Association, and the Yokusan Support Association as a trinity, what kind of relationship do they have with each other? How will they act in the future? The future political activities of the Yokusan Political Association are a major issue, so it is only through this parliament that its trend can be clarified, and this expectation can be said to be natural.

The various activities within the Yokusan Political Association that were revealed in front of the parliament correspond to the above-mentioned characteristics of this parliament. Namely, (1) comprehensively dealing with the urgent issue of enhancing combat power under the decisive battle, thereby endowing the stagnant Yokusan Political Association with a firm direction for political activities in order to鞭挞the government, which is the activity of the Seishin Club, the 30th Day Club, the Economic Assembly of Parliamentarians, etc. (2) Reforming the internal structure of the Yokusan Political Association, clarifying the location of its responsibilities, and establishing a domestic political mechanism integrating the Yokusan Political Association and the Yokusan Support Association, which is the hope of the young and middle-aged factions. (3) Should review whether the various bills submitted by the government are urgent bills directly related to enhancing combat power, which is the strong argument of some members of parliament. These are all regarded as激昂意见的.

The 81st Parliament reopened in this situation, so the revision theory raised its head for the problematic bills, such as the revised law in the wartime criminal special law, the revised law in the capital system, the city system, the revised law in the towns and villages, the Japan Securities Exchange Law, the Agricultural Group Law, the Fisheries Group Law, etc., were all brought to its俎上. This is more like a phenomenon of repeated political coordination due to the lack of consensus within the Yokusan Political Association than pursuing the government's statement: it is more about dealing with the problems within the Yokusan Political Association than the problems with the government. Therefore, the cooperative posture between the government and the parliament has not been fundamentally affected in any way, while the Yokusan Political Association has left problems for the future and can be regarded as promoting the desire to establish a strong internal mechanism.

The Government's Frank Attitude

Towards the above-mentioned parliamentary　勢, the government, from the beginning, adopted a fair and frank attitude to explain its policies, and conversely, towards retreating arguments, it consistently adopted a resolute attitude. In the pre-examination of the bills, the government also submitted the bills that became the focus of discussion in accordance with the established policy without hesitation, and Prime Minister Tojo, supporting his sick body, entered the hospital and declared to the world his determination to win the war with the groundbreaking policy speech at the reopening of the parliament, which began with "This year is the autumn of the decisive battle". The Prime Minister also expressed his belief in domestic unity at the main meeting of the nobles on February 1, and expressed his determination to concurrently serve as Minister of the Army at the budget general meeting on the 2nd, sweeping away the arguments. Regarding important political issues, the Prime Minister also repeatedly took the field and spoke in the committee with an attitude full of confidence.

Confirming the Government's Superiority

Although the parliamentary situation is extremely diverse, as mentioned above, its sincere discussions and positive cooperation with the government have broken away from the old pattern of the parliament seeming to be opposed to the government and embarked on the first step of rebuilding the Japanese parliament. On the other hand, the superior position of the government executing war politics has also been gradually confirmed on the floor. Moreover, among the laws passed and established by this parliament, the wartime administrative special exceptions law strengthens the powers of the Prime Minister and unifies production administration; the local system improvement law centralizes administrative powers and increases the superiority of the executive organs over the decision-making organs. In addition, the various laws concerning the economy aim at strengthening control and administrative speed. From this point of view, the strengthening of the cabinet's leadership can finally be realized through the implementation of these laws. Therefore, in decisive battle politics, the relationship between the government and the parliament will clarify each other's positions through this parliament, it is not an overstatement.

In this parliament, the discussion of the Yokusan Political Association problem never went beyond the past criticisms of elections, etc., which is a bit of a low tone. However, this was stopped by the difficulties of some members of parliament after all. Moreover, the arguments that completely deny the Yokusan Political Association and various national organizations related to national movements have disappeared, which can be said to be the parliament's progress on national organizations.

### Various Factories Hasten Production and Pressing; Oil Rationing by Population to Be Implemented; If Preparations Are Insufficient, Sales Will Continue Once According to the Old Method

Following approval from the military administration for oil rationing by population through the Wholesale Bureau of Edible Oil, the issuance of edible oil permits has been entrusted to the Food Management Bureau of the Public Works Department of the Zhou Family Cemetery Administration. All edible oil retailers, such as soy sauce manufacturers, distilleries, oil shops, and sauce-wine shops, have completed re-registration, been assigned registration numbers, and designated as edible oil retailers. Agreements have also been reached with various oil pressing factories. All oil pressed by these factories will be purchased by the military administration for allocation to the Edible Oil Wholesale Bureau, providing oil for rationing by population and for the business needs of various industries. The authorities will find ways to supply raw materials to the oil pressing factories, such as soybeans, rapeseed, peanuts, and cottonseed. Recently, eight factories, including the Japanese-owned Nikka Oil Manufacturing Company, Japan Oil & Fat Co., Ltd., Southern China Industrial Company, Taishan Oil Factory, Universal Oil Factory, Yoshida Oil Factory, Great Japan Oil Company, and Minhang Oil Pressing Plant, as well as four Chinese-owned oil pressing factories, have been allocated raw materials and are hastening oil production. The produced oil has been packed in iron drums and stored in designated oil depots, ready for allocation to retailers based on edible oil permits. Once the procedures for rationing by population are ready, a public announcement will be made for implementation, allowing purchases with the first coupon of the edible oil permit. Prices will be in accordance with the new prices announced on March 1st. It is expected to be implemented before the end of March. If preparations for rationing by population are insufficient, there may be another sale once according to the old method, allowing residents to purchase freely.

### Ambassador Shigemitsu's Remarks

Ambassador Shigemitsu came to Shanghai on the 17th of this month for official business. Yesterday (19th) at 4:30 PM, he held a reception at the Broadway Mansions for the local Chinese press corps. Attendees included Mr. Tagiri, Chief of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy, Secretary Shimizu, Vice-Consul Fukushima, Interpreter Masaki, and over ten reporters from various newspapers. Ambassador Shigemitsu began by expressing his heartfelt pleasure at meeting with the press. He intends to visit Shanghai once a month in the future. Although his stay this time is short, he has witnessed general improvements in Shanghai, especially in the economic sphere. This is due to the active cooperation of Shanghai's economic leaders, for which he expresses his immense satisfaction. He hopes to see further progress in Shanghai's situation when he visits next time, and Japan will fully assist in China's efforts towards reconstruction. He further stated that his expectation of China is nothing more than that the Chinese people will work hard to revive China and cooperate with Japan in East Asia to complete the Greater East Asia War and jointly build a New East Asia. Regarding the issue of returning the International Settlement, Ambassador Shigemitsu replied to reporters that Japan signed an agreement with China on January 9th to return the Japanese-administered concessions and signed detailed provisions of the agreement on the 14th of this month. He hopes that the issue of returning the International Settlement can be concluded in the shortest possible time to meet the expectations of the Chinese government and people. Regarding the abolition of extraterritorial rights, China has long hoped for it and aims to abolish unequal treaties. Japan has also had similar experiences in the past, but after years of effort, it has shaken off this restriction. Now is the time for China. On January 9th, Japan was the first to declare the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China, and China's friendly nations have followed suit. He hopes to see it materialize soon.

Furthermore, when Ambassador Shigemitsu hosted Japanese journalists yesterday, he stated that Prime Minister Tojo's recent visit to China will cause a major reaction among the general Chinese population, as they will understand the true meaning of Sino-Japanese cooperation.

### 30th Period Household Rice is Entirely White Rice

The 30th period household rice is entirely white rice and contains no brown rice or broken rice. This white rice includes (1) domestically produced Du rice, (2) Wuhu Yangxian rice, and (3) Thai and Vietnamese Yang rice, with a quantity of two and a half liters. As for the prices received by the rice shops, according to the purchase order regulations, each bag of rice is 308.6 yuan, and each bag of flour is 92 yuan. The price of the 30th period household rice has slightly increased to 300 yuan per dan, so the receiving price of each rice shop will inevitably be adjusted accordingly. However, the receiving price of each rice shop is temporarily kept at the old price. The adjustment will be made up at the end of March when the rice and flour payments are settled.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Announces; 30th Period Ration; Household Rice Price Slightly Increased

At that time, rice shops with registration numbers marked on the coupon will sell two and a half liters of white rice per rice permit coupon at a price of 7.5 yuan, and one catty and four taels of Grade 2 flour and four taels of Grade 3 flour per flour permit coupon at a price of 3.3 yuan. On the 31st of this month, all rice shops and the council's rice sales offices in the public concession will be temporarily closed for one day.

### Shops in the French Concession Use Kerosene Lamps at Night

However, there are still many shops in the French Concession that do not close until late at night at 12:00 AM, but the shop's electric lights are all turned off, and most are replaced with kerosene lamps.

### Advisor Ishiwatari Spoke Yesterday; Currency System Issues; Savings Certificates, Yen, and Joint Notes; Exchange Rates Should Be Specified Separately

A local dispatch from the Domei News Agency reports that Sohtaro Ishiwatari, the National Government's Supreme Economic Advisor, stated to the press at the Cathay Hotel yesterday afternoon that since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, general commodity prices have started to decline. Advisor Ishiwatari also stated that to strengthen the National Government's wartime economic policies, the number of Japanese economic advisors stationed throughout the country would be increased. Regarding currency system issues, he hoped that in the near future, the official exchange rate between savings certificates and yen (excluding military scrip) would be specified, namely 18 yen to 100 savings certificates. At the same time, the exchange rate between Central Bank savings certificates and joint notes would also be specified. After the merger of military scrip and savings certificates, the exchange rate between yen and savings certificates would be specified as 18 yen to 100 savings certificates. At that time, due to the merger of the two currencies, the number of savings certificates would increase, but this would not be currency inflation. Regarding Central Bank savings certificates and joint banknotes, the Chinese and Japanese governments are conducting research and will make concrete decisions. Food purchases are currently managed by the Ministry of Food but will soon be transferred to the National Commercial Control Association. To raise sufficient funds to purchase food, the National Government will soon issue food treasury bonds. At the same time, issuing prize-winning lottery tickets is also being planned. Mr. Ishiwatari will leave Shanghai for Hangzhou today (Saturday).

Short Commentary

### Ambassador Shigemitsu's Words; Expecting China's Revival

Ambassador Shigemitsu hosted the Chinese press corps yesterday and made a speech with two main points. He said, "I have witnessed the general improvement of Shanghai's situation, especially in the economic sphere, which is due to the active cooperation of Shanghai's economic leaders." He also said, "My expectation of China is nothing more than that the Chinese people will work hard to revive China." We believe that Ambassador Shigemitsu's words are not flattery but sincere hopes. From the standpoint of the Chinese people, we cannot help but feel the great responsibility to the country and must be doubly vigilant.

First, the new economic measures in Shanghai this time are only preliminary reforms in the process of experimentation. The main reason for this, as the ambassador said, is "due to the active cooperation of economic leaders." But on the other hand, it is also because these measures are suitable for the current environment that there are these reforms. Therefore, all economic measures - and even all political, social, and other measures - if they are to be effective, must have two preconditions: (1) full cooperation between the people and the government; (2) suitability to the environment at that time and place; otherwise, they will inevitably be in vain. This valuable conclusion of experimentation can be used as a guideline for Sino-Japanese relations and the efforts of the government and the people in the future. The economic measures in Shanghai this time are only preliminary reforms, and complete success still depends on the continued efforts of both the Chinese and Japanese governments and people.

Second, Ambassador Shigemitsu expects the Chinese people to work hard to revive China, and we strongly agree. The revival of China certainly depends on the efforts of the Chinese people themselves; however, under the current situation, frankly speaking, half of it also depends on the sincere assistance of friendly nations everywhere and giving the Chinese people full freedom to develop. The revival of China is also the key to the revival of East Asia. We have accepted Ambassador Shigemitsu's sincere and hopeful words, which have deeply aroused endless self-encouragement.

### Young Women's Christian Association Scholarship; 10,000 Yuan; Exerting Effort and Contributing Money; Worthy of Social Emulation

On January 30th, this newspaper received a letter from the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association, asking us to select twelve outstanding students from each level of primary, middle, and high schools on its behalf. The association would allocate scholarships to show its support for this newspaper's scholarship campaign. After this newspaper completed the selection last month, it was sent to the association to send staff to investigate and review according to the rules. Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from the association, along with a scholarship of 10,000 yuan, showing the association's deep appreciation for serving the society and benefiting young people. It has been found that the Young Women's Christian Association has been fair and strict in hosting the examination matters for this newspaper's past scholarship programs, which is well known in society.

Commentary

### Wartime Frugal Consumption

"Increasing revenue and reducing expenditure" has been the only solution in Chinese financial management since ancient times. If this sentence is used as the principle of the wartime economy, it is even more appropriate, because one aspect of the wartime economy is to focus on increasing production, and the other aspect is to focus on frugal consumption. If production increases as much as possible, but consumption cannot be frugal, the result will make the advancement of production power in vain and will not help wartime economic construction.

The solution to social problems, especially wartime social problems, cannot be achieved solely by relying on some principles and some laws. The most important thing is to rely on people from all walks of life in society, while the government takes the position of guidance and supervision. The establishment of the National Commercial Control Association this time is the best precedent for various sectors of society to jointly assist in solving social problems. Undoubtedly, the main task of this institution is to adjust the supply and demand relationship of materials, and it must take promoting production as its prerequisite issue. However, what we cannot ignore most is that in addition to promoting production, we must advocate frugality. Looking around the countries of the world during the war, which country is not striving for frugal consumption? To cite one or two examples, in Japan, those who go to restaurants and restaurants cannot escape heavy taxes. In France, the most appealing dance halls and nightclubs are cancelled at all costs. These are necessary measures for frugal consumption and are worthy of imitation.

In any case, in the process of implementing the wartime economy, frugal consumption and increased production must be planned and considered at the same time and complement each other. Rejecting extravagance must be regarded as a necessary condition during the war, and saving on food and clothing should also be regarded as an obligation to be fulfilled during the war. We believe that frugal consumption is most closely related to the entire wartime economic problem, and we hope that the government will actively promote it and the people will cooperate universally. In order to thoroughly solve this problem, it seems appropriate for the government to organize a Mass Frugal Consumption Guidance Committee, and for appropriate figures to be selected from the private sector to assist the government in publicizing, guiding, and promoting such an important movement; in necessary situations, the government should enforce it compulsorily, and it should also be regarded as a reasonable action.

### New Central Savings Society - Supervisory Committee Formally Established - Held First Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Transfer Matters

Central News Agency, Shanghai - The Supervisory Committee of the New Central Savings Society was formally established yesterday and held its first supervisory committee meeting to receive its asset and liability schedules and business account books. The supervisors present at the meeting included Tang Shoumin, Ye Fuxiao, Wu Zhenxiu, Qin Runqing, Yuan Ludeng, Zhu Boquan, Pei Yunqing, Pei Fuheng, Yang Xinghua, Ren Xishun (Li Da was absent due to illness), Liu Ruxiang, Wu Jiyun, Shao Shijun, and others, totaling fourteen people. Zhang Xisan and Zhou Shaojian attended as observers. First, Zhou Zuzhen, the deputy manager of the society, reported on the business situation and the situation since the military administration on January 9 of last year, as well as a list of all assets and liabilities. Then, they discussed the reorganization and establishment of the organizational system of the New Central Savings Society and the future direction for promoting business. The meeting adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM. The Central Savings Society was established in April of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936) with a fund of 5 million yuan allocated by the former Chongqing Central Trust Bureau. It has been more than seven years since then. In addition to branches in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, and other places, there are also many sub-branches throughout the country. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8, 1941, the Chongqing Central Trust Bureau took over the liquidation. The Central Savings Society thus became completely independent in accounting. On January 9 of last year, it was managed by the Japanese army, continuing business and preserving the rights and interests of general depositors. Now, the Japanese army has lifted the management and returned it to our government. With the approval of the government by the Ministry of Finance, the Central Reserve Bank is preparing to allocate funds to take over and reorganize it into the New Central Savings Society, which was formally established yesterday to continue business. All original depositors of the old Central Savings Society before the incident, after completing legal procedures, can continue their rights and interests. It is understood that the various organizational departments of the society after the reorganization will remain the same, with little change. However, the savings portion of the business department will be separated and a separate savings department will be established to handle all savings business. It is reported that in terms of personnel, in addition to the already designated Li Da as the general manager, Pei Fuheng, Zhang Xisan, and Zhou Shaojian as deputy managers, and Deng Yiyuan and Xiao Pei as assistant managers, all other personnel in various departments will remain the same and will not be changed.

### Minister Mei Elaborates on the Issue of Material Transportation

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th - Regarding the issue of general materials being moved in and out, and whether the National Government's announcement of the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association will also entail the establishment of branches in various locations, various parties still lack a full understanding of this. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited Minister of Industry and Commerce Mei to request an explanation, which was answered as follows: (1) Except for rice, materials in general can be freely moved in and out of various regions without any restrictions. This measure has been implemented since the 16th of this month. However, what is hoped of merchants and the public is, firstly, not to create hoarding of materials as a result of this; secondly, not to use this opportunity to engage in opportunistic speculation; and thirdly, not to secretly provide materials to bandit areas. It is earnestly hoped that merchants and the public can strictly abide by the above three points. If the above three points can be achieved, then the government will naturally continue to implement the unrestricted free movement of materials in and out for a long period to benefit merchants and the public. (2) The National Commercial Control Association was formally established in Shanghai a few days ago. Its establishment aims to assist the government in improving the materials organization and completing the wartime economic system.

### Material Visa of the City Chamber of Commerce to be Handled Centrally by the Commercial Control Association

According to inquiries made by a Shanghai News Agency reporter, several months ago it was stipulated that the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce would be responsible for issuing permits for the transportation of various materials in this city. Because the National Commercial Control Association was established and centrally handled the issuance of permits for the movement of materials in and out, the City Chamber of Commerce ended the handling of the visa office and notified all trade associations! (1) Inventory registration is limited to being completed before the 23rd of this month. (2) Since the 16th of this month, it is not allowed to freely move materials. Otherwise, personnel should be sent to contact the Materials Affairs Office of the National Commercial Control Association. All associations have now separately notified their respective members to abide by this. It is heard that each has sent personnel to contact the National Commercial Control Association.

### Directors of the Commercial Control Association Inspect the Status of Material Applications

Central News Agency, Shanghai - After the National Commercial Control Association's Material Movement Application Permit Office began handling material movement application permit matters, it issued some permits yesterday afternoon. Permits for the movement of rice and grain were issued in advance in order to fully regulate the issue of public food. It is heard that Tong Lüqing, a director of the Commercial Control Association (who is the deputy manager of Shenxin Textile Factory and the vice chairman of the Central Cotton Industry Tax System Association), made a special trip to the office yesterday morning to inspect the internal personnel's handling of affairs, which he found to be very satisfactory. It is heard that a written certificate from the Central China Cotton Industry Control Association is required for the cotton yarn and cloth movement application permit before it can be reviewed and approved for movement.

Editorial

### Strengthening Central Reserve Notes

The so-called strengthening of the National Government, in terms of the economic part, is nothing more than restoring the economy under the rule of the National Government. However, the prerequisite for economic recovery is the sound development of the currency system. Because this means that the economic policy of the National Government after joining the war, the first main goal is the rectification of the currency system, specifically, it must focus on strengthening the Central Reserve Notes.

The strengthening of the Central Reserve Notes must be reviewed from various aspects. The first is the issue related to various currencies. Although it is said that enemy old legal tender and other miscellaneous currencies have been driven out of Central China, they are still circulating around the vicinity of the peaceful area. The close relationship between the Joint Reserve Notes and the Central Reserve Notes is, of course, very close, but from the perspective of the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere, there are still areas that need to be improved in the relationship between the two. Looking at the relationship between the Central Reserve Notes and military scrip, it can be seen how close the relationship between the Central Reserve Notes and the Japanese yen is. But we still have further hopes, hoping that this relationship will adapt to the current situation and have a healthy development, to become a model for the currency relationship in the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

However, establishing the relationship between the Central Reserve Notes and other currencies, from the perspective of the Central Reserve Notes, still focuses on the content of the Central Reserve Notes itself. In other words, if the Central Reserve Notes want to establish a proper relationship with other currencies, it must first make real and sound currency achievements in the peaceful area itself. First, the issuance work of the Central Reserve Notes should always be made clear to people. As far as we know, the Central Reserve Notes are very sound in terms of both the amount issued and the amount of issuance reserves. The recent changes in prices are due to local reasons. If someone's trust in the Central Reserve Notes is shaken, then the factual reasons for it should be made clear to the public in order to alleviate the general public's shaken mentality. Second, regarding the whereabouts of the issued Central Reserve Notes! Should be earnestly explained. If the public knows the whereabouts of the Central Reserve Notes! It is definitely not in speculation and hoarding, but is used to strengthen the National Government and restore the economy, then? Its effect must be great.

The rectification of the currency system is not only a matter of the currency itself. The most important condition is to use the currency as a medium and use the soundness of commodity circulation and financial transactions to rectify the currency system. The establishment of the National Commercial Pillow System Association is a concrete manifestation of commodity circulation work. It must be remembered that the sound development of this control association is the side progress of the Central Reserve Notes. But what about in the financial sector, dare to say that this is the most unhealthy part of the economic situation in Central China, it is undeniable. The Public and Concession Industry Bureau has been working hard to reform this malpractice, and we deeply respect it, but we hope that the National Government will strengthen the past policy of suppressing speculation, and especially hope that Chinese financial figures will be more self-respecting.

Only by each cooperating directly and indirectly to strengthen the Central Reserve Notes from their respective positions is the responsibility of people in the peaceful camp. This is our consistent position. (Yunpeng: Translated from the Continental News on March 19)

### Dreams and Realization

— Han Feng

We humans possess a wonderfully mysterious power, which is the ability to dream. Everyone living in this world has their own aspiring dreams, and even if they cannot be fully realized, they still have considerable value. There is great power in dreams; they can enhance our intelligence and allow our talents and latent abilities to be fully发挥ed. With dreams, there is great hope, and with hope, there is a bright future. If we lose the power to dream, then all hope, courage, and the will to continue striving will completely vanish.

History tells us that the minds of the world's great figures in their childhood were filled with various strange dreams. To put it plainly, they were all dreamers, but not empty dreamers, but rather based on definite facts. The reason they were able to achieve success is that they could turn their dreams into reality. No matter how dark the environment they encountered, they could ultimately overcome all obstacles and achieve great success with unwavering faith and earnest effort. Therefore, we should exert tenacious effort to realize our great dreams.

Upward thoughts are sufficient to improve our dreams. To dream without realizing it becomes妄想. To construct dreams, in addition to having determined effort, we must also have firm belief; believe that the things you dream of can be realized. We must also stimulate your dreams, and never hold a skeptical attitude; doubt will weaken your courage and the will to strive. Therefore, we should dispel skeptical thoughts and embrace thoughts of accomplishment. Dreams that can be realized have value and are great. A person with dreams and faith has a far-reaching and bright future!

Dreamers can be said to be the pioneers of humanity, working tirelessly and enduring hardship to pave a smooth road for mankind.

If a person's dream is based on facts, then wonderful success is waiting for you!

### Second Place Winner in the February Essay Contest - How to Read and What to Read? (Part 1)

— Ying Yuanze

1. How to Read?

A Brief Word

The opening sentence: Reading is both a bitter thing and a joyful thing. Why is it a "bitter thing"? Because without understanding the method of reading, one often achieves half the result with twice the effort, working hard to no avail, which makes people feel painful. Why is it a "joyful thing"? Because understanding the method of reading, one can often have a clear plan in mind and proceed according to plan, reaping the greatest effect in a short period. The so-called "bitterness" and "joy" depend entirely on whether the application of reading methods is appropriate. Therefore, the question of "how to read" is worthy of deep thought for every scholar.

Regarding the question of "how to read," there are many complexities and a wide range. In the hands of experts, it can simply be written into a voluminous work. The author is unlearned and lacks parental feelings and experience. I can only compile the following items based on what I have read in the past to correct domestic Mingda scholars.

Two Kinds of Reading Methods

There are many methods of reading, but comparatively, the most practical and the most extensive are two kinds: one is the method of seeking refinement, and the other is the method of seeking breadth. Both of these methods are needed in the process of seeking knowledge in life, and neither can be neglected. Focusing only on refinement without discussing breadth will inevitably lead to ignorance and limited knowledge, inevitably leading to the ridicule of being a "bookworm." Conversely, focusing only on breadth without discussing refinement will inevitably lead to insatiable greed and a lack of thorough understanding, reading as if not reading at all.

Therefore, the compromise is to emphasize both "refinement" and "breadth," and neither can be neglected. Originally, there were some books of specialized nature, whose writing style was extremely elegant and whose content was quite profound. Readers should concentrate and read them carefully and thoroughly, understanding the essence of the original book between the lines to尊determine the foundation of personal profound knowledge. As for general knowledge books, their types are numerous and countless. If readers want to read them carefully and thoroughly, it is impossible even with a lifetime of energy. The only method is to browse through each book, observing its general outline. In other words, adapt to the times and conditions, use the "refined reading method" for a small part of specialized books, and use the "browsing method" for the majority of common sense books.

Who First, Who Later

As for how to refer to and use each other? Or who comes first and who comes later? That varies depending on the nature of the reader. In short, students whose academic foundation is not solid should pay more attention to the refined reading method and use the browsing method less. Those who already have a considerable foundation in a certain field of study but have not yet reached the level of breadth should change their strategy and put more effort into browsing. In short, the method is tailored to the individual, and there are no strict boundaries.

How to Seek Refinement

The starting point for "refined reading" is—what books to choose? Once the books have been selected, one should arrange them in order of priority and proceed step by step. One should also persist in this, and not read other books before finishing one book. One must know that being fickle is the fierce enemy of the refined reading method, and readers should remember it. When reading, one must carefully savor the essence of the book, striving for a thorough understanding without any doubt. If one finds any points that can be doubted, one should maintain a critical attitude and explore them in various ways to seek progress in thought. The next method is to underline the important parts of the book to identify or pay attention to them; one can also write "marginal notes" on the edge of the book pages, stating one's own feelings or summarizing the main idea of the paragraph, for easy reference. The best thing to do is to write notes separately in a notebook, recording the main idea of a chapter or section of a certain book, or its highlights, for comparison and research with other reference materials; it would be even more valuable if one could record one's own feelings or opinions on the research topic.

### Root

— Xin Bo

Except for Xue Fengchun talking quietly to He Yougong, everyone else was silent.

Soon, the entire deed was written, and Yu Du asked the second hand to hold it up, reading aloud, from "Li 　Qiren Wang Genming..." all the way to. Republic of China Twenty-seventh Year, January × Day』's 'Li 　Qiren Wang Genming "and" seeing Zhong Yang Zijie, Baochang Lu Bodong, copyist Yu Duzhou".

Everyone listened and had no objections. Yu Duzhou put the deed on the table and asked everyone to sign it.

Huang Chong'an walked down from the Kang bed and slowly exited the study door. Everyone seemed to understand what he was doing, and no one asked him.

Genming walked over, bent down, pressed the paper with his left hand, and took the pen given to him by Yu Duzhou with his right hand. According to the location specified by Yu Duzhou, he put the tip of the pen down. The tip of the pen shook uncertainly, just like a weeping willow in the wind, blown up and down, forward and backward. With great effort, he wrote two strokes on the paper, one straight and one horizontal, intersecting, also like a weeping willow using the force of the wind to draw two marks on the floating mud by the river.

It took another effort when it was Lu Bodong's turn to 　the word. It turned out that he was asleep, not knowing when he was leaning halfway against the window sill and halfway against the account table, asleep. After several calls and probes, he woke up, and after a few decisive urging and coercion, he drew a familiar "fancy word" under his name with sleepy eyes.

After everyone's words were drawn well, Huang Chong'an also returned and put a paper package on the table. Yang Zijie opened it and grabbed those pieces, some slightly spotted, horizontally stacked 　of silver dollars, counting them one by one to sixty-seven. (Sixteen)

### Elementary School Teacher Medical Assistance Fund - Second Committee Meeting - Report on Work, Distribute Donations

Given the importance of the duties of elementary school teachers, the arduousness of their mission, the meagerness of their treatment, and the hardship of their lives, the colleagues of this newspaper, once they are afflicted with illness, have no way to raise funds for medical expenses, and their moaning and painful emotions are self-evident. Therefore, the "Elementary School Teacher Medical Assistance Fund" was established, aiming to stimulate human sympathy and provide practical assistance to the majority of poor teachers. Since February, the enthusiastic support of doctors, hospitals, and pharmaceutical factories has been warmly welcomed, "those with money contribute money, those with wisdom contribute wisdom," and the broad sympathy of people from all walks of life has been deeply admired.

Yesterday, the second committee meeting was held at the Concorse Hotel. Zhang Yipeng, Ding Fubao, Wang Yijing, Chen Binhe, Wen Lanting, Zhao Jinqing and other gentlemen were present. Huang Jingwan reported on the progress of the handling. Public and private hospitals that voluntarily sent letters to participate included dental, ophthalmology, pediatrics, obstetrics, etc., which responded one after another to the righteous act or generously provided free diagnosis and treatment or half-price preferential treatment, totaling twenty-one. There were thirteen male and female doctors, and one each from the Health Association and Fitness Academy. Up to March 15, a total of 44,038 yuan was received from various circles, and donated medicines worth more than 11,000 yuan were received from three companies. Three hundred registration forms were issued, introducing more than thirty people to various hospitals for free treatment (including two births). More than ten health survey forms were received, and it was found that many schools suffered from neurasthenia, insomnia, gastrointestinal diseases, pulmonary tuberculosis, qi deficiency, blood deficiency, colds, and coughs, which shows the seriousness of the poverty and illness of general teachers. The following resolutions were passed (1) The Concorse Hospital, Hongren Hospital, West Gate Women and Children Hospital, and Civilian Women and Children Hospital specially agreed upon at the previous meeting will each be allocated 10,000 yuan, and medicines will each be subsidized with 2,500 yuan, but they must be reported quarterly and replenished after use, and treatment must not be stopped. (2) Other assisting hospitals and doctors will be compensated for a portion of the medicine and material costs at the discretion of this newspaper based on the number of people taught. (3) Those whose families are still relatively well-off and those with bad habits are not allowed to apply. Those suffering from serious illnesses and lung diseases that require long-term recuperation as certified by a doctor are temporarily not within the scope of relief. (4) Regularly hold seminars and health checkups to study disease prevention, and invite experts to guide non-medicinal treatment and simple health methods. (5) Those who apply for medical treatment must have a teacher's ID card and a certificate from the current principal and follow the application procedures to be valid. Those who want to go to nearby hospitals for diagnosis and treatment must have proof from this newspaper. Registration forms can be requested by letter at any time.
