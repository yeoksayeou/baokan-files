### Contribution to the Price Evaluation Council

In order to unify price management, the municipal government established the Price Evaluation Council, with the Director of the Bureau of Economics as the chairman and the leaders of relevant agencies as members, aiming to gather wisdom and solve the price issue reasonably. A meeting was held earlier this month, and now, as the price surge is rampant and people's lives are increasingly threatened, an extraordinary meeting was convened again recently to discuss emergency measures. We would like to offer a few practical opinions to the Council for reference:

The method of limiting the price of goods has been implemented since before the concessions were recovered. Not only have the fixed prices of various commodities been announced, but also a large number of male and female investigators have been employed to conduct daily investigations. As a result, except for a few larger department stores, which had to sell a portion of their goods at the fixed price due to the relationship with the marked price, it can be said that none of the other general stores stopped selling on the black market. Some investigators are unable to fulfill their duties, and some, although able to fulfill their duties, cannot sit in one store all day long. As a result, although prices are regulated, the black market is still rampant. Therefore, what the Council should pay attention to in the future is not only how to limit the price, but how to enforce the limit price, so that the people can truly benefit from the limit price.

The price limit methods of the former Public Works Bureau had too many categories and too many items, which were not necessary. We advocate that the types of commodities with limited prices in the future should be limited to daily necessities, so that the scope can be reduced and the investigation can be more thorough.

In recent days, the most drastic price increases have been in coal briquettes and then rice. Because both rice and coal are necessities for people's lives, they affect the rise in general commodities and labor. An effective way to stabilize prices should be to quickly implement coal briquette rationing and increase the amount of rice per household, so that people's lives can be stabilized and the fear eliminated. Then all prices can be stabilized without suppression.

The rise in industrial products is certainly affected by the price of coal and rice, but there is also a more significant reason: since the power company restricted the use of electricity, both industry insiders and outsiders have seen that production will be further reduced and prices will rise further, so they have been engaged in hoarding. A comprehensive approach should be taken: on the one hand, the ban on non-industry purchases should be reiterated, and all trade associations should be responsible for its implementation; on the other hand, the municipal authorities should earnestly negotiate with the power company to readjust the electricity limit for factories in order to maintain the existing productivity.

The free flow of goods within the area is stipulated in the "Temporary Regulations on the Prohibition of Wartime Material Movement." The municipal authorities have also repeatedly ordered that no obstacles should be placed. However, in fact, many people still fail to implement it earnestly, which increases the burden on merchants and increases the cost of goods. For example, coal briquette merchants often use this as an excuse. The Council should immediately suggest that the municipal government send more senior police officers in plain clothes to conduct secret investigations. Those who do not comply with the law and harass merchants must be severely punished at any time to reduce the burden on merchants, which is also a way to suppress prices.

Secondly, we also have a few opinions on the price evaluation work itself: First, the price evaluation should be based on the production cost, and the calculation of the cost can only be done by experts. Therefore, the Council should organize special committees to invite experts with both academic knowledge and integrity to preside over the matter. The Council itself should maintain an objective attitude and should not have subjective prejudices. Second, a too high price evaluation will increase the burden on the people, but a too low price evaluation will affect production or force merchants to hide their goods, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand and rising prices. The result is still the same: consumers will be affected. Therefore, when evaluating prices, the profits of producers and vendors must be taken into account. Third, the effective period of price evaluation should be moderately stipulated and should not be changed lightly unless there are special changes. Fourth, the Council should set up more contracted investigators to provide information at any time. Fifth, and also the last point, we hope that the Council can maintain close contact and cooperate fully with the "relevant executive agencies."

### Wuhan Residents Organize Aircraft Donation Committee

### Capital Youth Students Telegraph the Whole Country to Eliminate Poison

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) – The Capital Youth Students' Poison Elimination Association, in order to work together with youth students across the country to complete the poison elimination work, telegraphed youth students across the country, saying that since the youth students of this capital launched the poison elimination movement on December 17th, they have repeatedly received responses from youth classmates in various places, which has greatly increased our courage. After being inspired, we have listed several points for the information of our classmates across the country. Opium is a sharp knife for destroying the country and exterminating the race, gambling is the root of ruin and bankruptcy, and singing and dancing are poisonous seedlings that lose one's mind and ambition. The three have been poisoning China for a long time, and all enlightened people deeply hate and abhor them. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and our country's participation in the war, the people of the whole country have been practicing wartime production, saving consumption, and increasing production in order to contribute everything to the country. Unfortunately, there are still a few ignorant people who spend their days singing, dancing, swallowing clouds, and spitting fog, shamelessly affecting young compatriots to imitate them, which ultimately leads to the increasingly decline of the national spirit and the increasingly depraved consciousness of young people. If this continues, the country will not only have no talent to be made, but also no soldiers to be used. It is not like climbing a tree to catch a fish to seek the revival of the country and the liberation of East Asia. We are the future pillars of the country, and all hope is on our shoulders. Seeing this phenomenon, we are heartbroken and filled with grief. Therefore, we are gathering the hot blood of tens of thousands of classmates and launching a ruthless total attack on the poisons that hinder the survival of the nation. Our actions are all driven by patriotic feelings. We only hope to use this pure motivation to sacrifice everything in exchange for the revival of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the East Asian nations. Smoke, gambling, and dance are what we consider to be the biggest enemies, so they are at the top of our attack list. From now on, we will work tirelessly to eliminate all poisons from the country until there is not a single opium den, gambling den, or dance hall on the territory of the Republic of China, and no compatriots of the Chinese nation will be eroded by opium, gambling, and singing and dancing again. Then the youth students of the whole country will be fortunate, the Chinese nation will be fortunate, and the future of East Asia will be fortunate.

### Swedish Prime Minister Reiterates Determination to Remain Neutral

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) – Swedish Prime Minister Hansson delivered a Christmas broadcast to the nation, strongly stating Sweden's determination to adhere to neutrality. The gist of his speech was that Swedish citizens should understand that Sweden is not only verbally maintaining neutrality, and should not arbitrarily discuss the country's diplomatic relations with other countries. Swedish citizens must unite to maintain neutrality.

### Rumors Abound That Anti-Axis Forces Are Preparing to Attack Europe, Eisenhower Appointed Commander-in-Chief

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters report from London: A British semi-official news agency commented that the appointment of General Eisenhower as Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Forces to attack Europe and the appointment of General Montgomery as Commander of the British-Canadian Forces are regarded as shocking Christmas news, but newspapers will not comment on it within thirty-six hours. The agency's military correspondent, Buchu, believes that the invasion of Europe is not far away. The American side claims that the "Second Front" will take action within "ninety days." The Anti-Axis Forces in the United Kingdom are prepared, but not as much as Eisenhower and Montgomery taking on new positions. London believes that separate commands will be established for the US military and the armies of the European governments in exile. Rumors abound that the air force attacking Europe will be adjusted by another person. There will be commanders for the naval and air forces. This news is...

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – Reuters: German officials have not yet commented on the appointment of General Eisenhower as Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Forces to attack Europe.

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) – Reuters: Washington news; US Senator Johnson, based on information from "extremely reliable sources," claimed that the US military will account for 73% of the Anti-Axis Forces attacking Europe. This ratio will surely shock Americans, but I do not want to question the strategic value of this decision. Johnson is also a member of the US Senate Armed Services Committee.

### British Planes Bomb Berlin, Drop Time Bombs

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – Reuters: British planes bombed Berlin before dawn the day before yesterday, dropping a large number of time bombs to explode on Christmas Eve. Fortunately, due to Germany's preventive measures, the attempt by several people did not succeed.

### Roosevelt Warns the People Not to Be Overly Optimistic About the War Situation

Amsterdam, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to Washington news: In his Christmas speech, President Roosevelt said that the Anti-Axis side will still suffer significant losses. The US military has learned from the Solomon Islands, Gilbert Islands, and the Tunisia and Italian campaigns that there will be even greater and more sacrificial battles in progress. The war has now reached the stage where the Anti-Axis Forces are preparing for significant sacrifices. There is no easy road to victory, and the outcome of the war is still not in sight. During the President's trip abroad, the people he met all said that the abilities of the Axis soldiers are excellent. President Roosevelt commented at the end that some Americans think that the war is coming to an end and the Anti-Axis has won. This kind of thinking is wrong.

### American Steel Workers Brewing a General Strike

Artingen, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to a New York dispatch: Just as the American railway workers' general strike has not yet been resolved, a steel workers' strike has occurred, which will paralyze the steel industry, the center of the American military industry. The American labor problem has encountered unprecedented unrest since July of this year. The wage contract established between the Steel Labor Union of the American Federation of Labor and various steel companies expired at midnight on the 24th. At the same time, the workers belonging to the Union began to strike one after another. Workers at four steel mills in Ohio, 40,000 in all, went on strike starting on the 26th, forcing steel mills and iron plate and iron pipe factories to suspend work. In addition, workers at the Jelenko Smelting Company in Pennsylvania and the Hubbard Steel Company in Ohio also started strikes. Most of the steel mills in other areas are closed for Christmas holidays, and the attitude of the workers is still unclear. However, according to the 26th, if no new developments occur, the workers belonging to the Union will go on strike together starting on the 27th (Monday), and 350,000 workers in 500 steel companies across the United States will implement a full-scale general strike.

### British and American Troops Launch New Offensive in Italy, Street Fighting in Ortona

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters: During the Christmas holidays, the US Fifth Army launched a strong new offensive along the Minano-Cassino highway in southern Italy. The purpose seems to be to conquer the key German positions there, open up the plains of the Cassino front, and then deploy tanks to fight. Whether this move by the US military is a prelude to a major offensive in the western part of the southern Italian front remains to be seen. The fierce fighting in the east is taking place in the area of the Orsogna-Ortona highway. The troops under Montgomery's command are attempting to break into the German defenses from the west of Ortona. British troops are pouring into the city of Ortona, and fierce street fighting is underway. The town of Orsogna at the western end of the road is still in German hands, and repeated attacks by the Allied forces have been repelled by our army with heavy casualties.

### Economic Posture

— Jin Yi

Beijing, recently, because the authorities have cracked down on hoarding and speculation, general hoarders have not been able to profit as before, and the thriving business is trust business.

Emerging Trust Business

The so-called trust business is the general consignment store, which has been very active in recent years, and there is no one that has not made a profit. Now, general investment stores are also using the name of consignment. Because this type of consignment store can operate regardless of the amount of capital. If the financial resources are strong, they will buy goods that are cheap and easy to sell, and they can obtain heavy profits in one turnover. If they encounter goods with high prices and difficult to sell, they will sell them on behalf of customers, regardless of whether the goods are good or bad, or how the sales are. This method only makes money, and will never lose money. Even general merchants who are engaged in hoarding have nowhere to sell their goods, so they have to entrust these stores to sell them on their behalf. These stores can also take the opportunity to buy at fixed prices or lower market prices when market prices rise, and then resell them.

It is said that in the recent five or six months, there have been more than 20 newly established and affiliated trust merchants with larger scales, and there are even more that are thin and not noticed by the society. What is most intriguing is that some religious organizations and national organizations are also doing it. The Women's Christian Association holds a consignment auction once a week, and a Christian organization in Shijia Hutong also has several special commissioners there every day to buy and sell all kinds of goods for people. These institutions use the name of charity, but in fact, the profits are higher than those of general stores, because they do not have to pay taxes. This is indeed another aspect of the wartime economy.

Citizens' Copper Donation Week

I don't know when the word "week" has become a common noun. The week this week is called Copper Donation Week. This was decided by the Beijing Municipal Gold Donation Committee. The period is from the day of man to the 15th, and the citizens' copper donation movement week is implemented. And it ordered that all copper types, without permission, are prohibited from leaving the city and leaving the country, and pawnshops are strictly prohibited from accepting copper types of pawn items. In the past few days, we have seen many police officers notifying the citizens' homes door-to-door, saying that each household must donate two and a half pounds of copper, and the copper price on the market has also risen accordingly. With such a result, the success of the copper donation movement can always be expected. (Posted on December 15)

### German and Soviet Troops Fight Fiercely on the Kiev Highway, 58 Soviet Tanks Destroyed

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters: On the first day of the Christmas holiday, the Soviet army attacked the Kiev-Zhytomyr highway with about twelve divisions of infantry, covered by strong tank formations. As a result, 58 tanks were destroyed by us. The enemy made progress of several kilometers east of Vitebsk and north of Shylopin, but suffered heavy losses. In the fighting on the Kiev-Zhytomyr highway, the enemy attacked continuously in twelve batches, and there were many breaches. The German army is now counterattacking. Fierce fighting is also continuing southeast of Korosten, and the Soviet army's actions seem to be aimed at cutting off the German army's communications. The German army has continued to make progress northwest of Cherkasy and has now crossed the river and captured many strongholds.

### British Labor Party Dispatches Delegation to Soviet Union

Amsterdam, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to London news: Professor Laski, a special correspondent for the London Evening Standard, will soon go to Moscow as the leader of a Labor Party delegation to the Soviet Union. The Labor Party decided to send a delegation to the Soviet Union at a conference held eighteen months ago.

### The Crux of Current Grain Rationing Work

— Jing Yuan

Grain rationing is an important and difficult task. If done well, it can be a benevolent and virtuous policy; if done poorly, it can become an oppressive and cruel one. Since the establishment of the Grain Rationing Committee, achievements have not been evident, but only because expectations are high, the blame is felt keenly. At the same time, it is hoped that the authorities of the Grain Rationing Committee can bring up the difficulties and reveal the focus of the problems, so that, on the one hand, people can understand the reasons and, on the other hand, everyone can work together and strive to overcome the difficulties.

As far as we know, the reason why the current grain rationing work is hindered and cannot achieve a smooth and successful result is mainly due to the following reasons:

First, the organizational structure problem: The Grain Rationing Committee was originally the highest authority for national grain rationing. The responsibilities of the Grain Rationing Committee are procurement, transportation, storage, and distribution, as clearly promulgated by the Executive Yuan. Since the Grain Rationing Committee has been given the above-mentioned powers by the government, it should fully exercise them. If there are unsatisfactory aspects in the above-mentioned areas, the public only knows to ask the Grain Rationing Committee, and the Grain Rationing Committee cannot shirk its responsibility. According to the news released by Director Fu of the Grain Rationing Committee the other day, the transportation and storage work is handled by the Shanghai Grain Adjustment Association. We believe that this kind of patchwork phenomenon is by no means a symbol of a sound grain rationing system. It is hoped that the relevant authorities can quickly consult and adjust it.

Second, the personnel problem: Today, when grain has become a scarce commodity, the Grain Rationing Committee is regarded by some unscrupulous people as a place for profit, and cases of embezzlement and corruption are most likely to occur. Therefore, all sectors of society are paying more attention to the personnel issues of the committee. Since the establishment of the committee, various characters have been found, surrounding the committee's staff at all levels, displaying their skills, hoping to obtain unexpected satisfaction. Therefore, it is difficult for the committee's staff to avoid being shaken unless they have a firm will and are well-cultivated. Recently, several cases have occurred and are said to be under thorough investigation. In order to prevent future troubles, a system of joint guarantees should be quickly established. Assuming that five people are in a group, if one person violates the law, the other four will be held jointly responsible and severely punished. In particular, senior staff who hold important powers should take the initiative to sign such guarantees to show their purity and impartiality. Then, the higher-ups will set an example for the lower-level staff, which can create a clean and honest atmosphere.

Third, the transportation problem: Transportation is a key link in grain rationing, and it is also the most complex and difficult link. According to a report the other day, the Grain Rationing Committee's transportation work is now entrusted to the Huazhong Distribution Association by the Shanghai Grain Adjustment Association. We will not comment on whether this move is appropriate or not. Even if we just discuss the matter on its merits, it is indeed difficult for the Huazhong Distribution Association to be solely responsible. First, the association is also responsible for transporting military rice, and there are overlaps. Second, there are many unspoken rules and skills in transportation work that outsiders cannot fully understand. Each time, the extra expenses often far exceed the stipulated freight rates, just like the fixed price and the black market price of various goods. It is known that this is wrong but unavoidable. Merchants from friendly countries often have misunderstandings due to their national customs, which hinders transportation work. As evidenced by the fact that rice has been piled up in various places in recent months, even sprouting and rotting, while Shanghai is experiencing difficulties in supply and revealing its poverty, it can be seen that the transportation mechanism indeed needs to be reconsidered and adjusted.

Fourth, the burlap sack problem: Burlap sacks are an important tool for transporting rice. Currently, the supply of green line burlap sacks has been cut off, and the existing stock is small. The black market price for new goods is over 150 yuan per sack, while the Grain Rationing Committee's limited price is said to be around 130 yuan, making it difficult to purchase and delaying the start of transportation. It is now heard that the committee is ordering a large number of monofilament burlap sacks for use. Although the price is cheaper, the depreciation is high and they are not durable. It would be better to appropriately increase the purchase price to meet urgent needs.

The above are just a few points that address the crux of today's grain rationing and offer solutions. In today's turbulent times for the food supply in Shanghai, it is hoped that everyone can work together to overcome the difficulties. Originally, there are bound to be many obstacles and difficulties at the beginning of any work. This should not be used as a reason for negativity, but rather to overcome difficulties with courage and reach a smooth path.

### Banks and Money Houses Handling Year-End Closing of Accounts; Overall Financial Situation is Quite Stable

As the end of the 32nd year is approaching, all banks and money houses have begun to handle their year-end closing of accounts. The commercial and savings departments have completed interest settlements one after another. During this closing period, all lending, whether mortgage, credit, or overdraft, will be temporarily suspended as usual. Overdrafts without prior contract stipulations must be completely cleared before the closing period. Therefore, the money market is currently tight due to the closing of accounts, but this is a normal phenomenon during the closing period. However, the overall financial situation remains stable due to the efforts of the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank and Money House Reserve Fund in adjusting short-term lending and interbank lending. The internal reserves of the banks and money houses are exceptionally abundant. They are able to cope with all situations with ease and are determined to get through the year safely. It is predicted that the business operations of this year will be able to obtain considerable surpluses. Regarding the various industrial and commercial sectors, due to the soaring prices, business operations have developed considerably. There is no question that they will be able to safely pass the Lunar New Year. Markets in various industries, such as securities, will be closed for trading starting from the 28th to handle the closing of accounts. Banks and money houses will be closed for four days starting from January 1st and will reopen for business on January 5th.

### Egg Industry Joins Association and Revises Regulations

According to a reporter's investigation, in order to strengthen the control of the egg industry and crack down on informal egg merchants moving freely, the Chinese Egg Industry Association has revised the membership qualifications in its bylaws and will implement them today. In the future, egg merchants who want to join the association must meet the following two conditions: 1. Egg shops newly established in various districts that want to join the association must have a shop owner with more than three years of experience in the poultry and egg business, and have at least three employees. 2. The shop must have a business license issued by the relevant authorities and must be introduced by two or more members of the district's Egg Industry Association. They can only join the association after passing the review of the board of directors and supervisors.

### Shanghai Financial Market Conditions Last Week

The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai remained stable as usual last week. The official market prices of various commodities remained unchanged. As the end of the year approached, various banks and money houses followed the usual practice of handling the year-end settlement and temporarily suspended lending operations while urging the collection of debts, thus tightening the money supply. However, prices continued to rise last week, and unscrupulous merchants manipulated and disrupted market prices, causing public anxiety. In particular, the prices of rice and coal, both essential for people's livelihood, rose sharply. In order to stabilize people's livelihood, the municipal authorities are now thoroughly investigating the black market and suppressing underground market prices as a countermeasure, hoping that prices will soon fall. Moreover, the authorities are doing their best to dredge the sources to thoroughly resolve the issue and stabilize people's livelihood.

### Ten Thousand Miles of the Long March: A Certain Staff Officer's Experiences

The war has already been going on for two years. The enemy, encircled, are before the flag of Japanese warships, where they have established the impregnable Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, the enemy has now begun an all-out, desperate counteroffensive. Faced with this, our billion citizens must deliver a final, thorough, and devastating blow. As the Great East Asia War enters its third year, a certain lieutenant colonel from the 〇〇 squadron, who participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor, the largest base of the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Hawaii, at the beginning of the war, and subsequently participated in all the battles to dominate the North and South Pacific and the Indian Ocean, traveling no less than ten thousand miles, recently returned to the 〇〇 base. The following is a discussion of "Impressions of Ten Thousand Miles of the Battle Line," to encourage the home front to strengthen its war effort.

Attack on Pearl Harbor

Our fleet, shouldering the ideal of national construction, embarked on a great expedition of four thousand miles. In the dawn of December, the order came down: "Prepare to depart." The sea was quite treacherous, but the Pearl Harbor area was generally clear. The commander of the air unit finally gave the first order of the Great East Asia War. 〇〇 planes enthusiastically flew towards Pearl Harbor.

Those who saw them off devoutly prayed to the gods. For this day, our naval air corps had endured many years of hardship, and we believed that they would surely achieve a great victory. Indeed, at the scheduled time, the first telegram arrived: "Our surprise attack is successful."

Before the planes took off, we were listening to enemy intelligence in the ship via wireless. That day was Sunday, and the sounds of church prayers were being broadcast. They were conducting morning prayers: "May God grant assistance to the United States." At the moment when the naval aircraft, as predicted, attacked Pearl Harbor, the radio reported the chaotic state of the enemy, scattering in confusion.

"A certain unit of the army, hurry to the team!"

"Technicians, gather there!"

"See the unit assemble here, the entire division of Honolulu, quickly assemble in a certain area, under the command of a certain person."

The last sentence was invariably: "For the glorious homeland of the United States!" These final words—"For the glorious homeland of the United States"—made us deeply aware that, at the beginning of the war, the Americans also had patriotism. Although their beliefs differed from those of Japan, their spiritual strength could not be underestimated.

Returning from Hawaii, on the evening of the tenth, we heard the news that, thousands of miles away on the Malay Sea, our naval aircraft had sunk the British Far East Fleet's main force, the Prince of Wales.

Phoenix soaring tens of thousands of miles,
Avenging the arrogant with a single divine shout,
Bombing and shattering Pearl Harbor,
A touch of the sleeve, an invincible machine.

The fact that the enemy carried out this unprecedented large-scale attack in world war history was truly due to the late Marshal Isoroku Yamamoto. When departing to attack Hawaii, the commander encouraged us, saying: "Do not treat the enemy as a small enemy, but also do not fear them as a large enemy. Simply hold a belief in certain victory. Those who have a belief in certain victory, do not forget that there will surely be divine assistance."

We completely believed in the commander's path to certain victory and set out on our journey. When we learned of Marshal Yamamoto's heroic death while commanding in the air, we further strengthened the belief, as Marshal Yamamoto said, that the Imperial Navy always and everywhere inherits the "always on the battlefield" and "belief in certain victory," and thus will surely be victorious. When returning from Pearl Harbor, to report, in just one month, the commander's hair had turned completely white, and even his complexion had changed.

Sending us on the expedition to Hawaii,
His brow was filled with a belief in certain victory.

Returning from Hawaii to meet,
The general's head had turned white.

Establishing the Dutch East Indies Campaign

We attacked Java and Sumatra from the south. Enemy cruisers, destroyers, and transport ships, fleeing in defeat, were sunk one after another. A certain ship suddenly encountered an American cruiser at night. Our side clearly thought it was the enemy, but the enemy was completely unaware. The searchlight shone there, asking whether it was the enemy or friend, emitting a "Enemy? Friend?" firing signal. With such a good target, we immediately aimed and sank it. At that time, many people abandoned ship to escape in small boats from the defeated enemy ship. These boats were full of American, British, and Dutch officers. A certain small boat was captured, and when asked, they had been drifting for more than a week.

In the doldrums of the equator, the emotions of those drifting aimlessly… keenly felt the inevitability of defeat in war. At the same time, we, the victors, gratefully acknowledged the blessings of Heaven.

Indian Ocean Operations

Our 〇〇 unit turned its guns and advanced into the Indian Ocean. By this time, the war had been going on for five months, and the enemy had made considerable preparations. On the road ahead, as we advanced according to plan, we finally discovered enemy aircraft.

But at this time, it could also be said that there was divine assistance. The enemy's patrol was extremely clumsy. Although they flew towards us from the front, they did not know it until we took action. As soon as they came into contact with our actions, they fled, and our fighter planes pursued and shot them down one by one. When lowering to strafe, sentries and messengers were shot dead one by one. It was truly a pleasant and heroic battle.

In the Indian Ocean operation, we used attack to meet attack and inflicted great damage on the British. When bombing the enemy aircraft carrier Hermes, the Hermes was very close to the land, backed by large mountains, making it difficult to discover. Moreover, in that place, it was discovered and bombed by Japanese aircraft, because it was in a shallow area, there was no way to avoid it, only fate could help. In this operation, Lieutenant General Tamon Yamaguchi bestowed routine rewards, and his achievements at that time were truly great. His heroic figure standing on the bridge and commanding is still vivid in my mind.

Attack is the best defense. Attack is the first move in war, and only offense can lead to victory. Look at the current battles in the south. From a strategic point of view, it may be correct to think that Japan is taking a defensive posture. The south is now like pulling back a bow with an arrow nocked, waiting for the enemy to come, so it cannot be said to be a defensive posture. Even speaking of attack, unprepared attacks are meaningless. Engaging in strengthening the war effort as soon as possible is the task of the home front.

Northern Operations

The occupation of the Aleutians was on June 8th. We thought that the United States had also made considerable preparations, but Attu Island and other places were one-sided battles, occupied without bloodshed. At that time, the fog was extremely dense, and there was no clear sea lane, so navigation was indeed extremely difficult, and the landing point was unknown. In this state, we proceeded in the thick fog, using dead reckoning, in a place where nothing could be seen, twenty minutes ahead of the scheduled time. Eighteen minutes before, at a distance of about three thousand meters from the land, we suddenly saw the snowy mountain peaks on the opposite side.

In the dark and foggy night, was this not divine assistance? The gratitude at this moment, stepping on the completely white virgin snow that no one had ever trod on, and the red naval flag fluttering on the snowy mountain peak, will never be forgotten. The work of the gods, recognizing the snowy mountains in the fog. On the snow peak, a majestic flag stood.

After dawn, we saw the situation of the Aleut tribe of the Chichagof Harbor settlement living on Attu Island. When we approached, they fled quickly and nimbly. Later, we heard from their report that the Americans here had notified the mainland via radio that "Japanese soldiers have come." The Aleut tribe numbered about forty, with an American couple managing the politics and everything else here, and they used radio to communicate. The American residence was very luxurious, with considerable cold-proof equipment, heavy oil stoves, phonographs, etc., and was equipped with power generation equipment, so only their house had electric lights.

Compared to this, the existence of the Aleut tribe was truly pitiful. Here, one could also see the Americans' insatiable exploitation. On May 29th of this year, the entire Attu Island garrison was martyred. Kiska was evacuated at the end of July. Because of the evacuation operation of Kiska, we attacked the Aleutians again, which was truly deeply felt. Hearing about the martyrdom of the entire Attu Island garrison in the nearest place, we first firmly made a vow to take revenge. It was the Yamazaki unit transported by our warships. That unit no longer exists, completely destroyed.

The enemy, with a large army, forces the isolated island,
Mountains of corpses and rivers of blood stain the water red.
Soldiers and officers are martyred on the northern sea mountains,
Their loyalty and valor comparable to Masashige Kusunoki of old.

The evacuation of Kiska was an extremely difficult battle. For ten days, the dense fog did not dissipate, and several warships moved in the fog, unable to see each other. Radio communication was naturally impossible. However, there was also divine blessing here, combined with the skills of the soldiers. One of the divine blessings was the density of the fog, making it difficult for the enemy to discover us. The second was that, on a certain day, at the best moment, we saw the sun for an extremely short time, at which point each ship was able to determine its position. The third was that, when approaching the island, we saw a protruding part of the island for about one minute. The captain did not let go of this opportunity, determining the direction in less than a minute. The fourth was that, two days before, the enemy had killed each other and was not in this area.

Finally, we approached the bay. At this time, we saw the entrance to the bay at a distance of about five hundred meters. And the final divine blessing was that, after entering the bay, the bay was inexplicably very clear. The boarding of the evacuation unit was extremely rapid, completed in only half the scheduled time. After the entire force boarded and left the port, it was all dense fog outside. We returned safely in this dense fog. The joy of the evacuation unit, the joy of the welcoming unit, that was truly beyond words. (Xiang: Translated from the December 7th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### Warm Current

— Ge Xin

—— Opening the pen, I face the cold and lonely people, face your letters, face the sounds of begging outside the window, I want to create a crimson smile within an ice flower.

Don't say it, maybe you understand, I hope it is like the crimson of plum blossoms on branches, or like the cheeks of children when ice skating; if this can bring you a pleasant flush like when you are tipsy, then one can exaggerate and say: I even hope this is the "warm current" in your heart.

For a long time, you have been ill; this strange and barren illness; you say you once tried to commit suicide three times. But in the end, the love of life overcame you; you are alive.

My heart was taken aback! Cowardly you, why couldn't three suicides take your life? Stubborn you, struggling against the temptation of death, once! Twice! Three times!

Some people praise death, comparing death to a girl in blue, so gentle, so quiet. Imagine a legend in a poem: at sunset, when the evening breeze is warm and clear, an old missionary in his eighties, watching the sunset's glow, a golden depth; the constant, fine, and broken sound of the waves carries his faraway gaze, satisfied wishes, and a low song: "God dwells with me..."

He quietly fell asleep, a long and eternal sleep.

Some people passionately love death, comparing death to the fiery kapok of the south; the bright red flowers, in the midst of raging storms, cannot stand on the highest branches, like the red cape and red blood of a bullfighter, dying in ferocity. They say that dying in golden armor under the iron hooves of horses is heroic.

—— Yes, I also love that kind of death. If it is death in one's own will, and for freedom, for glory, for a more tenacious life!

Rather than dying like Napoleon on a desolate island, would you not prefer to die like Alexander the Great on a powerful, joyous wedding night? Rather than dying like Maupassant in a desolate mental asylum, would you not rather die like Spencer on the vast and long road of pursuit? But your letter says that your suicide was only for weariness, and the second and third times were still weariness! The loneliness of the time made you feel even more the past heroism and passion. You said: You asked life: Why are you living? The past of emotions proudly told you; the past of childhood told you with maternal love; the past of profession told you with the sacred light of education!......

But you are sick, all hopes and loves have become elusive emptiness. You want to take your life with your own hands! Darkness is like an overturned pool of tears, stealing the shimmering green of your youth: your kind mother trembles in the poverty of the ruined old neighborhood, illness erodes her kind and comforting words, and finally stifles the winter sun for you! —— Becoming a child without a mother. Your proud friends have gone away, taking away the loving voice and the strong support that you loved to hear most.

You are sick and dreaming, dreaming of the cold of your dead mother, dreaming of your drifting brother in despair. In the empty and lonely room, you say you can't wait to dream of being with them forever. You are willing to deeply believe in the Buddhist stories of emptiness and the soul. In the small room, you murmur, questioning time, but what answers you are only the sounds of bamboo leaves under the thin twilight that passes by. So you think of the meaning of life outside the hospital; like an accountant meticulously going through line after line of accounts, you also want to calculate the accounts of people's lives!

Yes, because you feel the gray coldness of this world; how many people drift about aimlessly, how many people quietly and silently disappear; it is as if people are going to the execution ground of "death" like prisoners in a prison van. But the executioners are not all living to their natural old age! But in the end, you can't envy those with full bellies and bloated fat, who are happy...

We all understand the pain of hunger, but what can we say? Aren't there many who are even less worthy of living than us! We are chewing on loneliness. War has destroyed everything and also made everything, and what is painful is only lingering and decline; not only on the earth but also in life. You must pursue your life, be the king, the master, the victor who endures the bitter door; but never commit suicide.

Look, isn't someone begging outside again? The life of the beggar is in the trembling voice, the sound of that life trembling all the way to stiffness; he rests only after creating the unequal sadness in this world.

We are pitiful and small pursuers in this world, whether in spiritual or material poverty, what does it matter if we dream? But it must be a dream of pursuit, always a successful and joyful one. Saneatsu Mushanokōji once said in Mother and Child: —— Travelers travel the road, until death they do not stop!

I know you won't strangle yourself, and you don't even have the money to buy a "Lysol" by your bedside. If you do, you might as well share a little with the beggar, teaching you to see the tenacity of life at that time!

Tighten your belt, face the cold, poverty, loneliness, and neglect, and die in a distant view of hope. In the meantime, fear the old general who will excavate all the filth, ignorance, childishness, and greedy desires of humanity in the world.

Then you will get the joy of the pride of old age in victory! Isn't it?

### The Fate of Books

—

When a child is sick, they need to see a doctor, which is natural, especially a child who is only a few months old! How can they withstand the torture of illness? But seeing a doctor is not easy in this day and age. The high pressure of daily life is already suffocating. Where can one find the money to see a doctor? Without seeing a doctor, one can only resign oneself to fate.

One day, two days passed, but the child's condition did not improve. It seemed necessary to call a doctor. To call a doctor, the first thing to solve was the money problem. Borrow? From where? Pawn? What items? There was no way. One could only search within the house, but the only things that could be found that could be exchanged for some money were some books that "cannot be eaten when hungry and cannot be worn when cold."

After careful consideration, I finally decided on the fate of my few and only spiritual friends—books. I took them and headed towards a used bookstore that I often frequented. On the road, for some reason, my heart began to feel heavy. I felt an indescribable pain that made me unable to bear to look at them again. How could I be willing to abandon the friends who had shared my sorrows and joys for so many years? I had been comforted by them, and I had not forgotten them for a moment, but why was I doing this unjust thing? No! I can't do it. Let's go back! But as soon as I turned my head, the sight of the child groaning in bed seemed to be displayed on a screen before my eyes. Under the assault of this double-layered thought, my body unknowingly approached the used bookstore.

"Hey! Do you want to buy these books?"

"What? Mr. Lin, are you kidding?" the bookseller said, as if in disbelief, because I had always only bought from him, but had never sold to him, so he thought I was there to joke with him; but I was wronged, how could the old owner know my mood at this time? How could I have the leisurely mood to joke with him? I wish I could show him my heart at this moment.

"Really, I'm not kidding with you. Take a look, how much are they worth?" As I said this, I handed him the books. Only then did he believe that I was really there to sell them to him. He took the books and flipped through them one by one, scrutinizing them. After looking them over once, he said to me, "Mr. Lin! I like to be straightforward, and besides, we are old customers, so I don't want to make you suffer. In reality, at this time, people don't have money to buy this kind of leisure book to read, but since you've come, I can't say no. I'll just give you fifteen yuan for them. How about it?" When I heard this, I was extremely angry. I took back the books and, without a word, ran away at once. My heart began to become even more chaotic. I thought that selling these books as waste paper might be worth more than that amount of money. Therefore, I cursed the black-hearted old owner for not treating other people's things as things at all. But I also regretted that I shouldn't have done this kind of thing, to invite unnecessary insults.

Harboring a belly full of resentment, I blindly wandered east and west. Later, I sold them at another bookstore. When I saw him giving me the money, my nerves began to feel numb. What else could this be but my friends' final farewell letter? I stood there dumbfounded, alas! My friends! We are parting forever! I have doomed you in my ruthless palm, but whose fault is it? The pressures of the environment force me to do this kind of thing. Friends, you must understand my predicament, I ask you to forgive me, goodbye, friends! In bleak silence, I left the used bookstore with a depressed heart. (Sponsored by Yishou Scholarship)

### Song of the Campaigner: Mountain Moon at the Frontier Pass

— Lan Yi

The mountain moon weeps in the desolate night,

The craggy bones of the mountains

Endure the erosion of the yellow sand,

The sound of the frontier flute wails.

The mountain moon at the frontier pass wanders sadly,

The wanderer silently travels at night,

Stroking the scarred frontier pass,

Tears of homesickness flow silently.

Bugles sound on the hillside,

Stirring the heartstrings with excited replies,

Even Little White cannot bear it—

Shaking its pure white mane,

It neighs loudly with its head held high.

Treading the path of campaign and return,

Smiles disappear with the tears,

Lying in a corner of the valley,

Amidst the frequent neighing of horses,

I sadly pray to Little White. (Sponsored by Yishou Scholarship)

### Go

— Yan Shi

Ah!

Friend,

Don't think it's sad,

Now is the time to struggle hard,

The environment,

Is a crucible,

It will forge you into a capable

Person,

If you don't believe me,

Listen!

The era is roaring unceasingly!

A large group of people,

Are advancing in cheers,

They

Are treading on the bloodstains of their ancestors,

Pressing forward bravely,

To accomplish a great mission.

Friend!

Don't linger,

Go! Life is a battle.

### Discussion of the Lineup for the International Cup Football Tournament: Goalkeeper Liu Xianhan is More Experienced; There is Ample Talent in the Center Defense; the Forward Line Should be Strengthened

The registration for this year's International Cup Football Tournament has already closed. The participants include teams from China, Russia, Portugal, and Northern Europe. Now, the Yilians team has reorganized and requested to participate. After discussion by the committee, considering that the order has not yet been finalized, permission was granted to accept them, thus increasing the competition to five countries. The competition order has also been arranged by the authorities.

Grand Tournament

The grand tournament is scheduled to begin in mid-January. At that time, this important competition, which has international significance, will cause a sensation in the football world, and the grand occasion is bound to be unprecedented.

Our Chinese team naturally attaches great importance to this competition. Therefore, the authorities have organized a selection committee to carefully consider the selection of players. Eighteen outstanding athletes have been selected as representatives of the Chinese team. There are nine players from the Donghua team: Zhang Banglun, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Tan Fuzhen, Han Longhai, Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Sun Jinshun, and Li Wei. There are also nine players from the Lianyi team: Liu Xianhan, Li Tiansheng, Wu Qixiang, Song Lingsheng, Qu Yongfu, Zheng Yingquan, Xu Wenkui, Li Yichen, and Fei Chunhua. With the insightful views of the committee members, such a selection should not be questioned. Moreover, the regret of overlooked talent is inevitable. According to Football Association journalist Zhou Junyu, there may be a possibility of supplementing the selection with one or two more players later. However, it is difficult for all eighteen or nineteen players to have an opportunity to play in the competition. Although it is to prepare for all eventualities, it has a sense of being excessive. In short, this is an international competition, and I deeply hope that the authorities will be especially careful in deploying the lineup, and even more sincerely hope that each representative will abandon prejudices, wholeheartedly exert themselves, and strive to win glory for the country!

Lineup

It is understood that the deployment of the lineup is roughly as follows, and a trial match is also planned at Yiyuan this afternoon to test it.

Liu Xianhan

Li Ning Wu Qixiang

Qu Yongfu Tan Fuzhen Song Lingsheng

Li Wei Sun Jinshun Dai Linjing Xu Wenkui Jia Youliang

Discussion

As for the goalkeeper position, Liu is more experienced than Zhang Banglun, so Zhang should be replaced with Liu. As for defender Li Ning, he has revived his youth this year. Apart from being a bit slower, he has regained his style of the past, so there should be no problems. As for the right-back position, according to each match's performance, Wu Qixiang has stood alone, being fierce and extraordinary, so there is no one else who can replace him. It is vaguely heard that Wu may be tied down by family affairs. If so, then I think Zhang Linggen could be supplemented to fill this vacancy, because Zhuang Youren and Li Tiansheng do have the demeanor of old generals, but they have both been in decline lately, so they are not as strong as Zhang Linggen's bold and decisive style, which can be competent. What do you think? There are abundant talents in the center defense line. Han Longhai, Zheng Yingquan, and Qu Yongfu each have their own characteristics, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Replacing this one or replacing that one does not pose a major problem. As for the forward line, the discussion is about the right inside forward and left winger. Looking at Xu Wenkui's recent situation, his strength has not been seen to be sufficient, and his footwork is also deficient. Xu's strength is indeed insufficient, while Li does not seem to be lacking in laziness, and has also been away from this position for a long time, appearing very stiff, so I hope that Xu can take care of himself more, and Li can practice a few more times. Then both Li and Xu are materials worthy of the above praise, and both can exert their power. It is also not a good strategy to fail to take advantage of both. Then there is no choice. In my opinion, only Li Wei is competent, without hesitation. Fortunately, Li and old Sun have a path of communication, or they may have a surprising performance. In short, Li is a material who knows how to improve, and he progresses more and regresses less in each game, so he should be entrusted with heavy responsibilities!

### Trial Match with the Yilians Team Today

This afternoon at 3:30, a trial match will be held at Yiyuan against the Yilians team. The style of the Yilians army is deeply imprinted in the minds of ordinary fans, especially the excellence of their goalkeeper, which is amazing. Although they have been absent from the field for a long time, they have recently practiced hard to restore their former heroic posture. Their lineup is roughly the same as before. The new center forward has never shown his face in Shanghai before, and is naturally capable of good reviews, so today's game is a trial before the official competition for both sides, and neither side will dare to relax a step, striving to exert their best skills to the fullest, which is truly a treat for the fans.

### Sights and Sounds from the Sports Field

The teams participating in the Mayor's Cup this time include the seven strongest teams in Group A: Donghua, Lianyi, Portuguese Business, Jewish, Police #1, Three Provinces, and Overseas Chinese Federation, all of whom are out in full force. The remaining teams are the strong teams in Group B: Huatong, Russian Police, Soviet, Hequn, and Soviet Shell six teams, and Nie Zhongcheng and Youlian from Group C. The relative strengths of these teams can be seen at a glance. The future competition will often be among a few teams from Group A. The Portuguese Business and Overseas Chinese Federation have refreshed their lineups, posing a serious threat to Donghua and Lianyi.

Nie Zhongcheng lost to Portuguese Business by eleven goals. People said that losing by less than a dozen goals wasn't much. However, the team's goalkeeper performed well. Although he conceded eleven goals, he saved more than two dozen shots.

Tan Yongzhan, the forward of the Huaying basketball Group B team, is a former Fudan volleyball star who attended the Far Eastern Games. His basketball style also has the style of playing volleyball: quick release and unmatched speed.

Zhang Jiapei, a female basketball and volleyball star, married Mr. Xu. She already has a child this year. Last week, she also appeared at Xiqing, completely in the style of a young mistress, without the heroic spirit of her days on the court.

It is said that Wu Qixiang may have difficulty attending recent games due to family affairs, which would be a small loss for the Chinese team.

Zhongbei withdrew from Xiqing and joined Zhongqing, determined to win. However, with Li Zhenzhong's foot injury still not recovered, it may be difficult to achieve their wish.

Zheng Yingquan, a famous player from the Hong Kong-based Lianyi team, is following in the footsteps of Song Lingsheng with the news of his formal engagement, which is quite interesting.

Li Yao smokes very heavily, his fingers are very yellow. The reporter hopes he can smoke less!

Liu Hesheng's baldness is more pronounced, and his voice is even louder when he referees on the field, which shows a glimpse of his state of mind.

Miss Yu, who must be present at every Xiqing game, always brings knitting and works while watching, which attracts much attention. (Our reporter)

### Simple Fitness Training Method (10) (1)

— By Tom, translated from German

Twenty-six. Muscles of the Forearm

Exercise 1

To develop the muscles of the forearm, there are two special movements.

With both arms at your side, clench your fists tightly, then quickly release and extend your fingers as much as possible. Continue to open and close your hands quickly and forcefully, keeping your arms as still as possible.

Close and open the hands of the forearm (ten times each). Note: For individual special practice, open and close the hands 25 to 50 times each.

Exercise 2

Extend both arms horizontally to the left and right, clench your fists, palms down. Forcefully lower, bend, and rotate your hands, then raise them as high as possible. This up-and-down movement should only occur at the wrist joint, keeping the arms still.

Note: Although this exercise can be done without equipment, it is best to hold a light object in your hands, such as a dumbbell. If you don't use dumbbells, the Warman Grip Exerciser is the best choice, costing only a few cents per pair. All kinds of exercises that use dumbbells can be replaced with this.

Forearm horizontally extended left and right; down, up (ten times each).

Note: Stretch the muscles as much as possible. After ten times down and ten times up, you will feel the muscles of your forearm engorged with blood. Special practice should not be less than twenty-five times.
