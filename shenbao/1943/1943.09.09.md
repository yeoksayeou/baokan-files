### Reflections on Eight Months of War Participation

On January 9th of this year, the National Government issued a proclamation declaring war on Great Britain and the United States. Since then, the ninth day of each month has been designated as a War Participation Memorial Day. To elevate the spirit of resistance against the enemy and to awaken public awareness, the proclamation of war participation is repeatedly published in various newspapers on each memorial day. Today is the ninth time we have seen this proclamation, meaning that it has been a full eight months since the declaration of war. The war declaration solemnly stated: "From this day forward, we are at war with Great Britain and the United States. We shall exert all our strength, cooperate with our friendly nation of Japan, sweep away the brutality of Great Britain and the United States, and strive for China's revival and the liberation of East Asia." If everyone can truly read this proclamation each time, then these words will surely be engraved in their hearts and will not be ignored!

In our ideal scenario, after participating in the war, especially after eight months, the general situation in the country should be able to achieve the following points:

The people's livelihood should gradually become rationalized, and everyone should live a frugal life at an average standard through saving and consumption. In other words, everyone should endure hardship to get enough to eat and do their best in their respective positions for wartime policies. There should be no talk of material enjoyment, because excessive enjoyment is consumption, and the meaning of wartime life fundamentally prohibits consumption and allows for no enjoyment.

The wartime economy should gradually become production-oriented. In both industry and agriculture, anything needed for the war or related to people's livelihood should focus on increasing production. The quantity of production must increase compared to pre-war levels to meet the needs of the war.

Wartime politics should gradually become efficient. All administrative measures should absolutely not emphasize superficial embellishments or official formalities but should focus on substantial results. At the same time, the political system should gradually adapt to the simplification of wartime, eliminating redundant layers and complex phenomena. To achieve the practical effect of people automatically cooperating in the war, the establishment of institutions for expressing public opinion should be promoted and realized under the supervision of the government.

Wartime culture should gradually become widespread. To enable the general public to understand the meaning of the war, the importance of victory, how to contribute their strength, and how to cooperate with friendly nations, cultural propaganda is undoubtedly a powerful tool to penetrate the people. It must be widely disseminated and its seeds widely planted.

The above four points are merely the most important aspects. If these four points can gradually reach the ideal state, we believe that we will have a better grasp of striving for victory. That is, we will have a better grasp of realizing the "cooperation with our friendly nation of Japan, sweeping away the brutality of Great Britain and the United States, and striving for China's revival and the liberation of East Asia" in the war declaration. However, to put it more positively, since we have already participated in the war, victory is the guarantee of national survival, and it must be absolutely striven for. Anything that is conducive to grasping victory must be absolutely achieved. Under this judgment, the four points mentioned above must become facts and are by no means mere ideals.

However, today is already eight months after participating in the war. Eight months is not a short time. Let us calmly, thoroughly, and realistically examine and reflect on the facts of all aspects today and how much distance there still is from our "ideals." We really do not want to be nitpicking or deliberately fault-finding; however, we also do not want to gloss over the facts or sing empty praises. Therefore, we are willing to adopt an impartial attitude and make an objective analysis as follows:

The people's livelihood has still not gradually become rationalized, and the sharp opposition between hardship and joy remains. Because of the continuous rise in grain and commodity prices, the lives of the poor masses are becoming increasingly unsustainable. They are frowning all day long, struggling with oil, salt, firewood, and rice. On the other hand, the lives of the "wealthy" class are becoming increasingly luxurious and extravagant. The cost of a single banquet can reach tens of thousands of dollars without hesitation, which is truly shocking. Meanwhile, hotels, theaters, and entertainment dens are brightly lit, bustling with people, and fully booked, making hundreds of times the profit. The poor are struggling to figure out how to get enough to eat, while the wealthy are indulging in figuring out how to enjoy themselves to the fullest. Although the suffering and joy are different, those who are indifferent to the victory of the war are no different. The more uneven the living conditions, the weaker the concept of war victory.

The wartime economy has not only failed to increase production but has even shrunk production. The decline in industrial production in Shanghai alone is particularly evident. Those with capital are even more eager to pursue speculative profits, creating a distorted economic situation of skyrocketing prices. Since the government issued the order to purchase yarn and cloth, the severe fluctuations in the economic sector are sufficient to prove the arrogance of all previous speculation and hoarding. The more intensely private interests are pursued, the thinner the concept of social public interest. It is truly difficult to expect them to contribute everything to the war.

Wartime politics has not yet shown any effective performance. Although the political system has been adjusted, substantive efficiency has not been achieved in the end. The main reason is often that there is still a gap with the interests of the people. Therefore, as long as the people do not have the opportunity to participate in politics, public opinion cannot be effectively expressed, and there is still a gap between government measures and public opinion.

Wartime culture has not been promoted universally and remains stagnant and depressed. Spiritual food and material food are equally important. Looking back at the publishing industry in the Japanese cultural sector, it is as widespread and developed as before the war, and paper is still sold for five yuan per ream. The government also fully allocates resources to the publishing industry. Comparing this to Shanghai, where the black market price of paper per ream has risen more than 500 times compared to before the war, the difference is truly vast and staggering. As a result, Shanghai, which has always been the center of publishing in the country, publishes less than five books per month. The pitiful situation is disheartening to talk about. In this situation, the lives of writers are exceptionally difficult, and the lack of thoughtful creation is inevitable. It is truly going in the opposite direction to promote the meaning of the war and raise public awareness.

We believe that the only major possible contribution that China can make to the war is materials. However, obtaining materials depends first on stabilizing the people's livelihood, and then striving to increase production to increase materials. If the people's livelihood cannot be stabilized and production shrinks, materials will inevitably be scarce. How can we talk about cooperating in the war? If this situation cannot be improved urgently, it will not only fail to cooperate in the war but will also increase the wartime responsibilities of friendly nations. As for how to improve the current situation, the only step is to start with improving politics. When politics is on the right track, all aspects of people's livelihood, as well as the economy and culture, can develop normally. People's livelihood will be stabilized from then on, increased production will be realized from then on, and the victory of the war will be achieved from then on. We take this War Participation Memorial Day to state our views and dare to ask both the government and the public to reflect on this.

### National Government Declaration of War

At the beginning of the Great East Asia War on December 8th of the previous year, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with our friendly nation, Japan. Since then, it has begun the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding security and improving people's livelihood, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Great East Asia War. However, countries such as Great Britain and the United States continue to pursue their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and are intensifying their efforts, colluding with the Chongqing faction, participating in the so-called British and American war effort, and sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill each other. Recently, because their forces have been successively defeated by the Japanese army and air force of our friendly nation, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost, they are resorting to even more cunning schemes. Moreover, they are jealous of the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the National Government, and they are constantly inciting the Chongqing faction to harass us in order to obstruct the progress of various construction projects. They are even using their own aircraft, using Chongqing as a base, to carry out indiscriminate bombing in our areas of Wuhan and Guangzhou, harming civilians. The members of the Chongqing faction willingly submit to the dictates of Great Britain and the United States, acting as traitors to East Asia, which is truly shameful. Great Britain and the United States have been plotting against East Asia, using every means to sow discord and division in order to achieve their ultimate goal of annexation, which is what the nations of East Asia should unite against. The National Government hereby declares that from this day forward, we are at war with Great Britain and the United States. We shall exert all our strength, cooperate with our friendly nation of Japan, sweep away the brutality of Great Britain and the United States, and strive for China's revival and the liberation of East Asia. The nations of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations. They are particularly united in their commitment to East Asian co-prosperity. In the future, we should strengthen cooperation to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. Our friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been fighting against the forces of Great Britain and the United States in the West for many years and have repeatedly achieved glorious victories. Our country is now joining the Great East Asia War and will coordinate with them to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All of our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the National Father's Great Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of universal peace and justice all depend on this. We must be of one mind and one heart, working hard from beginning to end, to fulfill the great mission of this great era!

January 9, Year 32 of the Republic of China
Chairman Wang Zhaoming

### Two Train Derailments in the United States: Hundreds of Casualties, Suspected of Sabotage

Buenos Aires, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from New York, the "Congressional Limited," a special express train from Washington to New York, derailed near Philadelphia on the night of the 6th, resulting in hundreds of casualties. In less than ten hours, the "20th Century Limited," a special express train on the New York Central Railroad's connecting line between Chicago and New York, also derailed, resulting in a large number of casualties. The simultaneous occurrence of accidents on the two major railway trunk lines in the United States, centered on New York, seems to have caused a major obstacle to wartime transportation. Although the cause of the above two accidents is still unknown, it seems to be a planned act of sabotage. In particular, the engine of the "20th Century Limited" seemed to have exploded after hitting an animal. The Federal Attorney General's Office in Washington has begun a rigorous investigation.

### German Troops on the Eastern Southern Front Adopt Mobile Warfare Strategy and Withdraw from Stalino According to Plan

In order to implement a mobile warfare strategy, German troops have withdrawn from the city of Stalino according to a pre-determined plan to shorten the front lines. Before the withdrawal, all military equipment was destroyed. Disregarding heavy losses, enemy forces vigorously attacked German positions in the Kharkov area but were repelled. The enemy launched strong localized offensives at multiple points in the central sector, all of which were repelled after intense fighting. There were no major battles in other sectors of the Eastern Front. Enemy forces continued to launch localized offensives against the bridgehead on the Kompaneevka River, with effective support from German aircraft and troops.

Berlin, August 8th, Central News Agency - According to a military correspondent from Huitong News Agency: "The defensive battles on the southern sector of the Eastern Front are intensifying. Soviet forces have deployed fresh troops to join the battle, while German troops continue to employ elastic defense tactics, abandoning more territory in the Donets Basin. The German retreat is ongoing, with German rear guards suppressing the pursuing Soviet forces and inflicting considerable losses. The Soviet advance from Izyum towards the Dnieper River has been halted. Southwest of Kharkov, Soviet forces continue to advance towards Krasnograd, encountering strong German resistance. The Soviet advance east of Poltava has also been unsuccessful. Soviet pressure west of Glukhov and near Konotop is very strong. The enemy's vanguard has reached the northeastern outskirts of Konotop, and fighting is still ongoing. The enemy has resumed its offensive south of Bryansk, but the Soviet attempt to encircle the city from the north has stalled. The situation east of Kirovograd and Smolensk remains unchanged. Localized Soviet offensives have been repelled."

### Mountbatten Busy Preparing to Take Office

Lisbon, August 8th, Central News Agency - According to reports from London, the newly appointed Supreme Commander of the Anti-Axis Forces in Southeast Asia, Lord Mountbatten, is currently very active in London, spending most of his time preparing to take office. It is reported that he had lunch yesterday with former Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and Indian Secretary Amery, and later met with the Ambassador of the Republic of China to Britain, Gu Weijun, and the new Viceroy of India, Field Marshal Wavell. London military circles believe that Mountbatten is currently a lieutenant general, but due to the importance of his new appointment, he may be promoted to full general despite being only 43 years old.

German Experts Discuss the Indian Ocean Situation

Berlin, August 8th, Central News Agency - In his paper speculating on whether the Indian Ocean will become a focal point of the war, Dr. Hafecht stated: "The appointment of General Mountbatten as the supreme commander of the Anglo-American forces in East Asia is a result of the Quebec Conference. This action is an admission by the Anti-Axis powers of their failure in the war against Japan. President Roosevelt decided to take decisive action against Japan due to pressure from domestic political circumstances. In 1940, President Roosevelt deceived the American public by saying that providing material assistance to Britain would preserve the United States itself. By underestimating the strength of the Japanese military, the United States was suddenly attacked at Pearl Harbor, and the United States focused its strength on Europe while neglecting the defense of the Pacific. At the Quebec Conference, President Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Churchill to bear a greater burden of the war in the Pacific than Britain had previously contributed. This proves that the United States cannot independently decide the war in East Asia, but it is not yet clear whether General Stilwell and General MacArthur are under his command and what Mountbatten's operational responsibilities are. As a result of the development of the Mediterranean war, the British Navy has increased its freedom of action in Southeast Asia. The British Navy was bound to the Mediterranean region, but after the conquest of Tunisia and Sicily, the danger of the situation has decreased, so Britain can redeploy its forces and send reinforcements to the Indian Ocean. For this reason, the focus of the world war will now shift to the gateway of India, which is not unexpected. Europe may not be very interested in the future developments in Southeast Asia, but the events that occur there will affect Europe, just as European events can affect the Greater East Asia War."

### Egypt and the Soviet Union Establish Diplomatic Relations

### Italy Replaces Ambassador to Germany; Ambassador to Turkey Takes Office

Laval Meets with Japanese Ambassador

Vichy, August 8th, Central News Agency - French Head of Government Laval met with Japanese Ambassador Takanobu Mitani today for a long discussion. Laval also listened to a report from the French Minister to Portugal, Monnier, who arrived here yesterday.

### Anglo-American Air Raids on Germany Suffer Heavy Losses; Up to Seventy Aircraft Lost in One Day

Berlin, August 8th, Central News Agency - The U.S. Air Force bombed Stuttgart on the morning of the 6th. The British Air Force then bombed Munich on the night of the 6th. According to German authorities, German forces shot down 51 U.S. bombers over Stuttgart and 15 British bombers over Munich. In addition, six bombers crashed within Swiss territory or were forced to land due to mechanical failures. Therefore, the Anti-Axis forces lost about 72 heavy bombers and 700 crew members in the bombing on that day. In general, each Anti-Axis air raid uses 200 to 300 heavy bombers, so if 500 are used day and night, the damage is over 15%. German authorities also claim that the losses suffered by the U.S. Air Force during bombing raids on German soil are gradually increasing. 30 heavy bombers were lost in the bombing of Hanover and Hamburg on July 26, 35 were lost in the bombing of Kassel on July 28, 52 were lost in the bombing of Romanian oilfields on August 1, and another 15 crashed in neutral countries. 37 were lost in the bombing of Ploesti on August 12.

### A Review of Germany's Domestic and International Situation on the Fourth Anniversary of the European War

Since the flames of war in Europe were ignited in a corner of Poland (the city of Danzig), today marks the fourth anniversary. During this period, the characteristic that dominated the European war situation was the initial and most urgent fact for the Axis powers since the start of the war: the Soviet Union launching its first summer offensive on the Eastern Front. The war situation undoubtedly encountered a major turning point. The Mediterranean front was also under threat. In Western Europe, the opportunity to open a second front, at the fervent request of the Soviet Union, suddenly became more promising. This urgent situation surrounding the fortress of Europe can indeed be described as Germany's "lack of vigor" compared to this time last year. However, when examining the essence and accurately grasping future trends, although the German army retreated somewhat due to the Red Army's first summer offensive, the impression given in concept was rather exaggerated. When examining the facts in detail, no "astonishing changes" occurred.

The Springboard for the Great Offensive

Compared to the beginning of this year, the current state of German-Soviet confrontation only shows that about one-thirtieth of the total area, including Orel, Kharkov, and their vicinity in the central region, has been recovered by the Soviet army. Moreover, this retreat in the central region is also due to the necessity of a new operational strategy called "bleeding tactics," which is of course inferior to last year's large-scale "territory-grabbing offensive." So how will the German army cope with the Eastern Front in the future? What medicine is Germany selling in the gourd? People are quite suspicious. The Klauswitz report stated: "Defenders must change to offensive tactics depending on the situation, but offensive forces cannot simply switch to defensive tactics." The German army's "bleeding tactics" are precisely to anticipate the occurrence of several frontal battles, to establish a long-term, undefeated posture aimed at defending the European continent, and to prevent the Soviet Union from launching a winter offensive. The German counteroffensive is of course planned to be implemented immediately after the current retreat.

The above-mentioned operational methods are now progressing very effectively. The Soviet army only broke through 50 kilometers west of Orel and Kharkov, but the price paid was the loss of 160 tank brigades and 1.6 million soldiers. Therefore, the current retreat is being viewed by the German army as a valuable "springboard." So although the German army is said to be "declining," it is still maintaining a confrontation line of more than 2,000 kilometers, penetrating more than 1,000 kilometers from its own territory into enemy territory. Therefore, it is difficult to judge the overall gains and losses based on a local battle.

European Defense is Impenetrable

Next, let's talk about the European landing operation that the British and Americans are calling for. After occupying Sicily, the Anti-Axis powers are now eyeing the Italian mainland with great interest. As the Soviet Union pointed out, if the British and Americans attempt to invade the European continent, they will have to fight the German army to the death. However, according to the various situations and intelligence of the month, the British and Americans seem to have no determination to go all-in. The British and Americans boasted that after the end of the North African War, they could save millions of tons of ships on the roundabout Cape Town route, but even in the Battle of Sicily, it took half a year of preparation. Even if a landing on the Italian mainland were to succeed temporarily, the Axis front would ultimately not be shaken.

Relying on the majority, the British and Americans have already spent five weeks occupying Sicily, and the losses suffered by the British and Americans during this period are countless. In short, the German army, whether for the Eastern Front, the Southern Front, or other fronts that may be opened in the future, will take a passive operational approach, that is, defensive tactics, in order to accumulate combat power. This is already discernible now.

In order to accumulate combat power, the air force is also willing to endure the terror bombing of the British and Americans and grit its teeth and endure with the people. Once this suppressed emotion erupts due to the accumulated combat power, the European war situation will have a clear development. The above-mentioned view of the war situation has become the foundation of the German national spirit, which has suffered all kinds of hardships.

The Domestic Situation is Also Complete

In the past four years, the degree of hardship in various aspects of German national life has increased year by year. Especially since this year, as a result of the implementation of the general citizen mobilization plan, about 60% of the shops in Berlin, which have no practical connection with the war, have been closed. In view of the situation of the Hamburg air raids, it is planned to evacuate one million citizens from Berlin, and the color of the decisive battle seems to be becoming more thorough.

### Fierce Rearguard Action in the Mountainous Areas of Southern Italy; British Troops Land in Ufemia

Berlin, August 8th, Central News Agency - The German Führer's Headquarters announced at noon on the 8th: "Anti-Axis forces landed in Ufemia in Calabria, southern Italy, on the night of the 7th. Since dawn on the 8th, Axis forces have been fiercely attacking the landing forces."

Berlin, August 8th, Central News Agency - The British Eighth Army under Montgomery has made no progress since occupying the ancient city of Palmero in Calabria. The troops attempting to attack north of the city were ambushed by German troops, suffering heavy losses and retreating. On the central front, the troops attempting to advance to Garigliano were blocked by the steep mountainous terrain and seem unable to advance. The British advance on the southern front is also very slow. German authorities believe that the Anti-Axis operation against Calabria is merely a diversionary operation to open up landings in other areas.

Berlin, August 8th, Central News Agency - The German New Open Press special correspondent for the Mediterranean region, Börner, stated: "Near Gidsatauro on the coastal road leading northeast from Reggio, British troops fought with the German rearguard for several hours, suffering heavy losses. The British troops suffered heavy losses because they failed to break through the German defensive artillery line, so they continued to advance slowly, trying to avoid contact with the German-Italian rearguard. Enemy troops continue to land in Sperlonga, seemingly attempting to enter the rear of the German rearguard."

Rome, August 8th, Central News Agency - On the 7th, Italian military sources reported on the landing of the British Eighth Army in Calabria and the progress of subsequent operations as follows: "The Anti-Axis forces, possessing superior weapons, used all naval guns and all land artillery to fiercely attack the Italian artillery line along the southern coast of Calabria, including Villa San Giovanni, Reggio, and Saline. In addition, a large fleet of several battleships opened fire together, and land artillery fire on the coast of Scilla was also quite intense. In addition, a large formation of bombers dropped bombs from the sky, but the Axis forces still resisted valiantly under this situation, inflicting great damage on some of the landing enemy forces. The residents of the combat zone had been moved to safe areas in the rear in advance. The garrison is currently repelling enemy troops landing along the coastline, but due to the excessive Anti-Axis shelling, it had to temporarily retreat. At this time, the Anti-Axis forces used landing craft to continuously land tanks and small and medium-caliber guns, and the Axis forces immediately launched a thorough attack on them, inflicting heavy damage. However, the number of heavy guns and tanks transported by the enemy was very large. Therefore, although the Axis forces launched a brave assault, the enemy finally landed with a large number of heavy guns and tanks in the area from San Giovanni to Sapri. In addition, the Anti-Axis forces used paratroopers to assist the landing forces, but they have already been inflicted with considerable damage by the Axis forces. The war is now being waged within several kilometers of the coastline, but that area is a famous mountainous area, and the Axis forces, resisting from a strategically advantageous position, are very fierce, causing the Anti-Axis advance to be slow."

### Vatican Convenes Episcopal Conference

Vatican City, August 8th, Central News Agency - Secretary of State Maglione paid a visit to the Pope yesterday to report on the deliberations of Monday's Episcopal Conference. This was the second conference since Rome was attacked, discussing the events caused by the war in Italy and Rome and the impact on the Vatican.

### The Air Raid on Hamburg Cost More Than $300 Million

Stockholm, August 8th, Central News Agency - The New York dispatch published in the Stockholm Evening News stated: "U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently revealed that the Anti-Axis raid on Hamburg cost $346,000,000."

### Italy Orders the Dissolution of the Reserve Officers' Corps

Rome, August 8th, Central News Agency - The commander of the military district, General Tumelin, yesterday ordered the dissolution of the Reserve Officers' Corps.

Rome, August 8th, Central News Agency - An official announcement yesterday stated: "The Badoglio government issued an order temporarily banning the sending of telegrams abroad when it was formed. This ban has now been lifted."

### Burma Celebrates Independence by Issuing National Construction Bonds

Rangoon, August 8th, Central News Agency - In order to celebrate its independence, the Burmese government has issued National Construction Commemorative Bonds worth one million yuan, which are currently being printed by Japan. A portion of them arrived here on the 7th. The government believes that the public is overjoyed with independence and eager to purchase the bonds, so it has been selling them through exchange vouchers since the 2nd, and will exchange them for formal bonds when they arrive. This is the first time that Burma has issued public bonds.

### Agreements Signed for Loans from Banks to Purchase Grain; Rice and Grain Control Committee May Be Established Within the Month

Shanghai News Agency reporter learned that the relevant authorities in this city, in order to thoroughly stabilize the people's food supply and guarantee their livelihoods, have decided to borrow a large sum of money from banks to purchase and store food, so that the people can be supplied with their normal needs. This matter was negotiated by the relevant authorities in a certain district and a major bank, and an agreement has been signed. This shows the determination of the local authorities to improve the grain policy with all their efforts. It is also reported that regarding the procurement and distribution of rice and grain, the Materials Control Review Committee has resolved that the matter will be transferred from the Ministry of Food to the National Commercial Control Association, and a Rice and Grain Control Committee will be formed under the Commercial Control Association to take charge. This committee is currently being organized, and its office will be located in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce once it is established.

The Later-Established Joint Grain Cooperative Society Will Be Dissolved

The food problem of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai is deeply valued by people from all walks of life. In particular, Shanghai, with millions of people living in non-productive areas, is even more eager for rice and grain from the inland production areas to be transported in to regulate the food supply. Since the Ministry of Food planned to implement the method of controlling the procurement, transportation, and distribution of rice and grain, the distribution of rice to households has not been on time and in sufficient quantity due to various reasons and the imperfect organization of the agencies in charge of rice and grain procurement. In view of this, the authorities, after research by the relevant parties, decided to reorganize the rice and grain control mechanism in order to improve the food needs of the people. It is heard that the National Commercial Control Association drafted the rice and grain control plan and submitted it to the sixth meeting of the Materials Control Review Committee for discussion and approval. Regarding the reorganization of the future rice procurement agency, the National Commercial Control Association will set up a Rice and Grain Control Committee. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was designated by the Executive Yuan as the chairman of the preparation committee. Lin Kanghou, Chen Guangzhong, Zai Ailu, Ji Hua, Chen Ziyi, Yang Heqing, He Quansheng, Yan Ji, and Luo Nazhai were appointed as members of the preparation committee. Yuan will convene the members to hold the first preparatory meeting within the next few days to discuss the preparatory steps, formulate organizational rules, and solve problems such as rice procurement, transportation, and distribution. It can be organized and established by the end of this month at the latest. As for the rice and grain joint cooperative societies in the Shanghai area and other areas, they will be dissolved when the Rice and Grain Control Committee is announced, and all business operations will be transferred to the committee for management.

Rice Ration Must Be Brought Back on Track

The current borrowing of rice from the Chinese Rice Distribution Association by the Economic Department of the First District Office in this month's rice ration is a temporary expedient, so the quantity is also less than during the normal ration period (two sheng per period before July). Therefore, this situation cannot be allowed to continue and must be brought back on track as soon as possible. The new rice and grain operation agency has a necessary urgency to catch up with the procurement and transportation of rice and grain. According to a Datong News Agency report, Yang Heqing, one of the members announced in the list of members of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, expressed his rejection of the position yesterday. However, the citizens pay close attention to the food organization and cannot afford to hesitate.

It is also reported that the sales of rice for the 21st period to households in the first and second districts of the fourth district of this city have been stopped a few days ago. The 22nd period of rice for households, totaling 2,150 bags (brown rice), has also been processed and shipped by the Joint Cooperative Office of the district. It could have been distributed immediately, but the rice purchase certificates for this time were only issued by the office to the first and second district offices for transfer to each Lianbao and each household starting yesterday (the 8th), so the procedures may be delayed for a few days. Generally, it can be sold around this Friday (the 10th).

### Hand-Woven Native Cloth Is Not Controlled; Tax-Free Transportation Is Still Permitted; Apply for a License from Local Tax Bureaus

Since the government authorities have taken control and purchase of cotton cloth, it is no longer allowed to be transported to other ports. However, hand-woven native cloth is not within the scope of control, so it can still be freely transported and sold. However, a "Tax-Free Transportation License" must be applied for from the local tax bureaus of the Ministry of Finance during transportation. As for hand-woven native cloth, it must meet the following conditions: completely woven with manpower and wooden looms; the warp and weft yarns must not exceed 20 counts of single-strand yarn, and it must not be refined, polished, or powdered. As for the license application procedure, an application form must first be filled out and sent to the local native cloth industry or silk cloth industry association for stamping and certification. After verification by the local tax bureau of the Ministry of Finance, it can be filled out and issued. The "Tax-Free Standards and License Issuance Procedures for Hand-Woven Native Cloth" are recorded below:

Tax-Free Standards and License Issuance Procedures

Hand-woven native cloth is also a direct woven product of cotton yarn, but this native cloth should be limited to those completely woven with wooden looms and driven by manpower. The following six standards for native cloth are hereby stipulated: A.

When native cloth transporting and selling merchants report the transportation of native cloth, they should first obtain a certificate from the local cloth shop or silk and satin industry association, that is, the native cloth transportation license application meeting, and submit it to the association for stamping and certification, and then submit it to the local tax authorities to fill out and issue the native cloth transportation license. Filling out and issuing native cloth transportation licenses is purely for the purpose of maintaining the livelihood of the poor, and no taxes will be collected. All seven cloth transportation licenses may not apply for tax refunds. The native cloth transportation license shall be transported with the goods. If it needs to be transferred or distributed, a native cloth transportation license shall be applied for from the local tax authority based on the original transportation license.

### Shanghai's First Hospital Run by a Woman: A Visit to the Ximenwai Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics Hospital

Dedicated Treatment of Obstetrics, Gynecology, Pediatrics and Other Departments; Complete Modern Mechanical Medical Equipment

The red bus takes you to Foshuli Road and walk south along Delas Road for about 200 meters. In front of you is the always quiet Xujiahui Road. The large area of ​​lush green gardens north of Huajiabang occasionally has a fresh and beautiful breeze, which sweeps away people's worldly thoughts. Looking to the right, you can see white Western-style buildings, as if they were specially embedded in the strange sky and white clouds, how beautiful! The plaque on the iron gate tells you that this is the first hospital in Shanghai run by a woman and especially focusing on saving the poor and sick: "Ximenwai Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics Hospital"

From the Red House to the White House

Ximenwai Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics Hospital, commonly known as the "Red House Hospital", was established nearly 60 years ago. It was founded in 1884 by American doctor Dr. Luo and was located in the Red House on Fangxie Road, Ximen. It was a highly reputable hospital in Shanghai. Later, it was jointly run by enthusiastic believers of the Christian Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, and the Women's Public Association. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, affected by the Shanghai War, they had to tearfully bid farewell to their old residence and moved to this "White House" at 850 Xujiahui Road, which was formerly the Niu Huisheng Orthopedic Hospital, and started operating again. Because the area is relatively remote, in order to continue to relieve the poor and sick, they also rented the old Niu Hui Orthopedic Hospital at 334 Foch Road (at the intersection of Cheng Road) as the "Ximenwai Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics Hospital Clinic Branch", and most of the new and old patients go to the branch for consultation.

In recent years, the general public has suffered from the impact of the current situation and prices, and there are poor and sick people everywhere. However, on the contrary, there are many hospitals or doctors who have been engaged in poverty and sickness relief work, but they have temporarily suspended operations due to various reasons. Therefore, there are countless people in the market who are unable to seek medical treatment and are waiting to die. The hospital naturally cannot bear to see this, so since May last year, despite the difficulties and disadvantages, they resolutely took over the Columbia Road People's Clinic, which was previously established by foreign doctors, and provided free medical treatment and medicine three times a week, specializing in treating the diseases of the coolies and their families in the nearby shantytowns. Since May this year, she has also taken on the role of voluntary clinic doctor for the Poor Children's Nursery Home once a week. Although their strength is limited and they cannot universally save all the poor and sick in society, they have done their best. As the saying goes, "Give a point of strength, give a point of light," striving to reduce the pain of the general poor compatriots.

Doctors, by nature, take eliminating the pain of patients as their highest goal. Hospitals and charitable organizations, in theory, should not have too much distance. However, in the current unhealthy society, we cannot expect every doctor and hospital to understand the great righteousness and sacrifice to serve. Often, those who are too seriously ill to be cured are rejected. One can imagine the suffering of the patient's family. Ximen Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics Hospital is particularly vigilant about this. As long as there is a breath of life left, except for infectious diseases that are transferred to infectious disease hospitals, all others are not rejected, and they try their best to save them. Often, they recapture life, and they are unspeakably happy. According to the hospital director, about 1,600 patients are hospitalized each year, and 16,600 patients are treated as outpatients. The mortality rate of patients in the hospital is extremely low. In the recent two-year records, including those who died before they could be treated, the mortality rate in the 31st year was 2.9%, and in the 32nd year it was 2.1%.

A Glimpse of the Women's Ward

Walking into the gate of Ximen Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics Hospital, you are greeted by a piece of land with lush impatiens swaying in the morning light, full of vitality. Although it was still early, the staff of the outpatient department were already preparing for their daily diagnosis and treatment work. The waiting room is not very big, but it is very clean and refreshing, like a rest room in a garden. It is said that not only do they not charge consultation fees for general poor patients, but they also often give them medicines, and those with serious illnesses have to be hospitalized.

Inside the outpatient department is the pharmacy. This is different from the simple dispensary in general hospitals. They have relatively complete equipment and have a full-time pharmacist in charge. In addition to the common medicines, they also regularly engage in pharmaceutical manufacturing and pharmaceutical research. There are certain procedures for the allocation of medicines needed by each patient, careful preparation, and careful review. The employees here understand the relationship between their every move and the patient's life.

The wards are divided into grades like ordinary hospitals, but they are divided according to the degree of the patient's illness, and they are not necessarily only based on the amount of fees charged. Some of the third-class wards can accommodate more than ten beds in one room, but they do not seem crowded. Most of the third-class wards only have two beds in one room. Because they are diligent in cleaning, they do not feel the peculiar smell of the hospital, but they have the care encountered in the hospital. Patients in the third class can pay a smaller fee, but the enjoyment is not necessarily worse than the first and second classes. Some people who are really unable to pay the fee can be exempted from payment.

Most of the first and second class wards are upstairs. The characteristic here is the interior. In addition to being scientific, they also pay attention to art. The soft light, the pleasing wall decorations, plus one or two not-too-strong fresh flowers, and the permission for family members to come and accompany them (of course, they have to abide by the hospital's rules). In this way, from the patient's psychology, the pain suffered is reduced. The lighter one leans back and reads a book, and closes his eyes and raises his head for a while, whether he is resting or meditating? The smile beside him inadvertently tells the visitor of his satisfaction with the hospital.

Nevertheless, the focus of the women's and children's hospital's service is still on the third-class ward. There are 147 beds in the whole hospital, but there are only 11 in the first class, and only 45 in the second class, while there are 91 in the third class. They will do their best to treat those who are able to pay the more expensive medical fees, but they will never neglect the poor patients.

A Visit to the Consultation Room

The consultation room seems to be a place that easily evokes people's feelings of pain, but the sincere service spirit and gentle attitude of the doctors and nurses can make up for this lack of feeling.

In the children's ward, there was a chorus of children's cries. Dr. Huang Shuzhen, the attending physician of pediatrics, was treating a patient with dysentery who was already in a dangerous period. After a while, she breathed a sigh of relief and said: Okay, this little life can be saved! Without talking to others, she went to treat another little patient. The sick children in the first-class children's ward were attended by family members, and their emotions were relatively calm. The director proudly praised this young attending physician of pediatrics. After graduating from Shanghai Women's Medical College in 1935, she interned at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and then went to the hospital to work as a pediatrician. Because of her enthusiasm and responsibility, she was "daily governed" and promoted to attending physician of pediatrics last year.

The arrangement and equipment of the gynecological treatment room is still rare in Shanghai. Dr. Wang Shuzhen, the attending physician, graduated from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1925 and has been serving in the hospital since 1926. From 1931 to 1939, she also served as a full-time teacher of gynecology at the Women's Medical College. She carefully explained the equipment and its functions in gynecological treatment. She said that in order to serve patients conscientiously, she can save her own life to the lowest level, but the necessary tools for medical treatment must be as complete as possible.

The delivery room is almost never idle. There are two state-of-the-art delivery beds, accompanied by cribs and other surgical instruments. There are washing rooms and disinfection rooms nearby. The sterilizer is still steaming. The mothers and newborn babies all have special rooms. The mother's room is full of an atmosphere of peace and joy. It is not very bright, but the air is fresh. When the nurse is holding the newborn baby for milk, the mother's pale face shows a grateful and happy smile after the pain.

In a small iron bed, the red baby's face is moving, how lovely! The nurses are busy taking care of them.

### Administrative Yuan Orders Designation of Penal Authority for Illegal Cases of Buying and Selling Yarn and Cloth; Materials Investigation Committee to Be Responsible for Investigation and Arrest

(Central News Agency) The Executive Yuan ordered the National Commercial Control General Association that Articles 3, 6, 7, and 8 of the Provisional Regulations on Buying and Selling Yarn and Cotton Cloth previously promulgated have various restrictions and penalties. The investigation matters have been ordered to the Shanghai Materials Investigation Committee to be responsible for handling. Regarding the enforcement agency for penalties, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has been ordered to designate the Shanghai District Court to handle it in accordance with the law. In addition, regarding the disposal of confiscated goods, the Shanghai Materials Investigation Committee has also been ordered to execute it jointly with the Shanghai District Court and then hand it over to the committee for safekeeping and reporting. After receiving the order, the Commercial Control Association immediately sent a letter to the Cotton Products Industry Association to forward it to all member trade associations to inform all members to comply.

### The Quality of Sugar for the Sixth Term Household Registration Is Quite Humid, Reportedly Due to Excessive Storage Time

The sugar for the sixth term of household registration in this city was not sold previously due to the relationship between the wholesale price. It is now learned that the wholesale price formulated by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative has not been approved by the authorities, and the citizens' demand for sugar is very high, so it has been decided to continue to sell it at the original price. The first and eighth districts have been widely implemented since yesterday, with each person still limited to half a catty, priced at 2.35 yuan. Other districts are scheduled to start selling in mid-September. The sale of sugar for the fifth term in Nanshi will end today. It is found that most of the sugar sold in this term is humid. According to the sugar merchants themselves, the time between the sugar being released from the factory and the date of sale by the retail sugar merchants is as long as 40 days. It happened to be during the hot season, so the sugar melted due to the heat, and some of it was sugar stored more than six months ago, which caused complaints from the outside world.

The Eighth District Cancels the Two-Percent Retail Tax

Residents of the eighth district of this city had to pay a 2% retail tax when buying sugar during the time of the former French Municipal Council. Since this term, the eighth district public office has cancelled it, so residents of the district can no longer pay this two-percent tax in the future. This is also the first time it has been implemented after the takeover of the concession.

Special Sugar Allocation Begins; Commercial Cooperation Department gives special allocation of sugar required for business operations to various industries, which is handled by the Special Sugar Allocation Office of the department. It was shelved previously due to the sugar price issue, but now that the authorities have approved the department's report to calculate it at the original price, this special sugar allocation has also begun. After receiving the notice from the department, companies and firms in various industries should exchange the sugar collection certificate within the time limit and pay the designated sugar firm to pick up the goods at 9.4 yuan per catty, and the 2% retail tax has also been cancelled.

Strict Management of Retail Sugar Shops

The Economic Department of the First District Public Office of Shanghai Special City continues to strictly manage the sale of household registration sugar by the Type A retail sugar shops. Each Type A retail sugar shop must report the quantity of sugar sold in each term in a truthful manner and submit the received sugar purchase certificates for verification by the department to prevent fraud.

There Is No Forced Purchase of Gold Jewelry; Citizens Are Requested Not to Believe Rumors

In recent days, there have been rumors in this city that unscrupulous people are forcing women to sell gold jewelry, which is enough to disturb the public. In order to clarify the truth, this reporter inquired with the police. It is said that "no relevant authorities in this city have sent anyone to buy gold jewelry, which is an illegal excuse. If such incidents occur in the future, it is hoped that the victims will report to the police station or the self-defense organization and hand them over to the police authorities, who will handle them in accordance with the law. It is hoped that citizens will not believe the rumors and suffer losses."

### The City Party Department Schedules to Handle the Handover

Since the Central Committee announced the reorganization of the city party department, the newly appointed director, Yang Yangshan, has come to Shanghai to prepare for the takeover. The department is rushing to complete the handover and is scheduled to handle the handover on September 11, so that the new director can go to take over.

### The Thrift Movement Association Is Recruiting the Second Batch of Members; It Has Never Solicited Donations From the Outside; Citizens Must Not Be Deceived

Since the Shanghai Citizens Thrift Movement Association publicly solicited members from the outside world, because it does not accept membership fees, citizens are very active in applying for membership. The first batch of membership application forms has been taken out. The second batch of membership application forms has been printed and is ready. Citizens who wish to join can go to the Preparatory Office of the association at the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association on the fourth floor, or the Shanghai Press Association at 160 Edward Road. It is also learned that recently, there are unscrupulous people who are falsely claiming to be soliciting thrift funds and defrauding money outside, so please pay extra attention to citizens to avoid being deceived. All expenses of the Shanghai Citizens Thrift Movement Association are borne by the participating groups themselves, and they have never solicited donations from the outside.

The effectiveness of the anti-epidemic this year is rare in history. There has been no discovery of genuine cholera, which is very gratifying. However, the authorities believe that it is now the cool autumn season, and diseases such as dysentery may still be prevalent, so they hope that residents will pay attention to their health.

Comments from the Economic World

### Explanation of "Contribution"

The uneasiness in the business community since the purchase of yarn and cloth is due to insufficient understanding of the matter. We have already said this many times. We should pay attention to the important conversation made by the Japanese ambassador to China the other day, in which there are several sentences that are worth everyone's attention: "The mission and importance of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth depend on how it will be handled in the future. How much contribution this major measure will make to low prices and stable people's livelihood will depend on how China and Japan cooperate in the future."

If we analyze these concise words, it is not difficult to add another layer of understanding to the matter. The mission and importance of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth, as well as purchasing major essential materials other than cotton yarn and cloth, lies in striving towards a common goal of low prices and stable people's livelihood, so as to make a contribution. What is the explanation of the word "contribution"? Broadly speaking, "contribution" means achievement; strictly speaking, contribution means supply and subsidy. How the government supplies what the people need and subsidizes what the people lack is the government's true contribution to the people. As for how much contribution can be made, as Ambassador Gu said, it depends on how China and Japan cooperate.

### The City's Industrial and Commercial Circles Plan to Restore Trade with Nanyang; Hope to Assist in Overcoming Shipping Difficulties

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, traffic between Shanghai and various parts of Nanyang has been interrupted, and various kinds of trade have come to a standstill. Before the incident, the annual trade volume between Shanghai and Nanyang was extremely considerable. Various materials were transported from Nanyang to Shanghai, and its manufactured products were sold well in various parts of Nanyang. Therefore,

Trade Stagnation

has a significant impact on the development of the city's industrial and commercial circles. According to a business magnate in the city's industrial and commercial circles yesterday: In order to normalize the overall economic development of Shanghai, the industrial, commercial, and financial circles of the city have long intended to restore trade with Nanyang. They have gathered with relevant authorities several times in the past, but there is no concrete plan yet. Recently, the industrial and commercial circles believe that this matter.

Cannot Be Delayed

Therefore, they have been working hard in recent days. The most difficult thing at present is that the shipping is very unsmooth. They will make the greatest efforts to request the assistance of the authorities, because if trade with Nanyang is not smooth, the industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai will not be able to

Fully Develop

A few days ago, some factories were forced to stop work because they could not obtain raw materials from abroad, and there are also solid products that cannot be sold well, resulting in a reduction in production quantities. Therefore, they deeply hope that the authorities will fully assist them to overcome this difficulty.

### Large Batch of Matches Awaiting Distribution

However, there were rebounds from small declines, and the brewing state is still temporary. The C-type opened actively, but after sellers dumped, it became weak. Other types had little activity.

Western Medicine: Recently, due to the influence of rumors of control, buyers disappeared, and scattered hoarding frequently led to dumping. Raw material prices and finished products all declined.

Artificial Silk: Transactions were deserted, the industry was calm, and the market remained sluggish. Prices remained at a low point.

Grains: Yesterday, due to rain, vendors were scarce. Prices were called higher at the beginning of the morning, but they weakened again due to sluggish actual sales. There were no major changes in rice reserves and oil prices compared to before.

Interbank Loan Rate: The interbank loan rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 2.3%.

Tea: Actual sales in the street have not progressed, people's hearts continue to be unexcited, and those who hold goods continue to supply, so the market price has not changed much. The whole city's Wuchang Tea Company took in eight boxes of black tea, and at the same time , Tai Tea Shop absorbed more than ten packages of black tea seeds. The above was sold by Yuxing Tea Shop. As for other varieties, no one is still interested, but only the black tea core , Xinya Chemical Plant still has , but they are trying to suppress the price and take advantage of it, and the household, due to cost reasons, is unwilling to be too cheap , so today, only both parties each reduced the price, especially in actual transactions.

Public Life

### Bank Trainee

— Xiao Yi

The general idea is that the job of a banker is a golden rice bowl, both stable and well-paid. So in the winter of 1940, I got the opportunity through a relative's introduction to participate in the trainee examination of a well-known commercial bank. When the admission notice was sent to my house, the whole family was overjoyed, and relatives and friends came to congratulate me, thinking that from then on my career would be stable and I could be free from worry about life.

With a happy heart, I ran into the bank's building in the new year of 1941 and officially started working as a trainee with humility and hard work. Although I felt unfamiliar and ignorant at the time, I had a great interest in everything, holding the belief that as long as I didn't do anything wrong and worked diligently and thriftily, I would be promoted to a bank clerk, promoted to a director, and become a manager in the future, with unlimited hope. I immersed myself in learning what I should do while dreaming of a beautiful future.

The name trainee, as the name implies, is established by the bank itself to cultivate useful talents. Its work should focus on making the trainee understand the bank's business; its salary is of course much lower than that of a bank clerk. Who knew that since I started work last year, I have been assigned to a job and have not been transferred to other departments for practice for two and a half years. At first, I felt that I didn't understand the things in this department, and it was difficult, but after I got familiar with it in a few days, I have been doing it mechanically every day until now. I am already extremely bored with the things I have done. I still don't know anything about other departments. The expectation that I would be able to make achievements as long as I worked hard in the early days has turned into smoke. Prices are rising step by step, and life is becoming more difficult. Many relatives and friends are spending their days with sad faces. Knowing that I work in a big bank, they always say, "You are relaxed! Your life is better than ours." Who would believe that what I earn every month is less than the income of a rickshaw puller! A bank clerk in a national bank and a few very few commercial banks can easily have an income of about 2,000. In our bank, a bank clerk's salary and benefits together are less than 1,000 yuan. We trainees only have a subsidy of 400 yuan per month. The regular salary was 16 yuan after the three-month probationary period from the year before last until now, and it has not increased. Who would believe that a person who sits in a magnificent bank building and handles millions of dollars every day cannot eat enough porridge at home because they cannot afford oil and eat boiled vegetables, and do not use soap for washing because soap is expensive!

Rickshaw pullers can wear torn clothes and eat coarse food, but a trainee cannot wear shorts and go to work barefoot. They usually work with bank clerks, and they cannot not socialize when others have weddings and funerals. The tea servant follows behind and calls them "Mr." During the New Year and holidays, they cannot not spend money because they are trainees. "The rice bowl of the banking industry is golden." This sentence was probably accurate in another era. Now, the rice bowl of the banking industry is like the northwest wind, the more you drink it, the colder it gets, and the more you eat it, the hungrier you get.

Factories use child labor and female workers, not to extensively cultivate technical talents in addition to male workers, but so that the bosses can save some wages. Banks use trainees, nominally to cultivate banking talents. In fact, it is also to save a sum of money. Our daily work is no different from that of bank clerks, and our responsibilities are of course the same as those of bank clerks. One-third of the trainees in the entire bank are doing the work of clerks, which is very obvious.

The bank where I work is not a small bank, and of course there are many people like me and even worse than us. I am not only appealing for the treatment of trainees, but if this continues, the entire banking industry will be bleak.

### Fourth Anniversary of the European War: Review of Germany's Internal and External Situation

(Continued from page 2) Minimum clothing and housing

Following this, the food ration coupons, since August 23. The 53rd coupon has been used. To this point, the ration allocation has changed as follows. The main food, meat, the first distribution was 500 grams per person per week, since March of this year. Reduced to 250 grams, only half of what it was at the beginning of the war. According to Goering's statement at the beginning of the war, bread was not to be restricted, but by October 1939, the regulation was 2,500 grams per week, and since 1941, it has been 2,000 grams per week. Since March of this year, to compensate for the reduction in meat, an additional 250 grams were added. Half oil has increased by 125 grams compared to the beginning of the war, for a total of 500 grams, and has remained unchanged to this day.

Margarine has been reduced to half of what it was at the beginning, and lard cannot be obtained now, so the overall amount of fats and oils has inevitably decreased slightly. However, cheese has increased by 125 grams since March, about twice what it was in 1939, and the fat nutrition of the people has been maintained. Potatoes, which Germans regard as rice, have adopted a pre-order system until the third year of the war. Since 1942, a coupon system has also been adopted, with about 3,500 grams allocated per week. A large amount is actually used for manufacturing sweets, and has been greatly reduced. From January to August of this year, adults were rationed 10 pounds and children 20 pounds. In 1939, sugar was rationed at 1,000 grams every three weeks, and is now 900 grams.

Secondly, regarding clothing, in the first two months of the war, for major clothing items, a purchase permit was required, becoming a fractional system. Recently, due to the intensification of aerial warfare, the use of clothing coupons by adults has been suspended, and purchase permits are only issued to those who have suffered in air raids. Clothing manufacturers have also been ordered to specialize in the needs of these victims.

Third, the changes in housing have been dramatically revealed due to the bombing of major cities as this year enters the decisive period. Since the housing control in the spring of this year, emergency measures such as the "New Regulations on the Supply of Housing to Victims" have been re-implemented since the beginning of June. New relatives and friends living together, people in the city borrowing houses in the countryside, and the construction of houses on roofs and underground are all increasing. Searching for air raid shelters has become a new lesson. In terms of entertainment, it was resolutely liquidated due to the long-term and intensified war, with the Battle of Stalingrad as the . Rental cars in transportation agencies, except for patients, are restricted from passengers under the strict control of the police. All unnecessary things are sacrificed to complete the war. In terms of domestic affairs, after the new Minister of Internal Affairs Himmler took office and took control of public security, the lives of the people became more and more pressing.

The transition of economic life

Anglo-American bombing cannot decisively destroy Sheng Longli, but with the prolongation of the war against the Soviet Union, the increasingly serious wartime economy has given rise to a new term, the air raid economy, which expresses the current economic life. Leaving aside military production for the time being, the state of lack of general consumer goods due to air raids cannot be denied. To this end, various Liu are implemented under the strong organizational force to maintain order on the ground. On the one hand, due to the huge absorption of civilian needs since the beginning of the war, and on the other hand, due to the increase in national income, especially due to the mobilization of latent population after the Battle of Stalingrad, the national income has greatly increased. Extending working hours is also one of the reasons, and the danger of inflation is only the recent increase in short-term debt. The original price and wage restrictions have not been shaken at all. The prices of rent, coal, and food, the three major factors in the lives of the Xu people, are guaranteed to be at a minimum level of stability.

A kind of abnormal phenomenon under air raids, barter seems to be decreasing. The value of things is considered priceless due to bombing, and most people increase their cash on hand in preparation for temporary evacuation. The basic nature of the wartime economy has been heading in the same direction since 1939. As a result of its development, all economic activities have been strengthened and unified under control in order to carry out the war. Among the three major items of temporary, quantitative productivity, smooth allocation of labor and raw materials, how the increase or decrease of productivity becomes the current issue.

Heated German Spirit

After the great victory on the Western Front, until the period when the Balkans were swept away, that is, during the period when Britain was gradually being eliminated, the initial "victor's" war of the German masses was formed against the background of the blitzkrieg's greatness and the new emerging emotions of the European New Order. However , after the war against the Soviet Union, this view of war changed greatly. The Battle of Stalingrad became more and more profound, and the previous bombing of Hamburg fundamentally revised the war view of the German masses. The current view of war is the concept of reducing war. The aerial that the United States and Britain are currently applying, the term "terror" cannot be cut to express it, but it is a devastating air raid that turns everything on the ground into nothing.

Therefore, the war view of all the German people is also the first thing in the history of human warfare. The definition that "battle is a political extension" has long been abandoned, and every people now cannot but realize that they can live or die at any time. Therefore, the hatred of the United States and Britain that every people now holds is no different from the soldiers who used guns to stab the enemy in the past. The maintenance of personal life has now been completely abandoned. Not to mention the situation in World War I when even dogs were used as food and fought to the end, the spirit of tasting hardships is completely reappearing in Germany today. (Xiang: From the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun on September 1)

National Forum

### From Price Limits on Western Medicine to Rationing

Part One

Since the Incident, the market price of Western medicine has risen due to the interruption of supply routes and speculation and hoarding. Fortunately, patients in need at that time could still purchase it at any time. Later, the authorities stipulated price limits for various raw materials and finished products to prevent manipulation. The benevolent government of the authorities took the lives of 5 million citizens of Shanghai as a prerequisite and limited the prices. However, the result was the opposite. The citizens not only did not benefit from it, but were even more burdened. One day, they contracted a disease and consulted a doctor. The prescription prescribed was run throughout the city, and they could not purchase it and died. The number was not small.

I work in a certain pharmacy and know a thing or two about this industry. My humble opinion is as follows: When price limits were first imposed on Western medicine, the price was less than the cost. Manufacturers could not bear the cost and stopped production. Retailers could not bear to be reported by the authorities for exceeding the price limit and being punished. The above two points have caused the past patients to have no way to purchase. However, the goods were hit by the suspension of production, resulting in a shortage of goods on the market, and were then hoarded, and the price rose like a kite. However, the manufacturers' suspension of production is not a long-term plan, and seeing the high price of goods, they were even more eager. Therefore, they supported the economy and raised the price limit. The raised price limit was more expensive than the black market. The hoarders dumped the goods, and at the same time, although the manufacturers were willing to rush to produce, their price was affected by the decline in the black market price, and they had no way out. However, they have a comprehensive plan to hoard the manufactured goods and not sell them until the black market price rises before selling them. The suffering of patients is especially evident here. In the future, when the control and rationing are implemented, please pay attention to the following three points: Western medicine cannot be like cigarettes and cotton cloth. Citizens can purchase it in advance. Once they contract a disease, whether it is the right period for rationing, there are more than 10,000 types of Western medicine, and whether the medicine being rationed is just what the patient needs. (Guoqiang)

Part Two

In recent years, Western medicine has been regarded by speculators as one of the biggest targets for hoarding, and each pharmacy has earned tens of millions or even hundreds of millions.

Medicines are important items related to people's lives. After Western medicines are hoarded by hoarders, the value of medicines has increased unprecedentedly, causing countless poor patients to lose their lives in vain because they cannot afford it. In order to eliminate this dark and unreasonable phenomenon, I put forward the following opinions: I hope that the joint efforts and common supervision can eliminate this dark and bad phenomenon:

The government should urge the establishment of a medicine rationing office.

Each pharmacy must accept the entrustment of the rationing office to sell rationed medicines and report the actual sales quantity to the rationing office on schedule.

Rationed medicines must be planned and distributed by the government. The production and existing quantity of each pharmaceutical factory and pharmacy must be registered with the government. When necessary, the government must purchase them at any time.

Rationed products must be sold at a limited price assessed by the government.

Each doctor who has opened a business and obtained a license in this port should apply for registration with the rationing office. All prescriptions prescribed by registered doctors may be purchased from the rationing office.

When a patient purchases medicine with a prescription from a rationing pharmacy, the rationing pharmacy must verify whether the doctor is registered and record the citizen certificate number and address of the patient or the patient's family for random inspection at any time.

If a registered doctor is found to have prescribed a fake prescription or committed fraud, their registration certificate will be revoked. (Xiu Ru)

### Letter

I recently read a letter in your newspaper from Mr. Liaofan, exposing that my manuscript "Man and National Language" was copied from an article by Fu Wang published in "A Youth" in 1940. After checking, "Fu Wang" is my pen name. After I submitted "A Youth and National Language" to the publication, it was not published for a long time, so I submitted the manuscript to your newspaper. Now I read a letter from Mr. Liaofan and learned that "A Youth" has been published, which I regret very much. Yao Shaosheng Qi.
