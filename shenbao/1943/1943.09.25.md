### On the Key to Political Success and Failure

When we observe the political successes and failures of past dynasties throughout history, the key lies half in the wisdom of the leader and half in the ability to employ people effectively. However, even if the leader is wise, if they fail to employ people properly, the result will still be a lack of political clarity and national prosperity. Therefore, for a political leader, merely possessing the cultivation of wisdom is not enough; they must also have the ability to employ people effectively to be considered truly accomplished. Great talents, in fact, exist everywhere; the key is to be adept at utilizing and recognizing them.

Analyzing the actions of past political leaders further, we often find those who strive for good governance but frequently end up causing chaos, and those who try to be wise but often fall into confusion. Such anomalies are too numerous to mention. Tracing the root cause, the problem lies in the inability to employ people effectively, which stems from suspicion and self-reliance. Generally, a political leader should first examine the talents and character of potential appointees. Once they decide someone is suitable, they must grant them the appropriate authority to allow them to perform their duties effectively. If there is even a slight doubt in their heart about their subordinates, they will inevitably be misled by what they see and hear. Once their perception is clouded, it becomes difficult to distinguish between loyalty and treachery. As a result, right and wrong are reversed, and clarity and confusion are intertwined in politics. In this situation, the political leader can become suspicious of everyone around them. Having doubted all those around them, they are bound to make decisions based on their own limited judgment and rely on their own opinions. Their actions, driven by suspicion and confusion, will inevitably lead to misjudgments against loyal individuals. Logically speaking, those who argue weakly will find it difficult to change the leader's mind, while those who argue too strongly risk incurring the leader's anger, further solidifying their self-reliance. During these disputes, treacherous individuals find opportunities to exploit the situation, flattering the leader's ego, offering compliant advice, calling right wrong and wrong right, and eagerly catering to the leader's desires. At a time when the leader is competing with loyal individuals, they find someone who agrees with them, forgetting their treachery and rejecting loyal advice. Once a leader reaches the point of rejecting loyal advice and trusting treacherous individuals, chaos in the realm and the leader's confusion become inevitable. However, the leader's intention is not initially to dislike loyal advice and favor treachery, nor to dislike good governance and prefer chaos, or to be wise and desire confusion. The problem lies in suspicion and self-reliance, and in competing with their subordinates. If the leader can dispel their suspicion and self-reliance, treacherous individuals will have no opportunity to practice their tricks, and loyal advice can be accepted. Intelligence will not be clouded, and political affairs can be handled appropriately. This will lead the people to respect them as a wise leader and future generations to admire them as a leader who governed well.

In the past, during the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, the prime minister, Chen Zhizhong, monopolized power and dictated policies. Advisors tried to persuade Emperor Renzong not to listen to him, and Ouyang Xiu presented memorials arguing forcefully with righteous words, stating:

"Prime Minister Chen Zhizhong, since taking office, has not met the people's expectations and has repeatedly committed wrongdoings, inviting criticism. Yet Zhizhong delays in resigning and continues to disgrace the prime minister's office. Your Majesty is diligent, frugal, benevolent, compassionate, and kind – using the heart of Yao and Shun. Judging by Your Majesty's intentions, the realm should have been governed well long ago. However, the order of the court deteriorates daily, the political decrees are increasingly flawed, the country becomes poorer, and the people become more impoverished. Refugees fill the fields, and incompetent officials fill the court. How else could this happen? It is because Your Majesty has appointed the wrong person as prime minister. Your Majesty does not realize that the prime minister is unsuitable but instead believes those who speak out are trying to persecute the prime minister. Once suspicion arises, perception is clouded, leading to self-reliance, believing that the prime minister should resign voluntarily and not be dismissed based on the words of others. Therefore, even though Zhizhong has committed great evils and obvious mistakes, Your Majesty tolerates him... The more Your Majesty's determination to use Zhizhong strengthens, the more fiercely those who speak out attack him. Your Majesty then thinks of ways to prevail over those who speak out, and treacherous ministers seize the opportunity to enter, surely flattering Your Majesty and falsely accusing those who speak out of wanting to remove Zhizhong and promote others. Your Majesty is worried about those who speak out offending the imperial ear, and is delighted to hear words that please Your Majesty, no longer discerning their treachery and trusting them. Therefore, Your Majesty rejects those who speak out more severely and uses Zhizhong more firmly, causing droughts, floods, and widespread starvation, and exhausting public and private resources."

Ouyang Yongshu directly pointed out that Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty's suspicion and self-reliance, his rejection of loyal advice, and his allowing treacherous individuals to occupy important positions misled the country and harmed the people. This upright and unyielding attitude stemmed from a burning passion for the country! Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty was not unaware of the need for good governance, nor did he fail to learn to be wise; he simply failed to employ people effectively, relying on his own judgment, leading to chaos in the realm. This is one of the keys to political success and failure.

Secondly, it is important to be good at employing people. In the past, Zeng Guofan and the Pan family discussed the ways of employing people, emphasizing transformation, cultivation, and observation, none of which should be neglected. Today's administrators have adopted many of Zeng Guofan's principles for managing affairs, but they should study the methods of employing people more thoroughly. Generally speaking, the common failings of civil servants are timidity and triviality among those in internal positions, and perfunctoriness and complacency among those in external positions. Following established customs, they seek only to avoid mistakes and are unwilling to strive for achievement. If the country encounters difficulties, there is a lack of talent to cope with them. Hastily seeking people who can revitalize the situation, there is fear that opportunists will take advantage. Therefore, to ensure everyone has talent, it is better to encourage them to engage in learning. Political leaders at all levels must lead by example to transform customs and morals. Encourage those who lack talent to learn, and severely punish the habit of ambiguity and inaction. For those who have some talent, encourage them to learn even more to temper their stubbornness and harshness. After a few years, there will be a significant improvement in talent. This is the way of transformation. In the past, the Nationalist Government had proposed promoting academic studies for civil servants, but unfortunately, it was not effectively implemented.

The way of cultivation includes several aspects: teaching, selection, commendation, and promotion. A word of praise from a superior can inspire a subordinate to strive for achievement; a word of rebuke can make them fear and correct their mistakes. This shows that teaching cannot be neglected. If thorns and weeds are not removed, orchids will lose their color; if harmful horses are not removed, thoroughbreds will be stifled. This highlights the importance of selection. The talent of individuals is like the growth of crops; the teaching of superiors is like planting and cultivating seeds. Selection is like removing weeds, and commendation is like irrigation. If promotion is added, it is like a timely rain, allowing the seedlings to flourish. Without commendation and promotion, crops and weeds grow and fall together in the fields, negating the purpose of cultivation.

In ancient times, seeking opinions and evaluating merits were tools for observing talent, and both were given equal importance. Throughout history, political leaders have often issued edicts seeking opinions. Officials at all levels have a responsibility to offer suggestions regarding the successes and failures of current policies, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of local conditions. Through mutual consultation and verification, not only can talented individuals be discovered, but their insights can also be used as a reference for policy implementation. Moreover, politics is a matter for the public, and attention should be paid to public opinion. Public opinion has both tangible forms, such as newspapers and magazines, and intangible forms, such as the people's likes and dislikes. Tangible forms are easier to observe to understand the trends reflecting public opinion, while intangible forms require deep investigation into the people. Heartfelt observation is essential for this method of observation.

In summary, the successes and failures of politics since ancient times have largely depended on the proper employment of people. The ways of employing people emphasize transformation, cultivation, and observation. We deeply believe that the key to the successes and failures of modern politics still lies in these aspects. We hope that the government can learn from these principles, strengthen its political position, and continue to demonstrate long-standing enthusiasm. Therefore, we present the key to political success and failure for the authorities to consider and use as a reference.

Now, Interior Minister Chen Qun is convening the Second Police Administration Conference before taking up his new post as Governor of Jiangsu Province. This conference is being held after the war has begun, and its significance is even greater. The importance of economic police was then explained, pointing out that the government is not only implementing a controlled economy but also a planned economy, and the execution of the duties of economic police has a significant impact on the people's support for the government's policies. It went on to elaborate on ensuring security, stabilizing people's livelihoods, and the duties that the police should fulfill. Finally, it was hoped that the members attending the conference would work hard to review and improve, and complete the mission of rebuilding China and protecting East Asia.

Chairman's Speech

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - At the National Police Administration Conference held on the 24th, Chairman Chen Qun delivered the following opening remarks: "The Ministry has submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval the holding of the Second National Police Administration Conference on September 24th of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943). To review the advantages and disadvantages of implementing the resolutions of the First Police Administration Conference in August of the 29th year (1940), to determine what should be maintained and expanded, and what should be changed, is the connection between the Second and First Conferences and should not be ignored. In particular, this conference is being held after the war has begun. The police have a special responsibility to ensure the security of the rear, which should be understood by everyone. Although we are not personally on the front lines wielding weapons against the enemy, all combat power comes entirely from the rear, and the importance of the task we bear is equal to that of the soldiers on the front lines. How to strengthen our strength and improve our efficiency to adapt to the wartime system and achieve victory is what we should discuss and learn from others. This is the motive for convening this conference. We hope that everyone will work hard in their respective positions, express their great ideas, and make contributions to the country and to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

A certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, 24th (Central News Agency) - The decisive battle in the Solomon Islands is intensifying. On the morning of the 13th, a large number of enemy aircraft attacked the Japanese base on Bougainville Island, Buka. The enemy aircraft included Douglas (SBD) dive bombers, Consolidated (PBY) heavy bombers, Lockheed (P-38) and Bell (P-39) fighters, Curtiss (P-40) fighters, and Grumman (F4F) fighters and bombers, totaling 142 aircraft. All Japanese forces immediately took off to intercept, and a fierce air battle ensued.

In that battle, the Japanese forces only suffered damage to two aircraft. There was minor damage to ground facilities.

### Fierce Maneuver Warfare Unfolds on the East Bank of the Dnieper River; The Battle Line Extends Over 300 Li

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency) - The major offensive and defensive battle between German and Soviet forces, centered on the Dnieper River, is becoming increasingly tense, extending from Novomoskovsk, 20 kilometers north of Dnepropetrovsk, to Rozevato, 20 kilometers east. Large German and Soviet forces are concentrated in a narrow battle line of about 30 kilometers, fighting to the death for every inch of ground. Soviet forces are also heavily bombarding the bridgeheads of Chaply and Zaporozhye and the key points of Kiev. Fierce maneuver warfare has unfolded at various points along the 350 li stretch of the Dnieper River's east bank. However, because the German forces are using skillful defensive tactics, they have prevented Soviet forces from achieving their goal of reducing German combat power. In the central battle line, Soviet forces north of Smolensk, after occupying Demidov, are attempting to cut off the railroad between Smolensk and Vitebsk, and have launched fierce attacks. In the western battle line, the two armies have also engaged in heavy tank warfare, with complex battle lines. Soviet forces have advanced to within 10 li of the front of Smolensk.

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to German front-line news, German forces have been engaged in fierce street fighting with Soviet forces in the key city of Nevel, 100 kilometers southeast of Smolensk, since the 22nd.

### Germany Determined to Fight to the End for Freedom; Goebbels Publishes an Article

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in this week's issue of "Das Reich" that there will be no surrender in this war. This war is a defensive war forced upon Germany by the enemy, whose intention is to prevent Germany from enjoying all possibilities for national life and development. This war, like any other war, also has countless dangers and risks. A great nation like the German one, if it defends itself with all its might with a strong and clear-sighted government, can overcome all dangers. Goebbels solemnly declared that the success or failure of this war is related to the spiritual solidarity of our people. He listed the obligations that every German must uphold during the war, including silence, discipline, mutual support, and faith. Goebbels said that there is only one thing that the enemy can use to defeat Germany: breaking the people's faith in the government, using their old political tricks, and depriving them of their leaders, thereby depriving them of their defense. Goebbels warned the German people that there is only one thing that must not be lost in this war: freedom. Freedom is the foundation of our life and future. Everything can be replaced, but once freedom is lost, the German people, whether as a nation or as individuals, will lose everything else and all their culture. We are fighting this war not to preserve peace but to restore peace. There is a famous law of war that says "a person must risk what they want to defend." For freedom, nothing is too much to sacrifice. Everything we have was earned for freedom. Without freedom, the German people will lose their purpose and possibility of existence. Free people can regain and rebuild everything they have lost in defending freedom. On the other hand, enslaved people will lose everything and never have a chance to recover. The purpose of our policies and war efforts is to guarantee the possibility for the German people to develop in all aspects as a free nation. Our generation must struggle and work hard to achieve this goal, because the greatest chance of final victory lies in the determination and unity of our people.

### Fascist Republican Government to Move to Northern Italy; Strong Lineup Gains Popular Support

Rome, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Huitong News Agency correspondent in Italy, sources in Rome said that after the Fascist Republican Government was established in Rome on Thursday, the cabinet and government agencies will soon move to northern Italy, and Mussolini himself will accompany them. After the foreign governments formally recognize the Fascist Republican Government, the diplomatic corps stationed in Italy will inevitably follow them to northern Italy. According to diplomatic sources, the Axis powers will take joint action within days to formally recognize the Italian Fascist Republican Government.

Rome, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Huitong News Agency report, Mussolini's new government is clearly gaining the support of the Italian people. The new cabinet members appointed by Mussolini are all competent and are welcomed by all parties. Defense Minister Graziani is a famous Italian general with outstanding achievements, and he will be able to quickly resolve various military issues. Most of the cabinet members are new faces, and Mussolini seems to want to change things.

### Cephalonia Island Occupied by German Forces; An Italian Division Annihilated

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - Officials said today that German forces, after fierce fighting with numerically superior forces from the "Batterio" army, had gained full control of the Greek island of Cephalonia yesterday. The island is located at the entrance to the Ionian Sea. The German forces stationed there received significant support from the air force. It is said that during this battle, almost the entire Italian division on the island was wiped out. The division's staff officers were also annihilated, and 4,000 soldiers ended up laying down their weapons and being captured.

### Frequent Mobilization of Allied British and American Forces; Preparing to Launch a New Offensive

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) – German News Agency reports: After unsuccessful fierce attacks by British forces northeast of Salerno, the situation on the left flank of the American Fifth Army was relatively calm on Wednesday. However, east of Montecorvino, powerful American troops advanced towards German mountain positions, where intense localized battles erupted. The American attempts to break through the cleverly concealed and deeply entrenched trapezoidal German formations proved ineffective. The American flanking strategy was also hindered by the strength of the German forward positions. It is expected that large-scale military actions will soon take place in all sectors of the front. Over the past few nights, large detachments of enemy troops have landed at the bridgeheads of the Salerno Bay. These troops are likely reserves to fill gaps in the line, or new detachments that will advance north and northeast from Salerno. German reconnaissance aircraft observed significant movements of British and American troops south of Montecorvino and in the Potenza area, indicating that the Allied High Command is planning to send fresh divisions from Taranto or Brindisi to the front to launch an offensive against the Germans. Simultaneously, the number of enemy airfields on the Apulian peninsula is increasing. Initially, only fighter squadrons were present in the area, but it is now claimed that Allied bomber squadrons are also massing there.

### Minister Tani Discusses Chongqing's Constitutional Policies

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) – Major General Tani, head of the Army Press Section of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, met with the Chinese press corps stationed in Japan today and discussed Chongqing's policies for implementing constitutional government, stating the following: Chiang Kai-shek, at the 11th Plenary Session of the Chongqing Kuomintang, explained that the purpose of the meeting was to establish national construction policies. He stated that national construction should be divided into political construction and economic construction, thereby advancing the foundation of political construction, which lies in the implementation of constitutional government. Chiang Kai-shek's unprepared announcement of constitutionalism and related policies undoubtedly contains a complex set of issues. In my opinion, for the sake of East Asia's future, China should not hastily become a constitutional state. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, considered the implementation of constitutional government internally and the abolition of unequal treaties externally as the two major goals of the Chinese revolution. However, due to the development of the Greater East Asia War, Japan, based on its strength and morality, has already provided China with immense assistance and success in abolishing unequal treaties. The only remaining task is constitutional government. However, China's implementation of constitutional government always requires the restoration of order as a prerequisite. In the current situation, where the entire country is a battlefield and four hundred million people are suffering from bloodshed, the so-called implementation of constitutional government is akin to climbing a tree to catch fish. Therefore, for the success of the Chinese revolution and in anticipation of the realization of its constitutional government, we must first demand that Chongqing cease resistance and restore order. Mr. Heminway, President of the American Bankers Association, said that if the American treasury's deficit continues to grow at the current rate, the United States will soon have to become a state socialist dictatorship. Also, the British commentator Shaw predicted that as a result of this war, Britain would become a communist state, meaning that the people would gain nothing and rely solely on government handouts to maintain their lives, which is effectively a communist society. We are not concerned with the United States becoming a dictatorship or Britain becoming a communist state, but we would be very pleased if our beloved East Asian brother, China, could realize constitutional government after the end of this war.

### Knox Discusses the Pacific War Situation

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) – U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated in London today, during a conversation with Reuters, that the Pacific war is actually a large-scale naval war against a powerful people who "know every corner of the Pacific well." Knox emphasized that the British public must find a way to understand the vastness of the war currently taking place in the Pacific. The prevailing view in the United States is that Britain considers the European war to be the real war, while the Pacific war is not important. Furthermore, after Hitler is defeated, the United States will be left isolated to fight the Pacific war, as if the Pacific war is solely an American affair. However, he also said that the Allied forces in the Pacific theater are encountering "fierce, reckless, and prepared-to-die combat." British submarines operate in the Atlantic, while American submarines operate in the Pacific.

### Mediterranean Committee to Meet Soon; All Allied Nations Invited to Participate

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a Reuter’s dispatch from Washington: A reporter asked at a White House briefing yesterday whether the United States, like Britain, had expressed dissatisfaction with the Spanish Blue Division. Secretary of State Hull replied that the U.S. government's position had already been fully communicated to Spain. He will also make this statement soon at the upcoming Anglo-American-Soviet foreign ministers' meeting and the proposed meeting of the three Rocus figures. Hull continued that the Mediterranean Committee will convene soon, but the United States has not yet selected a representative. An invitation has been sent to Chongqing to join the committee, but no response has yet been received. The Mediterranean Committee also has no authority to decide on events; its task is merely to exchange information and gather opinions.

Soviet Union Attaches Importance

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) – Batley, in a commentary in the News Chronicle on British Prime Minister Churchill's remarks regarding the French Committee of National Liberation, stated: The participation of representatives of the French Committee of National Liberation in the newly established Mediterranean Committee is a very important fact. The committee was organized on the initiative of the Soviet Union and will have a significant impact in the future. Judging from the presence of the Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs, the Soviet Union attaches great importance to the committee, so its organization may expand.

### U.S. Intensifies Aid to the Soviet Union

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to Reuter’s news: U.S. Lend-Lease Administrator Stettinius stated in a speech in San Francisco yesterday that the United States has spent 140 billion yuan since the implementation of the Lend-Lease system.

### Archbishop of York Promotes Anglo-Soviet Friendship

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a dispatch from London: The Archbishop of York, currently in Moscow, stated that attention should be paid to consolidating Anglo-Soviet friendship.

### Announcement of Key Points for the Rice Procurement Association; Discussions between the Minister of Food and the Japanese Authorities

Yesterday, Yuan Lüden, chairman of the Rice Control Committee, convened a meeting of the executive committee at the office of the Materials Control Review Committee, immediately passing the Key Points for the Preparation of the Rice Procurement Trade Association and promptly mobilizing rice merchants in various regions to commence procurement and purchasing activities. Simultaneously, Minister of Food Gu Baoheng, recognizing that the rice purchasing work, under the framework of the Rice Procurement Trade Association, will generate considerable capabilities, issued a solemn statement yesterday. The original text is as follows.

Original Text of the Minister of Food's Statement

“In the past, the Executive Yuan of the National Government ordered Yuan Lüden and others to undertake the important task of organizing a rice control mechanism. Now, I am fortunate to witness the establishment of the Rice Control Committee, which is truly gratifying. However, the success of the Rice Control Committee depends entirely on the activities of its lower-level organizations, namely the local purchasers. Therefore, the committee promulgated the "Key Points for the Establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Rice Procurement Trade Association," as recorded elsewhere, widely recruiting outstanding rice merchants from various regions to share this arduous task and fulfill their mission. This is a fair and appropriate measure. The government will spare no effort to provide significant assistance and protection to the selected and designated rice merchants. It is earnestly hoped that fellow traders with the necessary qualifications will apply promptly in accordance with the stipulated requirements, so as to contribute to the resolution of the food problem. This is what is earnestly hoped.”

Japanese Military Authorities Express Assistance

The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China also issued a written statement yesterday regarding rice procurement, expressing their determination to assist, stating, “This time, the Rice Control Committee of the National Commercial Control Association has widely selected competent rice merchants from among the general rice merchants in China, ordering them to purchase rice and recognizing those with excellent performance as entrusted merchants of the Rice Control Committee. This measure trusts the original rice merchants in various parts of China, placing Chinese and Japanese merchants on an equal footing, providing them with active opportunities, so that rice procurement can achieve great results, and people's livelihoods can tend to stabilize. All of this is sufficient to demonstrate the sincerity and impartiality of the Rice Control Committee's attitude, which can be said to be highly appropriate. The military authorities fully agree. It is earnestly hoped that the selected rice merchants will deeply feel their great responsibility, exert their intelligence, and fulfill their duties to the nation and the people. The military authorities will provide full support and cooperation for the procurement and transportation of rice by rice merchants with excellent qualities. In case of any persecution or obstruction of their legitimate transportation, resolute measures will be taken.”

Statement by the Japanese Embassy Authorities

The authorities of the Japanese Embassy stated: Solving the food problem is an urgent issue for China under the Greater East Asia War. The National Government is also actively establishing concrete policies. Currently, the Rice Control Committee has been established within the National Commercial Control Association to be responsible for purchasing and distributing rice. The Rice Control Committee has now decided to select the best merchants from among the Chinese rice merchants to take charge of purchasing, thereby improving purchasing efficiency and striving to solve the food problem. The Japanese side is also extremely concerned about the progress of this issue due to military necessity. In order to complete the tasks of the Rice Control Committee, the Japanese military and civilians will unanimously promote it. Japanese merchants will also, according to their capabilities, obey the control of the Rice Control Committee and engage actively, so that the efficiency of the committee can be maximized. It is hoped that after the smooth operation of the new Chinese mechanism, people's livelihoods can be stabilized, and at the same time, important tasks can be completed for the Greater East Asia War.

Yuan Lüden Expresses His Aspirations Yesterday

Yuan Lüden, chairman of the Rice Control Committee, yesterday issued a statement to the Shanghai press regarding the procurement of rice, saying: “I was ordered to organize the Rice Control Committee, and I myself consider my talents to be inadequate for such a heavy responsibility, and I am deeply fearful of failure. Fortunately, the Chinese and Japanese committee members have jointly cooperated and gradually promoted its smooth progress, which is gratifying. In order to achieve the goal of rice control and procurement, the Chinese and Japanese committee members have earnestly discussed and resolved to establish the "Key Points for the Preparatory Committee of the Rice Procurement Trade Association" in various rice-producing areas. The main points have been summarized, and a good reputation has been established. This plan will be promoted smoothly with the assistance of the authorities of friendly nations. In addition to sending a special envoy overnight to present it to the Executive Yuan for approval, it will also be promulgated today.”

### Key Points for the Establishment of the Procurement Association's Preparatory Committee

Key Points for the Establishment of the Rice Procurement Trade Association Committee: The Rice Control Committee (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee") will establish Rice Procurement Trade Associations in various regions in the future in order to complete the purpose of rice control and purchase.

According to news from the Oil and Grain Professional Committee, the committee is still awaiting approval from the authorities for its plans for purchasing and distributing in the three provinces and two cities. However, in order to adapt to the current reality, it will first begin purchasing from various producing areas. Free circulation of oil and grain will still be permitted in the city to supplement the insufficiency of the allocated quantity. Therefore, the door-to-door sales of the Daode Oil Factory and others, which have been suspended for a long time, have recently resumed on the principle of self-production and self-sales.

### Flour and Wheat Professional Committee Seizes Smuggled Flour; Confiscation to be Carried Out if Found Again

Since the National Commercial Control Association's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee implemented flour allocation in the main areas of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two special municipalities, the results have been good. Because the association's purchase of wheat this year is very sufficient, the quantity of flour produced by Chinese and Japanese flour mills allocated to various places has been increasing daily. The heavy burden of supplementing people's food has greatly benefited. Furthermore, because the association is concerned about the needs of the people and preventing illegal manipulation for profit, it plans to crack down on acts that disrupt the unified allocation. Recently, it has strictly investigated reported incidents of flour smuggling. Recently, a large amount of smuggled flour was seized in Nanxiang Town on the Beijing-Shanghai railway line and purchased at the allocated market price. In order to maintain the control policy and consider the normal and legal development of merchants' operations, the association has decided to severely punish smuggled flour in the future and has already notified various branch offices and relevant military and police agencies that if smuggled flour is found again in the future, in addition to confiscating the smuggled flour free of charge, it will also be severely punished.

### Solicitation of Articles for National Day Special Issue

The National Day anniversary on October 10th is approaching in the blink of an eye.

At this time of serious situation, on the occasion of this National Day, how should we strive and struggle and be on our guard? This newspaper will publish a special issue on that day and openly solicit articles on the topics of "How to Improve National Health?" and "How to Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production?" Both of these are fundamental tasks for national revitalization. We sincerely hope that readers will express their practical opinions and send in their articles, and we hope that they will be selected. Once selected, 150 yuan will be paid for every 1,000 words. If there are any overlooked gems, we will also reward them appropriately. The deadline is the end of September. Please send articles to the editor's office of this newspaper. This is an announcement.

### Cotton Purchasing Price to be Determined Soon

As late autumn approaches, the cotton in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is about to be harvested. Therefore, the Cotton Professional Committee is preparing a concrete purchasing plan in order to prepare for the unified purchase of new cotton and is determining the purchasing price of new cotton this year based on the prices of rice and other agricultural products. A reporter from the Commercial News Agency recently learned from cotton merchants that the price of cotton in the first half of this year soared due to the soaring market price of yarn and cloth. Various textile factories sent personnel to various nearby locations to purchase as much as possible, so the price of cotton suddenly soared, once breaking through 5,000 yuan per dan. However, since the government authorities implemented the purchase of yarn and cloth, the market price of yarn and cloth plummeted. Seeing that there was no profit to be made and that there was a risk of losses, various textile factories stopped purchasing one after another. In addition, the tight credit situation made general hoarders uneasy and sought to sell off their goods. As a result, in a situation where demand exceeded supply, the price of cotton fell in a straight line. Until recently, the price per dan has fallen back to half, and transactions are still rarely opened. However, it is faintly heard that the cotton price to be determined by the Cotton Professional Committee in the future will be slightly higher than the current market price in order to protect the interests of farmers.

### Middle School Symposium Held in Groups

The city's education workers' symposium, sponsored by the Municipal Party Headquarters and enthusiastically assisted by the Education Bureau, is now ready.

The first group will meet on September 27th, from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, at the auditorium of the Western Shanghai Police Bureau. The second group will meet on September 28th, from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, at the auditorium of the Lake Society on Guizhou Road.

### Shortage of Coal Briquette Retail Should Be Corrected Urgently

Recently, there has been a shortage of coal briquettes in the spot market in this city. Retail stores are limiting sales at the door, which is causing inconvenience to citizens. This is because rumors of coal briquette price increases are rampant, leading to opportunistic manipulation, resulting in a sudden reduction in supply at retail outlets. However, the authorities have already made precise calculations regarding the cost of coal briquettes, and manufacturers and retailers can obtain legitimate profits. Therefore, the fixed price of 32 and a half yuan per load can be maintained as usual. However, the current state of supply needs to be corrected by the authorities to benefit the people's livelihood.

Economic Circles - First Review

### The Clouds are Gradually Dissipating

Since the thunderbolt of the cotton yarn purchase, the gloom in Shanghai's economic circles has not completely dissipated. Everyone is sitting in a city of worry. Although after the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar, the economic uncertainty after the loose credit has not disappeared. This has made Shanghai's economy since June bleak and uninteresting. This cloud of doubt could have been avoided. It's just that some people are ignorant of the facts and short-sighted, thinking that once cotton yarn is purchased, the merchants' livelihood will be cut off. They think that since cotton yarn can be purchased, all private materials will be in danger.

Now, thanks to the smooth operation of the purchasing and allocation mechanism, yarn and cloth will soon be allocated. Salt, matches, and soap will also be distributed according to population, which has been put into concrete form. The purpose is to eliminate any worries for both suppliers and consumers. The Executive Yuan's order to abolish the "Provisional Rules for Prohibiting Shanghai Stockbrokers from Trading Stocks of Chinese Companies" is sufficient to show that those engaged in legitimate industry and commerce in the future will surely receive the government's support and assistance.

With the abolition of the decree "Prohibiting the Trading of Chinese Stocks," the Chinese Stock Exchange is scheduled to hold a reopening ceremony on the 29th of this month. From now on, domestic industrial and commercial circles should work harder to move towards legitimate production, so that social idle funds can be put on the right track. Regarding securities, we have said before that holding securities is equivalent to holding capital or property. Regarding securities trading, we have also said that the biggest purpose of the securities market is to make securities trading on the right track, to help the development of the national economy and the prosperity of industry. Therefore, investing in Chinese stocks should be encouraged. In a word, only a firm economic concept can dispel the clouds of doubt in the economic circles. The recent sharp rise in Chinese stock prices shows that the doubts in Shanghai's economic circles are gradually dissipating.

### Stock Exchange Reopening Approaching: Reviewing Stocks, Application Registration Deadline on the 29th

The Chinese Stock Exchange has been preparing for more than two months and is now largely ready. Some brokers, after being reviewed by the Ministry of Industry, have been announced, and the candidates for various positions in the exchange have also been decided. Now that the reopening is approaching, in order to comply with the current regulations, various stocks must first pass the review before they can be listed for trading. Therefore, all companies that want their stocks to be listed must immediately go to the exchange's preparatory office to complete the application registration procedures for review and approval. This registration will be closed on the 29th, and late applications will not be accepted.

### Brown Sugar Needed by Postpartum Women: Can Apply for Purchase

Beware of Being Deceived by Sugar

Brown sugar is commonly used by women, especially postpartum women. However, the sale of brown sugar has disappeared in the market recently, and prices have soared. The Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office has stopped allocation for a long time, resulting in urgent market needs. Therefore, some unscrupulous merchants believe that it is profitable, so they dye white sugar and sell it as brown sugar. This type of fake sugar has already been sold around Wuma Road. I hope citizens will not be deceived. According to people in the sugar industry, the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office has some brown sugar in its warehouse, but the quantity is very small. Postpartum women can apply for purchase from the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office with a doctor's certificate. It is said that the sugar price is calculated according to the special price allocation, and each person can purchase up to one or two pounds.

### Factory Registration in District One Has Reached 700

Application Deadline at the End of the Month

Those who fail to register by the deadline will be fined 20 yuan per week. In the past week, more than 400 factories have submitted applications, bringing the total number of registered factories to 700. It is also understood that the authorities are carrying out this registration to understand the situation of each factory and to ensure its safety and maintain hygienic conditions.

Oil and Grain Circulation Increasing, Market Reopening Undecided

Recently, the free circulation of oil and grain has been increasing, and goods from various places have been arriving enthusiastically. In order to smooth supply and demand and stabilize market prices, oil and grain merchants in this city recently jointly requested the authorities of the industry association to open the miscellaneous grain and oil cake market on Edward Road. According to the responsible party of the association, this matter must be approved by the relevant authorities and is currently difficult to decide.

### Chinese Stock Trends

Chinese stocks are mostly bullish. After a big rise, there is a small amount of scattered profit-taking. However, investors are still constantly absorbing large amounts. Idle funds are returning to the right track, and there is still a feeling that demand exceeds supply. Among the textile industry, Wing On Textile is rising alone and will not return. It is heard that shareholders will increase capital on the 27th of this month, changing the par value of 100 yuan to 10 yuan and giving each old share 20 new shares. Therefore, the buying interest is the most enthusiastic. According to reliable sources, China Film will distribute dividends in the middle of next month and give half a new share for each old share, which is enough to stimulate people's hearts. Most stocks have risen again, and trading is very active. The industry stocks are listed below.

### Business Summary

Type C bonds were lower than the previous day, but actually rose midway. The final price at noon was slightly lower than the previous day. Other types A, B, D, and E bonds fell slightly and were still balanced.

Interbank Rate: The interbank rate of the Money Industry Association was unchanged at 18%.

Grains: Rice and grains were well-supplied due to the increasing number of people freely transporting them, and prices fell again. Due to the large arrival and weak sales of oil and grains, the market showed a trend of wanting to rise but being unable to do so.

Medicinal Materials: Guang goods suddenly rose sharply due to the place of origin. The Cantonese help stopped going out and instead came in, and the price rose gradually. However, Sichuan goods and Tianjin goods were still less asked for. Huai goods and Zhejiang goods were even more depressed.

Wool: 70-80% of wool goods, regardless of coarse or fine, smooth or thick, were still falling. Observing the standard market situation, the situation is getting worse and worse. There are more sellers than buyers in the market. Although the prices of all kinds of goods have fallen within the limit price, the general public has shifted its focus and mostly still wants to wait and see. Therefore, except for the stores that have reduced prices, there is a slight business, but the original box and whole package business is still rare.

Rayon: The market turned slightly stable. Green goods were once shouted high mainly because the financial situation was upward, but they finally failed to rise due to sluggish sales.

### Enemy Countries Counterattack Burma: Japanese Army Waits for Opportunity to Intercept

The joint counterattack against Burma by Britain and the United States, which was previously discussed in the Beck talks, has been proposed for discussion. The scale and intensity of this future counterattack are naturally expected. After Alagan's collection of General Wavell to take office as Governor-General of India, Stilwell, the US commander in the East Asia Military Headquarters in New India, served as the commander of the East Asia Military, and based on India and Ceylon, a new Southeast Asian Command was established to conduct operations against the Japanese army. All of these illustrate the preparations for a counterattack under the intention of returning to Burma, and the internal situation of expanding military preparations in India. Now, let's examine the increasingly large Japanese military strength and the enemy, whose strength has been diminished by the domestic situation, in anxiety and unease, how they are desperately expanding their military strength.

China-Burma Border

First, look at the movements of the Chongqing army. In mid-July, Chiang Kai-shek not only issued a new order to deploy an unprecedented large army to the front lines of the northern army, but is also actively moving troops and dispatching reserve troops to a secret forest area of the ... River, attempting to establish new air bases in various places. Currently, they are transporting materials by air and desperately preparing.

North and South Burma-India Border

Secondly, on the northern Burma-India border, following the arrival of the rainy season, the British and Indian troops, who had previously retreated to the rear of the border line, have recently been seen moving again, attempting to advance to the front of 〇. Not only are there black troops who have been increased from the North African front and transferred here, but they are also trying to increase their military strength every day.

On the southern Burma-India border, the strength of the Japanese army secured on the opposite shore of 〇〇 on the 〇〇 peninsula is also increasing daily. Not only has a strong artillery position been completed, but the railway construction work from 〇〇 to 〇〇 is also continuing in parallel during the rainy season, and military roads in various places are being completed one by one.

Military Tension in India

Looking back at India, Kolkata and other cities have become fortresses, and British, American, and Chongqing troops can be seen everywhere in the city. In the two months since July, military trains have been running day and night on the railway from Calcutta to New Delhi, and large numbers of Indian soldiers have been recruited and new aviation departments have been established at universities in Calcutta and other places to train pilots. In addition, since the North Africa and Sicily battles, the enemy has gathered a large fleet in the Indian Ocean, and reconnaissance planes have been flying near the border government for days, exaggerating the amount of air force in India. The US strategy of overpowering the other side with the amount of troops and weapons is far from comparable to the previous Battle of Akyab. The British, American, and Chongqing cooperation and coordination will implement a fierce counterattack from the sea, land, and air, which is already as clear as fire. However, no matter how large its scale or how large its quantity, the operational vulnerability inherent in the entire army is an undeniable fact.

Even between Britain and the United States, in addition to the previous disputes over equipment and coordination at the air bases, Stilwell's assumption of the post of commander of the East Asia Military is also a manifestation of the United States' attempt to gain leadership of the operations in India. Therefore, the British and Indian armies are full of anti-American sentiment.

Although the enemy boasts about how prepared its counterattack posture is, we have the majestic and high-spirited Japanese army that has overcome steep mountains, prevented attacking swamps, and densely forested areas in the past battles in Alagan, and fought with enemies several times its size, causing them to collapse into disarray. We also have the Burmese Independence Army, which bears the mission of a new Burma. In the future battles, we will completely frustrate the enemy's counterattack and make the British, American, and Chongqing armies suffer a major defeat similar to the tragedy of Dunkirk.

### Widespread Cholera Epidemic in North China

Since the discovery of cholera in Beijing at the end of August, Beijing's epidemic prevention measures can be said to have broken all previous records. Not only were the gates of all the outer city closed, but even the gates of the inner city leading to the outer city were locked, completely cutting off traffic. Areas within the city where cholera was discovered, such as Wangfujing Street, were also closed to traffic. In addition, vaccination efforts were stepped up. The authorities did not allow anyone who had not been vaccinated within the past seven days to pass through major roads, and passengers on trains without vaccination certificates were not allowed to board.

Stepped-Up Vaccinations

A few days ago, several city gates leading to the outer city were completely closed, and even trams were not running. Only Zhengyangmen was left half-open, and passage was only allowed after detailed inspection and disinfection. It was not until the 8th of this month that Xuanwu and Guang'an Gates were temporarily opened, but passage was still extremely inconvenient.

Not only was a vaccination certificate valid for at least seven days required to pass through the gate, but disinfectant was also sprayed on the spot, drenching clothes before one could slowly pass through the gate in a long line amidst an air full of mixed odors. The authorities also dispatched countless vaccination teams to randomly select pale arms and stab them vigorously, while the police went door-to-door to investigate whether each household's epidemic prevention equipment and implementation were satisfactory.

Fly-Catching Campaign

Flies, the carriers of cholera, also suffered the misfortune of being "wanted with a reward." The *Shui Ribao* newspaper published the New People's Association City General Association's decision to expand the epidemic prevention plan, one of which was a two-week fly-catching campaign. It is said that the goal was to catch one hundred million flies, weighing one *wan* *liang*. The group leaders handling the fly-catching would also receive a subsidy; each *liang* of flies caught would be rewarded with one yuan of Kuomintang currency. "The fly carcass purchasing fee is provisionally set at six yuan per group, to be kept by the group leader, with prices issued at any time, and liquidated at the end." This truly set a precedent for epidemic prevention and fly eradication.

Speculation in Medicine

During this period, there were also many people engaged in speculative trading. The first and most obvious were advertisements for "assured cures," which, according to reports, had the effect of "living and dying together." "Epidemic prevention vaccination" advertising signs were also hung high at the entrances and on the walls of various candle hospitals. Even traditional Chinese medicine practitioners had become vaccination experts. In Xidan, one traditional Chinese medicine practitioner boldly wrote "Vaccination against cholera, three yuan" and other words in front of his door. In order to prevent malpractices, the authorities decided to ban them and ordered all private hospitals and clinics to provide free vaccinations, with medicines distributed by the Epidemic Prevention Headquarters. However, there were still many who defied the ban.

Spreading Epidemic

Most worryingly, the cholera epidemic seems to be spreading throughout North China. Cholera was discovered in Fengtai earlier than in Beijing, and the number of deaths had already reached several hundred. On September 3rd, true cholera was also discovered in Shijiazhuang. In the Datong Kouquan area, several people who died of unexplained causes were also discovered recently. It was not until the 7th of this month that it was confirmed to be true cholera, and the same disease also occurred outside Datong City. It is said that Jinan has also been affected, and even Zhangjiakou has suspected cholera patients. In just the two days of the 9th and 10th, there were still seven cholera patients in Beijing. Such a spread is truly a huge crisis for North China during the war. Two days ago, Beijing experienced a bout of autumn wind and a day of heavy rain, and the climate became much cooler as a result. Perhaps Heaven has taken pity on the people of North China who are on the brink of starvation and wants to use this natural cold to kill the terrible germs, so there is hope that the cholera epidemic will be eradicated. However, assuming that the cholera epidemic passes, and the cold winds come from the north, how will the people of North China, who have not died from the disease, resist the cold winds from the north?

### A Small Textile Manager's Plea

— Chen Shicong

I am the manager of a small cloth factory with thirteen looms and a dozen workers. Since the war, a large number of hoarders have emerged, and the short, fine capital of the factory has been gradually and secretly seized by them. Because factories need circulation and cannot follow their hoarding practices and remain immobile. After all, the speed at which finished products can be created are not as quick as the speed at which raw materials rise, so raw materials gradually get shorter and shorter in the situation of overt hatred and covert depletion. Even in normal times, the purchase of raw materials is indeed not easy, because we lack the ability to buy in bulk of five or ten packages, and must go through various requests and accumulation to obtain them. This is the hidden pain of small-scale traders at the moment, and there is no need to shy away from it. However, when I return to the factory and see the workers who are working hard all day long, my spirit feels slightly comforted, because the relationship between labor and capital is very harmonious, like a family. No matter how difficult the situation is, I always can't bear to let the workers who help me work every day leave me.

Starting in late July, movement permits were impossible to obtain, and the raw materials in the factory gradually became insufficient. Then came the government's order on August 9th to implement a comprehensive purchase of yarn and cloth. In this extremely helpless situation, I had to announce that the ten thousand yuan of cash I had prepared was gradually being used up. I fear how the days to come will be arranged. Where is the floating capital of my own? It is yarn and cloth, but it has been purchased by the government, and it is impossible to exchange it for cash. To ask relatives and friends for loans! They have almost the same fate as me. If it is delayed for a long time without a proper relief method, then I can only be forced to take one path: to dismantle and sell the machines and dismiss my workers who have been with me for more than ten years. I think there are more than one person in society in my situation. I hope the wise authorities will consider it.

### An Appeal for Cotton Textile Workers

— Zhigao

I am a glove weaver in a certain glove factory. Since I joined the glove factory last year, business has been quite smooth. Unfortunately, now I have been harmed by hoarders who have raised yarn prices privately. Between June and July, the high yarn prices were the most severe, rising directly from 20,000 to 40,000 yuan per piece, causing the prices of various cotton textiles (socks, gloves, towels, undershirts, etc.) to rise accordingly. This kind of phenomenon is truly illegal. The authorities have repeatedly issued price limits, but no one has followed them. Therefore, this time the National Government had no choice but to resort to this drastic measure, first prohibiting movement, and then implementing registration and purchase, so that unscrupulous merchants could no longer raise prices, like "rats eating their way into a rat trap." They can only await their death. Therefore, the prices of various cotton textiles have also been falling sharply in recent days.

However, this move has had a huge impact on cotton textile factories and workers. Even if you have existing yarn and have registered it, you can no longer use it to produce. So, wouldn't all the large and small cotton textile factories and workers in Shanghai have to stop working? Can all the cotton textile workers in Shanghai find jobs in other industries at once? I urge the authorities to actively conduct investigations and implement a rationing system as soon as possible, so that our cotton textile workers can suffer less pain and be able to continue working to make a living. That would be fortunate indeed.

### The Importance of Public Health

— Zhang Jishan

In densely populated areas, opening factories that harm public health has long been strictly prohibited in all civilized countries. They must be set up at a distance from the city, so as not to cause interference. Recently, when I visited a friend at the southern end of Route Ghisi, I suddenly felt a foul odor that made me want to vomit. According to my friend, there is a paint factory at the southern end of that road, between Route Foch and Route de Zikawei. Because the equipment is not complete, a kind of chemical and paint odor is scattered and dispersed during work, affecting the neighborhood. After breathing this kind of foul air, many neighbors suffer from headaches, eye irritation, nausea, and coughing. The students of Zhenying Primary School in the north are particularly affected, so it is not only annoying.

I heard that during the French Concession era, the neighbors jointly requested the French Concession health authorities to order improvements. It has been closed for more than a year, and the surrounding residents were able to breathe cleaner air. Unexpectedly, the factory reopened at the beginning of the month, releasing foul odors, causing the surrounding residents to panic and feel uneasy. The factory should strive to improve or relocate to take care of public health.

Recruitment of Service Personnel: Ten service personnel are being recruited by the organization. Food and lodging are provided, and a monthly subsidy of 300 yuan is given. Applicants must have a secondary school education, be between 20 and 35 years old, be able to endure hardship, have no bad habits, and be of sound character. Please personally write a resume, attach a 2.5-inch half-length photo, and send it to the Second Middle School of Zhoupu Town District, Pudong. If qualified, a written notice will be sent for an interview in Shanghai.

Claim for Lost Watch: While taking a trolley bus home the other morning, I found a watch in my pocket. I was quite surprised and wondered where it came from. Please come to Mr. Zheng at Hongsheng Pawnshop on Route Muling between 12:00 and 2:00 every day within a week to claim it. After the deadline, it will be used as a *Shen Bao* scholarship.
