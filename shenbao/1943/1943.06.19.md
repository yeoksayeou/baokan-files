### Re-discussing the Student Aid Movement

Our newspaper's student aid program for the next semester has now begun fundraising. Looking back at the achievements of the past four sessions (please refer to this newspaper's issue on the 16th), we deeply feel the following points: First, the increase in the number of donors and the increase in the amount of donations in each session prove that there are indeed many insightful and enthusiastic people in society. As soon as they see the student aid movement start, they are willing to donate enthusiastically to help the country and society cultivate talents. Second, from the students who have received student aid in the past, we can see several characteristics: (1) The number of applicants is almost ten times the actual power we can provide for student aid, which also shows that there are many young people in society who are ambitious but out of school. (2) The grades of the young people taking the exams are generally sufficient, and their aspirations are particularly encouraging, and it is felt that there are indeed many promising talents among the majority of out-of-school youth. (3) Among the young people taking the exams, many are children of civil servants and middle-class families. In principle, they should not accept student aid, but in reality, their parents are indeed unable to afford their schooling. Third, in terms of schools, although we have not yet conducted a thorough and general survey and statistics, we know from individual interviews that (1) most schools enthusiastically support the student aid movement. Some have specially set up student aid quotas, and some have given special preferential treatment to students who receive student aid, but generally speaking, the schools' help for student aid is still insufficient, mainly because the schools themselves have difficulties. (2) Students who receive student aid, regardless of whether they are in universities or middle schools, generally receive good reviews in terms of character, and diligence is a consistent characteristic. On the whole, they can live up to the expectations of enthusiastic people in society.

Currently, the problem is becoming more serious: First, with the soaring of prices and the increase in the burden on students in general, because public schools are limited by budget; and private schools have particularly large expenses, and most of their income has to be taken from students, it is almost inevitable that all fees will increase in public and private schools next semester. For this reason, the amount of student aid that could previously help 1,000 students go to school will inevitably be discounted in the number of students that can be helped next semester. If you want to not reduce the number of student aid places and meet actual needs, and hope to increase the number of places, the amount of student aid must be greatly increased compared to the past. Second, the current actual situation in society is that ordinary middle-class families and salaried classes have reached the point where they are unable to afford their children's education. There is currently no possibility of improving this situation, and it may become even more serious in the future. The result of this trend will inevitably create a terrible phenomenon in the country and society, that is, a large number of young people dropping out of school. This new trend forces us to loudly call out: The student aid movement is urgent! Leaders from all walks of life must be motivated by national righteousness and rise up to advocate for it!

As for our student aid methods for the next semester, we will also make some improvements in response to the aforementioned situation, that is, in addition to the general student aid movement for elementary schools, middle schools, and universities, donors can also specify to specifically subsidize students studying or learning certain subjects in a certain school, in order to expand the scope of donors and open up new avenues for the cultivation of specialized talents. At the same time, we will seek to expand the student aid quotas for elementary schools, middle schools, and universities as much as possible. We often see a contradictory phenomenon in society, that is, most children from wealthy families do not like to study, while children from poor families mostly study hard, and many apprentices in factories and shops secretly study. We sincerely hope that powerful and wealthy people in society can take a broad and long-term view and take cultivating other people's children as the greatest pleasure, so that those ambitious and hardworking children from poor families who are entrusted with the fate of the country and society in the future can all obtain the opportunity to study and go to higher education. We want to repeat that the increasingly serious phenomenon of large numbers of young people dropping out of school is a future crisis for the country and society, and the most urgent and effective way to address this is to expand the student aid movement! We hope that people from all walks of life will actively rise up and help it succeed.

Commentary and Analysis

### Anglo-American Orchestrated Coup in Spain

After the North African war, the United Kingdom and the United States repeatedly propagated a European landing operation. Based on reports from various sources regarding the Anglo-American plan for the operation and the mission of the anti-Axis forces, the key points are as follows:

The primary objective is to capture the German and Italian bases in the Mediterranean, namely the occupation of Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, the Dodecanese Islands, and the Lemnos Islands. The operational plan initially divides the Mediterranean combat area into eastern and western waters. The capture of these islands is designated as the top priority for Anglo-American forces operating in West Asia and Africa. It is reported that the United Kingdom and the United States are currently focusing on planning a landing on the European mainland, with their air forces preparing to capture these islands and bomb the western Mediterranean islands. Preparations for operations in the eastern Mediterranean waters have not yet begun, as the air force partially transferred from North Africa to Syria has not yet completed its relocation. It is widely rumored that special landing forces are currently being trained in Tunisia, Egypt, and Syria. The forces planning to land in Tunisia are composed of American troops, while the landing forces in Egypt and Syria are composed of British and Greek troops. The forces operating against Italy are temporarily dominated by American troops. The British troops participating in the Tunisian campaign, namely the British 1st and 8th Armies, are moving to Syria, Iran, and Iraq, where they will combine with the forces originally stationed in West Asia in Turkish territory to form a large army corps. This corps will respond to changes in the situation, either for operations in the Balkans or, if necessary, to prevent the southward advance of the Red Army, or will be moved to the Afghan region. In the event of any changes in the situation in India, troops can be immediately drawn from this area to respond. Therefore, the British army has a large army corps stationed in West Asia in a waiting posture.

They also want to organize Anglo-American special forces in the Spanish and French Moroccan borders, but these forces have no particularly significant combat significance, that is, from the perspective of modern warfare, they are not powerful troops. The purpose of this army is probably of political significance. The purpose of their deployment there is to overthrow General Franco's dictatorship, support the free and democratic movement in Spain, and establish a new government organized by pro-British figures, or to establish a monarchy. French Morocco is currently gathering various Spanish opposition parties to form a democratic volunteer army, which can also be seen as proof of this tendency.

The second is the Anglo-American economic manipulation after the Tunisian war. After the end of the Tunisian war, the rights to develop zinc, iron, steel, and other mineral resources in North Africa's Tunisia and Algeria were almost entirely transferred to American companies. It can be predicted that American capital will invade North Africa in the future. The connecting route to North Africa and Egypt originally ran from Dakar through the Belgian Congo to Sudan, but in the future it will be shortened to Dakar-Algeria-Nice-Egypt. Anglo-American capital has already planned to seize North African resources, not only adding new military factories to the original ones in Egypt and Syria, but it is also reported that new military factories are also under construction.

Prime Minister Tojo Declares Japanese Government's Determination in the House of Representatives

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - In the House of Representatives plenary session on the afternoon of the 18th, Prime Minister Tojo, on behalf of the government, expressed the government's determination regarding the "Defeat the United Kingdom and the United States: One Hundred Million Strong" resolution passed by the House of Representatives, stating that the unanimous and enthusiastic approval of the resolution by the House of Representatives has further encouraged the vigorous fighting spirit of the one hundred million people. The Japanese government hereby reiterates its firm determination to adapt to this unprecedented and critical war situation. The depth and intensity of the current war situation have reached the level we expected. At this moment, the Japanese government is determined to stand at the forefront of one hundred million compatriots, based on the traditional Japanese spirit of loyalty, and do its utmost to achieve the practical effect of increasing harvest and strengthening war capacity, so that the loyal and brave soldiers of the Japanese army have no worries and can fully exert their combat power, in order to advance along the path of completing the Greater East Asia War. Upon accepting this resolution, we merely reiterate the above determination of the Japanese government, and pledge to fight alongside all citizens to inherit the will of the soldiers who have died for their country, to annihilate the United Kingdom and the United States, and to strive for victory, so as to reassure the Emperor.

### House of Representatives Unanimously Passes "Defeat the United Kingdom and the United States: One Hundred Million Strong" Resolution

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - At the House of Representatives meeting this afternoon, more than eighty members, including Yuta Nagai, proposed a resolution to "Defeat the United Kingdom and the United States: One Hundred Million Strong" in order to proclaim the total war intention of the one hundred million Japanese people to the world in response to the new phase of the war situation. Yuta Nagai explained the purpose of the proposal, emphasizing that the Japanese people should take the lead in demonstrating their fighting spirit as the pioneers of the Asian nations in order to promote the rise of the Asian nations. The entire House unanimously passed the resolution. The resolution reads as follows: In accordance with the eternal Imperial Way and to realize the grand plan of Hakkō ichiu, to eliminate the aggression of the United Kingdom and the United States against East Asia for many years, to allow the one billion people to obtain their proper place, and to guide the world back to international justice, in order to achieve the ideal of human co-prosperity, this is the mission entrusted to the Imperial Country. At this great moment, the Empire deeply feels that its position and responsibilities are profound and significant. Therefore, it is determined to devote all its efforts to achieve the objectives of the war. At the same time, it will increasingly strengthen its ties with Germany, Italy, and other allied countries, so that East Asia can cooperate with each other to complete this unprecedented great undertaking. Since the outbreak of the war, the Imperial Army has repeatedly achieved unparalleled brilliant results, but the United Kingdom and the United States are attempting to rely on their own production capacity to carry out counterattacks in order to salvage their defeated decline. Therefore, the current war situation is presenting the momentum of continuous major decisive battles. We are convinced that the result will be complete victory. Therefore, at this moment, one hundred million people urgently need to consolidate their unity, develop their fearless spirit of heroism, rise up to annihilate the brutal and inhumane United Kingdom and the United States, establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and thoroughly fulfill the will of the soldiers who have died for their country, in order to comfort the loyal souls.

Nagai Explains the Reasons for the Proposal

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - During the House of Representatives meeting on the 18th to discuss the "Defeat the United Kingdom and the United States: One Hundred Million Strong Resolution," Yuta Nagai explained the reasons for the proposal. The gist of his explanation is recorded as follows: "It has been a year and a half since the Imperial Rescript declaring war was issued on December 8th of the year before last. Thanks to the courageous struggles of our military soldiers under the Imperial authority, enemy forces have been defeated and enemy bases have been destroyed anytime, anywhere in the vast battlefields extending from the American continent in the east to Madagascar in the west, and from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the Australian continent in the south. Today, the Japanese flag can be seen flying everywhere in the Greater East Asia region. The area formerly belonging to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands and now occupied by our army is 1.3 million square miles, approximately five times the size of our country's territory. These great achievements are truly rare in the history of East Asia, and deeply appreciated by our one hundred million citizens. As for the European front, the enemy, the United Kingdom and the United States, have used the German-Soviet war to either surround Germany or attempt to alienate Germany and Italy, exhausting their cunning abilities to prevent cooperation between the two countries. However, the unity of Germany and Italy has become even more consolidated. The troops of the two countries have now suppressed most of Europe. With their large-scale operations and indomitable spirit, they are joining hands with Japan to advance toward the path of building a new world order. Both the East and the West have risen up for international justice. This is a magnificent spectacle in the history of world civilization. The Greater East Asia War arose from the ideal of realizing a new world, so that all nations can obtain their proper place and all people can live in peace. It is truly the only war of human liberation that arose for justice. For many years, our Asia has suffered from the aggression of British and American imperialism, which has deprived us of our forests, extorted our resources, and exploited our labor. The East Asian nations have been cruelly trampled upon. Therefore, we should defeat the United Kingdom and the United States in Asia, liberate the nations of Asia from their violence, and build a new, independent Asia. Therefore, the victory of the Greater East Asia War will not only determine the survival of Japan, but will also determine the rise and fall of the entire Asia. When Roosevelt and Churchill met on the Atlantic Ocean the year before last, they issued a joint declaration called the "Atlantic Charter," stating that the United Kingdom and the United States respect the nations whose governments and sovereignty have been seized, and will organize governments according to their will and restore their sovereignty and independence. However, the United Kingdom and the United States are the largest aggressor countries in the world. In the past centuries, they have relied on islands in Asia, Africa, and the Americas to invade and exploit many small and weak countries. To this day, they still refuse to grant them independence and trample on their sovereignty. It is extremely contradictory to say that they will respect the independent sovereignty of small and weak countries in the future. Their self-deception in an attempt to achieve their ambition to dominate the world cannot be tolerated. Therefore, the entire nation of Asia, full of the spirit of independence and autonomy, should rise up at this time to assist the righteous advance, fight alongside Japan, and annihilate the United Kingdom and the United States. With the struggle of the Asian nations themselves, we will strive for autonomy and independence. Our Japanese people have been the pioneers of the total march of the Asian nations. In the future, we should raise the fighting spirit of one hundred million people, take the lead in suppressing the ambition of the United Kingdom and the United States to dominate Asia, and our ideal of liberating Asia has no room for compromise. Therefore, we should work hard to strengthen our war capacity with a zeal surpassing that of the United Kingdom and the United States, and implement industrial reorganization to transform the entire country into one large arsenal. I know that our citizens will deeply appreciate this. All our citizens should share the same determination as the government, cooperate to realize the consolidation of enterprises, and work hard to strengthen our war capacity. Therefore, I propose the "Defeat the United Kingdom and the United States: One Hundred Million Strong Resolution," and I dare to request a public decision."

### Minister of Greater East Asia, Aoki, Elaborates on the Co-Prosperity Sphere's Food Policy; Various Regions Striving for Food Self-Sufficiency, Minimizing Transportation Difficulties

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Greater East Asia, Aoki, responded to questions from member Togo Minoru at the House of Representatives' Food Production Increase Countermeasures Committee on the afternoon of the 17th, providing a detailed explanation of Japan's current food policy and the food production and exchange situation in Manchuria, Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, the Philippines, the islands, and other southern regions within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, stating that in terms of the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, food is basically sufficient for self-sufficiency. Currently, in order to ensure smooth food exchange between various regions, adjusting transportation is a fundamental issue. This issue is extremely important during this war period. Therefore, Japan and Manchuria both recognize that it is necessary to establish a self-sufficiency policy for major food items. Therefore, when Manchuria established its Second Five-Year Plan last year, it attached great importance to increasing agricultural production and increasing coal production, and made its greatest efforts. Although the harvest of agricultural products last year failed to reach the ideal results, the results of food purchase were better than the previous year. Therefore, soybeans and other items could be supplied to Japan, and a considerable amount of miscellaneous grains could be transported to Korea and North China. The wheat produced in Central China is generally sufficient for self-sufficiency, but because a considerable amount is transported to North China, the rice necessary for Shanghai and other cities currently has to rely on various southern regions. From Japan's perspective, Japan has great expectations for North China in terms of iron, coal, cotton, salt, and other important materials. Therefore, it is necessary to cooperate in solving the food problem in North China. In South China, most of the areas within the peace zone are centered on cities, and there are fewer agricultural areas. Therefore, if a considerable amount of rice is not imported from the southern regions, it is impossible to achieve self-sufficiency. In short, although China is actively seeking food self-sufficiency, it has not yet achieved this goal. Due to the planting of cotton and the implementation of other policies in Japan, it is necessary to import food from other regions for supplementation. In addition, the transportation problem must also be considered. The southern region, as a whole, is a rice surplus area, especially Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma, which used to export a large amount of rice. Currently, negotiations are underway with Vietnam and Thailand to supply their surplus rice to China, Japan, and other necessary regions. As for the various regions within the Japanese military administration, they are currently striving for food self-sufficiency. In order to alleviate transportation difficulties as much as possible within the possible scope, they are simultaneously striving to increase supplementation in various regions to ensure food self-sufficiency. However, it is difficult for the Malay Peninsula to achieve this goal in the near future. Therefore, it is necessary to import flour from Thailand and other southern regions nearby for adjustment. However, other southern regions such as Borneo are currently also experiencing difficulties in self-sufficiency and need to rely on foreign countries. However, most regions are currently actively engaged in increasing food production, so their future is very promising. Burma has a very abundant food production, but due to transportation reasons, it has not been able to supply as much of its surplus as possible to other food-deficient regions. At the same time, from the perspective of the people's livelihood and future food in Burma, it is not appropriate to reduce the production of rice in Burma. Therefore, within the possible scope, it should continue to produce. In short, although it is possible for China, Japan, Manchuria, and the various southern regions to seek food self-sufficiency, in order to coordinate transportation problems, Japan's current food policy is considering ways to ensure food self-sufficiency within the possible scope in Japan and the regions near Japan, such as Manchuria and other regions, and to reduce imports from afar as much as possible. Therefore, current policies are also based on this policy.

### Ambassador Cai to Japan Visited Prime Minister Tojo Yesterday Morning

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - When Prime Minister Tojo delivered his policy speech in the Diet on the 16th, he stated that in order to fundamentally improve the relationship between China and Japan, all treaties between China and Japan would be fundamentally revised. To express his gratitude to Prime Minister Tojo for this kindness, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Cai Pei, visited Prime Minister Tojo at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:30 a.m. on the 18th to express his gratitude. The gist of Ambassador Cai's remarks is recorded as follows: China's ability to complete a completely autonomous and independent country has truly achieved the ideal of the Chinese people, which is also due to the warm assistance of the friendly nation of Japan. Therefore, the future of China and Japan will be even brighter. It is truly cause for celebration for Greater East Asia and for the people of the world. I hereby offer my respectful thanks to the friendly government of Nanjing.

### Japanese Troops Stationed in China: One Week of Battle Situation

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Expeditionary Army stationed in China announced the battle situation for one week on June 18th as follows: Since the summer campaign began until June 10th, the Chongqing army suffered 30,000 casualties, 4,000 were captured, and the Japanese army seized 87 cannons, 382 heavy machine guns, and approximately 3,000 rifles, achieving significant war results. After achieving their objectives, they immediately implemented counter-offensive operations and destroyed the Chongqing army's operational center. This operation was extremely significant, and the Chongqing side believes it was an operation to invade the interior, causing deep concern. This time, the sudden reversal by the Japanese army and its strong strength have led to vigorous and false propaganda about victory. However, according to a broadcast from the Chongqing side on the 7th: In this operation, the contradictions within the Chongqing army have been deeply felt, which is a fact that is difficult to conceal. According to those returning from Chongqing: The Sichuan army in the interior is quite dissatisfied due to inferior treatment compared to the Central Army, and the entire Sichuan army is filled with ominous signs of instability. Furthermore, a part of the 50th Army of the Chongqing side in Zhejiang Province has also become unstable due to treatment issues. The Chongqing side has always disregarded these regions and used its influence to oppress them. Currently, unstable conditions are occurring successively in various places, posing a significant difficulty for the Chongqing side in terms of command.

### Director of the Japan International Culture Promotion Society, Count Kuroda, Arrives in Nanjing for Talks

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - Count Kuroda Kiyotaka, Director of the Japan International Culture Promotion Society, came to Nanjing a few days ago to promote East Asian culture and preside over the Modern Japanese Painting Exhibition, which deeply impressed the people of the capital. Afterwards, he visited places such as Shanghai and Beijing. Count Kuroda had previously been engaged in Japanese-American cultural affairs in New York, USA, for many years, and had made many efforts to promote culture between Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Now, with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in order to promote the spirit of Oriental culture, he held the Modern Japanese Painting Exhibition. Now, Count Kuroda has come to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 17th in order to further promote cultural undertakings in the Central China area, staying at the Capital Hotel. He will pay his respects to the Chairman within days. It is expected that Count Kuroda's visit to Nanjing will definitely benefit Sino-Japanese culture. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired about his feelings regarding the relationship between China and Japan in promoting international culture as follows: Culture is the foundation for constructing everything. All kinds of progress in modern international relations depend on the promotion of international culture. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, our East Asian culture is particularly important. The cultures of China and Japan have a glorious history. However, in the past, the two countries' cultures each had their own emphasis. During the Greater East Asia War, we must not only strive to develop our own national culture, but also further build Greater East Asian culture. The first priority in building Greater East Asian culture is to ensure that the thoughts of young people in both countries are correct. Therefore, during this period, the relationship between young people in China and Japan must be given attention. During my visit to China, I sincerely hope that Chinese youth will cooperate more with Japanese youth to build Greater East Asian culture. At the same time, international culture will also be promoted as a result.

### Fierce Air Battle Over Lunga Point Sea Area, Japanese Aircraft Heavily Damage Transport Convoy, Sink Many Enemy Transport Ships, Shoot Down 32 Enemy Aircraft

Dongdong, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 p.m. today: On the 16th of this month, the Imperial Naval Air Force, with a combined large formation of fighters and bombers, fiercely attacked the enemy transport convoy in the Lunga Point sea area of Guadalcanal Island. As of the 18th, the verified battle results are as follows: Four large transport ships sunk, two medium transport ships sunk, one small transport ship sunk, one large transport ship damaged, one destroyer sunk, and 32 or more aircraft shot down. Twenty of our aircraft have not returned. (Note) This battle is referred to as the Lunga Point sea area air battle.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Naval Air Force launched a strong attack on the enemy transport convoy in the Lunga Point sea area of Guadalcanal Island on the afternoon of June 16th, achieving extremely significant war results. This is truly the largest war result since the naval battle off the island of Henieier, which Japan became mired in this year. A total of four enemy large transport ships, two medium transport ships, one small transport ship, and one destroyer were sunk, and one large transport ship was damaged. In addition, more than 32 enemy aircraft were shot down. On that day, the Japanese Naval Air Force, after receiving reports of an enemy large transport convoy being discovered, launched a large-scale operation to crush the enemy's attempt to counterattack in one fell swoop. At that time, dozens of enemy fighters responsible for sentinel duty in the sky were already waiting to intercept. It is said that the enemy had already adopted this tactic of waiting for interception when Japanese aircraft attacked Russel Island on the 12th of this month. However, the Japanese Naval Air Force still rushed into the enemy's solid fighter formations with all aircraft. More than 100 aircraft from both sides launched a large dogfight in the air. Japanese aircraft immediately shot down more than 32 enemy aircraft. At the same time, the Japanese bomber formations, braving intense gunfire from the sea and land, began bombing the enemy convoy, and in an instant, destroyed seven of them. Furthermore, one enemy destroyer and two medium transport ships were sunk by Japanese aircraft body crashes. In this battle, twenty Japanese aircraft were unrecovered or self-exploded. This is the first major battle since the South Pacific naval battle on October 26th. Most of the enemy ships sunk this time were transport ships, totaling approximately 53,000 tons, and these ships were all carrying troops and heavy fire resources, so the damage to the enemy was extremely great.

### Two-Week Anniversary of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: Today is the two-week anniversary of the signing of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty. German political figures and journalists have expressed their views, saying that Germany has recognized Turkey's strong determination to maintain neutrality. The claims spread by Britain and the United States that Turkey has chosen a course favorable to the anti-Axis forces are merely part of their psychological warfare. Germans are extremely satisfied with Turkey's protection of German-Turkish friendship and its inviolability.

Istanbul, 18th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: Turkish interviewer Sha Jianke published an article in yesterday's Aksham newspaper, stating that the Turkish-German Friendship Treaty signed on June 18, 1941, can be called a masterpiece of politics, and the whole world has benefited from it. Fortunately, due to the two countries' sincerity and consideration of mutual interests, the Balkan War was stopped at the Turkish border, and the Middle East and Near East were spared from war. The conclusion of this treaty was not forced, but based on the interests of both parties, and will maintain its important nature under any circumstances.

Some believe that the Axis powers may launch military operations in the Near East in the near future. On the other hand, the Axis powers are now doing their best to step up their "psychological warfare."

### Turkey and France Deny Rumors of Severing Diplomatic Relations

Ankara, 18th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency correspondent in the Turkish capital reports that the rumors spread by the United States that Turkey and France are about to sever diplomatic relations were denied yesterday afternoon by responsible Turkish officials and the French Embassy here.

Special Issue on North China

### Japan's New Policy Towards China and the Situation in North China

(Special dispatch from Beijing) Following China's participation in the war, Japan has launched a new policy towards China. What is the impact of this in North China? How to materialize it? And how will the autonomous participatory system entrusted to North China under the new policy develop? Based on a comprehensive understanding of the local situation and the views of various parties, a brief description is as follows:

(1) Generally speaking, the spirit of Japan's policy towards China has been fully implemented by both Chinese and Japanese authorities and the people in North China. Various specific measures in politics, economy, and culture are being actively promoted by both China and Japan in close cooperation, gradually getting on track.

(2) However, due to Japan's earnest implementation of the new policy towards China, both Chinese and Japanese people initially failed to grasp the true meaning of the new policy. The Chinese side did not deeply reflect on the fact that it was based on the solemn fact of participation in the war and endowed with autonomy. Similarly, the Japanese side also had pessimists who viewed the new policy as a retreat from China. On this point, efforts must be made to thoroughly implement the true meaning of the new policy in the future.

(3) After the implementation of the new policy, the expansion of Chinese autonomy has its limitations, priorities, and urgency in carrying out the Greater East Asia War. The Chinese side should fully reflect on this. The Japanese side should also take appropriate measures to rationally handle various specific measures. The participatory system in North China will be further strengthened as a result of resolving this issue.

(4) The so-called issue of the special characteristics of North China can only be resolved by focusing on North China's contribution to the war as the highest proposition. The original level of the special characteristics of North China, in expanding and developing into the special period of all of China in the Greater East Asia War, has no reason to continue to exist alone. However, today's situation in China is such that all of China has not yet been united into one, and it has not yet demonstrated the full development of contributing to the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the special characteristics of North China cannot but continue to exist.

(5) The entry and settlement of the National Government in North China should also be based on the aforementioned supreme proposition as a prerequisite. If there is an eagerness to centralize North China, it will instead hinder North China's contribution to Japan and greatly appease the people, giving the Chinese Communists an opportunity to take advantage of. Fortunately, the National Government's attitude has been extremely cautious so far, and the rapid centralization work has been quite cautious.

When the reporter came to Beijing, he was questioned by Chinese and Japanese people who asked: "To what extent is Chinese autonomy concretely recognized? What are the limits of the centralization of North China and the special characteristics of North China, which aim to strengthen the National Government?" The key to solving this problem lies entirely in North China's contribution to Japan. Regardless of political or economic issues, in short, all local measures should focus on being able to follow the principle of efficiency in order to adapt to this supreme proposition.

Japan's new policy towards China is by no means to force China to bear heavy burdens. The foundation of Sino-Japanese cooperation cannot be the principle of equal sharing centered on the principle of efficiency. The vast capital and outstanding technology required for the development of important resources, transportation, communications, and other projects still depend on Japan's supply, and therefore Japan's leadership cannot but be recognized. Crushing Chongqing and the Chinese Communists is becoming increasingly important in the future.

As for the people's livelihood policy, Chinese autonomy should be made to flourish, and the mission of completing China's participation in the war should be promoted. After the new policy guidelines are fully understood, the North China Expeditionary Army will only have the task of a field army. Apart from operations and security, everything should be let go. A large number of Japanese members of the New People's Society have also withdrawn, and those who remain stand in cooperation with China as advisors. As for the economic aspect, the prices of daily necessities and the sales and distribution are all placed under the unified organization of the Chinese agency, the Material and Price Management Committee, with the Japanese side participating in the plan as a unit of its lower-level organization. All of these represent significant changes due to the new policy. From the Chinese perspective, it represents an expansion of autonomy.

In short, one of the important tasks in the local area in the future is the rational implementation of the principle of Sino-Japanese sharing, and to strengthen positive cooperation between China and Japan on its results.

The special characteristics of North China have a triple nature. On the one hand, North China is the front line of anti-communism, and on the other hand, North China is the center of Sino-Japanese economic relations. China itself, historically and geographically, forms a different area from the south of China. The National Government's participation in the war naturally expands these issues to all of China, but the reality of China cannot be solved by the slogan of participation in the war alone, and there are many difficulties. Not only because of the remaining Chongqing forces, the transformation of these special characteristics into the whole of China is impossible, but also because the National Government's own problems also feel this deeply. In short, the politics of North China have a strong lingering color of the Provisional Government. In economics, the boundaries between the Joint Reserve Certificates and Reserve Certificates shown in the currency are extremely clear. From the perspective of strengthening the National Government to unify the whole of China, although these must be amended sooner or later, the reality is not so simple.

Regarding the issue of the centralization of North China, a powerful Chinese figure expressed his opinion to the reporter as follows:

The centralization of North China is certainly a good thing, but before that, the people who were in charge of the politics of North China were politicians from North China. Are they to be despised? First, it must be examined whether the North China politicians lack the ability to be in charge of the politics of North China? Secondly, it must be examined who in the National Government can be in charge of the politics of North China. Can that person gain the support of the North China people and implement a better policy than the current one?

This is probably the opinion of the general public in North China. The hoarding problem that has recently arisen in Shanghai has further exacerbated this question. Regarding the handling of important events that test the political power of the National Government, it is hoped that the National Government will give it deep consideration. The Greater East Asia War is now in the autumn of a decisive battle for survival. The base of the military supplies, North China, cannot tolerate any chaos. It is expected that the National Government will strengthen itself and not allow unreasonable political power to infiltrate North China. (Xiang: Translated from the June 7th Seibu Asahi Shimbun)

### Economic Reorganization in North China's Participation in the War: Increased Food Production and Price Suppression

(Special dispatch from Tianjin on the 8th by special correspondent Nakamura) Due to the National Government's participation in the war and Japan's implementation of a new policy towards China, the North China economy has undergone a historic transformation. Various economic measures, stemming from the demands of the people's livelihood policy and as the basis for cooperation with Japan, are being concretely implemented. Therefore, the mission of North China's economy in participating in the war is extremely important. The adjustment of trade between North China and Central China, as well as issues such as food and prices, are also getting on track. Since the Greater East Asia War, North China has been isolated from the world market, so it has had high expectations for the rice, flour, and other food supplies from Central China. Central China also urgently needs the coal supply from North China, so the relationship of mutual dependence between the two sides is rapidly becoming closer. Therefore, the smooth flow of goods between North China and Central China has become an urgent task. The North China-Central China Trade Promotion Agreement held in Shanghai earlier was based on this demand and outlined the direction of the period.

The important policies decided at the meeting were to exchange North China's coal for Central China's flour. In the future, when North China and Central China trade, the exchange rate of 18 yuan for Joint Reserve Certificates and Reserve Certificates will be maintained, while the exchange rates for special yuan and Shanghai exchange will remain the same.

However, it must be noted that when adjusting goods between North China and Central China, Central China goes through the National Commercial Control Association, while North China goes through the North China Trade Organization Association. However, the National Commercial Control Association not only adjusts goods shipped from Central China to North China, but also unifies the acquisition and supply of goods in Central China. It will also set up branches in Tianjin and Guangzhou to break down the regional economies of Central China, North China, and South China as its basic policy. However, from the perspective of North China's intentions, at least for the time being, it will stop at setting up a control association in North China. The relationship between North China and Central China is naturally a trend that parallels the political approach, but its implementation will of course be gradual, because in the establishment of the decisive war system in North China itself, there are still many tasks that need to be resolved, namely the food problem and the price problem. If the people's livelihood cannot be stabilized, the development and increased production of North China's resources will be impossible. North China is now overcoming the difficult problems that have accumulated step by step, and is developing a decisive war system, but suppressing prices and ensuring food self-sufficiency are the basis for strengthening production in North China in the future.

The North China Political Affairs Committee has previously established the North China Price Processing Committee and the Food Administration Bureau, and under its supervision, established the Food Quick Transport Company in each province and special city, in order to ensure the input of previous food supplies, increase local production, and establish a procurement mechanism.

As for the issue of rising prices, it has recently become even more prominent. Whether in stabilizing the people's livelihood or reorganizing the economy for war participation, it is hoped that a plan for stabilization will be drafted as soon as possible.

The recent causes of rising prices are the hoarding by the consumer class and the prevalence of barter trade due to the difficulty in obtaining food supplies. The Food Administration Bureau and the North China Material and Price Processing Committee have established a Material Balance Fund Operation Committee to handle material and material countermeasures in a unified manner. Furthermore, they are closely coordinating with the North China Central Material Price Cooperation Association and the price cooperation associations in China to move towards establishing a wartime price policy. The situation encountered in North China after the implementation of the new policy is extremely difficult and serious in terms of the price problem alone. To break through this difficult situation, fully exert the political power of the North China Political Affairs Committee, and implement the various economic measures following the change policy one by one, is currently the most important task in North China, and is the mission of North China.

### Public Concession Baojia: Deadline for Re-checking Household Registration, Detailed Report and Guarantee Required; Head of Household Responsible for Changes

The Public Concession Baojia authorities, in order to investigate citizen certificates and any cases of falsely reported population, have recently ordered the Baojia chiefs of each district to handle the following three matters: (1) Each Jia chief must conduct a detailed investigation within their jurisdiction. If there are any cases of citizens who have not obtained citizen certificates or have falsely reported population, they must immediately submit a detailed report. This work must be completed within ten days, and a guarantee must be provided. Accordingly, the Jia chiefs of each district will submit a pre-printed guarantee form to the head of each household to fill out, sign, and stamp, in order to demonstrate their seriousness. The content of the guarantee states: "There are no cases of falsely reported population in this household, nor do we have any residents who have not obtained citizen certificates. We guarantee that no such incidents will occur in the future. Otherwise, the head of this household will bear full responsibility and will not shirk." (2) Citizens who move to other districts or other cities must surrender their citizen certificates. However, those on short-term travel are allowed to take their citizen certificates with them. If there are any citizens who move without surrendering their citizen certificates, the head of the household must submit a detailed report. If any incidents occur due to delays, the head of the household will bear full responsibility. (3) For citizens who move into this district from other cities and whose good citizen certificates or other proof documents have been lost, the head of the household and the Jia chief shall provide proof, confirming that they are indeed good citizens. If any incidents occur, the head of the household and the Jia chief will bear joint responsibility.

### ### Spokesman for Japanese Army Releases Statement

Yesterday, the spokesman for the press department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai released a statement, saying that Prime Minister Tojo's speech at the Japanese Diet on the 16th of this month was of great significance, and that the Chongqing side has been greatly agitated recently. Furthermore, the military spokesman for the Chongqing side issued a statement on the 17th, showing that they were clearly affected by Prime Minister Tojo's speech. In his speech, Prime Minister Tojo stated that Japan's launch of the Greater East Asia War was to eliminate the century-long Anglo-American aggression against East Asia, and to liberate East Asia from Anglo-American oppression. Japan will spare no effort to promote the task of Greater East Asia, and those who cooperate with Japan include China, Burma, and the Philippines. Prime Minister Tojo specifically pointed out that the opportunity for Burma and the Philippines to achieve independence will soon mature, which has attracted much attention from all parties, especially the Chongqing side, which was greatly agitated. Recently, General Pang Bingxun, a person of great importance and prestige in Chongqing, has come to join the peace movement under the leadership of Chairman Wang, which is an obvious fact. The Chongqing military spokesman issued a statement, claiming that they were being threatened, and mentioned that the return of Generals Pang Bingxun, Sun Dianying, and Rong Ziheng was not voluntary. Now that the facts are clear, General Pang personally took the opportunity to go to Beijing to visit the Chairman and meet with various ministries, and gave a speech. Therefore, the Chongqing side's fabrications and slander are not worth discussing. Regarding the recent Roosevelt-Churchill conference, although we have not obtained the details, at least two proposals could not be decided: some advocated for operations in Europe, while others advocated for operations in the Pacific, and the debate was endless. Mutual exploitation made it impossible to talk about unity and connection. However, Chongqing is being sacrificed, and the Anglo-Americans are simply using its base, which is of no benefit to Chongqing itself. Even the recent proposal in the US Congress to abolish the Chinese Exclusion Act, which has been superficially agreed to, is only a temporary phenomenon. The US has no genuine sincerity towards Chongqing. In fact, even if there is such an attitude, it is only for wartime exploitation. This is a deceptive tactic by the US towards Chongqing. The Chongqing side is being exploited and fooled on this recent Allied Nations Day, and is unaware of it, and even proudly displays 32 national flags, believing it to be an honor. This mob does not even know that there are powerful countries outside of these 32 nations. It is feared that before long, a white flag will be added to the 32 flags. By then, this boastful act will be unimaginable. Furthermore, after Stilwell, the US official in charge in Chongqing, returned to Chongqing, he met with Western journalists and expressed concern about the war situation in Chongqing, and stated that the US was making considerable preparations for Chongqing, and how to strengthen it, and stated that the US's 14th Air Force in Chongqing was actively cooperating with the Chongqing ground forces in combat, in order to emphasize and promote future combat. However, this can already be seen in Dongting Lake and Yichang, which can already demonstrate the extent of US-Chongqing combat cooperation. The result is not only ineffective, but has also suffered惨 defeat. To briefly summarize, from May 1st to June 6th, Chongqing-US aircraft were dispatched a total of 127 times, with 222 aircraft departing for bombing missions. During this period, the results of the battle were 17 Japanese aircraft shot down, and 22 aircraft destroyed or damaged. This statistical figure does not include reports that have not yet been compiled. However, in this battle, the Chongqing-US air force is vastly different from the Japanese air force. The US cannot compete with the Japanese air force, because the Japanese air force's excellent qualifications are due to good preparation and long-term training, and the repeated destruction of the US-Chongqing air force is enough to demonstrate the superiority of the Japanese air force. Furthermore, it is said that although it cannot be determined that the cooperation between the US-Chongqing air forces cannot be linked, the Chongqing army is unwilling to have the US air force take the glory of the battle, and is unwilling to carry out the missions of the US commander. Therefore, since the US-Chongqing air forces do not have sufficient sincerity to cooperate, how can there be any effect?

### Chief Hirota Releases Statement

Yesterday, Information Chief Hirota, spokesman for the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office, released a statement:

Developing Resources

Chief Hirota first mentioned the purpose of Prime Minister Tojo's speech, regarding the issue of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere organization and the close organization that is fundamental to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, explaining that a bill has been passed in this Diet to organize Japan's domestic industries and collect and develop resources in the South Seas and China, in order to strengthen war capabilities. The purpose of the discussions in this Diet is to organize Greater East Asia's politics and economy in order to address fundamental issues of how they can be organized. Special emphasis is placed on China to support China's economic and political strength, and Japan is preparing to adjust the various treaties concluded between China and Japan, in order to strengthen the cooperative relationship between China and Japan. In addition, the Philippines was also explained, and it will be granted independence within this year. Regarding the Burma issue, it was said that an independence preparation committee was first established on May 8 of this year, and once preparations are complete, it can be self-governed. At the same time, regarding the Dutch East Indies issue, the people of Java will obtain political participation,

Region or Organization

Therefore, the pure significance of Tojo's speech and the policies being implemented lie in the issue of large-region national organization, in other words, the organization of large-region groups and the organization of large-region national groups. Chief of Information Hirota continued: Why does Japan advocate for large-region national organization? The reason is that from the perspective of the current international situation, in terms of wartime preparation for military force and food, small countries will find it difficult to exist. For example, when the First World War ended in 1919, Great Italy had already declared bankruptcy. Austria has a narrow area and a population of eight million, most of whom live in the capital city of Vienna, with no production capacity. Even if they rely on agriculture to live, they cannot be economically independent.

Ancient and Modern Military Affairs

Furthermore, from a military perspective, due to the rapid changes in modern weapons and strategies, the strength of large countries and small countries is vastly different. Today, the development of material and industrialization, and the development of combat strategies, have reached their greatest scale. Airplanes travel at 700 kilometers per hour. Once combat begins, small countries will suffer the poison of large countries. In 1939, during the German-Polish war, Poland was resolved within a week after the start of combat. From this perspective, we can understand that it is most important to have sufficient food and industrial resources in a large area for economic and military matters.

Strengthening War Capabilities

Regarding the significance of the reorganization of domestic industries in Japan, Japan has the responsibility to protect the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and must strengthen war capabilities in order to enrich the power of protective operations. Among them, petroleum is abundant in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the development of the continuing rights must be accelerated. Today, the land and naval forces, and light and heavy industries, are the main forces for protecting Greater East Asia.

In summary, the organization of a large-region group of countries is an urgent task to adapt to the current international situation. The countries of East Asia must unite and undertake the mission of protecting East Asia, and devote all their efforts to developing the economy and reviving the culture. It is hoped that China will deeply recognize this important significance.

### Embezzling Over Two Million in Funds

Xu Shengyu, from Jianren, was doing business in Putian and jointly invested with his nephew, You Shoutin, to open Yuhua Shenzhuang at No. 2 Ji'an Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, French Concession, with Xu investing seven-tenths of the capital and You serving as the manager of Yuhua. In the morning, Xu remitted one million and two hundred thousand yuan from Putian to Shanghai, and You purchased goods. Later, You used the excuse of disrupted transportation and inability to transport the goods and secretly sold and embezzled the funds. Recently, the matter came to Shanghai for unsuccessful negotiations, and a lawyer was commissioned to report the matter to the French Concession Police, who detained You. Over ten thousand yuan worth of goods were recovered. Yesterday, he was interrogated. The plaintiff requested a civil lawsuit to recover damages or return the goods. The sentence is scheduled for the 22nd. In addition, Liu Hanqing, from Fujian, remitted over one million yuan to Shanghai last year, entrusting Yuhua Shenzhuang to purchase wool and cotton yarn. You Shouting, the manager of Yuhua Zhuang, embezzled the goods. Recently, Liu came to Shanghai to negotiate without success, and Liu hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit.

### 10,000 Bags of Flour, Emergency Relief Association Temporarily Postpones Purchase Because the Flour Has Already Been Purchased by Merchants

The North China Emergency Relief Association had previously decided to purchase 10,000 bags of No. 4 flour first and transport it to the north as soon as possible, and had sent a letter to Tongrun Qianzhuang for a loan of 1.6 million yuan to be used for purchasing flour. It is now learned that this move has encountered a change of plans, because this flour has already been purchased by merchants, and the association is now looking for other ways.

The Hebei Native Place Association in Shanghai's radio fundraising results: a total of 194,286 yuan and some cents were collected within seven days, with 652,686.86 yuan outstanding. Li Tianzhen, president of the World Red Swastika Society and standing director of the association, broadcasted Peking opera on the French radio station on the 16th of this month, with excellent results. Donations reached 70,000 yuan on that day, which was quite unexpected. In addition, the China Film Company plans to screen a few days’ worth of movie tickets at a designated theater, and the full amount of the ticket sales will be allocated for emergency relief.

Zhejiang's First District Advances 200,000

Shen Erqiao, Administrative Inspector of the First District of Zhejiang Province, initiated emergency relief for the North China disaster, and the Special Commissioner's Office advanced 50,000 yuan from the treasury, Wankang Company advanced 100,000 yuan, and Ningbo Cooperative advanced 50,000 yuan, for a total of 200,000 yuan in national currency. It was first remitted to the Hangzhou Provincial Government free of charge by the Central Reserve Bank on the morning of the 8th for emergency relief.

### Performing Dance Skills for Charity Auction to Help Disaster Relief

Mr. Hong Jiong and Ms. Jiang Hua performed dance skills on the evenings of the 15th and 16th of this month at the Great World. They auctioned off gifts from friends on the spot, raising a total of 19,400 yuan. All the proceeds were used for the North China disaster relief and handed over to the Yarn Industry Bank for collection. The enthusiastic act is highly commendable. The list of titles and amounts of friends who enthusiastically purchased for disaster relief is as follows: Li Yao 300 yuan, Tao Youxiang 600 yuan, Qiao Zhengrong 300 yuan, Lu Runsheng 700 yuan, Chen Yongtang Zhou Weibin, Mr. W.S., Huang Jiarui, 300 yuan each, Ms. Han Jianming 3,600 yuan, Sun Ziqian 700 yuan, Xu Jinlou 200 yuan, anonymous 2,900 yuan, Zhang Zhongyuan 200 yuan, Zhou Jinghe, Zhang Liangzhi 400 yuan each, Zhang Chengxi 500 yuan, Mrs. Zhang 700 yuan, Wu Rongrong 200 yuan, Mr. Li 1,700 yuan, Zhang Xingsheng 700 yuan, Wang Lijun 300 yuan, Xu Zixiu 400 yuan, Ni Qinsheng 100 yuan, Shi Jifu 500 yuan, Chen Guangyu, Chen Guangyu, Liu Fanglian, 200 yuan each, Mr. Wang 100 yuan, Lu Zichuan 1,000 yuan, Mr. Wang 900 yuan, Lu Zichuan 1,000 yuan, Le Shichuan 300 yuan, little sister 200 yuan, totaling 19,400 yuan.

### District Court Actively Dispersing Inmates

The total number of inmates detained in the Shanghai District Court Detention Center is close to 1,000, and pre-trial detainees account for half of them. The weather is becoming increasingly hot, which is not only detrimental to hygiene, but also, in recent months, due to the scarcity of food sources, it is difficult to obtain even a grain of rice. If we do not make efforts to alleviate the congestion in the prisons, then diseases and starvation will follow, and the problem is serious and cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is understood that Court President Wu Zongxing, in addition to contacting the relevant parties regarding transferred prisoners and submitting a request to the ministry for approval of relocation and dispersal, requires all pre-trial detainees to have their cases reviewed by the handling prosecutors, strictly implement bail based on the circumstances of the case, and pay attention to expediting case closures, which will benefit both prison administration and criminal policy.

### Su Yizhi Case, Difficult-to-Forget Report Still Awaiting Translation

In the case of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School, who was beaten to death by Liu Wangshi, the mother of student Liu Zhijun, the Difficult-to-Forget report has been delivered in the past few days. The content generally finds that there is no poison in Su Yizhi's stomach, and there are no injuries on the whole body, but there is a slight swelling on the temple of the face, and blood is flowing from both ears, which must be caused by a ruptured eardrum. Yesterday morning, the case was again interrogated by the Second Criminal Court. The victim's family member, Secretary Shi, and a lawyer, as well as the elder sister of the deceased, Su Fengying, appeared in court, and the defendant also hired a lawyer to appear in court. According to lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station, the report on the case from the 工部局 Public Works Department's health department and the forensic examination report were only delivered yesterday afternoon, and the translation work has not yet been completed, so it is still necessary to study which articles to use for prosecution, and a request was made for another extension. The court ordered Liu Wangshi to be held pending rescheduling for interrogation on the morning of the 23rd.

### Mr. Gao Hanqing's Eightieth Birthday, Celebration Funds Transferred to Charitable Causes

The 20th of this month is the 80th birthday of Mr. Gao Hanqing, a pioneer in the cultural field and founder of the Commercial Press. Leaders from all walks of life believe that Mr. Gao's life's work has contributed to the cultural field, and a public celebration has been scheduled for 3:00 PM at the YMCA. Mr. Gao, being modest and self-effacing, first donated 10,000 yuan himself to save the flood victims in North China and Shantou. All cash received from relatives and friends will also be distributed to various charitable organizations for orphans and the elderly.

### Japanese Residents' Frugality Movement, Wearing Old Clothes as a Way to Save

In order to respond to the simplification of clothing and the textile conservation movement in Japan, the Shanghai Japanese residents have decided to fully launch the "Decisive Battle Clothing Life Movement" by the Total Mobilization Patriotic Association. The residents' association has already worn type B national uniforms made of cotton. The embassy and consulate-general have also decided to wear collared shirts and shorts without ties. At the same time, they are advocating wearing old clothes. The Shanghai Office of the Embassy has stipulated that during the summer work period from the 21st of this month to the end of August, all staff members must not wear coats, do not use ties, and only wear collared shirts and shorts, except on the Great Edict Day (the 8th of each month) and when participating in ceremonies, when they must still dress properly.

### Tenth Anniversary of Life Elementary School

Life Elementary School on Gordon Road was founded by the current principal, Ms. Sheng Wenguang, and has been around for ten years. Yesterday, the school held its tenth anniversary celebration. Fang Wen, a twelve-year-old child and graduate of the school, also held a solo exhibition of calligraphy and painting. School board members Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Sheng Pihua, and Lu Dagong all visited and admired the exhibition, and were all amazed, giving the student high praise. Wen will donate some of his works for a charity sale to help with the disaster relief in North China. The school has expanded its facilities significantly over the past ten years, which has cost a lot of money, all of which has been subsidized by the school board and Principal Sheng. The school is also very strict in terms of discipline and education, and it is no accident that it has achieved today's results, which can serve as a model for elementary schools in Shanghai.

Please feel free to raise any opinions you may have for discussion. Finally, he said that Japan pays great attention to introducing its culture to China at any time, but it is rare for China to introduce its culture to Japan in the same way as Japan.

### Earnestly Hoping That All Sectors Will Maintain Their Consistent Spirit and Sponsor the Fifth Annual Shen Bao Scholarship Fund, The More Donations, the More Young People Will Benefit; The Amount of Funding Needed This Year Will Definitely Be Enormous

Applications for the Fifth Annual Shen Bao Reader Scholarship will begin on July 1st, and all procedures are being prepared. In recent days, we have received several inquiries from students every day about the application process. During this period when schools are conducting exams, we earnestly hope that all students will pay attention to improving their academic performance. If they are indeed poor and outstanding, they will definitely be able to obtain a scholarship from this newspaper.

Bring Your Credentials to Collect the Application Form in Person

As for the application regulations for this year's scholarship, they will be announced in this newspaper when the deadline arrives. Applying students must bring their credentials in person to the office to collect the application form. No one may collect it on their behalf, and no requests by mail will be accepted. Those who are sick or who have left Shanghai to return to their hometown during the summer vacation must also have a certificate from the school authorities before it can be issued. However, those who fail to arrive in time for the exam at another place will have their application qualifications revoked.

The Need for Scholarships is More Urgent Than Before

The need for scholarships is increasingly urgent, as past practices have shown that each subsequent session has been more important than the previous one. The reason for this is the increasing financial difficulties of the students, and some students would have dropped out of school two or three years ago if they had not received a scholarship. Therefore, if the scholarship can receive permanent and consistent assistance from all sectors of society, the number of talents that will be cultivated is countless. Moreover, this newspaper firmly believes that each yuan of scholarship given to poor and outstanding young people will have a greater effect than the ten yuan or one hundred yuan wasted by纨袴子弟 the sons of wealthy officials. Therefore, the greater the expenditure on scholarships, the deeper the comfort this newspaper receives, and the more obvious the function of social mutual assistance becomes. Our colleagues are willing to work tirelessly to serve the generous donors from all sectors of society, and to speak on behalf of the poor students. The more donations, the wider the benefit, and the greater the cultivation. This is the wish of our colleagues, and the hope of the students.

Do Not Forget the Poor While Celebrating

Yesterday, we received a letter from Principal Huang of the China Textile Dyeing Industry Supplementary School, stating that it was the birthday of Mr. Wu Zhongyi, the father of school board member Wu Zhongyi. While celebrating, Mr. Wu felt the number of out-of-school youths in Shanghai, and specifically instructed the school to transfer 2,000 yuan in national currency to be donated to this newspaper's scholarship fund to advocate for it. Mr. Wu founded a supplementary school to benefit employees, and his contributions are immeasurable. Now, he has generously donated a large sum of money, with enthusiasm for education, to benefit society. This is worthy of admiration, and it is a testament to the deep insight of those engaged in education.

Scholarships Received Yesterday

The list of titles and amounts of scholarships received yesterday is as follows: Wu Zhongyi 2,000 yuan, Fei Qihe (saving the expenses of the soup cake banquet for the one-month celebration of his daughter Zhaoyun) 1,000 yuan, Xu Leshentang. Zhu Chishen 200 yuan each, Gongji 100 yuan, Senlin (manuscript fee) 20 yuan, Shen Zhong. (manuscript fee) Wang Jiajie. (manuscript fee) 16 yuan each, Lizhi Middle School (lost and found by students during the semester) 7 yuan, totaling 3,579 yuan in reserve notes, with a balance of 453,831.59 yuan.

Economic Commentary

### Future of Small Banks

Because the Ministry of Finance has decided to reorganize the various small banks, stipulating that they cannot operate unless their capital reaches 3 million yuan, the future of these small banks only has two paths: "increasing capital" and "merging." This measure, from the perspective of the entire financial institution, certainly has a positive impact.

However, we believe that while setting requirements for the capital of banks is very important, the inspection of banking operations is even more crucial and should not be overlooked. Regardless of the scope or capital of a bank, if its business operations are not on the right track, the greater the capital, the greater the harm. The result would be inversely proportional, which is deeply concerning, isn't it?

The government, with great effort, has devised this method to improve finance and benefit the people's livelihood. Banks should understand this intention well and do their best to assist, so as to produce great results. When we think of the current situation of widespread disasters and the people's livelihood in decline, how can we not be vigilant and implement these measures naturally?

There are many ways to self-discipline: In a negative sense, it means refraining from improper business operations. In a positive sense, it means assisting the government in developing production industries to revive the people's livelihood. Recently, there have been reports that silver and money businesses are forming loan syndicates to invest in production industries. Regardless of the investment path, whether it's rural loans or industrial loans, anything that benefits the social and national economic future is worthy of our joy and praise.

We firmly believe that in today's banking industry, only by investing in production industries can the foundation be solid. At the same time, we also believe that only through cooperation between the government and the people, and diligent promotion, can the banking industry have great achievements. In this time of national crisis, the banking industry, which bears the responsibility for regulating finance, should practice self-discipline and self-encouragement, make more contributions, and meet the expectations of the public!

### Commercial Control Committee Passes Temporary Wheat Unified Purchase Plan, Implementing Unified Wheat Purchase

The National Commercial Control Committee held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday and passed a temporary plan for the unified purchase of wheat. The committee has submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval today. However, due to the urgency of the situation, which cannot be delayed, the Flour and Wheat Industry Committee has been instructed to begin implementation immediately according to the newly established plan. Any amendments or changes required by the Executive Yuan will be communicated separately later.

### Temporary Wheat Unified Purchase Plan

Consists of ten key points, which will be published separately in today's column for reference.

Centralized Management of the Purchase and Sale System

The plan centralizes the wheat buying and selling system, stipulating that wheat dealers in central locations purchase from producing areas and sell to commissioned and trading merchants. Commissioned merchants can sell the purchased wheat to flour mills or to traders in Area A. Traders can sell the purchased wheat to commissioned merchants in Area B, or vice versa. In other words, the wheat raw materials used by flour mills in various regions can be purchased from commissioned merchants in those regions. Commissioned merchants then purchase directly from traders and wheat dealers in central locations.

Locations for Establishing Branch Offices

The National Commercial Control Association's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has provisionally decided on the locations for establishing branch offices: Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Taixian, Nanjing, Wuhu, and Bengbu, totaling nine locations for branch offices. The locations for establishing sub-branch offices are: Hangzhou, Kunshan, Changshu, Taicang, Jiangyin, Danyang, Qishuyan, Benniu, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Baoying, Yizheng, Jiangyan, Xinghua, Dongtai, Nantong, Chuxian, Luzhou, Anqing, and Mingguang, totaling twenty locations.

### Central Bank Restricts Discount and Loan Measures

The Central Reserve Bank, in order to support the development of industry and commerce, handles bill rediscount business, etc. However, to prevent speculation and hoarding, the following types of bills will not be purchased or rediscounted, nor will they be used as collateral for other loans: (1) Bills arising from long-term speculation in the purchase of real estate, mineral products, houses, machinery, etc.; (2) Bills arising from consumption purposes and not used for current business needs; (3) Bills arising from speculative transactions. At the same time, in accordance with the revised Central Reserve Bank Law, the bank is not allowed to directly engage in various industrial and commercial activities or provide credit loans or overdrafts for businesses with speculative characteristics. As for the real estate acquired by the bank, it is limited to the following: (1) Real estate necessary for business operations; (2) Real estate acquired due to debt repayment.

### Chinese Stock Firms Plan Centralized Trading

The 35 Chinese stock firms in this city, after being granted permission to resume business, are earnestly adopting a policy of self-discipline to promote industrial and commercial enterprises and guide idle funds into the regular market. In order to promote centralized trading, they have been actively discussing various strategies in recent days to ensure the active turnover of stocks while preventing speculation and hoarding. It is also understood that the 35 Chinese stock firms, including Xingye and Yongchang, have temporarily organized the "Chinese Stock Firm Friendship Association" to coordinate all business matters in the future. All matters concerning communication with various authorities, payment of registration fees, and handling of settlements will be discussed by the association.

### Municipal Food Supply to be Coordinated by Joint Cooperative

The Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Cooperative, which has been in preparation for a long time, is reportedly ready to commence operations. The directors and supervisors are scheduled to take office today. According to information obtained by reporters from the cooperative, although the supply of rice to residents in the concession area will still be managed by the Municipal Council through the issuance of rice tickets, the transportation and coordination of the supply will be the responsibility of the cooperative, which will begin discussing detailed procurement plans in the coming days.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks fluctuated yesterday, with inconsistent ups and downs. Among public utilities, China Electric advanced rapidly, while Zhabei Water and Electricity saw a decline in buying interest and fell slightly. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company rose close to a major level. Great China Match adjusted to level off. Kang Yuan Confectionery stood firm just outside a major level. In the cultural industry, China Bookstore outperformed The Commercial Press. In the pharmaceutical industry, Sino-French Pharmaceutical Company showed slight meandering, while New Asia Pharmaceutical was weak. The textile industry remained strong due to yarn prices, with Wing On Textile once again exceeding a major level before falling back. Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories faced excessive demand. New shares of Sino-Japanese Cotton Mill suffered a small setback. The department store sector saw the greatest fluctuations, with Wing On and Sincere both rising slightly. Chinese Underwear and King Fook Hosiery found buyers at lower prices.

### Activities of Various Trade Associations

The three associations for soy sauce, soy sauce gardens, and soy sauce dealers have been ordered to merge into the Soy Sauce Industry Association. It is reported that the association held its inaugural meeting yesterday at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, with over 140 members attending. Representatives from various authorities were also present. After performing the necessary ceremonies, Cai Yuanfu, Fang Zhongfu, Shen Zhongyang, and others were elected as directors, while Song Xielin, Chen Yuting, and others were elected as supervisors.

Tea and Pastry Industry: The Shanghai Tea and Pastry Industry Association held its inaugural meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Relevant authorities attended to provide guidance. The association's charter was approved on the spot, and the first board of directors and supervisors were elected. As a result, Huang Jingqi, Li Guozhi, Xu Rongsen, and others were elected as directors, while Zhou Weixing, Wu Qingdai, and others were elected as supervisors.

### Temporary Wheat Unified Purchase Plan Established by the National Commercial Control Association

The importance of food policy in a wartime system is self-evident. To ensure military needs and provide adequate food for the people, a sound organization and a comprehensive plan are necessary. Cooperation between officials and merchants, strengthening supply and demand management, can achieve this goal. However, to achieve this, increasing production is the first priority.

Flour is a staple food, and the adequate supply of flour depends on increased wheat production. Central China is a region with abundant wheat production and a concentration of flour mills. Historically, the amount of wheat harvested has not been sufficient to meet the needs of various mills. Due to the lack of precise statistics, it is impossible to determine the ratio of agricultural output to purchase volume. Currently, the Ministry of Food is actively promoting plans to increase agricultural production, such as promoting specific techniques, protecting loans, and improving technology. The increase in agricultural production will certainly be effective. However, significant efforts are still needed regarding large-scale purchases to replenish warehouses. Since the outbreak of the war, the environment has been complex, movement has been difficult, and goods have not been easily concentrated. If prices are further suppressed, farmers will be unable to make a living from their agricultural products, and the raw materials for flour mills will inevitably be affected. In order to improve the results of purchases and maintain the balance of commodity prices, the following ten-point wheat purchase plan is established:

(1) Average allocation for collective production: The amount of wheat allocated to each flour mill will be determined by the association based on the production capacity of each mill. Each mill will designate a commissioned merchant to procure the wheat according to the allocated amount, without exceeding the quota. (2) Establish a centralized management system for purchases: To achieve centralized management, a buying and selling system will be established. (3) Facilitate the collection and concentration of sources: The free movement of wheat from rural towns to the centralized markets will be ensured, allowing wheat to concentrate in the markets. (4) Prevent speculation and hoarding, and prohibit mutual buying and selling between parties of equal status: To supplement the provisions of Article 2 and prevent speculation and hoarding, mutual buying and selling between parties of equal status shall be prohibited. (1) Wheat dealers in the same centralized location shall not engage in mutual buying and selling. (2) Commissioned merchants shall not engage in mutual buying and selling. (3) Traders shall not engage in mutual buying and selling. (4) Flour mills shall not sell wheat. (5) The association may, within a certain period, purchase all unsold wheat purchased by commissioned merchants, traders, and wheat dealers in centralized locations at an assessed price and allocate it to various flour mills. (5) Complete registration and accurate statistics: Statistics are the preliminary work of control, and registration is an essential procedure. The wheat production area is vast and complex. In order to achieve thorough management, the registration process will begin with wheat that has already entered the market, gradually extending to wheat that has not yet entered the market. Detailed registration is required for all wheat arriving at centralized markets (including quantity, price, storage, movement, and sale to traders or commissioned merchants). The procedures will be handled by wheat dealers in centralized locations. All traders who transport registered wheat to needed areas must register in detail at both the departure and arrival locations (including the name of the buyer, the purchase price, the quantity, and the destination). The procedures will be handled by the traders. All flour mills purchasing wheat must register in detail (including quantity, price, name of the commissioned merchant). The procedures for receipt and storage in outside warehouses are the same. All commissioned merchants who purchase from traders or sell to flour mills must register (including quantity, price, the brand of the trader from whom it was purchased or the name of the flour mill to which it was sold, and the storage location). The association will print the registration forms separately. Those engaged in the wheat business can submit the forms to the association or its branch offices nearby, and the association will compile the reports to create statistics. (6) Establish branch offices widely to strengthen the purchase system: Branch offices will be established widely in major and secondary wheat-producing areas to supervise and manage the various purchase organizations, concentrating and strengthening purchase matters. Provisional locations for establishing branch offices will be determined. (7) Stipulate the qualifications, registration, and business scope of purchase organizations: Flour mills and those with the qualifications to manage wheat businesses in the various locations where the association's branch offices are established, as stipulated in the preceding article, must register with the association or the local branch office in accordance with the following regulations: (A) Flour mills: Those who are members of the manufacturing group of the local flour industry association and have registered with the association may request the association to allocate wheat. The allocation method will be determined by the association, and each mill will purchase according to the allocated amount and comply with the following regulations: (1) Procure according to the quantity allocated by the association, without exceeding the quota. (2) Report the price and quantity of wheat received daily to the association or branch office. (3) Each mill's wheat procurement will be handled by a designated commissioned merchant, but the designated commissioned merchant must be reported to the association for verification. The association may order a change or revocation if necessary. (4) Each mill shall not directly purchase from wheat dealers in centralized locations, traders, or farmers. (B) Commissioned merchants: Those who are members of the local grain industry association and have been designated by a flour mill may purchase from traders and wheat dealers in centralized locations (i.e., locations where the association has established branch offices) according to the quantity designated by the flour mill, and comply with the following regulations: (1) Register with the association. (2) Be a member of the local grain industry association. (3) Be commissioned by a flour mill to purchase wheat from traders or wheat dealers in centralized locations. (4) Report the daily purchase situation and the quantity of wheat delivered to the mill to the association or local branch office. (5) Not directly purchase from farmers. (6) Not engage in mutual buying and selling with other commissioned merchants. (7) The purchased wheat must be completely delivered to the commissioning flour mill and not resold to others. (8) Commissioned merchants shall not also operate a wheat dealership in a centralized location. (C) Traders: Those who have the qualifications of a member of the local grain industry association may be traders. However, they must register with the branch office in the collection area before procuring wheat from wheat dealers in centralized locations and transporting it to needed areas (i.e., areas where flour mills are located), and shall not hoard. They must comply with the following regulations: (1) Register with the branch office in the procurement area. (2) Be a member of the local grain industry association. (3) The wheat transported must be registered wheat from wheat dealers in centralized locations. (4) The transported wheat shall not be sold locally but must be transported to the destination and resold to a flour mill through a commissioned merchant. (5) Report the daily procurement of wheat to the branch office in the procurement area. (6) Not sell unregistered wheat. (7) Not engage in mutual buying and selling with other traders. (8) Not resell to non-industry personnel. (D) Wheat dealers in centralized locations: Those who are members of the local grain industry association and have registered with the local branch office may be wheat dealers in centralized locations and may directly purchase from farmers or wheat dealers in nearby towns who do not need to register with the association and sell to traders and commissioned merchants. They must comply with the following regulations: (1) Register with the branch office. (2) Be a member of the local grain industry association. (3) Directly purchase from farmers or wheat dealers in nearby towns who do not need to register with the association. (4) The purchased wheat may be sold to traders or commissioned merchants but shall not be directly sold to flour mills. (5) Report the daily purchase and sale situation to the branch office. (6) Not resell to non-industry personnel or engage in mutual buying and selling with other wheat dealers in centralized locations. Flour mills, commissioned merchants, traders, and wheat dealers must strictly comply with the provisions of this article. Violations will result in the immediate cancellation of membership and severe punishment. The penalties will be submitted to the government for approval and implementation. (8) Implement adjustment policies and prevent competitive behavior: If a flour mill is unable to meet its approved purchase quota, the association will make effective adjustments to its allocation ratio after investigation and verification of legitimate reasons. If there is a total shortage of purchases, the allocation amount for all flour mills will be reduced proportionally. Flour mills should strictly implement wheat acceptance to eliminate the bad habits of competitive buying and adulteration. (9) Negotiate appropriate and reasonable prices to encourage rural production: To encourage rural production and increase the purchase quantity, the association will consider the costs of water wheat and flour, and reasonable profits, and propose reasonable prices to be submitted to the government for approval. (10) Implement the plan in a timely and appropriate manner: The plan will be drafted by the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee and submitted to the National Commercial Control Association's Board of Directors for approval and reported to the government for record.

— Zhi Zeng

There is no shortage of wealthy merchants from Chao-Shan, such as the grain gang, flower side, new people and new things mortgage pawns, normally willing to spend a thousand gold, and they cannot stand idly by now. Recently, I heard that a certain PhD border merchant who is welcoming education, and the church are in the process of raising funds.
