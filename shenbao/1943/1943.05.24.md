### The Decisive Stage Is About To Begin

The period of drastic changes in the world war situation is approaching, and all parties are preparing for the start of the decisive stage.

The end of the battles in Tunis and Bizerte is a turning point in the world war. There is no doubt that the so-called real war may break out on any near tomorrow. The question is the future focus of the war and the trends it may develop, which is precisely the focus of the contradictions among the anti-Axis powers today. The so-called "strategic dispute" arises here, and the result is undoubtedly a great benefit to the Axis powers. As the saying goes, "A cat that shouts cannot catch mice." The clamor of the Allies before the decisive battle and the composure of the Axis powers may somewhat hint at the future!

From the perspective of the entire war situation, after the end of the North African war, according to the judgment of the anti-Axis military observers, their victory is built on immediately launching an attack on Europe. Otherwise, the initiative will be in the hands of the Axis powers, and not only London but also New York may encounter a sudden attack. However, the anti-Axis countries have experienced new conflicts at this time. The British rulers, led by Churchill, adhering to the view of "national interests first," insisted on the selfish strategic policy of "defeating Hitler first." He persuaded the United States to send the largest force to Europe and even tried to trick Stalin into taking chestnuts out of the fire for them in the East to appease Roosevelt. However, this kind of strategy has obviously aroused great resentment among the US Army and Navy. Senator Chandler, who was once regarded as Roosevelt's loyal confidant, recently delivered a speech in Congress that fully exposed the deep unease of the US rulers, criticizing Churchill's Europe-centric strategy. He warned Roosevelt: "When Britain and the Soviet Union are vying for Europe, the US President will bitterly feel that he has lost the right to speak in the world." Therefore, this movement against the "Europe-centric strategy" has spread in the United States. We have every reason to point out that while Washington is still debating, the new starting point of the world war situation has already begun in a certain place and in several places. Because the Axis powers no longer need to have any compromises in strategy, their interests are completely aligned, which is the first characteristic before the start of the decisive stage.

It is certainly impossible to judge where the future decisive battle will be staged. However, as we pointed out the other day, the Mediterranean theater will first concentrate the firepower of both sides. Italy has now declared a state of war throughout the country, and all its people are on the front line, uniting their strength to resist a possible enemy landing operation. The amazing air war has already begun for several days. Judging from the current situation, due to the consolidation of the defense capabilities of Sicily and Sardinia, and the daily strengthening of the German-Italian joint defense forces in southern Italy, the control of the central Mediterranean is firmly in the hands of the Axis powers. Relying on this, the enemy's conspiracies against Turkey and Spain cannot take effect, and the Axis powers also have sufficient time to strengthen the defense lines of thousands of miles in southern and western France, in the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Scandinavian Peninsula, and at the same time, they can carry out operations to eliminate enemy activities and strengthen mobilization in the Balkan Peninsula. Conversely, after the huge consumption of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa, it is not easy to gather the offensive power from the vast areas of Africa, west to England and east to the Near East, especially since there are still old and new contradictions within.

There has been three months of silence on the German-Soviet front. This is the time for both sides to desperately prepare. Now, according to some information announced by both sides, it can be said that they both admit that each other's preparations have been quite complete, and the decisive war has reached the stage where it can break out at any time. Although the situation in Europe is completely different from the African war situation last year, the decisive position of the German-Soviet war in the world war situation has not only not decreased, but has increased even more. In Tunis and Bizerte, the Axis powers resisted enemy forces with a small force of more than ten divisions, which was not much smaller than the number of Soviet troops on the Eastern Front, and perhaps even better in quality, for more than three months. However, on the Eastern Front, the Axis powers do not deny that they have concentrated ten times the force of North Africa, and have been buried in preparation for three months without lightly using it. It is obvious that the Axis powers never deny their main target of attack. Therefore, it is more meaningful to pay attention to the development of the German-Soviet war than to value the disputes between Roosevelt and Churchill in Washington, Churchill's illusions about Stalin, and the daydreams of Roosevelt's faction about "counterattacking Japan." The decisive battle that we call will break out on any near tomorrow also lies here.

Before the decisive stage arrives, in order to conceal their true intentions and to guard against the tyranny of Britain and the Soviet Union, Roosevelt's faction created some incidents in the Pacific, such as the adventurous landing on Attu Island in the Aleutian Islands, which had been occupied by the Japanese army for a year. The enemy's propaganda machine spared no effort to promote these events. But its effect is only temporary deception, and it will not succeed even in Chongqing and Australia. The facts have made Chongqing and Australia feel disappointed and resentful towards the so-called "allies." Even the British side does not believe in this trick of the United States, so in his speech to the US Congress, Churchill pointed out that "the largest part of the US force is in the Pacific," which is such humorous irony in front of the Americans, because what "the largest part of the US force" has shown is the greatest defeat.

### Record of the Russo-Japanese War in This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago - Old Newspaper New Excerpt (4)

Introduction

We recognize that in the future, the responsibility for defending the Pacific will entirely lie with the Asians, and the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States must not be allowed to intervene. However, fulfilling the task of defense depends on a strong naval power. Our ally Japan has established its navy through decades of hard work and continuous improvement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, it showed its talent by defeating the many with the few. In this Greater East Asia War, it has exerted its invincible power even more. At present, the entire defense of the Pacific is solely shouldered by the navy of our ally, and we deeply regret that we have not been able to share the burden. Therefore, how we should emulate the navy of our ally in the future, establish a new Chinese navy, and participate in the task of defending the Pacific is a goal that the people of our country should jointly strive to catch up with. In order to enhance the Chinese people's naval knowledge and interest, this newspaper has excerpted the records of this newspaper during the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago as a new excerpt, from the 21st to the 30th, for a period of ten days. I hope readers will pay attention.

### The Japanese Blocking the Port of Lushun (Recorded in This Newspaper No. 11088, Guangxu 30th Year, January 17th, Western Calendar March 3rd, 1904, Thursday)

The Japanese blocking of the port of Lushun has been repeatedly reported in telegraphic dispatches. Now, reading a certain Japanese Tokyo daily newspaper, it says: On February 23rd of the Eastern Calendar (i.e., the eighth day of the first month of the Chinese Calendar) to the 24th, the naval commander-in-chief Togo personally supervised the fleet to attack with great effort. How effective it was has not been reported. However, Togo is usually bold and careful, and at this time, he is expected to return with victory. As for the stone ships blocking Lushun, one is the Incheon Maru of the Postal Ship Company, weighing 2,331 tons, with a steel hull, manufactured in 1877 AD. One is the Hokoku Maru of Kawamura Sakichi from Hyogo Prefecture, weighing 2,766 tons, with a steel hull, manufactured in 1870 AD. One is the Buyo Maru of the Merchant Ship Company, weighing 563 tons, with a steel and iron hull, manufactured in 1889 AD. One is the Bushu Maru of the Merchant Ship Company, weighing 1,289 tons, with a steel hull, manufactured in 1883 AD. It is also heard that the Russian governor Alekseyev's public telegram said: On February 24th of the Western Calendar (i.e., the ninth day of the first month of the Chinese Calendar), at 2:45 AM, when the waning moon had sunk and the morning stars had not yet risen, the Japanese attacked Lushun again with torpedo boats, and also used four ships loaded with flammable materials, intending to sink them to block the port. The Russian Lt. Utyugov Battery fired and bombarded them, and two ships were destroyed near the port. Then, with electric lights illuminating the distance, four ships were seen to be broken. Eight torpedo boats sailed into the Japanese fleet, surged back with waves. At present, the port is still open to traffic and there are no obstacles.

### More on the Japanese Blocking the Port of Lushun (Recorded in This Newspaper No. 11089, Guangxu 30th Year, January 18th, Western Calendar March 4th, 1904, Friday)

A certain Osaka newspaper in Japan published an official report obtained by the Russian Consul General stationed in Shanghai, roughly saying that on the nights of February 22nd (i.e., the seventh day of the first month of the Chinese Calendar) and 23rd (i.e., the eighth day), warships suddenly attacked Lushun and were repelled by us. In the darkness, it was not known which country's ships they were, nor what kind of ships they were. Only six damaged ships were seen. The Russian military attaché stationed in Lushun telegraphed that: On February 24th of the Western Calendar (i.e., the ninth day of the first month of the Chinese Calendar) at 2:00 AM, Japanese torpedo boats crossed to the port of Lushun and attacked the battery, and also used eight ships loaded with rocks, intending to block the port gate. The Russian commander, seeing this, quickly ordered the Lt. Utyugov ship to join the battery and fire, and the Japanese boats, seeing the Lt. Utyugov ship, flew forward. Soon, two ships were stranded on a shoal, and one was sunk near the Golden Hill Lighthouse. At this time, the night was very clear, and soon four more ships were seen sinking one after another, and eight torpedo boats retreated to the fleet. Among the sunken ships, half of the sailors drowned, and half were missing. As for whether there was any damage to the Japanese fleet, it was not very clear from the shore. Only that it was divided into two teams and headed towards the horizon. The ships damaged on February 9th of the Western Calendar (i.e., December 24th of the Chinese Calendar last year) were quickly repaired and will soon be able to engage in battle in the vast sea again.

### Japanese General's Telegram on the Battle of Lushun (Recorded in This Newspaper No. 11110, Guangxu 30th Year, February 9th, Western Calendar March 25th, 1904, Friday)

A certain Japanese Tokyo daily newspaper said: The battle of Lushun was recently telegraphed by the naval commander Togo, roughly saying: Our Japanese warships, as expected, agreed to besiege the port of Lushun on March 10th of the Eastern Calendar. On the night of the 9th, after 11:00 PM, first order the torpedo boat fleet to reconnoiter outside the port of Lushun for a week. By dawn on the 10th, it was divided into two teams, A and B. Team A used a specially made machine to sink mines outside the port. The Russian battery commander saw it and immediately fired remotely. Our ships were undamaged and were able to sink the mines and return. At about 4:30 AM, Team A, with six ships, went straight to the south of Old Iron Mountain and approached the enemy's torpedo boats. After fighting for about 30 minutes, our "Asashio," "Kasumi," and "Akatsuki" ships almost rubbed against the sides of the enemy ships. The enemy ships fired fiercely with three or four ships. Soon, the enemy ships received multiple shells, either damaging the machinery or causing fires in the cabins. Only the wails of the soldiers were heard. It is not known how many were injured. When the enemy ships were defeated and fled, our "Asashio," "Kasumi," and "Akatsuki" ships had also been heavily damaged by enemy shells. A total of seven soldiers were killed on the ships. On "Kasumi," the chief engineer Nanzawa Yasuo and seven soldiers were injured. On "Akatsuki," the boiler exploded, and hot water spewed out, killing four soldiers instantly. By this point, all three ships were unable to sail. Team B, at 7:00 AM, arrived outside the port, and, seeing two enemy torpedo boats in the ocean, went straight ahead to block their return route and opened fire. After about a minute of battle, both sides suffered heavy damage. Soon, one enemy ship fled like an arrow. The one named Si Tieliu Siqi was driven under the fortress and was injured by our shells. The Lian ship seized him and dragged him back with a huge rope. At that time, the sea was turbulent and the water was gurgling in from the shell holes. They had no choice but to cut the rope and detain four enemy soldiers. At 10:15 AM, the enemy ship gradually sank. After the event, it was found that two soldiers were killed and Lieutenant Shima Yuukichi and three soldiers were injured on the Lian and Akebono ships. Previously, the enemy ships Novik and Boyarin flew out of the port and were pursued by Team B of our army. Later, seeing our cruiser fleet approaching, they turned back again. Our main naval force and cruiser fleet arrived at the sea off Lushun at 8:00 AM on that day to support the torpedo boat fleet. Soon, the ships of our main force changed direction and advanced towards Old Iron Mountain, while the cruiser fleet went straight to the port gate. From 10:00 AM to 1:40 PM, the main force fired at the shore, and the shells hit the enemy's key points. The enemy also fired in response, but our ships were undamaged. Another cruiser team went to the sea outside Dalian Bay and bombarded the enemy's warehouses and camps on Sanshan Island from afar. The Takasago and Chihaya ships reconnoitered the enemy's situation on the west coast of the Lushun Peninsula and saw the enemy ship Uknichtliy, which had been broken in the previous attack, sunk in the shallow waters of Pigeon Bay, with only the masts and chimneys slightly exposed above the water.

This operation was completed on May 22nd, and the Japanese army stationed in the area announced the comprehensive battle results at noon on the 23rd as follows: The Japanese army's Taihang Mountains operation has also ended. Although it lasted for two months, the morale has become more and more vigorous, and it is also responsible for security work, in order to prepare for the future war. If the Chongqing and communist armies try to act rashly again, the Japanese army will inevitably attack them anytime and anywhere. Now, the residents of various places in the area fully trust the policies of the Japanese army and the administrative organs of the Chinese side, and are working hard to revive China and protect East Asia, and will not easily believe in the schemes and propaganda of the Chongqing and communist sides in the future. The comprehensive battle results obtained by the Japanese army in this area since the start of the war are as follows (the battle results of the adjacent area troops are also included): 8,077 bodies of the Chongqing and communist armies were left behind, 2,828 people were captured.

### Luo Qiu Talks - Chongqing Side Still Disappointed

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - All circles in Chongqing are extremely concerned about the Luo Qiu talks currently being held in Washington. Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly convened meetings with the highest-ranking officials such as Kong Xiangxi, He Yingqin, and Xiong Shihui, and, based on the reports of Song Ziwen and Wei Daoming, has discussed countermeasures. According to various sources, it is known that the Chongqing side is quite dissatisfied with the argument of the Europe-first operation principle still insisted on in the Washington talks. It also pointed out that Japan is currently using Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam and Malaysia as bases for cultivating combat power, so Japan's strategic position is becoming increasingly consolidated, in order to arouse the attention of Britain and the United States. The main points of its advocacy of the equal emphasis on Europe and Asia principle are (1) to increase the deployment of troops for the purpose of opening up overseas routes, and especially to actively prepare for the counteroffensive operation in Burma; (2) to increase the establishment of air force bases and supply liaison agencies from the US Pacific coast to the border between Burma and India; (3) to actively transport aircraft, military supplies, and resources to Chongqing, etc. However, the progress of the Luo Qiu meeting still tends to focus on Europe, and only gives slight consideration to the position of Chongqing. The Chongqing Dagongbao also expressed pessimism about this situation on the 20th.

### International Communist Party Organization: Moscow Announces Dissolution; Rumored to be at Roosevelt's Suggestion; US Special Envoy to Meet Stalin Again

Moscow, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Executive Committee of the International Communist Party, on the 22nd, citing the serious current world situation, proposed a plan to dissolve the International Communist Organization. The proposal was signed by the Secretary-General of the International Communist Party and representatives of communist parties from various countries, but representatives from Britain and the United States were not listed. According to the committee's statement yesterday, the reason for the dissolution was that since the establishment of the International Communist Organization in 1919, the international situation has changed drastically, especially after the outbreak of this war, and the situation has become even more serious. Therefore, the international organization of the vanguard of the working class is no longer suitable for the international situation. The International Communist Organization must be dissolved, but communist parties in various countries should do their best to support the war effort in the future.

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to Washington sources: British Ambassador Lord Halifax met with Secretary of State Hull yesterday, mainly to discuss the dissolution of the Third International.

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Swedish newspaper "Dagens Nyheter" published an interview with Davies on the 21st, stating: I visited Stalin at 9:00 AM today and personally handed him a letter from President Roosevelt, and did not leave until 11:30 AM. I regret that I cannot disclose the contents of the letter. However, I can tell you that the letter was very long. After Stalin received it, he had someone translate it into Russian, and he listened attentively. He also said that he planned to meet with me again in the coming days.

Roosevelt's Demands

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Havas reported, citing sources in Lisbon with close ties to US senators in Washington: The dissolution of the Third International announced in Moscow yesterday was actually initiated by President Roosevelt. The US side is confident that President Roosevelt made specific demands regarding this matter in a letter delivered to Stalin by his special envoy, Davies. Roosevelt's demands were roughly as follows: (1) President Roosevelt strongly urged Stalin to be more cautious in his political strategies than in the past, because Moscow announced its political and military goals too early, which led to the failure to eliminate the hostility between Finland and the Soviet Union. (2) President Roosevelt asked Stalin to be particularly careful in announcing the Soviet Union's war aims towards its western neighbors, especially regarding Poland, the Balkans, and Turkey. The premature announcement of the Soviet Union's annexation plans would strengthen the determination of these countries to resist. (3) President Roosevelt asked Stalin to effectively help eliminate tensions within Britain and the United States. To achieve this goal, he proposed the immediate or at least formal dissolution of international communist organizations and the end of the Comintern. (4) In return for Stalin's fulfillment of the above demands, President Roosevelt announced his willingness to allow Stalin to arbitrarily dispose of European affairs related to Soviet interests when peace is concluded.

Suggestion to Convene a Four-Power Conference

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Havas's special correspondent stationed here stated last night: Special Envoy Davies had read the contents of President Roosevelt's long letter to Stalin beforehand. The reason why the US side spread the propaganda that Davies was unaware of the contents was because Roosevelt feared that premature disclosure of important parts of the letter would hinder the success of Davies' mission. This matter has become an open secret among Americans here, who learned about it through connections with some senators in Washington, but their names have not yet been identified. Although the accuracy of this information cannot be guaranteed to be entirely reliable, the source of the information about the contents of the letter and several other facts disclosed at the same time guarantee the accuracy of the above information. The letter mentioned world military strategies. It also emphasized the need to concentrate greater military strength in preparation for an offensive.

German Diplomatic Circles Express Views

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German Foreign Ministry issued its views on the Soviet Union's dissolution of the International Communist Party on the 22nd, stating in essence: The Soviet Union's dissolution of the International Communist Party is clearly a deliberate deception. Stalin has taken this step to be able to join the anti-Axis powers, laying the foundation for a meeting between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. However, this move is a major blow to anti-Semitic and anti-communist elements in the United States. Stalin has dissolved the Third International, but at the same time, he has established the Fourth International. Stalin had previously declared that he would bring Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and other Southeastern European countries into his sphere of influence. Today's move further solidifies this policy, and he intends to establish Soviet governments of different forms in these countries. In short, Stalin dared to take this measure because of Roosevelt. Roosevelt can only maintain his pro-Stalin policy through this, and allow the Soviet Union to develop freely towards Europe. However, European countries are currently fighting to preserve Europe from communist ideology, and they will certainly not be affected by Stalin's move. They will continue to challenge communism until it is eradicated.

### Military Attaché Corps of China, Manchukuo, and Thailand Inspects Southern Regions

### Fourth Anniversary of the German-Italian Alliance: Celebration Held in Berlin Yesterday; Italian Ambassador Alfieri Attended and Addressed, Emphasizing His Country's Determination to Complete the War

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Yesterday marked the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Axis Pact. Today, German newspapers prominently displayed headlines reiterating the close relationship between Germany and Italy. "Völkischer Beobachter" stated: The alliance established on May 22, 1939, established the basic principles of the two countries' foreign policy, and both sides still adhere to them today. "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" stated: The enemy's coercion has instead promoted the alliance between Germany and Italy to create a new Europe, mutually building a new order with firm determination.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - This month, the 23rd, marked the fourth anniversary of the signing of the German-Italian military agreement. Berlin held a commemorative celebration on this day, presided over by Dr. Clodius, Vice President of the German-Italian Association. German representatives included Deputy Foreign Minister Schnurre and senior officials from military, political, and party circles. Italian representatives included Ambassador to Germany Alfieri and members of various embassies. Ambassador Alfieri delivered a speech on the spot, emphasizing Italy's determination to complete the war, stating: From the beginning of Italy's participation in the war, it was deeply aware that the war would inevitably progress to an extremely fierce and difficult situation. It is believed that although the Axis forces are forced to retreat locally, it has no impact on deciding the entire war situation. Prime Minister Mussolini once said: Although Italy's plan to build an African empire on the African continent is temporarily difficult to achieve, it will eventually make efforts again to achieve success. Even if enemy aircraft bombing is fierce, Italian morale will never be shaken. The Italian people are determined to always unite around the King and, under the leadership of Prime Minister Mussolini, strive for final victory and move forward with unwavering belief. I am confident that the common determination, common interests, and friendly feelings between the heads of state and people of Germany and Italy are the best guarantee for the Axis powers to achieve final victory.

### Anti-Axis Powers to Hold Second Food Conference

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to news from Virginia Hot Springs, there are extremely divergent opinions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union at the anti-Axis food conference currently being held there. Therefore, a second conference may be convened. The agenda of this conference is to discuss the allocation of food after the war, not to discuss the urgent issue of immediately transporting food to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet delegation is not satisfied, so it plans to convene a second conference to discuss the Soviet demands in order to appease the Soviet Union. However, this plan has not yet materialized. It is believed that US State Department official Acheson has been ordered to mediate the current disputes. It is expected that the second conference will also be held in Hot Springs and will only be attended by delegations from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

### Air Supremacy and Naval Warfare (II)

— Written by Sato Kiichiro, Translated from Kaizo, May Issue

III

Leaving aside the Greater East Asia War, the European war has shown that no matter how powerful a fleet is, it cannot accomplish its mission without the cooperation of the air force. Needless to say, the tasks of the fleet at sea are to destroy enemy fleets at sea or at bases, attack various enemy coastal facilities, destroy communication and transportation lines and trade lines, protect our maritime transportation and communication lines, and cover land troops. However, the results of these fleet operations can be said to be determined by the extent of first, air supremacy, and second, the freedom of fleet actions in the combat or aerial-maritime zones. However, these first and second conditions are not inherently separable. Without the first condition, the second condition can hardly be established. In other words, air supremacy is the precursor to sea control. The so-called "sea control from the air" illustrates this relationship.

Sea control from the air - in other words, the best example of the air force's victory over the navy can be seen in the German army's Norwegian operation. The German army's Norwegian operation occupied the air bases immediately before the British, and landed the army by warships and transport aircraft. The British fleet hurriedly escorted the transport convoys to Norway, but because it did not consider the following of air power, it was attacked by a fleet of 150 German bombers 100 to 200 kilometers off the coast. Soon, the transport convoy of battleships and cruisers was easily eliminated. This contains the significance of the German air force, which gained air bases on land, capturing or destroying enemy ships within the 200-kilometer air supremacy circle at sea. It is nothing more than the fact that in the face of air supremacy, sea control and everything else disappear into smoke.

When the German army carried out the Norwegian operation, the most painstaking thing was the difficulty of landing troops simultaneously in the harbor scattered across the narrow territory of the winding 1,000 kilometers. This operation was unprecedented. Therefore, the harbors of Hamburg, Wilhelmshaven, Kiel, Stettin, Tangier, and Mergaardin Hafen, from which troops were transported, were first strictly defended with fighters and anti-aircraft guns. Secondly, when transporting the troops, they were protected by the Messerchmitt, a twin-engine, reciprocating aircraft with a speed of 600 kilometers per hour, which had never been dispatched by the German air force. At the same time, bombers were dispatched to the North Sea to sink British warships. Moreover, on the 3rd, 8th, and 10th of April, sixty aircraft were formed into seven teams, repeatedly bombing the British mainland's Scapa Flow military port. The British Air Force was completely unable to take off from the airfield during the day and could only move at night. Therefore, the only thing that could detect the German army's movements was the German fleet's sudden information of moving at sea.

In this way, at dawn on April 9, the German battleship Scharnhorst, the cruiser Hippel, and other destroyers landed troops on the Norwegian coast, and the operation began. In just three days, the landing in the seaports of Narvik, Trondheim, Bergen, Stavanger, Kristiansand, Arendal, and Oslo succeeded. Then, airlift was carried out by transport aircraft to seize the enemy's airfield behind the defense line. Taking Oslo as an example, a transport plane protected by five fighters landed at a nearby civil airfield on the 9th. One hundred and twenty soldiers jumped out of the transport plane and captured the airfield within fifteen minutes, allowing subsequent transport planes to land safely and quickly, and 3,000 soldiers landed in less than an hour. In addition, Stavanger was occupied by parachute troops.

On the one hand, the British Navy received a report of the German fleet leaving the port and immediately dispatched the Northern Fleet with the battleship Renown as its flagship, equipped with nine twin mine boats, to the coast from Tromsø to Narvik, to be responsible for setting up mines and landing marines. A Southern Fleet consisting of the battleship Rodnaya, the cruiser Aurora, and nine destroyers and mine boats was dispatched to Bergen to prevent the German fleet from heading north. However, the German fleet had not only entered the port of Narvik hours before, but both the Northern and Southern Fleets were fiercely bombarded by German bombers. Especially the Southern Fleet, the battleship Rodnaya was hit by all bombs, the cruiser Aurora suffered even more severe damage, and the destroyer Gergaga sank within four and a half hours. The two fleets fled back to base in embarrassment.

For this defeat, the British Navy hoped to make a comeback and reorganized a large fleet with the battleship Forthright as its flagship, equipped with several cruisers and destroyers, and many other small warships, and advanced towards Narvik. On April 13, it inflicted great damage on seven German mine boats. Soon, it was discovered by a large group of German bombers dispatched to rescue friendly forces. Several were fatally damaged, and the attempt to land in Narvik became a pipe dream, and they had to retreat again.

At that time, the British Air Force also dispatched attacks on German warships and airfields in the Kristiansand, Bergen, and Stavanger areas, but the German army strengthened these airfields with fighters on the 12th, and the attacks had no effect.

After that, until the Norwegian army surrendered on June 9, the German and British armies continued to fight to the death. British warships were defeated by German bombers several times. The battleship Forthright, the cruiser Carr, HMS Effingham and many other mine boats and minesweepers were sunk.

The Norwegian operation, as mentioned at the beginning, was always a victory for the German Air Force's active operations. The German army's strategy was to occupy the airfields in Denmark and Norway from the beginning, bring the aviation base closer to the front line, quickly seize air supremacy, and make it easier for friendly fleets to land and fight. At the same time, it set up an air supremacy circle far at sea to defeat the British fleet. However, the British Navy placed the aviation base at a location far away from the front line. Therefore, while the imposing fleet sailed forward, it was often attacked by German bombers and suffered defeat.

### World Red Cross Plans to Build Beggar Camps; Chairman Orders Implementation and Will Teach Agricultural Skills

The problem of repatriating refugees and beggars in the two concessions and the city has been under discussion for a long time. It is now known that this ideal can become a reality. The World Red Cross has been ordered to conduct on-site inspections in Dachang to complete the beggar repatriation plan.

Develop Self-Sufficient Life for Beggars

Repatriating beggars is indeed one of the social problems in this city, so it has long been paid attention to by the authorities. Building beggar residences in Dachang is intended to maintain public health in the bustling city of Shanghai, and it is hoped that infectious diseases in the hot season can be reduced. According to relevant sources, this plan is expected to be realized in the near future.

Chairman Instructs World Red Cross

Okazaki Katsuo, Chairman of the Municipal Council, is also very keen to solve the beggar problem. During the street cleaning campaign at the beginning of this month, he expressed his determination to repatriate street beggars to representatives of various baojia and self-defense groups. Later, the World Red Cross was inspired by Chairman Okazaki and was responsible for handling the repatriation work.

Heads of Various Districts Discuss with Each Other

Last week, the heads of the three municipal districts in this city approached each other to discuss and seek solutions to this problem. It is also reported that the Nanshi authorities have also engaged in the practical solution of this problem, taking the same steps as other authorities. Beggar businesses in Dachang are under construction and are expected to accommodate 5,000 people, although this has not yet fully accommodated all the beggars in the city. The World Red Cross has a very large plan for the management of the beggar camp. The beggars who are taken in, especially the younger ones, will be taught agricultural skills and other commercial knowledge.

### All Sectors of Shanghai Work Together to Relieve Disaster-Stricken Compatriots in North China; Aiming to Collect a Substantial Amount in a Short Period

National Forum

### Eliminating Latent Power

— Ji Wei

If we want to revitalize society and consolidate national power, I believe that abandoning latent power is the most important fundamental task. Why do I say this? The reasons are stated as follows:

First, let's look at the advantages and disadvantages of latent power. People who are untalented and incompetent rely on the latent power of their fathers, uncles, and other relatives to hold high positions. They are full of sycophantic flattery, and in a few years, they strut around, pretending to be important figures. Examining their actual knowledge, they are only capable of socializing, frequenting entertainment venues, and being mere good-for-nothings. On the other hand, those with real talent and learning remain underlings for a long time. And it is the latter who support and advance society. If the former occupy their positions and do not leave, the latter cannot rise. This is one reason for abandoning latent power.

Let's look at the distorted development of current society. Those in power use their authority and rely on the latent power of their positions to flaunt their power and indulge their selfish desires, thus creating extremely terrible consequences. The tragic death of Zhang Jinhai this time is greatly related to the use of latent power by certain parties. This is the second reason for abandoning latent power.

Let's look at the high prices in Shanghai. The reason is hoarding and speculation, and initially, it was hoarders from all walks of life who used their latent power to hoard large quantities of goods. (For example, bank personnel once used their authority to engage in speculation.) Therefore, tracing the root cause, the existence of latent power is a major reason for the increasing cost of living. This is the third reason for abandoning latent power.

Let's look at current society: money is the highest authority, and everything is about money. Having money means having power, which means having latent power. With money, anything can be done, while many poor but knowledgeable people are looked down upon and despised. Why is this? It is because people in general value money too much and value latent power too much. Therefore, if we want to correct such a bad phenomenon and eliminate this bad concept, abandoning latent power is a task that cannot be delayed for a moment. This is the fourth reason for abandoning latent power.

Since the disadvantages of latent power are as described above, we must abandon it in order to make society vigorous and national power prosperous. But how do we abandon it? This question is very complicated. First, we must understand the reasons for the existence of latent power and understand its crux before we can completely abandon it. So, let's first look for the source of latent power. The causes can be divided into the following types:

(1) The existence of latent power is because people in society do not value talent and instead focus on cultivating their own relatives and friends into a faction, forming so-called cliques, and cultivating their own power, suppressing dissidents, thus creating so-called latent power.

(2) Those in high positions engage in embezzlement and corruption due to the convenience of their authority. They use the advantage of their position to form latent power and act recklessly, doing whatever they want.

(3) Those who are in subordinate positions, in order to preserve their jobs, do not hesitate to do private matters for their superiors and cover up for their superiors, which makes those in high positions more unscrupulous and cultivates deeply rooted latent power.

Due to the above points, we can know that latent power is man-made. Whoever tied the bell on the tiger must untie it, so to abandon latent power, the public must release their power to complete it together.

We should not drag our untalented and incompetent friends and relatives to cultivate our own power; we should not abuse our authority to engage in embezzlement and corruption; we should not be afraid of losing our jobs if we do not do private matters for our superiors; we should work impartially and selflessly. Only in this way will latent power disappear, society will flourish, politics will move onto the right track, and the country will be revitalized!

### How Should the Famine in Henan Province Be Relieved?

— Yuan Weili

This year, a drought occurred in Henan Province. Regarding the situation in the disaster area, the Shen Bao has previously published an article that described it in detail. According to people from Xinxiang County, the severity of the famine in Henan Province is currently increasing, and the worst areas are Wuzhi and Qinyang (Huaiqing Prefecture) counties. Last year, the Qin River once flooded, and after the water receded, the land was covered with a foot of sticky mud (sticky soil). This kind of soil is not suitable for planting without sufficient rainfall, so the compatriots in the vicinity have exhausted their food supply and are now using bran, wheat middlings, tree bark, grass roots, peanut shells, etc. to fill their stomachs. However, after autumn, all the plants will wither, so it is not difficult to imagine what will happen to the people of Henan Province at that time. Therefore, how to relieve the famine in Henan Province is a matter that the authorities and philanthropists in general should pay close attention to. Now, based on my limited knowledge, I will briefly state the methods of relief as follows:

(1) Transport food to the disaster area as soon as possible. The authorities should designate personnel to handle relief matters. The procedure should be to first estimate the amount of food needed in the disaster area, and then find ways to transport food to the disaster area as soon as possible. What is even more important is how to ensure that the victims receive real relief after the food arrives in the disaster area. In other words, we should try our best to eliminate the matter of enriching one's own pockets by using disaster relief.

(2) Establish agricultural loans for farmers to facilitate well drilling as soon as possible. Although the disaster area failed to plant last year, which resulted in this year's summer and autumn harvest, this is limited to wheat and early-maturing sorghum and millet. As for late-maturing corn, mung beans, buckwheat, etc., it is not too late to plant them a month later. Therefore, the authorities should urgently establish agricultural loans in the disaster area to help people dig wells and purchase waterwheels. If this can be realized as soon as possible, then not only can the current famine be relieved, but future famines can also be reduced or even disappear.

The above are just the urgent tasks of the authorities. As for what philanthropists in Shanghai should do, it is to generously donate money in order to provide the authorities with great assistance. Accordingly, I believe that major newspapers in this port should quickly establish an organization to collect donations for the relief of the Henan drought, just like collecting donations for Mr. Zhang Qiu Jinnan. This will definitely be welcomed by the press, which serves society, and philanthropists in Shanghai will definitely be enthusiastic in their donations. (Manuscript fees are used for donations)

Economic Circle Translation and Discussion

### The Necessity of Revitalizing Small Industries

At a time when the issues of hoarding and prices are causing anxiety, news has spread that some small industries are emerging in Shanghai, which is very meaningful. So far, the industries that can be included in this category are rickshaws, tricycles, pharmaceuticals, and soap. It would be too easy to conclude from this fact that the economy of Central China has begun to recover. However, in this fact, we should recognize the resilience or environmental adaptability of the economy in general, and the Chinese economy in particular.

To put it a bit too strongly, the recent economic direction of Central China has become too dominated by a controlled economy. Considering China's status under participation in the war, a controlled economy is necessary, but its control spirit and method are too formulaic. At least most people feel that way. A controlled economy must be limited by considering the particularities of each national economy. What is considered appropriate in developed countries, in the eyes of those who do not understand, may be considered as a way to suppress the Chinese economy. Therefore, for China's controlled economy, we must first have the best possible ideal, and then seek its realization. We are not saying that this result was produced because of the progress or the difficult state of the General Chamber of Commerce, but there is no doubt that there are many things that should be reflected upon there.

What does the rise of small industries mean against this background? This is a natural development that occurs before China's controlled economy reaches full activity. The Chinese controlled economy currently being prepared uses the smooth flow of materials to increase production, with the aim of realizing the revival of the Chinese economy. The rise of small industries cannot be regarded as unplanned, it should be regarded as an effort to directly achieve this goal. If there is an abundance of materials, this effort may be hindered by the controlled economy, but the reality of the Central Chinese economy is just the opposite, only the controlled economy can help this effort to progress.

Not only in Shanghai, but also in other places, if there are production enterprises that are about to emerge, regardless of their size, they should be given assistance. We eagerly hope that the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce will provide more assistance to small industries, and the effect will be great. We further hope that the Chinese and Japanese government authorities and the General Chamber of Commerce will promote the revitalization of small industries from a broad perspective and devote their efforts to guidance, which is greatly expected.

### Banking Industry Loans for the Purchase of Spring Cocoons and Wheat; Settlement of Accounts Will Be Handled When the Dragon Boat Festival Approaches

After the banking industry conducted agricultural loans to revive the rural economy, China Communications and other banks have formed an agricultural loan syndicate, temporarily limited to the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, which will actively carry out the work by dividing the area. In addition, loans will be granted for the purchase of agricultural products such as spring cocoons, wheat, rice, and beans. The principle has been decided and will be handled by various banks. Details are as follows:

Spring Cocoon Loan

Silk factories and silk cocoon merchants can apply to banks for loans to purchase spring cocoons. It is reported that the total amount of spring cocoon loans already concluded is about 10 million yuan. Recently, cocoon shops in Zhejiang have opened scales. However, because the number of cocoon shops has been fully opened, the production of spring cocoons has decreased compared with previous years, resulting in each cocoon shop facing difficulties in purchasing enough pre-set volumes. Due to competitive acquisition, prices have increased mutually. Fresh cocoon improved variety Sima scales in Hai'ning and other places have an average price of 3,000 yuan per load, which is higher than the standard cocoon price evaluated by the Ministry of Industry. Cocoon shops in various places in Jiangsu will open scales soon, and the silkworm season is reportedly better than in Zhejiang. As for silk factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, Jiaxing and other places, they will soon prepare to start work because spring cocoons have been launched on the market.

Wheat Loan

Wheat in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has begun to enter the market. Due to the even distribution of rain, all places have reported a bumper harvest. Recently, each bank has agreed to provide as much wheat loan as possible. At the same time, Japanese banks have also agreed to provide loans for purchase. It is reported that the purchase and distribution of wheat will be handled by the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee under the National Commercial Control Association. The association is an organization that unites Chinese and Japanese flour manufacturers and colleagues in the flour and wheat industry, and will purchase wheat in large quantities from the wheat production areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The wheat obtained will be distributed to various factories for the production of flour. As for the price of wheat, it is evaluated by the competent authorities according to the agricultural cost and market price.

Dragon Boat Festival Holiday Decided

June 7 is the Dragon Boat Festival, and each industry will handle the settlement of accounts as usual. Recently, because the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching soon, each factory, company, bank, and squid has begun to prepare, and all customer accounts that have been loaned out in the past will be urged for collection after being cleared separately. At the same time, funds due on Dragon Boat Festival for each bank will be transferred and returned by themselves. It is reported that each bank in the banking industry has now decided to take a holiday during the Dragon Boat Festival.

### Stable Prices in the Capital City

In order to stabilize prices, eliminate the black market, and stabilize people's livelihood, the Nanjing Municipal Government has implemented the first step of the plan, actively rectifying the major commercial trade associations, and investigating the quantity of inventory stored in the city. Most of the trade associations have been rectified and are ready, and the first step of the plan can be completed as scheduled this month. Under the cooperation of the authorities and the trade associations, various goods have gradually become stable, and black market transactions have also been eliminated. It is expected that in the future, each industry and the price of goods will gradually be brought into the right track, and the lives of citizens can also be stabilized.

### Dynamic Trends of Various Trade Associations

Brewing Industry: The Brewing Industry Association has been formally established, has started working, and is handling member registration. All stores and businesses operating the brewing industry in this urban area, whether self-made, selling, purchasing, or separately selling merchants, must join the association to maintain their business, with a deadline of the 28th of this month.

Match Industry: The United Association of the Match Industry Trade Association, organized by local match factories and the cigarette, match, and soap candle industries in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two special municipalities of Shanghai and Nanjing, has been prepared and scheduled to hold an establishment conference on the 30th of this month at the association's office. At that time, each district association must send representatives to attend.

### The Commercial Control Association Will Set Up an Office in Nanjing

After the Commercial Control Association was transferred to the Executive Yuan, its autonomous organizational work is expected to accelerate its progress. Regarding the establishment of branch offices in other ports, the two places of Guangdong and Hubei will be ready soon. The establishment of branch offices in North China will be delayed due to special circumstances, but it is recognized that after the material exchange outline of North China and Central China is determined this year, the establishment of branch offices and the establishment of an autonomous control mechanism can also be promoted in parallel.

It is reported that the Commercial Control Association has decided to first set up offices in Nanjing and other major cities. In order to facilitate contact with the Executive Yuan and other relevant departments, the Nanjing office will be established first.

After the progress of this kind of organizational work, the Commercial Control Association can strengthen its guidance and control power over various important places, and at the same time, it can promote the establishment and strengthening of local trade associations.

### Apprentices in Modern Factories

— Shen Tu

I am an apprentice in a well-funded iron factory that prides itself on being modern. The factory director, supervisors, and other staff are all highly educated, some even holding doctoral or master's degrees. Therefore, the management methods here are innovative, supposedly scientific and rational. Under such a scientific and rational system, our apprentices' treatment is certainly different from that of ordinary old-fashioned, corrupt, and unscientific small factories.

Admittedly, we don't have to wash rice and vegetables, we don't have to hold the boss's baby, and we don't have to empty the accountant's chamber pot. But, besides that, what do we get? Let's take a look!

Our apprenticeship lasts three years, with room and board provided by the factory. In these difficult times, being able to have three meals a day and a place to sleep without worry is already fortunate, and of course, we shouldn't ask for more. However, what we hope for is: (1) that what we receive is equal to the cost the factory pays, so that a few people don't profit in the middle, causing us to suffer even more. (2) Although we can't be too picky about the quality, cleanliness absolutely cannot be neglected. However, when we discover that the price of the meals doesn't match the food, or there are flies in the food, the administrative staff always defends the kitchen and threatens us with demerits or expulsion. Why is this?

Apprentices in old-style shops or factories receive a reasonable monthly allowance. We have the same, generally between ten and twenty yuan, depending on the length of service and diligence, but the name is different; it's specifically called "Attendance Subsidy." As the name suggests, this subsidy is only given for attending work. If you take leave, it must be deducted according to the number of days. Although this ten or so yuan isn't enough for a capitalist's cigarette or a cup of wine, the managers never overlook it, which shows their shrewdness.

Deducting the subsidy for leave is not enough to show their strictness, so it is also stipulated that one day of leave must be made up with two days of work. For leave of three days or more, the guarantor must take the apprentice out of the factory. This really makes us afraid to even think about taking leave.

After the three-year apprenticeship is completed, according to the rules of old-style commerce and industry, you would be promoted to clerk or worker. But in our factory, there's a new twist: you must serve for three years, and all benefits during the service period are lower than those of other regular workers. If you quit voluntarily before the term is up or are dismissed, you must repay the factory for all room, board, and subsidies enjoyed in the past. This is called compensating for losses.

Here are my recent expenses, published as follows: Haircuts cost five yuan each, three haircuts in February, averaging seven and a half yuan per month; bathing costs five yuan each, twice a month, totaling ten yuan; one bar of laundry soap costs twelve yuan per month; toothpaste, toothbrush, and towel average five yuan per month. These items alone cost nearly forty yuan, which is not enough even if the attendance subsidy is not deducted. What about the cost of shoes, socks, work clothes, and inner shirts and trousers, which are major expenses?

### On the Cotton Cloth Problem

— Li Zhihua

Cotton cloth is a necessity for people's clothing. In wartime, accurate supply and demand statistics are even more necessary.

For several months, the authorities' principles for dealing with cotton cloth have been roughly two points: (1) Preserve existing resources. (Restrict the movement of cotton cloth.) (2) Lower prices. (Announce price limits for cotton cloth.) But reviewing the implementation of various measures, it seems to be close to passive prevention, so a comprehensive plan is needed.

The reasons for the sharp rise in cotton cloth prices are roughly as follows: The first surge was due to the panic of the New and Old Currency Exchange last year, but it quickly gradually returned to a lower level. This year's surge was due to (1) reduced production by spinning mills; (2) the impact of unfounded rumors of a 2:1 exchange of Joint Reserve Notes and Savings Certificates for new currency this spring, and the recall of military notes; (3) outsiders taking the opportunity to enter the market; and (4) the authorities restricting the movement of spot goods and prohibiting the sale of warehouse receipts, causing merchants holding goods to fear violating the law and to remain on the sidelines, resulting in a reduction in the amount of goods circulating on the market, supply falling short of demand, and every transaction exceeding the price limit, becoming an open secret.

However, according to the recent announcement by the National Commercial Control Federation, the inventory of cotton yarn and cloth in this city is extremely sufficient, enough to supply consumption for a considerable number of months. Therefore, today, for the overall problem of dealing with cotton cloth, emphasis should be placed on a comprehensive plan for the allocation of both inventory and consumption. (1) Request the authorities to announce the inventory of cotton cloth in this city (convert yarn reserves into cloth) and reserve it for several years of needs. (2) Adjust the established price limits. It is necessary to review whether the established price limits are appropriate. However, the price limits after adjustment, such as after a new announcement, must be decisive. The registered inventory should never be changed, in order to eliminate the idea of speculation and hoarding. (3) The Cotton Products Federation or the Cotton Cloth Guild should, according to the needs period announced by the authorities, accept the items and quantities requested by the demand side on a monthly basis in proportion (including retail merchants in this city and other cities, and the amount of foreign exports), and purchase and allocate them from inventory holders at the price limit. The purchase method may still allow free negotiation between buyers and sellers, but the payment of the goods must be made after the negotiation is completed, first by the demand side submitting it to the Cotton Products Federation or the Cotton Cloth Guild, and then paying it to the seller for delivery, in order to eliminate the trend of exceeding the price limit (limited to the actual allocation of spot goods). If the holder of the goods hoards and refuses to sell, the guild may order the purchase. (To be continued)

### Apprentice Diary

— Long Er

(1)

Three years of apprentice life have passed by emptying chamber pots, sweeping floors, opening and closing shop doors, and carrying bolts of cloth. But the boss has no intention of hiring another apprentice, and still only gives me ten yuan a month for spending money. Now it costs two yuan to get a haircut, what can I do?

The day before yesterday, Zhang, who came a month earlier than me, went to ask the boss about the salary issue. The boss turned red in the face and said to him: If you don't want to work here, you can go somewhere else.

(2)

I went home to see my mother at dusk. The five yuan I gave her the day before yesterday is already used up. Alas! The cost of living is soaring every day: last year, five yuan could last four or five days!

In the crimson twilight, it feels very cold. It's not the time to wear a lined shirt, but there are already seven or eight holes in my cotton robe. This spring, the boss widened his eyes and said to me: "Those who eat in a silk and satin shop must dress nicely!"

(3)

I am very worried. I am not worried about my hunchbacked mother, but about my young sister, who is also sixteen years old! Will she fall because of the environment? Will she be deceived?

I also thought about the few dilapidated houses passed down from our ancestors. When my father was alive, he had already sold a row of buildings to the Jin family. This time, my mother told me that the Jin family is preparing to buy the remaining few houses outside at a high price. Should we sell them, or not? "Of course not!" I thought firmly. But my mother has repeatedly borrowed more than one hundred yuan from the Jin family. Where can we get the money to pay it back? Ah, don't people even have the right to live in a few dilapidated houses?

(4)

Today, while eating, the boss scolded me fiercely, saying that I was not attentive to customers, that I always had a straight face, and that there was not a trace of a smile, and that customers didn't come to see my face. Alas, God, I am not putting on airs and selling smiles like a prostitute who has lost her soul. Why should I pretend to smile to cater to people? Besides, I was just daydreaming a bit, and was a little less attentive. I was thinking about my house, my mother, my sister!

(5)

"Hee hee, the price is the cheapest, you can rest assured."

"This pattern is the most fashionable, and the color is also very good. Hee hee"

I am always smiling like this in a series.

"Hee hee" seems like the teeth of a beast, and it is about to devour my youth.

(6)

Zhang has been recommended to a factory in Shanghai by his uncle. He has left this sea of suffering. When will I be able to escape this hateful situation?

The boss is suffering from a very serious typhoid fever. I am very happy. It is certain that those with a lot of wealth are weak in body, five thousand yuan of capital, and it has changed to seven hundred thousand.

(7)

Today, taking advantage of the boss's illness, I went home again. Coincidentally, my sister wanted to come and find me, wanting me to sign a deed to sell the house. Alas, Heaven knows, how can my trembling hand sign it? The house passed down from our ancestors, how dare I sell it? I put down the pen and rejected my sister's request.

Silvery-white earthworms crawled down from the corners of my mother's eyes, and my face also seemed to be a little itchy, and my chest was also wet.

[Long Er... You know, right? It's not that I'm heartless... I must sell it. What will life be like in the future... We owe the Jin family so much money, and we often borrow from your uncle's place...] My mother continued to say: [When your father died, he only left us fifty yuan and three dilapidated houses...]

[Mom, I know, too. Where will we live if we sell them?]

[In the countryside, at your uncle's place.]

(8)

In the morning, my mother and sister set off for the countryside together. The only property passed down from our ancestors was sold for only four hundred yuan. Alas, how long can the four hundred yuan last after deducting the old debts? What will we do when it's used up? Ah, ah, I dare not think about it.

From now on, I am the loneliest child. I have no sympathy or comfort, only coldness and disdain are cast upon me. The future is also vast and I am afraid that I will only be an apprentice for the rest of my life, being yelled at by people.

(9)

The boss has recovered from his illness, only sick for a month and a half.

Very serious damp-heat typhoid fever; if my mother had it, I am afraid she would be in the ground by now. I hope I can pray to Heaven to give blessings to my mother, so that she will not be uneasy and sick.

Received a letter from my mother, which made me miss her even more.

(10)

In the early morning, when opening the shop door, my limbs were frozen stiff, and I put on the tattered cotton robe without regard for anything.

In the afternoon, the young boss came to see the boss. He was wearing a neat thick velvet suit. I looked in the mirror. He was no more blessed than me, and his features were about the same as mine.

(11)

In the afternoon, two young customers came, a man and a woman. The boss personally traded with them, and bought several pieces of woolen fabric, worth more than five thousand. When paying, there were two ten-yuan bills, which the boss said were fake, because the printing was relatively blurry. The two insisted on not exchanging them. The boss was uneasy and asked me to take them to the department store across the street to ask.

Where did the fake bills come from at this time? The boss likes to nitpick. The manager sitting in the department store said they were good to use. I returned to the shop and told the boss and customers what the shop assistant said. The boss blushed, admitted his mistake, and apologized.

After the customers left, the boss grabbed the copper ruler on the table and chopped it over. I quickly dodged to the side, raised my right foot again, and kicked towards my stomach. At this time, I could explode. I have freedom. Although I eat his food, I also work for him. After all, I am not his slave.

I raised my left hand, clenched my right fist, and punched him in the chest. He fell and tumbled.

(12)

I left. I live in a small almshouse, and I feel like a cat. Although I have broken with my master, where is my home, and where can I find food?

In the middle of the night, the old cat croaked strangely, pulling up my memories. My mother often said to me: Long Er, you must be patient! A young man must be patient, and only with patience can he have food to eat.

However, how can I endure any longer? I want freedom! I have never been a slavish flatterer in my life, which is the most disadvantageous thing. If I could flatter, people would look at me differently, and there would be no need to be patient or not. In short, I lack a valuable heart to flatter.

### Night

— Xiu Jing

Dusk swallowed the crimson sunset;

Darkness spreads endlessly.

There is no moonlight, sparse stars blink playfully;

Only frogs stretch their tongues:

Ge ge ge…

As if with that lively sound,

Breaking the silence of the night.

The iron bench seems impatient with the loneliness of this clear night,

Wanting to break free from its shackles, to pursue the youthful singing of the day,

The heavy footsteps, when occasionally falling on the grass,

The grass emits a low squeak;

As if lamenting its youth, being destroyed for no reason.

### The Decline of a Weak Life

— Ling Zuren

—What does it matter if a few people die! There are plenty of living people!

"Mr. Ling! My body is not well! Please give me a few days off!"

When a weak and trembling voice vibrated in my ear, I habitually looked up and saw a female worker standing beside my typewriter. On her bloodless face, the two dull eyes revealed a powerless and desperate light, looking at me with a plea for help. Seeing it, I was a little scared, it would remind me of the eyes of a dying person.

"Okay! You can take a rest!"

"Thank you!" These three weak, feeble words burst out from the opening and closing of her slightly trembling grayish-white lips.

Then, she dragged her heavy steps away. I silently watched her thin back, and I began to feel sad for the fate of this poor person.

In the past few years, several times, several unfortunate people, after this situation, have disappeared forever.

When some people bring their "news of death," my heart always feels a violent tremor.

"Mr. Ling! My body is not well! Please give me a few days off!"

That powerless, weak, trembling... voice floated in my ear again, that bloodless face, the desperate and pleading light in the dull eyes, flashed in front of me again.

"Ah! Poor people!" I felt that there was a kind of wet liquid rolling in my eyes.

After that, the empty positions they left behind in the factory were immediately and easily filled by those newly arrived substitutes.

When I passed in front of those substitutes, I often focused my gaze on their faces. What I saw were all faces full of vitality. I was a little lost. The faces of those poor dead people flickered in front of me again. I will never forget their desperate and pleading eyes. I remember, when they first entered the factory, weren't they all the same as these energetic people? But, after the machines have absorbed their vitality, they have become rich sacrifices in front of the god of death.

Is it? Who can say for sure that these new substitutes will not fall into the same fate?

In this labor circle, the news of the death of some workers is something that everyone feels indifferent to. It is nothing more than providing some living people with some oral talking material. Yes! Who would really care about the decline of a weak life that has nothing to do with them!

The unfortunate news of death, at first, among the living, will still be hotly discussed, or criticize the deceased's strengths and weaknesses. Of course, these deceased people, during their lifetime, were just people who sold their labor. Therefore, in fact, they will not have any meritorious deeds, virtues, or words... and other words and deeds or movements to inherit to future generations, nor will they be like the great men who established great careers, who can leave people with an immortal impression. Therefore, soon, everyone will forget about this matter.

Every day, the looms, yarn spindles, still roar dully without stopping, every worker is still burying their heads, bending their waists, and using their thin hands to control those ignorant, cold and rigid machines. Who will ever go back to memory to find out the past traces—the news of death!

I also remembered a sentence said by a senior employee in this labor circle who is good at saying cold words: "What does it matter if a few people die! There are plenty of living people!"

Yes! The dead have certainly died quietly, but there are plenty of living people! Isn't it? Every day, how many living people are struggling on the line of death, using their blood and flesh to contend with life, forcibly supporting their weak bodies, and only a few remaining strength, squirming and toiling, ah! Those poor, many, living people!

"Mr. Ling! My body is not well! Please give me a few days off!"

This powerless, slightly trembling voice will always vibrate in my ear again! I am thinking.

### A Silver-Gray Hope

— Yuan Ying

After drinking a bowl of thin congee in the morning and going out with his uncle, Shen Xiaogen didn't rest his feet at all. In the afternoon, he came back with two extra dou of rice on his back. After circling a few times in the concession, he dragged his exhausted body back home.

"Go take a nap!" "Don't go to school today," his mother said as she picked up the rice sack, using a loving tone towards Xiaogen.

He certainly needed to sleep for a while, but he remembered that he had to go to school. Mr. Shi had said last week that there would be a writing competition today! ——— Yes! That's right, it's Thursday!

Thinking of the writing competition, Xiaogen immediately thought of the dense diagrams and "A" grades in his writing book. Mr. Shi had said:

"Shen Xiaogen has hope!"

So he struggled to get out of bed. He had to go to school! Besides, he was the class leader, and class leaders shouldn't be absent from class under any circumstances!

"I told you to take a nap, but you never listen! What are you getting up for?" His mother's voice rang from the corner of the room.

"I—I want to go to school!" Xiaogen said softly.

"You're courting death!" His mother got angry: "You've been running all day, and you still want to go to school?!"

"There's a writing competition today."

"Writing competition? — No matter what competition it is, it's not okay. Let me ask you: Do you want to live? Tomorrow I'm planning to talk to the teacher and tell him not to let you study anymore. Go earn some money with your uncle every day. Your father has been sick for more than ten days..."

"Don't study?" Xiaogen was shocked: "Mom! ...That's not possible! ...I've only been studying for a little over half a year..."

"This is your uncle's idea!" His mother still loved her son: "I still have to discuss it with your father... but you can't go today! ...You've run dozens of miles,... and it's too late to go anyway! It's already past six o'clock... the sun has already set..."

Xiaogen climbed onto the bed in despair.

What kind of topic will Mr. Shi give? ...They've probably already finished writing it, right? ...Who will finish first? ...Chen Meiying will definitely get first place this time! ...

"Ah—...yah—..."

He didn't know that this was his father. Looking at his father's pale face and his thin, reed-like body covered with a thin quilt, Xiaogen had a series of memories. Since the factory closed down, his father had never had a good life. First, he worked as a temporary laborer at the pier with Uncle Feng, then he started doing small business, setting up a stall; later, he carried Du rice with his uncle, running back and forth two or three times a day...

That's how he ruined his health, constantly coughing, sometimes even spitting up blood...

"Can't you rest for a few days?" His mother often complained like this.

"Rest for a few days?" His father always replied like this: "You always have such a pampered nature. Rest for a few days, what will we eat? Eat milk? Or ginseng and bird's nest?"

"Your health is not good!" His mother grumbled.

"I know," his father lowered his head: "But what can I do? ...Knowing that my body is not good, I still have to keep going! ...My... my life is over! Xiaogen... must live well! ...Study more! ...Fight for success! ..."

...

Thinking and thinking, Xiaogen's tears flowed down.

In the evening, his uncle came.

Seeing his uncle, Xiaogen felt half gratitude and half resentment.

"How is Xiaogen's father?" His uncle sat down at the table; "What I earned today should be enough for a dose of medicine!"

"The medicine has been taken!" His mother answered softly: "But there's not enough money to buy household rice! ..."

"Go earlier tomorrow and make more trips!"

"Let him rest for a day tomorrow!" His mother raised her head: "He was terribly exhausted today and didn't go to school either!"

"He's still a child after all! Not very useful!" His uncle shook his head: "But, he needs to practice next time! ...Hard days are ahead! ...However, I say, sister, if you really rely on him to take over his father's path,... then there's simply no need to go to school anymore! ...What's the use of studying? ..."

"No! Uncle!" Xiaogen cried out? "I... I want to study! I've only been studying for a little over half a year... Mr. Shi said..."

But thunder rumbled from the side of the table:

"Do you want to live? Do you want to support your father and mother?"

Xiaogen burst into tears on the table.

"Xiaogen! Listen to Mom!" His mother walked over: "Just listen to your uncle! Don't go to school starting tomorrow! Tell the teacher at school,... when Dad has money, we'll let you study again: ...Don't even go to the free night classes! ...Go to a good school, go to university! ..."

Xiaogen sobbed, stubbornly shaking his head.

"Good! That's settled!" His uncle stood up: "I say Xiaogen is not a muddled-headed child. ...He's very sensible and will understand Mom's meaning... I'll let you rest for one day tomorrow, and I'll come again tomorrow night!"

His uncle left.

Xiaogen sobbed.

His mother also sobbed.

Outside, the rain was also sobbing.

That morning, the rain had been falling continuously, drizzling and drizzling.

In the afternoon, the rain was lighter, and he went to school.

Luo Baokang, Big Head, Shi Rongde, they were all playing at the school gate.

"Oh! Shen Xiaogen is here! — Hey! Where's your schoolbag?"

"Shen Xiaogen! Why aren't you talking?"

"Hey! Why don't you say a word? Putting on airs?"

"Shen Xiaogen! Have you become mute?"

"Did you quarrel with someone!"

Xiaogen lowered his head and walked into the school gate without saying a word, followed by a large group of classmates.

"Shen Xiaogen—why didn't you come?" Mr. Shi was grading papers.

"He went to carry rice!" Big Head rushed to answer! "Luo Shikang went to his house!"

"Carry rice?" Mr. Shi said in disbelief! "Where are the adults in your family?"

"Dad is sick,... he's been sleeping for more than ten days... he hasn't had a dose of medicine! ...And there's no money to buy household rice..."

"How much can you earn in a day?"

"Yesterday..." Xiaogen shook his head! "Yesterday... I ran all day,... and it was only enough for one dose of medicine! ...But, Dad... is still the same today! ..."

Mr. Shi didn't respond. Xiaogen heard him sighing softly.

The classmates all held their breath, widened their eyes, and didn't say a word.

"Mr. Shi! ..." Xiaogen finally mustered his courage; "...Mom said... I have to go... carry rice every day from now on, so... I... I... I won't study anymore! ..."

Mr. Shi was silent, as if he had known it for a long time.

Luo Baokang, Big Head, Shi Rongde, and many other classmates were also silent, without a single sound.

Everyone felt like a big stone was pressing on their hearts...

"Dong dong! Dong dong! Dong dong! ..." The bell rang familiarly.

The classmates reluctantly walked out of the office one by one.

"Shen Xiaogen! Come play often in the future!" Big Head was the last to leave.

Xiaogen raised his sleeve and slowly wiped his eyes.

"Don't be sad!" Mr. Shi's voice also changed: "...Haven't I told you many times before? ...The childhood of truly great people is not spent in school! ...You are very smart and very hardworking! ...You have a lot of hope! ...Come and ask me whenever you have time!"

"Mr. Shi! You're so..." Xiaogen raised his tear-stained face.

"I know your difficulties!" Mr. Shi nodded: "But this is something that can't be helped. Come back when your dad gets better!"

"I... I'm leaving! ..." He remembered that his mother would tell him to go back early.

He hesitated and lifted his feet. In the classroom next door—in that familiar classroom, Mr. He was teaching arithmetic as usual, and the classmates were still sitting quietly as usual, listening, and after a while, they would still do problems as usual and get out of class as usual... But,...

Walking out of the school gate, his tears flowed again.

He remembered how happy he was last autumn when his father came back from outside and told him that he had seen an advertisement for a free night school on a utility pole and told him to sign up. He had finally stepped into the gate of the school! ...Even his father and mother often told people! "Xiaogen is in school now!" ...

He also remembered how the classmates had elected him as class leader because of his good grades—even though he was the youngest in the class! ...

...

Finally, he arrived home.

"Xiaogen's father! ...Xiaogen's father! ...Wake up! ...You... you..." His mother knelt in front of the bed and called out urgently.

He suddenly felt a burst of inexplicable terror. His body trembled violently, and he ran to the bed in a panic.

His father was still like that, lying quietly on the bed, his pale face covered with soybean-sized beads of sweat, his eyes closed, his cheekbones protruding high, and his hair like a tangled pile of weeds...

"Xiaogen's father! ..." His mother finally sobbed.

His father's eyes opened, his weak gaze slowly swept around, and he shook his head with great effort, intermittently:

"...I... I... can't... do... it... anymore... Xiaogen... must... live... well! ...Study... more... ..."

...

32.5.17. Late at night. In the sound of rain.
