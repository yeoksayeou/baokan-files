### Our Attitude

— Chen Binhe

Yesterday was the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, and also the first anniversary of the resumption of publication of this newspaper. In this past year, we are ashamed to say that we have made no contribution to the nation, society, or even Greater East Asia. However, compared to the attitude we have held from the beginning with the facts of the past year, after honest reflection, there is not much discrepancy. As for what our attitude is, it can be summarized into the following points:

Newspaper business is a permanent undertaking. Therefore, it should be managed with a detached sense of enterprise to establish a lasting foundation. It should constantly and correctly promote national welfare and people's livelihood, and absolutely not be used as a tool for temporary political propaganda. This is the fundamental viewpoint of this newspaper since its resumption of publication.

Our attitude towards the current situation is to support the Nanjing National Government's peace policies and national policies. At the same time, we will cooperate with allied nations to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War, taking the Greater East Asia Declaration passed by the recent Greater East Asia Conference as the highest political ideal.

Our attitude in writing is to fully rely on public opinion. The people are the foundation of the nation, and the nation is originally a collective of the people. It is not difficult to inspire the people's love for their country, and it can even be said to be innate. Whether it is developed and to what extent depends entirely on how much the rulers value public opinion. To put it bluntly, if the rulers value public opinion and cherish the people, then how can the people not cherish the government and the country? Based on this principle, we absolutely value public opinion. All our arguments are based on and express public opinion. Therefore, even if we advocate reforming politics to the government, and are somewhat straightforward, we do not care. We believe this attitude is the most sincere expression to the government. Because in today's era, hypocritical praise and flattery are neither what we want to say nor what we expect the wise authorities to want to hear. Secondly, our attitude towards allied nations in our writing is completely the same. Furthermore, we have always maintained that if the allied nations need to talk about genuine Sino-Japanese friendship, they must first understand Chinese public opinion. If they do not understand Chinese public opinion, then the foundation of all policies is no different from building on sand. We often adopt critical arguments to prompt the authorities of allied nations to pay attention to the fact that the traces of the past between China and Japan should be improved through a thorough understanding of public opinion.

Our attitude towards the Chongqing regime and the Chinese Communist Party is to oppose relying on Britain and the United States to undermine China's unity, and to oppose dragging the war and plunging the people into misery. However, we especially oppose the "amphibious animals" of double-dealing. What are "amphibious animals"? They are those who hang up a signboard, on one side Chongqing, but on the other side Nanjing or Japan, relying on tricks to deceive and confuse the public for their own gain.

In the past year, due to limitations in manpower and resources, there are many things that were planned but could not be done. Compared with advanced countries, China's news industry is indeed far behind. However, this newspaper has been published for seventy years and has a long-standing position in history. Binhe happens to be in charge of this newspaper at this time. I dare not usurp the past history and achievements of my predecessors. But I will never shirk my current responsibilities. I only hope that China's news industry can catch up and keep pace with advanced countries. That would be fortunate!

### Prime Minister's Broadcast Last Night to Commemorate the Third Year of Victory, and Attended the Prayer Festival at Yasukuni Shrine

Nationwide Silent Prayer for Certain Victory Held

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Two years have passed since Japan declared war on Britain and the United States. December 8th, a day that all East Asian nations will never forget, has come again. On this day, all Japanese citizens will offer a one-minute silent prayer for certain victory at 11:59 a.m. at their respective locations, echoing the determination to strike and destroy Britain and the United States. In Tokyo, citizens praying for certain victory in front of the Imperial Palace since morning have been continuous. The Yokusanzonendan mobilized 140,000 members nationwide at dawn to solemnly hold prayers for certain victory in various places. At 9:00 a.m., a ceremony to read the Imperial Rescript was held in the auditorium of Tokyo Imperial University. All universities and vocational schools across Japan also held similar ceremonies to pray for Japan's certain victory and to wish the students sent to the front a long and successful military career. Prime Minister Tojo, along with cabinet members, representatives of the army and navy, and various veterans' groups, attended the "Imperial Army's Prayer Festival for Lasting Military Fortune" held at Yasukuni Shrine at 10:00 a.m. to pray for certain victory to the spirits of the patriotic martyrs. Prime Minister Tojo also delivered a major broadcast speech at 7:20 p.m. on the 8th to the 100 million people of Japan and the 1 billion people of East Asia, commemorating the third year of victory.

### Prime Minister Tojo's Broadcast Address

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - On the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Prime Minister Tojo of Japan delivered a special broadcast to the nation from the Central Broadcasting Station at 7:20 p.m. on the 8th, urging the people to unite and work together to strive for final victory. The original text is as follows:

Two years have passed since our country declared war on Britain and the United States on December 8th of the year before last. Looking back over the past two years, our army, under the Emperor's grace, has planned well and fought bravely. Recently, taking advantage of the enemy's large-scale counter-offensive, we have successively achieved rare and great victories. We are currently striving for final victory. I would like to express my deep gratitude to all the soldiers fighting day and night on the entire front line, express my condolences to the heroic spirits who died in battle, and express my deep respect to the people who have worked hard and strived for final victory.

Allied Nations Closely United, the Future is Full of Light

Two years ago today, in order to break the economic and military oppression of Britain and the United States, and to achieve our country's own independence and self-defense, we had no choice but to resolutely take up arms. Therefore, our righteous army was invincible, and the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States were swept away and driven out of East Asia. The nations of Greater East Asia rose up, and the nations of Greater East Asia, based on brotherly relations, intensified their cooperation to transform abundant resources into war power, and worked together to build Greater East Asia based on morality, striving to achieve common goals. The firm common determination of the one billion people of Greater East Asia has been further consolidated by the recent Greater East Asia Conference. Comparing this with the situation before the war, it is clear that the situation in Greater East Asia has completely changed, and our future is now wide open and full of light. On the other hand, the fighting spirit of the European allied nations is also becoming more and more vigorous, overcoming all difficulties and continuing to strive. Our country's cooperation with the European allied nations is also becoming closer day by day. The East and the West echo each other to crush the ambitions of Britain and the United States, and continue to bravely advance towards the common goal of building a new world order.

Points out that the Cairo Conference Exposes the Ambitions of Domination

Looking at the enemy's side, the British and American leaders often shout about justice, humanity, fraternity, benevolence, and righteousness, but what they do is completely contrary to this. For example, their barbaric act of repeatedly bombing our hospital ships is not allowed by gods and men. In order to seek their own prosperity, they do not hesitate to sacrifice other countries and other nations. They shout about opening the door and equal opportunities to our East Asia, while implementing exclusionary policies and unequal treatment against the nations of East Asia in their own countries. In short, what they seek from the nations of East Asia is to be their permanent slaves. Recently, the British and American leaders held talks in Cairo, arbitrarily discussing the disposal of East Asia, and attempting to make Japan a third-rate country. This is enough to prove that they are tired of fighting and feel deeply uneasy about the future, so they are trying to cover up their current failures. They did not mention the regions of the world that have not been plundered by them for many years, or the nations under their oppression, because what they seek is neither justice nor humanity, but still to extract from other nations to seek their selfish prosperity. Today, they are playing tricks on Chongqing, making them continue to engage in useless resistance. Their intention is obviously to permanently alienate the nations of Greater East Asia, making East Asia their colony forever, and completing their ambition to dominate East Asia. The so-called Cairo Conference is nothing more than exposing their ambitions to the world and explaining what their war aims are.

Increasingly Strengthen Unity to Cope with Long-Term War

Their ideals are completely incompatible with the noble spirit shared by the nations of Greater East Asia. The noble spirit shared by the nations of Greater East Asia is to maintain friendly relations with all countries in the world, eliminate racial discrimination, communicate cultures, and further open up resources, so as to contribute to world culture. The people of Britain and the United States are being deceived by tyrannical and unscrupulous leaders, and the suffering of the war is becoming increasingly profound. It is inevitable that they will doubt the purpose of this war. The British and American leaders are currently taking active actions to try to achieve their greedy and insatiable ambitions. In their anxiety, they are repeatedly launching stubborn counter-offensives, which is expected. Therefore, the war situation will become more intense and prolonged. We have long held the determination that the means adopted to strike at the tyrannical Britain and the United States have been revealed. Since the enemy is trying to achieve their ambitions by violence, we can only destroy them by strength. Because forbearance and self-respect have reached their limit, we have no choice but to take up arms for self-preservation and self-defense. The determination made on this day two years ago is like yesterday. Now, with the belief of certain victory, we will increasingly strengthen the unity of Greater East Asia, and hold the determination to completely destroy Britain and the United States. No matter how fierce the enemy's counter-offensive is, we will not care. We will only resolutely repay them with killing, and further give them a thorough beating until they surrender.

One Hundred Million People United as One to Strive for Final Victory

The way to victory is definitely not something that can be obtained easily. It requires one hundred million people at home and abroad to do their best in their respective positions and daily lives to fulfill their utmost sincerity in serving the country in order to achieve it. The key to victory is in our own hands, and the fervent loyalty, fervent souls, and strong will to destroy the enemy are the foundation of final victory. If our one hundred million compatriots can unite as one, do their best, and fight to the death, then final victory will surely be ours. You, the soldiers on the front line, are fighting fiercely and achieving brilliant victories near Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands, and in central China. This is commendable and grateful. All our soldiers deeply understand the great righteousness, do not expect to return alive, and are willing to leave their homes and go to the front line. Seeing the patriotic enthusiasm of all sectors of the people, we are even more convinced that victory will belong to us. Although our compatriots at home are still in the rear, their hearts are on the battlefield, vowing to strengthen their combat power during wartime. With the belief of a long-term war, and striving to make the third year the decisive year, we will surely be able to accomplish the country's future. Moreover, the hearts of one hundred million Japanese people are also the hearts of one billion people in Greater East Asia. Therefore, if the Greater East Asia War cannot be completed, Greater East Asia cannot be built. Whether the one billion people of Greater East Asia can live and work in peace and prosperity, or fall under the oppression of Britain and the United States again, depends on this great war. Our one hundred million compatriots and the one billion people of Greater East Asia will join hands to complete the war and complete the construction. This is inevitable. On the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I would like to renew the determination made two years ago with all the people, uphold the belief of certain victory, and vow to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Military Progress in China War During the Second Anniversary of the Great East Asian War Japanese Dispatch Army Authorities Announced Talks Yesterday

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Dispatch Army authorities stationed in China issued a statement on the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, as follows:

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War and the China War, the Allies suffered a disastrous defeat. Knowing the disadvantage of the long-term war of attrition, they obtained a fully prepared wartime situation and strived for a counterattack. Currently, fierce decisive battles are being developed in the southern sea area. In addition to the counterattack in the southern sea area, the Allies attach importance to the counterattack in Burma, which is a link in the counterattack against Japan, and the counterattack from the mainland of China, driving the Chongqing side to fight a thorough war of resistance, and attempting to directly bomb the Japanese mainland by the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and cut off maritime transportation. However, after Chongqing gave up hope of self-reliance in the war of resistance, it tried its best to place its hopes on relying on Britain and the United States, dreaming of the victory of the anti-Axis countries, allowing Britain and the United States to grasp the supreme command and the arrogance of the air force. Even the economic re-invasion continues its recklessness. Therefore, the current stage of the war on the Chinese mainland is gradually showing a complex and profound phenomenon. The status of the Chinese front in the Greater East Asia War is also becoming more important. In the second year of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Dispatch Army stationed in China not only engaged in its original mission of destroying the Chongqing army and launching active mopping-up operations against the communist army, but also took preemptive measures against the movements of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force to block their so-called air raids on the Japanese mainland.

The War Results of the Japanese Dispatch Army in China for One Year. The most important operations of the Japanese Dispatch Army stationed in China in the past year include the Taihang Mountain operations in the spring and summer of North China, the anti-communist operations in the autumn, the Dabie Mountain operations in Central China, the offensive operations in the spring and summer, the operations in the southwest area of Taihu Lake, the operations in the Guangzhou Bay and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line areas in South China, and the currently launched offensive operations in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Other active activities have also been continuously carried out in Mongolia, Central China, South China, and North China. Now, let's list the general war results as follows: (A) The number of battles is approximately 22,000, with an average of 1,900 per month and approximately 67 per day, which is slightly less than the 25,000 in the previous year. Moreover, the number of military launches is about the same as last year. From this point of view, it is sufficient to prove that the Chongqing army is trying its best to avoid combat. (B) The total number of combat troops is approximately 3,300,000, which is slightly less than the 3,600,000 in the previous year. The reason for this is, of course, none other than the Chongqing army's efforts to avoid combat mentioned in the previous item. However, on the other hand, it can also prove the difficulty of replenishing the Chongqing army's troops. (C) Approximately 210,000 Chongqing troops were killed in battle, and approximately 200,000 were captured and surrendered. The ratio of the latter to the former is 95%. However, this ratio was 12% in the 29th year of the Republic of China, 29% in the 30th year of the Republic of China, and 44% in the 31st year of the Republic of China. From this point of view, in the most recent year, the number of people captured and surrendered has greatly increased. However, in the past, most of them were local and scattered surrenders, but now they have become group and regional surrenders. This is because the military and civilians under the rule of Chongqing have realized that the war of resistance is not a plan, and it is sufficient to prove the decline in the Chongqing army's combat power. (D) The number of artillery and heavy firearms intercepted by the Japanese army has decreased compared to the past, but the number of bayonets and other weapons has increased, which is sufficient to prove that after the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing army's supply route was cut off, and the replenishment of its main weapons was insufficient, so its equipment gradually declined.

Situation. (A) Chongqing side. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to the deterioration of the internal and external situation, the Chongqing side's weaknesses, such as the economic crisis and the decline of popular sentiment, were successively exposed. However, the Chongqing side still imagined that Britain and the United States would win the victory, so that they could win the victory when the world war ended. Therefore, on the outside, they only knew how to flatter Britain and the United States. On the inside, they avoided military consumption, focused on internal construction, and devoted themselves to solving the economic difficulties of the war of resistance. At the same time, for their internal construction, they focused on developing the border areas. From this, it can be seen that the Chongqing side's so-called war of resistance and national construction and post-war management, although containing many weaknesses, still act arbitrarily. At the same time, they do not express any cooperation with the British and American counter-offensive operations in East Asia. However, in view of the blows suffered on the Burma front in the past, they still have a sense of unease in this operation to recapture Burma. (B) Chongqing-Communist relations. When the Soviet Union announced the dissolution of the Third International, the Chongqing side took the opportunity to increase pressure on the Chinese Communist Party, resulting in conflicts between Chongqing and the Communist Party in various places. The degree of opposition between the two sides is unprecedented. The Chongqing side demanded that the Chinese Communist Party reflect on itself, claiming that it hoped to solve the political problem and attempted to stop the Communist Party's edge. At the same time, it adopted all measures to suppress or even destroy the expansion of the Communist Party's power in both material and spiritual aspects. After the dissolution of the Third International, the Chinese Communist Party tried its best to prevent internal turmoil. At the same time, it always demonstrated its armed resistance to the Chongqing side. In fact, the efforts made by both sides to solve the current Chongqing-Communist problem are all aimed at benefiting themselves. In this way, the Chongqing-Communist sides have gone through several divisions and mergers in the modern Chinese revolution, and are still continuing their ugly and nameless struggle. (C) U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is sufficient to reflect the United States' active intention to counterattack Japan. This is the independent 14th Air Force of the Army, commanded by Brigadier General Chennault, under the command of the U.S. Air Force stationed in India in October of this year. Since then, it has been actively strengthened in terms of both manpower and resources. There have been sorties in the past, but our air force often implements appropriate advance operations, so until now, it has not been able to fulfill its plan to bomb the Japanese mainland. Until recently, a part of the Chongqing Air Force was incorporated under its command to establish a U.S.-Chongqing mixed air force unit, gradually showing the power of the U.S. Air Force to dominate the Chongqing Air Force. At the same time, it also wants to greatly strengthen the U.S. Air Force itself in the near future in order to bomb our battlefields and block maritime transportation lines. This should be closely monitored and guarded. Conclusion. In this second year of the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese front has gradually changed its state, increasingly increasing the importance of a link in the Greater East Asia War. As mentioned above, in the third year of the war, the Chongqing side did not understand our country's true intentions, but overestimated our strength and continued its war of resistance policy. Although the Chongqing side will try its best to avoid military consumption and adopt guerrilla tactics to disrupt the security work in the rear, the United States, in order to achieve its ambition to control East Asia, is actively planning to launch a counteroffensive from the Chinese front. At the same time, it is also not difficult to understand that it is seizing the opportunity to bomb the Japanese mainland more urgently. From the above points, the situation on the Chinese front in the third year of the Greater East Asia War cannot be underestimated. Our country's strategic posture toward the Chongqing side, from Mongolia, through North China, Central China, South China, Vietnam, Thailand, to Burma, forms a winding 4,000-kilometer encirclement line. The strategically important strongholds are all in our army's hands, so it is not difficult to give them a painful blow at any time and anywhere. The so-called leading troops deep into the enemy's territory and controlling their fate is by no means difficult under our army's strategy. As for the U.S. Air Force, its main bases are now all within our army's sphere of influence. In order to destroy its bases and eliminate its power, our army has completed all preparations, which is the clearest. The dispatch group adheres to the established policy, increasingly promoting its morale, strengthening its combat power and war preparations, and exerting its full strength to destroy all resistance forces that stand in the way of the Greater East Asia War.

### Youth Hold Dawn General Mobilization

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – Two years have passed since Japan officially declared war on Britain and the United States. Throughout East Asia, everyone is celebrating this second anniversary. In the capital, youth league members gathered at 8:00 AM in front of the Sun Yat-sen statue at Xinjiekou to hold a Dawn Mobilization Assembly. After the ceremony, they held a city-wide parade and planted trees at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Youth league members from various schools went to the National Assembly Hall to participate in a Pro-Asia Lecture after the Dawn Mobilization Assembly. In the afternoon, the Propaganda Department, in conjunction with China Film Company, screened a movie at the National Assembly Hall. Japanese residents, starting from the morning of the 8th, wore battle uniforms, abstained from smoking and drinking, and paraded in the city as a volunteer army, shouting "Down with Britain and America" and "Victory in the Greater East Asia War." The entire city, Chinese and Japanese civilians alike, were filled with intense and fierce combat spirit.

### National Government's Declaration of War Proclamation

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th two years ago, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with friendly nation Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public order, and attended to people's livelihood, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and other countries continue to use their century-old policy of dividing and controlling East Asia, and have even intensified their efforts, even colluding with the Chongqing faction to participate in the so-called Anglo-American battle line, sending troops to Burma and India, using East Asians to kill East Asians. Recently, because their forces have been successively defeated by the armies, navies, and air forces of friendly nation Japan, and their bases for invading East Asia have also been lost, they have become even more cunning. Moreover, they are jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's controlled areas, constantly instigating the Chongqing faction to harass us, in order to obstruct the progress of various construction projects, and even directly using their own aircraft, using the Chongqing faction as a base, to repeatedly bomb our Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The Chongqing faction, willingly subjected to British and American manipulation and acting as traitors to East Asia, is indeed shameful. Moreover, Britain and the United States, harboring ulterior motives toward East Asia, have exhausted their ability to sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate ambition of annexation. This is something that East Asian nations should regard as a common enemy. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is at war with Britain and the United States, and will exert all its strength to cooperate with friendly nation Japan, sweeping away the brutality of Britain and America in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two countries, Manchukuo and Thailand, have always maintained friendly relations and share the same heart for the common prosperity of East Asia. In the future, they should further cooperate in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on righteousness. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been engaged in a struggle with British and American forces in the West for many years, repeatedly winning glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and should echo them in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All of our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Three Principles of the People’s concept of Greater Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of righteous peace for the entire world all depend on this. Let us be of one mind and one heart, exerting our strength from beginning to end, in order to fulfill this great mission of this great era!

January 9th, Year 32 of the Republic of China Chairman: Wang Zhaoming

### Former Lieutenant General Tanaka's Remarks

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Naval Attaché to China, Lieutenant General Minoru Tanaka, issued a statement on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the gist of which is as follows: Two years ago today, the Imperial Rescript was promulgated, followed immediately by the announcement of major victories such as the Battle of Hawaii, the air raid on the Philippines, and the landing in Malaya. The morale of the Japanese people can be said to be unprecedented. Now, at a time when major victories have been repeatedly won in the South Pacific, on this second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I am deeply gratified. The ambitions of the enemy countries to invade East Asia for centuries were extinguished one after another by the Japanese army in less than half a year after the start of the war. Now, everywhere is a place for the coexistence of all nations, and the construction of co-prosperity among all countries is being carried out in order to cooperate in completing the war. Since the Greater East Asia Conference, the unity of East Asian nations has been further strengthened. However, at this time, the enemy's counter-offensive momentum cannot be underestimated. Fierce naval battles are currently unfolding. Judging from the war situation in Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands, it can be seen that the enemy is trying to counterattack, disregarding great sacrifices and fighting desperately. Therefore, the war situation is very serious. We must, no matter what, defeat Britain and America and thoroughly punish their delusions. Both sides have achieved great results in this war. In today's total war, there is no distinction between the front and the rear, no distinction between inside and outside. Everyone is on the front line and should each stay in their own position. With the strength of one billion people in East Asia, united as one, the path to East Asia has already been clearly indicated in the previous Greater East Asia Declaration. However, the road ahead is still long and difficult. In the future, there is no room for optimism. Today, we can only strive forward towards this light in an effort to restore East Asia to its original state. Although the East Asian issue is extremely complex and divergent, its core is actually China and Japan. If these two countries are not closely united, they cannot be the central axis of East Asian unity. Therefore, in order to complete the war and build up the stock after the war, the Sino-Japanese national relations should be based on the treaty of alliance to establish a permanent foundation of friendship. This matter, although it must wait for the sincere awakening of the peoples of the two countries and their mutual active understanding, is extremely important for the efforts of Japanese residents in China in their respective positions. The most important thing for us in the local area is to contribute to the completion of the war in our own position, paying attention to the long past and the reality, and realizing that this is not easy. However, we must face the future, strive to rise up. The relationship between countries is a matter between people. Whether things succeed or not depends on how sincere people are. The permanent and unchanging affection of the nation and the people is based on mutual trust and reliance. We must treat people and handle affairs with a sincere and humble attitude before God, and then we will surely have a sense of mutual trust and respect. Moreover, if the local area is strong, then people should also use the spirit of brave battle like the soldiers on the front line, with one heart and one mind, and give their sincerity to the 400 million people of China. I deeply hope that on this day next year, I will be able to see this kind of transformation.

Imperial Rescript Recitation Ceremony

### Chongqing's 10th Army Completely Annihilated

Hankou, 8th (Central News Agency) – Zhou Yingxiang, commander of the 3rd Division of Chongqing's 10th Army, previously led his division north from the 9th War Zone to rescue Changde. When he reached Leijiazhou, 24 kilometers south of Changde, he was surrounded and fiercely attacked by the Japanese army and suffered heavy losses. As a result, Division Commander Zhou Yingxiang only led a remnant regiment to Zhangshan City, 5 kilometers south of Changde. However, in that area, they were again surrounded by the Japanese army. By the morning of the 4th, there were few left in that unit. Thereupon Division Commander Zhou Yingxiang led several of his subordinates to escape the Japanese encirclement. They attempted to escape northwest along the Yuan River, but the Japanese army continued to pursue them fiercely. By 6:00 PM that afternoon, the division commander was shot in the head and died in battle. Zhang Huimin, commander of the 9th Regiment of the division, also died in battle on the 3rd. According to reports, Sun Zhaojin, commander of the 10th Division, and Zhu Yue, commander of the 190th Division, of the 10th Army, which went north to rescue Changde, have all died in battle one after another. Now, Zhou Yingxiang, commander of the 3rd Division, has also died in battle. The army is almost completely annihilated.

Hankou, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing-American joint air force sent fourteen P-40 aircraft to the airspace over Changde twice on the 5th, two of which were shot down by the Japanese army. At 12:30 noon and 4:55 PM, they came again repeatedly, with a total of twenty-five North American B-25 P-40 fighter-bombers. Japanese fighter planes engaged them in fierce air battles, shooting down ten P-40 aircraft and destroying several B-25 aircraft. The remaining aircraft fled, and all Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

### President Jiang of the Examination Yuan Talks About Future Plans

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – Two years have passed in a flash since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Yesterday, the reporter paid a special visit to Jiang Kanghu, President of the Examination Yuan of the National Government, to inquire about future plans for promoting the national examination administration. He said the following: The Examination Yuan is in charge of four types of examinations: Higher Examinations, Ordinary Examinations, Special Examinations, and Certification Examinations. In the three years since the return to the capital, only two Higher Examinations have been held in the capital and North China. The Examination Yuan will propose that the other three types of examinations should be held successively in the near future, so that examinations will be the only legitimate way for the state to select and employ talents, and the Examination Yuan will be the only government agency to implement the examination administration. The planned plan is like this, and thereafter, we will gradually promote it according to the needs of the facts and the permission of the environment.

### Turkish President Meets with Roosevelt and Churchill in Cairo No Military Representatives Participate

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports that a British correspondent in Cairo reports that Roosevelt and Churchill in Cairo have held a meeting with Turkish President İsmet İnönü to exchange views on the Tehran Conference. British Foreign Secretary Eden, US representative Hopkins, and Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu also participated in the discussions.

Ankara, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, Turkish President İsmet İnönü had not yet returned to the Turkish capital yesterday afternoon but was already on the way from Adana to the Turkish capital. According to people close to the Turkish Prime Minister, General Taksamak did not accompany İsmet to Cairo. Apart from the President's adjutant, no military representatives participated in the Cairo Conference. The speculation that military issues were not discussed at the Cairo Conference is probably correct. According to British sources, the Cairo Conference was not a continuation of the Adana Conference, which focused on military matters. Turkish political sources believe that İsmet has received reports on the resolutions and results of the Tehran Conference. İsmet's visit was probably suggested by Roosevelt, and the Cairo Conference has become more important due to the Tehran Conference communique calling on all countries to participate in the war against Germany. İsmet may report to a special cabinet meeting today on his visit to Cairo.

Berlin Keeps Silent

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, the German Foreign Ministry yesterday still refrained from clarifying its attitude towards the rumored meeting between Turkish President İsmet İnönü and Roosevelt and Churchill. A spokesman pointed out that although Turkish newspapers have published their views, the Turkish official authorities have not issued a statement. Turkish newspapers have emphasized that Turkey's neutrality policy was decided by the agreement of the Turkish President, government, and National Assembly, and there is no reason to change it.

Istanbul, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu met with German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, at noon on the 6th for a meeting.

German Newspapers Comment on the Iranian Conference

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, local newspapers commented on the Tehran Conference communique, believing that the conference was a political failure and that all discussions were controlled by Stalin. Roosevelt and Churchill had to follow Stalin's wishes. The "Berlin Evening News" stated that the communique was very short and contained nothing surprising. We had expected that the participants would appeal to small countries and that they would continue to put pressure on them because Roosevelt could not return home empty-handed. The Tehran Conference and recent history's encouragement regarding the future of small countries are the most inappropriate measures to gain the trust of small countries and can be viewed as a political failure.

Voroshilov Reportedly to Visit Britain to Discuss Military Plans

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, Washington sources: The news that Soviet General Voroshilov is about to visit London has made Americans more confident that the date of the invasion of Western Europe is near. It is expected that General Voroshilov's mission is to jointly agree on an offensive plan with the British and American chiefs of staff.

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, London sources: General Smuts met with Roosevelt and Churchill in Cairo.

### Fierce Battle for Monte Cassino The Focus of the Italian War Shifts to the West

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, the anti-Axis forces broke the quiet atmosphere on the southern Italian front on Monday. The British Eighth Army and the US Fifth Army participated in the offensive at the same time. The focus of the war is still on the flanks. The US military, on the western flank, launched an attack on various points of the front line with a large number of troops after artillery preparation. Its main target was Monte Cassino. After a day of fierce fighting, the enemy was able to gain some foothold in the mountainous area. Monte Cassino is located on the east bank of the Garigliano River, the outpost of the main German front line. The US military is now holding its newly acquired positions to block the German counterattack. The situation in the central Apennines has not changed. The enemy has repeatedly attacked Ortona in the east of the area without success. On the Adriatic coast, British troops have reached various points on the Moro River. The pressure of the British Eighth Army on the eastern flank is not as strong as that of the US military on the western flank. This is probably because the British heavy artillery has not been transported to the front. Heavy rain and the German minefields have caused great difficulties for transportation.

### Pétain Declares Continued Rule

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said yesterday in response to inquiries from foreign reporters that the German authorities were unaware of General Pétain's statement that he would continue to govern. This statement does not conflict with the current situation. The spokesman also said that French Prime Minister Laval also participated in the talks between General Pétain and German Ambassador Abetz. No other details were disclosed.

### Berlin Zoo Destroyed in Air Raid

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: During the recent terrorist air raid on the German capital by British and American planes, the Berlin Zoo was destroyed, and many animals died. The elephant house was bombed, and nine of the ten giant elephants died. The aquarium was directly hit, and snakes and fish were buried in the ashes. Many lions, tigers, and leopards were also bombed to death. At the same time, one polar bear had to be euthanized due to severe injuries. All but one giraffe had to be euthanized. Many red deer, antelopes, and monkeys were also bombed to death. At the same time, a large birdcage was partially destroyed.

### Turkish Prime Minister Scheduled to Deliver Speech

Istanbul, 8th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu will deliver a speech during the annual Savings Week, which is scheduled for the 12th of this month.

### German Home Front Determined Not to Waver Goebbels Delivers Speech

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech at the "German Railway Workers' Day" rally held here yesterday, saying that terrorist threats or promises are not enough to dampen the spirit of the German people and their resistance. Under any circumstances, the German home front will never be divided. This is our only opinion on the Tehran Conference. Our enemies are not appealing to the German people because they know that this appeal will be difficult to achieve. Finally, Goebbels expressed his gratitude to the German railway workers for their achievements in difficult times and said that unconditional or unconditional surrender would not be accepted by the German people.

### The Collapse of the Enemy's General Counteroffensive: A Dialogue Between the Naval Press Section Chief and the Army Press Section Chief of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters (Part 2)

The Relationship Between War Results and the War Situation

Colonel Matsumura: War results and the war situation are different, and this is also the case from the Navy's perspective. I will now give a rough overview of the enemy's counteroffensive. Roosevelt stated in his memorandum: "Regarding Japan, it is necessary to repeatedly attack various points of its national defense circle from all directions simultaneously." After the Quebec Conference, Churchill reported to Parliament that British forces were launching in Burma. Since October 7th, Mountbatten has been to New Delhi to assume the position of Supreme Commander of Southeast Asia, and recently has either visited Chongqing to meet Chiang Kai-shek or flown to Cairo to attend meetings, engaging in various activities. After the end of the rainy season, due to the previous tragedy in Arakan, today's preparations are extremely cautious, building airfields, laying roads, requisitioning ships, proceeding steadily and cautiously, and the bombing of Burma is becoming increasingly intense. According to the current situation, Mountbatten's counteroffensive seems to be at the end of this year or the beginning of next year. As for the second counteroffensive, it is MacArthur's counteroffensive, centered on Australia, aimed at New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. As Navy's Tashiro-kun warned earlier, currently Timor, Ambon, Aroe, and other places are under constant surveillance, and there are occasional air raids by more than ten aircraft. In addition, there is Nimitz's counteroffensive, which is aimed at the Gilbert Islands. The purpose, as Knox said, is to attack the Marshall Islands and shorten the US-Australian communication line. In short, with India and the Pacific as the stage, just as Roosevelt's memorandum mentioned, entering the second year of the war, we will simultaneously face strong counteroffensives from three directions, which can be clearly anticipated.

Colonel Kurihara: That's indeed the case. I had thought that once the rainy season ended, the Burma counteroffensive would come, but who knew the result would be "hearing the sound of footsteps but not seeing anyone come down the stairs." However, the fighting in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Gilbert Islands has been quite lively. Fortunately, as the Imperial Headquarters has announced on several occasions, in the Bougainville area, from the naval battle off Bougainville Island to the first to fifth air battles, many aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and other vessels have been sunk or destroyed, and considerable damage has been inflicted on enemy aircraft. After the situation there calmed down somewhat, their counteroffensive against the Gilbert Islands began again. Fortunately, considerable damage has also been inflicted on enemy fleets. The purpose of this counteroffensive, as just mentioned, is to put pressure on the Marshall Islands area. They claim that this is the first step in attacking the Japanese mainland and that it can shorten the US-Australian communication line. However, our war results, as you know, are truly great war results since Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. However, the enemy's counteroffensive on Bougainville Island has a very significant impact on the so-called Pacific war situation.

This means that in the battle for air bases, the acquisition of air bases is a very important issue. Similarly, regarding the Gilbert Islands, the enemy's landing on Tarawa Island and Makin Island is indeed no small matter. This point, I think, is precisely the problem of carefully considering war results and the war situation.

Landing Points Difficult to Reinforce

Colonel Matsumura: Although we inflicted serious blows on them tactically, they advanced their bases strategically, which is extremely regrettable. In fact, since the major battle of Guadalcanal, they have conducted such tests in Rentba, New Georgia, Bougainville, and other places, and their method is exactly the same: forming aircraft carrier groups and landing under the cover of bombing and naval gunfire. The landing sites are chosen where Japanese forces are extremely thinly deployed. This time, in the Bougainville Island area, although the Navy inflicted considerable damage, the enemy forces that slipped through still landed secretly. The reason why the war situation in that area is not good is that the Solomon Islands are sparsely populated, culturally backward, and there is hardly a decent road on the islands. Even on Bougainville Island, near the Torokina landing site, there were not many Japanese troops stationed, and they were subjected to intense naval gunfire and bombing, but the survivors still fought hard, sinking dozens of enemy landing craft. Torokina, where the American forces landed, is flanked by extremely swampy areas and backed by mountains and dense forests. Therefore, it is quite difficult to use trucks to transport large forces in a timely manner to the enemy's landing site, to put pressure on them and prevent them from gaining a foothold on the shore. They are striving to build an airfield and have also deployed a considerable number of aircraft. As they themselves say, "advancing is difficult." Land advances seem to have little hope. They probably want to create a flying base there to hinder Japanese supplies. In other words, it is the so-called supply war.

Creating an air base on an island makes connections and supply difficult, which is not only seen in this island battle on the ocean. In an uncivilized place where the population is less than one person per square kilometer, there is not even a proper road, and coastal communication relies solely on small boats, so reinforcements cannot immediately reach the landing site. Therefore, after we received the report of the enemy landing at Torokina, the troops rushing to the scene walked for two full days in the 20-kilometer dense forest. During this time, the enemy was able to unload artillery and tanks, consolidate their positions, and establish themselves on the shore. They also built an airfield, and as a result, the range of aircraft influence expanded northward.

The Purpose of Establishing Bases

Duane, the US Air Force commander on Bougainville Island, declared that if the US forces gain a foothold at Torokina, the Japanese forces will not be able to withdraw or resupply. Therefore, they only seek to secure a point on the island. It seems that although the Navy has achieved such great war results, the enemy forces that slipped through still landed and gained a foothold.

Colonel Kurihara: Yes. In fact, cutting off the enemy's supply line is indeed the most important thing. We are now working hard to cut off the supplies of the enemy forces landed at Torokina. However, it is still necessary to win in the fierce air battles and seize air and sea control for this work. Therefore, it is necessary to have a considerable number of aircraft. In the end, I think the problem is still the number of aircraft.

The Number of Aircraft and Air Supremacy

Colonel Matsumura: Yes. In the end, it is still a matter of aircraft. If most of the time each day were under our air supremacy, we could certainly restrain them with great effort.

Colonel Kurihara: Indeed, indeed. From this, we know that the problem of the number of aircraft is indeed a very important issue. In short, to seize air supremacy, a considerable number of aircraft is necessary. When the aircraft of both sides encounter each other, the friendly aircraft that shot down some enemy aircraft have to return to base due to fuel and other reasons. At this time, if there are many aircraft, then when some aircraft return to base for replenishment, another batch of fresh air force can be dispatched, so that air supremacy can be maintained at all times.

The American method of operation relies entirely on absolute numerical superiority. Therefore, when the aircraft of both sides meet, although the American aircraft are driven away, they cannot stay in the air for a long time due to the nature of the aircraft, and the result is that they have to return to base. Therefore, even if air supremacy is obtained, it is only for a very few hours during the day. As a result, after this period, the other side sends fresh troops to operate.

Therefore, no matter what, air supremacy is held by the side with the most aircraft. Due to this reason, the supply war cannot be carried out as ideally as possible. When thinking about such things, I hope that the people will be more serious about the increased production of aircraft.

Colonel Matsumura: In fact, the Navy has already overcome difficulties such as thin clouds and dawn, and has struck the US Navy and destroyed enemy air power. Therefore, as long as there is an equal air force, air supremacy will belong to us. However, due to the large number of enemy aircraft, most of the time each day air supremacy falls into the hands of the other side, so that supply and other things become very difficult. To reverse this situation, intercept the enemy's counteroffensive, and defeat the enemy, we hope to have more aircraft no matter what.

Colonel Kurihara: Exactly. Absolutely!

General Conditions of Air Combat in the South

Colonel Matsumura: The American Air Force's attack tactics in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands generally take the method of group attacks, relying solely on numbers, and attacking in batches. After one attack team returns, another considerable number of aircraft flies in after two or three hours, and they do this continuously. Therefore, although our side initially soars into the sky, defending against their attacks, and engaging them in aerial warfare, but later, due to running out of gasoline and ammunition, we have to come down; at this time, the enemy's fresh troops have flown in to attack, and the battle will of course be very difficult and unfavorable. Moreover, the enemy also sends many reconnaissance aircraft, flying everywhere, and once they discover a good target, they use the phrase "Sometimes the opportunity is there, but there is no aircraft!" In short, opportunities are always there, but unfortunately there are no aircraft to seize the opportunity. The state of the Southern Front is so tragic!

Their ground forces have no spirit of active attack. Relying on quantity, they rely entirely on thorough bombing and firepower. After seizing a corner, they immediately build an airfield and continuously transport aircraft to cut off the supply line. In the battles in that area, our officers and soldiers will never lose to them, it is just that the supply gradually becomes inadequate, so although they have not been defeated, they still have to move their positions unwillingly, which is indeed regrettable! This is what we have experienced since Guadalcanal. On the battle lines in that area, soldiers are bombarded by enemy forces every day. As a result, according to officers recently returning home, the front-line soldiers are very worried about their own aircraft, and issue the cry "What on earth is happening to Japanese aircraft?" In short, as long as there are aircraft, they can be forced back. Aircraft, aircraft, we need aircraft!

The Production Volume of American Aircraft

Colonel Kurihara: Next, please have Colonel Matsumura talk about the production status of American aircraft.

Colonel Matsumura: After suffering a terrible defeat in the initial battles, the United States converted most of its automobile factories into aircraft subcontracting factories, and added aircraft factories, frantically manufacturing aircraft and warships, using stockpiled raw materials and industrial power, desperately striving, and then shouting for counteroffensives and counteroffensives. This year, Roosevelt declared in his memorandum that the production volume of aircraft would be 125,000, but in reality it is around 90,000, about 80,000 to 90,000.

Colonel Kurihara: 90,000 is roughly correct, right?

Colonel Matsumura: A few days ago, according to Asahi Shimbun's Hosokawa-kun, who recently returned from Buenos Aires, the enemy did not establish a material mobilization plan, and was doing things at random, so abnormal conditions occurred in terms of materials, and the situation regarding labor problems was particularly bad, so that the angle of increase in production has gradually decreased since this summer. Before this, although it was rapidly increasing, the summer and autumn of this year have been quite stagnant. (Yoshida: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, December 4)

The Aerial Decisive Battle on the Continent

After the Quebec Conference, the enemy intensified their counteroffensive, attacking both north and south in the Pacific, and increasing their troops on the Indian border. They are making every effort to use their air force to bomb the Japanese mainland. It is estimated that the strength of the US Air Force stationed in China, including those on the coast, is approximately 500 aircraft.

Under the command of the commander of the 14th Air Force stationed in Chongqing, the central base has been moved from Kunming to Jianchuan, using airfields in Guizhou as relay bases, and strengthening other airfields, so that they become forward bases for attacking the Japanese mainland.

This diagram, with Tokyo, Japan as the center, shows the range of action of aircraft. Aircraft with a cruising range of 6,000 kilometers or more are required to reach Tokyo without refueling. According to the current situation, the strength of the US Air Force stationed in China is insufficient for this.

### The Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: Celebration Ceremony Held, Over Two Thousand Representatives from Various Countries Attended

Central News Agency Dispatch: Yesterday marked the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. To commemorate this historically significant day, the Greater East Asia War Second Anniversary Commemoration Executive Committee held a celebration ceremony for representatives from various countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere at the Paramount Theater on Jing'an Temple Road in this city yesterday (the 8th) afternoon at 3:00 PM. Those in attendance included Mayor Chen Gongbo, Minister Tajiri from the allied nations, German Consul General Fischer, Consul General Ye Yao Gong from Manchukuo, and Army Minister Nagatsu. Also present were Rear Admiral Kondo from the Japanese Naval Attache Office, Hirota, head of the Information Section of the Japanese Embassy, as well as over two thousand representatives from various countries, including eight nations: China, Japan, Germany, Manchukuo, the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, and India. The event was unprecedentedly grand and enthusiastic. The assembly began promptly at 3:00 PM. Following speeches by Minister Tajiri of Japan, Mayor Chen, Consul General Fischer of Germany, Consul General Ye Yao Gong of Manchukuo, Army Minister Nagatsu, and Rear Admiral Kondo, the assembly ceremony concluded. Afterwards, newsreels such as "The Great Unity of the Greater East Asian Peoples" and the "Greater East Asia War Second Anniversary Cultural Film" were screened, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

Speech by Minister Tajiri

I am delighted to celebrate the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War and hold this grand commemorative ceremony. Representatives from the Republic of China, Manchukuo, Germany, and various countries of Greater East Asia are all present. I feel very honored. In the past two years, the Greater East Asia War has expelled the forces of British and American aggression from the lands of Greater East Asia, realizing the liberation of Greater East Asia, and Greater East Asia has entered a stage of construction. Japan and the Republic of China have concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, establishing a permanent friendly relationship. The single-minded and unified relationship between Japan and Manchukuo is also becoming increasingly profound. Furthermore, in the south, the alliance between Japan and Thailand is becoming stronger. Following the newly born nation of Burma, the Philippines has also been established, and the day when India completes its independence is not far off. The Greater East Asia Conference held previously in Tokyo has promoted the determination of the one billion people of Greater East Asia to cooperate in consolidating unity and to complete the construction of a new order in the Greater East Asia War. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration can be called the grand charter for building a new order in Greater East Asia. I am confident that the construction of a new Greater East Asia will take great strides forward due to this declaration. In this way, it can be expected that in the third year of the Greater East Asia War, the construction of Greater East Asia will develop even more rapidly, and defeating the British and Americans will surely be successful. If we look again at the European front, our ally Germany is displaying amazing combat power, defeating the anti-Axis front. At the same time, the construction of a new European order is progressing daily. We express our deep respect for the great achievements and unwavering fighting spirit of our allies. On this second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, we hope that the nations of Greater East Asia will consolidate their unity further, strengthen cooperation with our ally Germany, and resolve to complete the Greater East Asia War and achieve final victory.

Speech by Mayor Chen

Gentlemen: Today is the second anniversary commemoration of the Greater East Asia War, and it can also be said to be a victory celebration in advance for the Greater East Asia War. Although the war has not yet ended, for the whole of Greater East Asia, the forces of Britain and America have already been eliminated. Burma and the Philippines have already become independent. The people of Malaya and Java have obtained the right to participate in government. The Provisional Government of Free India has been established, and the three hundred million oppressed people of India have the dawn of liberation. As far as China is concerned, all concessions have been recovered. Extraterritorial rights in China have been abolished. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has been signed. The Boxer Protocol has been abolished. Unequal treaties have been abolished. Therefore, although the Greater East Asia War has not yet ended, the liberation of the nations of Greater East Asia is about to be completed. Although the war is not over, the essence of the war has already been won. That is why I call today's commemoration a victory celebration in advance for the Greater East Asia War.

Today, people from various countries of Greater East Asia and representatives from various allied nations are participating in this commemoration. Therefore, in addressing you, I will speak solely from the perspective of China and examine the general situation of China. We must strengthen our forces to participate in the war and determine our direction.

First, the Republic of China joined the Greater East Asia War on January 9th of this year. This significance is very great. Our participation in the war is not only for the sake of our own liberation but also for the sake of the liberation of all the nations of East Asia. Now, China's concessions have all been recovered, extraterritorial rights have also been abolished, and China's unequal treaties no longer exist. China's liberation has been realized. However, we Chinese should examine how much effort we have exerted in this participation in the war. We have not yet sent troops to the front lines for the Greater East Asia War, but we are preparing to do so. We do not want to participate in the war in name only; we want to participate with real strength. Therefore, I hope that our people will intensify their organization and training so that when something happens, they can take up arms and go to the battlefield at any time. In the rear, they can maintain order, establish security, and make all necessary preparations.

Second, we not only seek our own independence but also further seek the independence of all the nations of East Asia. Burma and the Philippines have already become independent, and we should support them. The Provisional Government of India has also been established, and we should support it even more vigorously. The previous visit to China by Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, was to seek China's sympathy and assistance. I acknowledge that if India is not independent, the national liberation of Greater East Asia is not yet complete. If India is still in the hands of Britain and America, the crisis for the nations of Greater East Asia still exists. I call on the citizens of the Republic of China to provide India with the greatest possible assistance. If there is anyone who advocates cooperation with Britain and America to destroy the freedom of India, we should stop them and eliminate them. Moreover, I call on the soldiers of the subjugated army who are scattered in India to immediately rise up and cooperate with Bose's army to fight against Britain and America to complete the national liberation of Greater East Asia.

Third, since we have participated in the war, we should strive to fulfill our responsibilities, especially to exert our own abilities. Strength comes from concentration. Therefore, we must further unify China. By unification, I mean, on the one hand, overall peace and, on the other hand, especially striving for political, military, and economic unification under the National Government. Demanding national unification is the responsibility of every citizen and the right of every citizen. Only by concentrating our strength can we contribute to the Greater East Asia War. Only by concentrating our strength can we revive China.

Fourth, increasing production is our unanimous demand. Increasing production is, on the one hand, to supply military needs to the soldiers at the front and, on the other hand, to supply necessities to the people in the rear. We also know that during wartime, raw materials will be scarce, and power will also be reduced. However, we will never stop production because of the lack of raw materials. On the contrary, we should seek raw materials because of the lack of raw materials. We will also never reduce production because of the reduction of power. On the contrary, we should work harder to increase power because of the reduction of power.

In short, we are determined to win the Greater East Asia War, and we are determined to complete the national liberation of Greater East Asia. We have such determination and also possess unparalleled perseverance. We must prepare for a long-term war, and we must prepare for a long-term struggle. Today, at this commemoration, we celebrate in advance the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the success of the liberation of Greater East Asia.

Speech by the German Consul General

In his brief speech, the German Consul General emphasized the important significance of holding the commemoration, praising the close unity between Japan and Germany today, like cities facing each other, preparing with unwavering determination to resist the attack of a common enemy. The two countries are filled with the same ideals and are advancing shoulder to shoulder towards victory. Germany and Japan are fighting to protect the right to exist, so they will surely win, he said.

Speech by the Consul General of Manchukuo

Today, we joyfully celebrate the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. It is a great honor for me to be able to participate in and deliver a speech at this grand commemorative ceremony. It has been two years since the Japanese army began the great war. During this period, from the attack on Pearl Harbor to the subjugation of the Malay Peninsula and the capture of Singapore, to the recent attacks on Bougainville Island and the Gilbert Islands, fierce battles have been waged, causing the enemy, Britain and America, to suffer repeated defeats and punishments, and demonstrating the spirit of "Hakkō ichiu" (the eight corners of the world under one roof) at home and abroad. This is truly due to the Japanese army's exceptional spirit, lengthy silent and arduous training, and overcoming of various objective disadvantages, which has led to this valuable gift. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War has become a certainty of victory. At the same time, the foundation for the construction of our East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is as solid as a rock. It is a well-known fact that such amazing achievements of Japan will surely bear fruit. The two Axis countries of East Asia, Manchukuo and China, are of course included, as well as the emerging countries of Burma, the Philippines, and Free India, which constitute the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. I believe that they will be able to jointly maintain close cooperation to contribute to the stability of the overall situation in East Asia. And with the belief of certain victory and rock-solid unity, they will carry out rear tasks and move towards increased production.

Speech by Military Attaché Kondo

Today, the Greater East Asia War enters its third year. I feel extremely honored to be able to participate in today's grand ceremony with China, Japan, and representatives from various countries of Greater East Asia and Germany. The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was due to Britain and America using the beautiful name of peace to pursue their ambition to invade East Asia and imposing economic and military pressure on Japan. This runs counter to Japan's great national ideal, where all nations get their due place. Japan, in order to eliminate aggression and uphold justice, has led the one billion people of East Asia to rise up resolutely.

Upon initiating hostilities with Britain and America, the Japanese army fought bravely and skillfully. In less than half a year after the start of the war, it drove out and swept away the forces of British and American aggression in East Asia, which had lasted for a century. In the subsequent year and four months, it crushed and annihilated the enemies' so-called total counter-offensive everywhere, and crushed the enemy's combat power. At the same time as the battle, the construction of Greater East Asia is also progressing step by step. The bond between Japan and Manchukuo is becoming increasingly solid. The alliance between China, Japan, and Thailand has been renewed to complete joint operations and has formed a close relationship. In addition, the Philippines and Burma, which have been humiliated for years under the brutal rule, fraud, and exploitation of Britain and America, have also embarked on a new path of light. The Indian people have also resolved to rise up and carry out a war of liberation. Today, the one billion people of Greater East Asia have jointly made the decision to exert all their strength to defeat their old enemies, Britain and America, in order to make Greater East Asia an eternal paradise. Recalling November 5, the representatives of the six countries of Greater East Asia jointly issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. This declaration clarified this determination to the world and inflicted a major blow on Britain and America, who have no war aims whatsoever and are driven solely by ambition. Looking at the current situation, the enemies in the central and southern Pacific have repeatedly counterattacked. The result of the battle is only that valuable ships and precious lives have sunk to the bottom of the sea. In the Indian Ocean and on the Chinese mainland, the enemy has no room for manoeuvre due to the close cooperation between the Japanese army and navy.

Recently, the enemy's damage in the Bougainville Island and Gilbert Islands areas has been shocking. But why do these enemies continue to counterattack at all costs? This is because they fear the growing strength of Japan's combat power. The enemy knows very well that Japan has ample time to put them in an irreparable predicament. Therefore, it can be expected that the enemy's counterattacks, whether in the South Pacific or the Indian Ocean, will become more and more intense in the future. But we are deeply convinced that the results achieved in the half-year after the start of the war and the power of the combined strength of the entire East Asian nation will surely achieve final victory and complete the construction of Greater East Asia. As the holy war enters its third year, I pray that the East Asian nations will work together with one heart, fight bravely, and struggle hard.

### Yu Senting Donates Repaid Loan to Help Students; Master Kuzhai Donates 2,000 Yuan from Book Sales

This newspaper received a letter yesterday from Mr. Yu Senting stating: More than ten years ago, I borrowed 2,000 taels of silver from my close friend Mr. Wu Nanpu. Mr. Wu has been living in seclusion in the countryside for a long time, and I have been unable to ascertain his exact address through inquiries. Mr. Wu is known to be wealthy and has never demanded repayment of the loan, but I have felt uneasy about using the money for many years. Therefore, I have ordered my son, Jia Peng, to convert the amount into 3,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, add an additional 2,000 yuan, making a total of 5,000 yuan, and allocate it as a student aid fund to benefit Mr. Wu. In addition, Master Kuzhai supports student aid and benefits the poor students. He has donated large sums of money in the past and yesterday donated 2,000 yuan from the sales of the Baofu Method, which is deeply admirable. Here is a list of the student aid funds received in the past two days: Master Kuzhai (donation from sales of Baofu Method) 2,000 yuan, Wang Boyuan 1,000 yuan, One person 1,000 yuan, Li Xingji 400 yuan, Jianjin Vocational School's Workers' Voluntary Evening School Students (donation of souvenir fee for teachers' enthusiastic teaching) 270 yuan, Wu Zhonglian 100 yuan, Sun Liji 50 yuan, Pu Jiting 10 yuan, Yu Senting (repayment of loan used for student aid) 5,000 yuan, One banking trainee (donation of bonus income used for student aid) 500 yuan, Huaide Hall 100 yuan, Mrs. Pu Jiting 10 yuan, total received Central Reserve Bank notes 10,440 yuan, balance 1,148,543 yuan.

Economic Circle Commentary

### Reflections on the Year-End Closing Period

The year-end closing period for the silver and money industries is approaching in a blink of an eye. As a result, all industries limit all loans, such as current account overdrafts and credit loans, to be cleared before the year-end closing period, and new loans during the year-end closing period are temporarily suspended as usual. At the same time, although the Bank Joint Reserve Association and the Money Industry Joint Reserve Department can do their best to accommodate the interbank lending of banks and firms, it must be limited to the legitimate uses of each bank and firm. Therefore, we feel that the silver and money industry can be said to be faithfully implementing the self-inspection and self-insurance system during the year-end closing period, and refusing all speculative loans.

Due to the self-discipline and self-insurance policy of the silver and money industry during this period, we are reminded of how important the regular system of the wartime financial industry is in relation to the entire industry and people's livelihood. The reason why the trend of speculation, hoarding, monopoly, and manipulation has subsided slightly in the past one or two months is because the authorities have launched a comprehensive investigation and crackdown, and also because of the restrictions on informal and illegal lending by the silver and money industry. Therefore, when discussing prices again yesterday, we believed that restricting price disturbances from the monetary and financial aspects is still a price policy that draws firewood from under the cauldron. In a word, we feel that the investment direction of the financial industry is most likely to affect a country's production and living conditions. Therefore, those who talk about financial control during wartime pay attention to the management of bank loans, especially the regular management of bank loans. Only in this way can speculation be eliminated, and only in this way can production investment be discussed.

### Qualification of Directors and Supervisors of Various Associations to be Reviewed; Statutory Number May Not Be Arbitrarily Increased or Decreased

The various trade associations in this city have been reorganized as of the 19th, and the directors and supervisors responsible for association affairs have also been elected separately. The relevant authorities, in view of the fact that although the institutions of various associations have been established in order, they still cannot complete the tasks of the association and achieve the spirit of commercial autonomy without the promotion of good personnel. Although the directors and supervisors of various trade associations are elected publicly in accordance with the law, it is inevitable that there are still a few unqualified personnel mixed in. Therefore, the relevant authorities will review the qualifications of the directors and supervisors of various associations. Anyone who meets one of the following conditions may not be a director or supervisor: Those who are not in the industry, those who have been deprived of public rights, those who have violated national policies and have been punished for criminal offenses by the court, those who have been declared bankrupt and have not yet been restored to their rights, those who have been expelled from the association, those who lack the ability to act. In addition to reviewing the qualifications of directors and supervisors, the authorities also consider the number of people. The number of directors and supervisors of each association must meet the statutory number and may not be arbitrarily increased or decreased.

### Six Temporary Special Taxes to be Levied in Eastern Zhejiang

Central News Agency, Ningbo: The Taxation Bureau, affiliated with the Ministry of Finance, announced to the counties of eastern Zhejiang the other day that it would begin levying temporary special taxes on six categories of goods, including tung oil, tea, pork bristles, poultry feathers, sugar, and cosmetics, starting immediately. It also announced the tax rates and payment procedures for each item, ordering businesses in each industry to comply.

### Restrictions on Sales of Goods by Fellow Traders

In recent weeks, the authorities have appeared to be extremely calm on the surface regarding the management of prices, but in reality, they have never relaxed. They continue to implement their consistent policy of strictly enforcing price limits and investigating hoarding. The authorities believe that the high cost is the main reason for the high prices, but the successive sales and mutual profits have invisibly increased the buyer's costs. When selling, they will naturally raise prices. Therefore, in order to completely flatten prices, the sales of businessmen in various industries should also be strictly managed. This reporter learned from various trade associations yesterday that the authorities have formulated the following restrictions on sales by fellow traders: When a vendor sells goods to a firm, the firm must sell the goods to a shop engaged in such items, and then the shop will display the goods in the store for normal users to choose from. Absolutely no sales between firms or between shops are allowed. Once a sale is made, a transaction order must be issued for the authorities to check when necessary, and a receipt must be issued for sales in the store to prevent abuses.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds: Yesterday's prices remained weak. The number of participants at gatherings continued to dwindle, and professional traders had completely disappeared. Only a very few counterparties remained, inquiring about prices and engaging in limited trading. Yesterday, Class C bonds initially opened higher, but then declined. By midday, the final price was slightly lower than the previous day. Class A bonds saw the biggest drop. Class B and D bonds only had quoted prices, but no transactions occurred due to the large price differences. Class E bonds also declined significantly, with little prospect of recovery.

Interbank Loan Rate: Yesterday morning, the Money Trade Association's interbank loan rate remained unchanged at 1.8%.

Grains: The amount of grain arriving in Shanghai yesterday was relatively small due to transportation delays along the route. This led sellers to try to raise prices, and market conditions became firm. Glutinous rice prices increased several levels compared to the previous day. Ordinary rice also saw a rise in price. Trading in oilseeds was scarce, and prices also tended to be firm.

Artificial Silk: Trading remained slow yesterday, and the market showed a gradual downward trend. Prices fell slightly again, with 120 Denier Tianqiao at 6.575, trending downward.

Northern Goods: The supply of goods from the north has been quite active recently. However, actual sales are fragmented and lack volume. Trading remains lackluster, and prices show a weak attempt to rally.

### Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War

— Captain Shioda

The lesson the enemy has learned from this initial stage of the war is that air power has become almost the deciding factor in modern naval warfare. It also seems to have gained significant lessons in the modification of submarines.

Thus, the initial stage of the war has led the British and Americans to make significant changes to their naval forces and their composition. After the pre-war naval forces were defeated, new fleets suitable for the new strategies were deployed.

This new deployment, or rather counter-offensive, can be seen in the various naval battles currently unfolding in various theaters. So, what is the current state of naval warfare after the initial stage? The maximum increase in air force strength, air force fire and air strike operations, and the adoption of submarine tactics to disrupt Japan's production and transportation lines. In other words, actively and passively, they are engaging in counter-offensive operations from the air and from the water. After years of research, the United States has finally used aircraft carriers instead of battleships in its so-called trans-oceanic wheel formation against Japan, as seen in the recent naval and air battles of Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands. They are launching counter-offensives with two to three aircraft carriers at the core, escorted by battleships and cruisers.

Before the beginning of this year, enemy aircraft attacked in formations averaging 80 planes. By September, the average attack in the Pacific region was by large formations of about 300 planes. Since then, they have constantly launched air strikes with combined fighter-bomber formations of 150 or more planes.

These large formations first bomb Japanese positions, and then amphibious tanks lead various vessels in landing operations.

As for the enemy's submarine activities, the enemy has made maximum efforts to improve submarines and train personnel. At the same time, they are providing submarine crews with the best possible treatment. Therefore, submarine activity is more aggressive than when the war broke out. There is no shortage of brave men among their crews, so we must be even more vigilant against their movements.

In short, the nature of modern naval warfare is greatly influenced by aircraft and submarines. At the same time, no one can deny that the countless islands in the South Seas also have a major impact on modern naval warfare.

From the above-mentioned characteristics of naval warfare, it can be seen that future naval battles in the Pacific will be battles of great attrition, great replenishment, and great production.

Next, I will analyze the limits of American military production capacity and explain why production is such a crucial factor in battle.

The greatest feature of all the battles currently unfolding in the Gilbert Islands and the Solomon Islands is base-to-base offensive and defensive warfare, or, in Roosevelt's words, "island hopping." These islands are 2,600 to 2,700 miles from Tokyo, 4,300 miles from San Francisco in the United States, and 1,500 to 2,000 miles from Hawaii. Both Japan and the United States must rely on rear-area replenishment. Therefore, the rear area must have an extremely large replenishment source and a strong transportation capacity. Replenishment capacity and transportation capacity are the keys to victory. Therefore, victory on the front lines depends on the victory of the people in the rear, and the results of the front lines are the results of the rear.

First, regarding replenishment capacity, American production capacity peaked in May and June of this year, and subsequent production capacity has not increased. This is completely consistent with our pre-war research: that the United States would reach its peak production capacity by 1943. The military supplies seized before the war from the South and other regions were largely used up by the end of 1943. Second, due to labor and other factors, it can be determined that production replenishment capacity will not increase from the end of this year. But in fact, this phenomenon was already apparent half a year earlier, from June of this year. No matter how hard War Production Board Chairman Donald Nelson tries, no matter how much Knox brags, the shortage of production materials and the shortage of labor are all difficult problems. Tungsten is a necessary raw material for alloy production. It is a unique product of South China and Burma, accounting for 70% of the world's reserves. American tungsten production is less than one-third of peacetime needs. The United States relies only on imports from South America, which account for less than 10% of the world's reserves. It is not without reason that the United States is imitating what Japan did before the war and is trying to manufacture wooden airplanes. Regarding steel, iron, copper, and aluminum, the so-called three important controlled materials of the United States, wartime production of 8.8 million tons this year has decreased to 3 million tons. Chairman Nelson said, "The steel production capacity of the United States has reached its peak, and it is very difficult to increase it further." Knox also said, "The production of everything from warships to aircraft is quite difficult due to the shortage of materials centered on steel."

Furthermore, rubber, which is indispensable for carrying out the war, is 90% produced in the Malay region. Therefore, the United States has banned civilian use of rubber due to its inability to obtain it and is engaged in the manufacture of synthetic rubber. Rubber Control Officer William Jeffers has taken decisive measures in the domestic control of rubber, prohibiting any increase in consumption. The United States had a rubber reserve of 700,000 tons before the war. Most of it was used last year, and it is doubtful whether even one ton will remain by the end of this year. Moreover, Japan has turned natural rubber into highly volatile aircraft fuel, and the current anxiety of the United States is not difficult to imagine.

As for petroleum, the United States consumes 40,000,000 barrels more than it produces domestically. The United States has no tin production, while the South produces 90% of the world's supply. Furthermore, quinine, which is indispensable in tropical warfare, is 98% produced in the Solomon Islands.

As mentioned above, the United States, with its shortage of production materials, will not have a higher production output for aircraft and ships next year than this year. It can be seen that the United States' production replenishment capacity peaked this year. U.S. Navy Board of Materials Input Minister Volsh said, "Of the 11.4 million tons of merchant shipping the U.S. possessed before the war, One year after the start of the war, most of it was lost." Furthermore, the shipbuilding volume, which had been increasing from last year until May of this year, has gradually decreased after June. The same goal is to reach 20 million tons. This is not to say that the United States does not need a shipbuilding target of more than 20 million tons, but rather that the United States has reached its maximum possible shipbuilding capacity (continued on the fourth page).

## Page 4

### The Greater East Asia War

(Continued from page 3)

Currently, it takes 20 tons of shipping capacity to transport one soldier. Therefore, it requires 5 million tons of shipping space to transport 500,000 troops, and another two tons of shipping space are needed for replenishment for each soldier. Based on these calculations, it initially requires 5 million tons to dispatch 500,000 troops to the front lines, and then constantly requires 1 million tons of shipping space. If the time required for ship maintenance and the losses from sinkings are added, one-third of the fleet is unusable. Given these considerations, the enemy's deployable forces are also limited. In terms of population, that is, military manpower, the total population of the United States is 130 million. If women, children, blacks, and laborers are removed, the maximum number that can be mobilized is only 3 million.

This is taking the enemy's example to explain Japan's future production capacity and replenishment capacity. In short, America's combat strength reached its peak this year. Conversely, Japan can start a real war from next year. In this respect, although the combat readiness is one and a half years behind the enemy, the Japanese Navy, which annihilated all of the enemy's pre-war battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers, is still unharmed. The enemy's ships currently in the Pacific are almost entirely newly built. But the Japanese Navy is still standing in wait, prepared for a decisive battle. The damage inflicted on the enemy at Bougainville is estimated at 23 battleships, 30 aircraft carriers, and 98 cruisers. In addition, if we add the other various ships destroyed, the enemy has bled a lot. And the loss of personnel is a fatal blow. A military commentator, Hanson Baldwin, published an article in the New York Times on October 22nd saying: "The US has built 19 million tons of ships", of which about 3 million tons are condemned ships, and he also stated: "The US has 21 battleships, 12 to 15 aircraft carriers, and a number of auxiliary and escort aircraft carriers and aircraft transport ships." Even if it is true, it is not surprising compared to the current state of American production capacity and the recent marked increase in the Japanese naval air force.

### The Strong Japanese Navy

Approximately seven months after Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto died in battle against the enemy on a plane in the South Seas, the officers and men of the Japanese Navy are now led by Admiral Koga, the incomparably brave successor to the late Admiral. On this anniversary of the start of the war, we would like to express our complete trust and respect to the Admiral and the officers and men of the Navy. For the past two years, they have consistently achieved great victories against an enemy that is dozens of times stronger. Yet they remain unshaken. They do not boast of their achievements, but silently march towards battle. We must prepare the naval officers and men for battle deployment and a decisive engagement as soon as possible.

After seventy years of intensive training, we have finally reached this day. The Japanese Navy, after three years of war, has high expectations for its future brave struggles. The Japanese Navy's unshakable belief in victory, cultivated in training, and the excellence of its weapons, strategic research, and constant superiority over the enemy, starting from the Pearl Harbor attack, the air battles that will continue to be fought from now on are due to the system adopted by the Japanese Navy for the world's throne, namely the Type A, Type B, and Type C pre-training systems. This plays a very important role in the results of today's battles. In addition, with these young air force soldiers currently being trained nationwide, the magnificent state of the Japanese Navy in the third year of the war is firmly unshakable. Seeing the vigorous spirit of the young people who are constantly carrying on the legacy of their predecessors, no matter how the enemy comes to counterattack, it will only be in vain to shed a lot of blood.

### Women's Christian Association to Hold Family Flea Market

As winter approaches and the cost of living rises, many poor families are willing to sell surplus clothes, toys, stationery, ornaments, cosmetics, kitchen utensils, daily necessities, glassware, and porcelain to supplement their household income. At the same time, other families are willing to purchase useful items at lower prices to reduce household expenses. To meet this need, the Adult Education Department of the Women's Christian Association will hold a flea market from the 10th to the 13th of this month, from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily, at its headquarters at 638 Weihaiwei Road.

### Correction

In yesterday's fourth page mini-article "The Dawn of Complete Peace" written by Mr. Hu Shuo-mei, from the fourth paragraph onwards, it mistakenly spliced in the works of Mr. Zhang Bao-nan, causing inconsistencies. The original articles by both Mr. Hu and Mr. Zhang will be published in the Shanghai News Monthly. We ask readers to take note.

### The Navy

— Written by Toyo Iwata, Translated by Hong Yang

A week had passed. On the seventh evening, the new mother, Wako, had recovered her strength as usual and was already working around the house. It would be easy to assume that a forty-four-year-old woman who had given birth to eleven children would be quite strong, but in reality, she was pitifully thin. Her complexion was pale, her skin delicate, and she had a full head of black hair, as is common among rural women. If you were to call her a beauty! High cheekbones, thick lips, and a dull, impolite expression. However, her eyes drooped at the corners, and her voice was soft, yet charmingly cute. She was originally the wife of a general store owner. Besides rice, she also sold tobacco, sundries, and shochu, so her behavior was also humble. There was no sign of strength about her anywhere. Moreover, she was a daughter of the common people, who did not know what was called "reason" and could not speak of "rights," an ordinary, traditional woman of the Satsuma region. She was a woman who was not worthy of pursuing any meaning in life other than labor, faith, and raising children.

"Haruko... it's almost noon."

She was already ordering her eldest daughter from the maternity bed.

"Okay!"

Haruko, as silent as her father, was in the kitchen in front of the maternity room, cooking sweet potatoes with soy sauce. Haruko was only seventeen years old, and during her mother's confinement, she had taken over all the cooking. Her eldest son, Shinzo, who was fifteen years old, was weak and unable to help in any way. Mitsuko, who was fourteen, and Shinichiro, who was thirteen, were able to sweep the house and deliver goods to the store, and were of some use. The most troublesome was Taro, who was two years old. In a family with many children, the housework was surprisingly well-organized. No matter which time she gave birth, there was no labor pain, and it passed smoothly.

"Haruko... Did you send the roasted rice cakes to the Kajiki family?"

"I sent a liter..."

The mother gave her instructions once, and then gazed peacefully at the dark and shiny ceiling boards. Although it was a house in the town, half of it was built like a farmhouse. The kitchen was quite large, including the maternity room, there were three rooms in total—although there was a small room upstairs for storing sundries, it could be used by the children for studying. In the evenings, every room would be filled with this family of thirteen. But now, it was quiet, and only the call of an owl could be heard from the beach at Yoji.

Suddenly, Makoto, who was sleeping next door, began to cry loudly. The mother, who was used to giving birth, knew with one listen that the child was hungry.

The woman opened her chest and put her nipple in the child's mouth. Her full breasts seemed out of keeping with her age. But even more astonishing were the fingers and palms holding those breasts. Her fingers and palms were as rough and large as old baseball gloves. Those were the hands of a woman who had been constantly working on all the housework for twenty years, from the time she married at the age of twenty-four until today.
