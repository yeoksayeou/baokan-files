### The Grave Problem of Cultural Paper

Paper is a tool for preserving culture and communicating knowledge, occupying an extremely important position in the cause of human civilization. Our country is also the inventor of paper and the most common paper-producing nation. Unfortunately, for thousands of years, we have stagnated in the traditional methods of handicraft production, with limited output and inconsistent quality. Only in the last three or four decades have we had modern paper industries, but they are still in their infancy, and most of the paper used for printing comes from foreign countries. According to statistics from 1937, the import value of paper amounted to 65,300,020 yuan. After the Greater East Asia War, foreign paper disappeared, and paper prices soared daily. As a result, the price increases of cultural paper, including newsprint, official letter paper, mimeograph stencils, and carbon paper, have been truly alarming. This has had a significant impact on the stagnation of cultural undertakings. Take Shanghai as an example. It is the cultural center of the country and occupies an important position in calling for cultural revival during this extraordinary period. However, the general publishing industry is still in a state of stagnation, and the high cost of paper is one of the biggest reasons. If this factor is not resolved soon, not only will major bookstores find it difficult to resume publishing books, but also current newspapers and magazines may face a crisis of being unable to continue publishing in the near future. Considering the future of culture, one cannot help but shudder. Further research into the soaring price of newsprint in Shanghai reveals that it is most unreasonable. Except for a small portion produced locally, most of it is foreign goods stockpiled before December 8th of the year before last. Although the price should increase due to changes in currency value and market conditions, it should certainly not increase by more than twenty times compared to the end of the year before last. It is against social consensus and national laws to allow a few people to profit excessively and trap the publishing industry in a state of stagnation.

In order to maintain and develop cultural publishing, we urgently hope that the government authorities and the cultural community will work together to solve the following points: First, is the massive increase in the production of cultural paper. The existing machine-made paper factories in Shanghai should increase production, while also increasing the production of handmade paper and improving its quality. At present, the government should first provide loans to paper manufacturers, encourage production, and enlist the technical talents of friendly nations to jointly improve China's papermaking industry. Second, as a temporary solution, all paper merchants who purchased foreign newsprint before December 8th of the year before last should immediately re-register and implement price limits. For local paper mills, their costs should be estimated and price limits implemented. At the same time, hoarding and speculation by non-paper merchants should be strictly prohibited. Third, is to immediately implement controlled consumption and reasonable allocation. On the one hand, consumption of paper for superstitious purposes should be restricted, and on the other hand, unnecessary commercial flyers and entertainment advertisements should be reasonably restricted. In addition, official documents, letters, and store paper should all be used sparingly. Then, a reasonable allocation should be implemented for newspapers, magazines, and book publishing, providing full guarantees for obtaining paper. Only then can the cultural publishing industry have the hope of reasonable development. It is hoped that the government authorities and the cultural community will work together to maintain the progress of China's cultural publishing industry.

Translation and Discussion

### Charter of the New European Order

According to a Berlin dispatch, the heads of the Axis powers are discussing the finalized plan for a new European order. A formal statement on this issue will be released soon. As can be seen from the official gazette published on March 1st, this issue was one of the important topics discussed for five days by the German and Italian leaders in Rome starting on February 24th. The publication of the concrete plan for the Axis powers' new European order will make the flags of Germany and Italy even clearer, leaving no room for enemy propaganda. The European countries will be more settled in their positions, praying for the victory of the Axis powers. This cannot be said to be a timely strategy in promoting the common cooperation of European countries.

The official gazette published after the aforementioned Rome talks stated that the people of all nations within the European cooperative system can enjoy the guarantee of social justice by engaging in productive labor within their protected national territories. Furthermore, on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Propaganda Ministry on the 13th of this month, Dr. Goebbels, in response to questions from foreign journalists, stated: In the new European order under the Axis powers, all countries can maintain their respective independence, and cooperate in political, economic, diplomatic, and cultural sectors. The idea that Germany is using force to unify Europe and forcing all countries to adopt German National Socialism is clearly inaccurate. Goebbels also said: "During the war, the German people themselves are subject to restrictions on freedom and work under very strict regulations to achieve wartime goals. Similarly, for the people of the countries occupied by the German army and other European countries, it is necessary to take various compulsory measures to carry out the war." In short, the intention of the German and Italian governments is to exclude communism, Jewish influence, and the restrictions of the principle of command, and to respect the independence and autonomy of all countries as much as possible.

Of course, in the past, there were many rumors about the concept of a new European order centered on Germany and Italy, and the actual relationship between Germany, Italy, and European countries has often been misunderstood in the past, which is regrettable. Even regarding the ideal of the new order itself, respecting the will of the people of each country is necessary in principle. Furthermore, from the point of view of timing, it cannot be said that the German and Italian governments are taking wise measures at this time to grasp the public opinion of various countries and dispel their original misunderstandings, so that the people of all countries can understand the true intentions of Germany and Italy. The British government has always emphasized egoism and adopted a policy of supporting small and medium-sized countries, thus signing a mutual assistance treaty with Poland in August 1939. However, to this day, in order to ingratiate itself with the Soviet Union, it has abandoned the countries of Eastern Europe, allowing the Soviet government to handle them freely. Britain today has no qualification to guarantee the countries of the European continent, and in the future, it will have even less room to intervene. For their own purposes, Britain and the United States unhesitatingly sacrifice the security of the European continent and the welfare of the people of all countries. On the contrary, Germany and Italy, the core of the new European order, externally, are strengthening their capacity to protect the European continent, and internally, are solidifying their spiritual unity. Germany and Italy have put a lot of effort into building a new European order, and the development of its future is something to be watched with anticipation.

### Prime Minister Tojo Attends Parliament Reports on Domestic and International Situation Remarkable Progress in Sino-Japanese Cooperation and Expresses Willingness to Assist Burma's Independence

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) The 81st Japanese Parliament held its last plenary session in both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives today, and the closing ceremony is scheduled for tomorrow. Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech at the plenary session of both houses today. The main points are as follows: Today, I would like to report to you on the recent situation. When I held talks with Burmese officials, including Chief Minister Ba Maw, on the 23rd of this month, I expressed the Empire's intentions regarding the independence of the new Burma and exchanged opinions frankly with each other. I will now report to you the main points of the imperial intentions that I expressed at that time. First, regarding Burma's independence, what the Empire expects is that the new Burmese state can possess the substance of a completely independent country with its own creativity and responsibility, and at the same time, as a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, closely cooperate with the Empire to contribute to the construction of a new world order. The Empire sincerely hopes that Burma can quickly prepare and adapt to complete the war situation. In terms of the organization of the new Burma, its territory includes all of Burma, except for the Shan States and Karenni. As for the decisions of its people, it is hoped that they can be based on the principles of mutual harmony and unity among the various ethnic groups within the territory. As for the political structure, it should be decided by Burma itself. The operation of state affairs should be strong and simple. Regarding the economy, it is hoped that it can be an integral part of the construction of Greater East Asia, and carry out fair and vigorous activities under the sovereignty of the new Burmese state to promote the revitalization of the Burmese economy. Chief Minister Ba Maw and his delegation were deeply grateful for the special treatment given to our imperial family and understood the true intentions of the imperial government. At that time, they expressed their determination to do everything possible to build the new Burmese state. Recently, I also visited the Republic of China in response to President Wang’s and Premier of the Executive Yuan visit to Japan last year. I would like to express my respect for the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States. I also had frank talks with the National Government authorities on completing the joint war strategy. The leaders and people below the National Government also understood the true intentions of the Empire and deeply appreciated the concrete measures of the Empire's sincerity. Therefore, it can be confirmed that our friendly nation, the Republic of China, is actively working to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. I am very pleased to be able to report this to you. The people of the Republic of China are also gradually understanding the true intentions of the Empire. All aspects are deeply inspired by the measures taken by the Empire this time, and they all have great hope for the future of China. A kind of atmosphere has been created, and they are all willing to engage in the construction of the Republic of China and fully cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War. On the one hand, this proves the strengthening of the political power of the National Government. On the other hand, it proves that the so-called resistance in Chongqing has lost its basis. This is deeply noteworthy. Furthermore, Chongqing was deeply shocked by the enlightened measures taken by the Empire this time. Currently, people in Chongqing are also deeply concerned about the Empire's true intentions and future concrete practices. Recently, the generals in Chongqing on the front lines have also become more and more eager for peace. Therefore, the number of people who surrender has greatly increased compared to before. Britain and the United States are also deeply uneasy about the Empire's new policy towards China, and their embarrassment is difficult to conceal. Today, they have no way to alienate the relationship between the Empire and the new China. Our justice is invincible. Today, Chinese people have agreed with the true intentions of the Empire and are willing to be true comrades who share the same joys and sorrows and live and die together. The closeness of the relationship between the two countries is increasing day by day, which makes us infinitely excited. The Empire's attitude towards the Republic of China and Burma, needless to say, is based on the spirit of Hakkō ichiu and implements the Empire's unshakable national policy. In the midst of this great war, it has been gradually realized, which is truly gratifying. In terms of Europe, the morale of Germany and Italy is becoming more and more prosperous. They are not only repelling enemy forces everywhere, but also concentrating national strength to prepare for a large-scale offensive in the coming days. The leaders of Britain and the United States are only traveling back and forth to hold talks and discuss ways to reverse the defeat. However, because Britain consistently disregards the sacrifices of the United States and other countries, and wants to satisfy its ambition to dominate the world in order to maintain the prosperity and authority of the old Britain, they are therefore in conflict and difficult to resolve. Although they use beautiful words and phrases to talk about their post-war management to cover up the current defeats, they have actually exposed their internal mutual suspicion and the disunity of their anti-war camp. If we compare this kind of ugliness with the close cooperation and mutual assistance of the allied nations of Greater East Asia and the Axis powers such as Germany and Italy to defeat the common enemy of Britain and the United States, we will know that there is a significant difference between us. Therefore, it also increasingly strengthens our belief that we will win. In the past, the government has continuously worked hard to expand the important productive forces that are the urgent task of wartime in order to enhance military power. Recently, this parliament has passed the Wartime Administrative Special Cases Act and other bills. However, in order to fully adopt the various high-level views of this parliament in order to achieve comprehensive application, we will make every effort to enhance wartime production and have formulated the temporary system of cabinet advisors, the administrative inspection system, and the establishment of the Wartime Economic Consultative Council. The development of the domestic and foreign situation described above has gradually become more favorable to us. However, the progress of the world war is not yet optimistic. All 100 million of our people should renew their determination, endure the difficulties under the increasingly heavy war in the future, and redouble their efforts to win the final victory.

### President Wang Speaks to Japanese Reporters in Guangzhou

Guangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency) President Wang of the National Government met with a group of Japanese reporters at his official residence here at 9:00 a.m. on the 25th and spoke on the significance of the National Government's participation in the war and the purpose of his decision to come to Guangzhou. The gist of the speech was as follows: The reason and significance of the National Government's participation in the war are very clear. We have followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings as the foundation of our policy and have always thought about when we can live and die together with our friendly nation, Japan. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government immediately issued a statement, resolving to share the joys and sorrows with Japan. Now, we have taken a further step and resolutely decided to live and die together with Japan. We have carefully considered how we can cooperate with Japan in order to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. As a result, we decided to participate in the war. However, it is not because we know that Japan is in an absolutely invincible position that we are participating in the war. It is because if we only engage in peace movements when we must cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War, our direction is actually not clear. In order to break the deep-seated dependence on Britain and the United States among the people and build East Asia for East Asians, we have no choice but to participate in the war. The direction that the Chinese people should take has been completely determined by the National Government's participation in the war, and has become more focused and clearer. After our participation in the war, we should reduce the burden on our friendly nations and contribute to the war, and we must increase production and make full use of resources. Furthermore, since the National Government's participation in the war, Japan has returned concessions, withdrawn extraterritorial rights, and provided assistance in various aspects, which has deeply impressed our country. We are determined to redouble our efforts and continue to work hard so as not to fail the cooperation of our friendly nations. Guangzhou is close to Hong Kong, and most of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are from Guangzhou. Therefore, the people of Guangzhou know the most detailed details of the aggression by Britain and the United States, and they are also the most deeply infected by British and American ideas. In the past, the United States ran Ginling College in Nanjing, Yenching University and Tsinghua University in Beiping, Lingnan University in Guangzhou, Nankai University in Tianjin, and St. John's University in Shanghai. The purpose of these universities was to numb the Chinese intellectual class and alienate the feelings between China and Japan. Jiang Jieshi's continued delusion and continued resistance to Japan have been supported by many intellectuals who have been educated by Britain and the United States. Today, Chongqing has completely become the fifth column of Britain and the United States. Although Jiang Jieshi knows that Dr. Sun Yat-sen wanted to remove the forces of Britain and the United States and their ideas from East Asia, he is still being used by Britain and the United States, so he is actually a traitor to China. Therefore, in order to thoroughly eradicate the idea of ​​dependence on Britain and the United States, we must quickly launch a fierce ideological war.

Every day, countless refugees are fleeing west along the railway and highway to Shaanxi to find food. I have seen refugees fleeing from war zones and bombing zones, but I have never seen such a miserable sight of millions of hungry people. There are very few young women or children among these refugees, because most of them have been sold. A young woman can be sold for 100 yuan. Food must be shipped immediately to provide relief, otherwise, an unprecedented tragedy will occur in the province."

Full Text of the Regulations

Nanjing, 25th – Central News Agency: Today, at the 9th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council, Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry proposed that, in order to adjust and strengthen wartime economic organizations, the old Industrial and Commercial Association Law is no longer suitable for the current environment.

### Three Days of Fierce Fighting on the Mareth Line: Axis Forces Maintain Original Position; Rommel's Mobile Defense Tactics Effective

Berlin, 25th – Allied News Agency: The German authorities announced on the 24th that the Axis forces in North Africa had completely repelled the British forces attacking the Mareth Line and are now firmly defending the same battle line as before the start of the offensive.

Berlin, 25th – Haitong News Agency: The great battle in southern and central Tunisia has not yet reached its most intense stage. The enemy's attempt to break through the Axis forces' position has not yet succeeded. The U.S. forces in central Tunisia have been reinforced by British forces. The German-Italian Allied forces on the Mareth Line have recaptured many strongholds. The enemy's troop strength and war equipment are very sufficient. The losses from three days of fierce fighting are difficult to make up. After the Battle of El Alamein, Montgomery often used elite troops as reserves and only deployed them to assist in the most intense stages of the battle. The British forces seem to be encircling the southwest and west of the Matmata Mountains, disrupting the western part of the Mareth Line. However, General Rommel's mobile defense tactics have once again proved effective. However, the enemy's offensive has not abated, and the fierce battle will continue.

Bern, Switzerland, 24th – Havas News Agency: Fierce fighting on the Tunisian front continued today. The Allied forces acknowledge that the German forces are strongly defending the Mareth Line and state that Rommel's forces have attempted to drive out the British forces, but the British forces are still able to defend their position. In addition, the British forces, maneuvering to attack the rear of the Mareth Line, have occupied the Dabalgar Mountains, eight miles from El Hamma. The British forces intend to flank the German forces from there, but have been blocked by Rommel's forces. According to U.S. sources, the U.S. forces are also making slight progress in fighting along the railway line from Metlaoui to the port of Sfax. It is rumored that they have occupied the highlands five miles east of Maknassi. However, U.S. intelligence director Davis made a statement in Washington, stating that the nation should not be too optimistic about the actions of U.S. forces in North Africa. According to a Berlin announcement, the offensive of the British Eighth Army has been repelled by Rommel's forces, and there are no changes in the positions of either side. Regarding the northern front, according to British and U.S. sources, the Axis forces only have scouting and artillery activity. There is no mention of how the British First Army is acting.

### Eastern Front Thaws and Roads are Muddy: Major Battles Come to a Halt

Berlin, 25th – Haitong News Agency: The battlefields of the Eastern Front are covered in mud, causing inconvenience to both the enemy and ourselves, making large-scale battles impossible. Only the enemy forces south of Leningrad and Lake Ladoga are more active, attempting to counterattack, mobilizing large artillery and air forces for combat, but have not yet succeeded. There are only local battles in other sections. Enemy attacks on German positions have been repelled. The German forces are conducting successful mopping-up operations in the area between Izyum and Belgorod. The German advance west of Kursk has been halted due to muddy roads. The Soviet forces in the Kupiansk bridgehead have concentrated six battalions of troops to attempt an offensive, but have been contained by the German forces.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 25th – Havas News Agency: According to the latest Soviet war report, the Red Army in the southern region has made slight progress in the Kupiansk area, occupying several villages and densely populated areas, including the Kireevo and Kiivka stations. On the Donets front, German forces crossed the northern section of the Donets River at Peski-Radkovskie and established a bridgehead on the east bank. Moscow acknowledges that German troops have occupied a densely populated area on the left bank, but after a Red Army counterattack, the German forces retreated to the right bank. In the Kursk area, German forces continue to advance on the enemy in order to flatten the Red Army salient west of Kursk. North of there, the Red Army acknowledges that German forces have launched repeated fierce counterattacks at Sukharevka (40 miles northeast of the German's strong hedgehog position in Smolensk), but have been stopped by the Red Army. General Konev's forces, along the Vyazma-Smolensk railway line, are attacking Smolensk, but have not made much progress. However, one army advancing south along the railway branch line claims to have occupied the city of Rukhnovo. On the northern front, General Timoshenko's forces continue to attack, especially in the area around Lake Ladoga, but Berlin sources say that this offensive has been successfully repelled by German forces. Various observers on the Soviet border believe that the focus of the Eastern Front may soon shift to the southern region, as the roads there are easier to dry than elsewhere. The Red Army's progress in the Kupiansk area is limited. German forces are holding positions west of Kupiansk and have brought in a large number of cannons, mortars, and machine guns to defend their positions with "arced fire."

### Turkey Watching European Developments: Neutral Countries Skeptical of Anglo-Soviet Understanding

Berlin, 25th – Haitong News Agency: Neutral public opinion remains reserved about the Anglo-American-Soviet dispute over the future fate of small countries. Only Turkish newspapers have begun to comment on the British proposal, concluding that Turkey is closely monitoring the developments of this matter. Turkey's current position seems to be dealing with threats from three sides. From Berlin's perspective, the attitude of various neutral countries seems to be skeptical of the Anglo-Soviet understanding to guarantee Europe. Regarding Germany's total mobilization, various neutral countries believe that it will surely unleash a tremendous force.

### German Side Announces Submarine Warfare Results

Berlin, 25th – Haitong News Agency: The German High Command announced yesterday that 15 enemy merchant ships, totaling 73,000 tons, had been sunk. In total, German submarines have sunk 121 enemy ships this month, totaling 748,000 tons. The 15 ships recently sunk were from a convoy traveling from the United States to Gibraltar. German submarines pursued them along the way, achieving this success.

### Japanese-Vietnamese Cooperation Intensifies, Chongqing's Activities Completely Fail

(Saigon, Special Correspondent Matsunaga, 15th Dispatch) "A French Indochinese colonial army will, in the not-too-distant future, fight against the Chongqing army." This is not the raving of a journalist in Vietnam. The Vichy government's statement on the 23rd of last month, declaring the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions, signifies a refusal to recognize the Chiang Kai-shek regime. The Chongqing side's acting ambassador to Vichy has already withdrawn to Lisbon, and it is rumored that French diplomats stationed in Chongqing are under house arrest. The diplomatic relationship between France and Chongqing is essentially severed. Several hundred French expatriates still reside in Chongqing, Kunming, and the Chinese interior. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which supports Chiang Kai-shek, is a joint Sino-French venture, starting from Haiphong, passing through Hanoi and Lao Cai, and reaching Kunming. The day these arrangements are finalized will also be the day Chongqing and Vichy mutually declare the end of diplomatic relations. France, which was utterly defeated in the prelude to the Second European War, is now acting with extreme complexity and subtlety. The suffering of a defeated nation is profound. French Indochina, thousands of miles from the motherland, is drawn into the vortex of the Greater East Asia War, isolated in a corner of Greater East Asia. Its future is certainly not a smooth road.

Since June of last year, the reporter has been stationed in Vietnam, observing the turbulence in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects. The expression of Vietnam, with lingering shadows, adapts to the shifting international situation, keenly changing its attitude. Governor-General Decoux and the leadership of the colony have a very correct understanding of the situation during this period, and thus their actions have not been mistaken. The illegal actions of British and American forces invading French North Africa in November of last year determined the path France should take. This break with the Chongqing regime further unfolds a new situation worth watching. Since French Indochina borders the provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi, it can be said to have reached a stage of determining its destiny. The reporter has a personal experience of its turbulence and feels that now is the opportunity to truthfully recount the truth of French Indochina, hence the writing of this on-the-spot report.

In July 1941, the agreement between Japan and France regarding the joint defense of Japanese-Vietnamese territories was a military and economic agreement taken by the Japanese army. The spiritual content of every Vietnamese soldier is extremely poor. Although the Chongqing army, a puppet of Britain and America, is an enemy of the Japanese army, a part of the Vietnamese army defending the Sino-Vietnamese border does not consider them an enemy that should be jointly destroyed with the Japanese army. Such a strange phenomenon exists in the tense border.

In November of last year, the author inspected the situation on the front lines of the Vietnamese-Chinese border in early winter, only three hundred meters away from the fortress of the Chongqing army. The reporter heard the following anecdote directly from the young generals confronting the Yunnan army, which is presented below:

One day, a certain Japanese general was patrolling the border security when a French officer came out from the Chinese border side. When questioned, he replied that he was scouting the enemy's situation. In fact, the French officer had dined in the Chongqing army camp guarding the border and was returning. He was immediately reprimanded, and he defended himself plausibly: "What I give to the Chongqing army is textiles, salt, and sugar, and the gifts I bring back to the Japanese army are the equipment and movements of the Yunnan army. I am definitely not selling out Japanese intelligence." At that time, a part of the Vietnamese army, which jointly defended the colony with the Japanese army, often concealed it from the eyes of the Japanese army, crossed the border, and interacted with the Chongqing army. At that time, two or three French officers, dissatisfied with the pro-Japanese policies of the top leadership, went to join the Chongqing army.

The French fortress of the Vietnamese Maginot Line, standing on the high ground near Chi Lăng, cost a total of 20 million Vietnamese dong to build. If a war breaks out there, will the roar of the cannons be directed at Chongqing?

However, the world situation, centered on France, has undergone drastic changes. France has severed diplomatic relations with Britain and the United States, and recently broke ties with Chongqing. This is a welcome thing for Franco-Japanese-Vietnamese friendship. A certain general, after inspecting the Japanese and French armies defending the border, said:

"The border security is now perfect. When the French-Vietnamese army joins forces with the Japanese army, the Chongqing army will not be able to cross the border one step." The French army unit commander, acting as a guide, led a detailed inspection of the interior of the fortress and sent over military secret maps.

Recently, the attitude of the French-Vietnamese army has been completely open and trusting of the Japanese army. The Japanese-French-Vietnamese military agreement now lives up to its name, and cooperation is seamless.

Around the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Tagore elements scattered in Malaya and other parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere fled the war to Vietnam. Da Lat, the only highland resort in southern Vietnam, 300 kilometers south of Saigon, is their refuge. They used wireless communications to secretly contact their comrades, brewing a pro-British and American atmosphere. Now their covert activities, under the strict surveillance of the Japanese and Vietnamese authorities, have almost ceased. Xoài Rinh in the south is a concentration point for overseas Chinese supporting Chiang Kai-shek. Before the Greater East Asia War, it was known for opium and gambling along with Saigon, and was a stage for active international intelligence.

Southern Vietnam produces three thousand several hundred million piculs of rice, most of which is in the hands of 250,000 overseas Chinese centered around trading houses. Xoài Rinh has thus become a completely Chinese city. Recently, large-scale investigations of communists and crackdowns on overseas Chinese supporting Chiang Kai-shek have been carried out. Before the end of last year, the skies were full of Chongqing antennas, and the exchange of secret information was extremely busy.

Spies from Chongqing infiltrated Vietnam and were very active. The Tagore elements, overseas Chinese supporting Chiang Kai-shek, and communists lurking in Vietnam have been repeatedly suppressed by the Japanese and Vietnamese authorities and completely cleared. Vietnam's security is now worry-free.

From the entry into northern Indochina in 1940, the entry into southern Indochina in 1941, to the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, the military and economic tasks that Vietnam has fulfilled as a logistics base cannot but be given due evaluation. The ties linked by the dual belts of the Japanese-Vietnamese Joint Defense and the Economic Agreement are becoming stronger. The Japanese army and navy entered the French Concession of Guangzhou Bay on the 21st of last month with the understanding of France, the Vichy government declared the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of the concessions on the 23rd of last month, and the strengthening of the Japanese-Vietnamese Economic Agreement announced on the 5th of this month are all clear evidence. This attitude of dependency and cooperation with Japan can also be seen in the negotiations between the Japanese representatives and Governor-General Decoux and Economic Director Marton. The General Manager of the Bank of Indochina, Gana, candidly stated:

Vietnam's current trade, industry, finance, and so on, are breaking away from their original dependence on France and now, as a member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, are dependent on Japan.

Vietnam is cooperating with Japan with all its strength in exporting rice, corn, and other agricultural products to Japan, expressing Vietnam's sincerity. Recent examples include restricting its own needs and agreeing to supply Japan with large quantities of timber and cement. Japan is trying its best to help Vietnam control the inflationary trend caused by the lack of materials.

France's approach to the Axis powers has become increasingly apparent recently. Minister for Greater East Asia, Aoki, in replying to a question from a certain member of parliament, said:

"Vietnam now fully understands Japan's trust and is actively cooperating with Japan in political and economic aspects. The realization of joint defense is the only path Vietnam should take, and Vietnam is deeply aware of this."

This statement by the Minister for Greater East Asia is acknowledged by local Japanese people. All of France's colonies have been ravaged by Britain and the United States, and the Indochina Peninsula is the last colony maintained by France, so it has no choice but to depend on it to maintain its existence. There are 40,000 French people living in Vietnam, singing the national anthem under the tricolor flag, and they are the happiest people. Among the French people in Vietnam, there are also those who firmly believe that Britain and the United States will win the final victory; however, the astonishing attack of the Japanese army shattered this hope. France's recent dismal expression is, of course, due to understanding the current situation of the various colonies. If Vietnam can understand Japan's sincerity, it will naturally understand the path Vietnam should take. With its rich resources as a background, Vietnam should take new and solid strides.

### A Visit to the Tokyo Rope Manufacturing Factory

A steel wire that is completely seamless and as long as 4,000 to 5,000 meters must be flawless in terms of its granularity, decarburization, structure, thickness, surface, tensile strength, elongation, twisting, bending, grinding, etc. You must still remember the elevator and cable car tragedies that occurred in the past.

To strengthen a steel wire, it must first be annealed, pickled in acid, neutralized with lime, and dried. Then, it is passed through the holes of a wire drawing machine many times to make it a thin and strong steel wire. In general, to turn a steel bar three-tenths of an inch in diameter into something as thin as hair, it must go through more than thirty processes. However, in these processes, a lot of soap is used to make the steel wire very smooth. In addition to various machines, this factory also has various important materials such as iron, coal, sulfuric acid, lime, soap, special steel, and hemp.

The perfectly made steel wire is then twisted into various shapes using hemp thread as the core to form steel cables. It is regrettable that the importance of steel cables in modern warfare is not given more attention. Due to space limitations, the important uses of steel cables in war cannot be listed in detail. In short, without steel cables, aircraft at sea and on land cannot be operated; balloons and sea mines cannot be secured; minesweepers will lose their mission; and both warships and ordinary ships will encounter major obstacles. Moreover, it would be impossible to set up anti-submarine nets in the sea, and warships would be unable to defend against sea mines. In other words, without steel cables, warships, cannons, and tanks cannot be produced. In the production lines of the rear, the haulage ropes, balance ropes, hoisting ropes, and rails used to transport coal, iron, copper, other important ores, and timber are unimaginable without steel cables.

Under the current decisive battle situation, the Tokyo Rope Manufacturing Factory, which bears this important task, was founded on February 1, 1892, by Baron Eiichi Shibusawa, Masakuni Yamada, and others. Initially, it focused on manufacturing Manila hemp ropes, but after 1900, it gradually shifted to manufacturing steel cables. Since the factory has such an old tradition, the average length of service of its employees and workers is fifteen years, and it is not uncommon for people to have served in the factory for three or four decades. Mr. Daiketsu Ikeda (currently 74 years old), who is currently working as a warehouseman, has a history of 52 years in the factory and was still working enthusiastically in the factory at the end of last year. Mr. Ikeda started working at the factory when the price of rice was six sen per go, and his daily wage at that time was 16 sen. He was originally a veteran who participated in both the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. Here, whether it is a senior worker or a new-era worker, they are united by a supreme love of country, and everyone expresses a sincere willingness to cooperate in production from the bottom of their hearts.

"Does our production really make any contribution to the front lines! Or is it insignificant?"

Such sincere concern unites the hearts of all 00 people in the factory. All actions can be summarized in the phrase "for victory." Every gesture and step is focused on this one and only goal. In short, all the employees of this factory are advancing courageously with such a brave spirit.

However, in terms of the character of this factory, there is one thing that makes people worry that cannot be taken lightly. If they are employees who manufacture shells or bullets, then the shells are used to destroy the barbaric British and Americans, and the bullets are used to pierce the chests of those who do not obey. This awareness is expressed very strongly, and in their work, they show a spirit of enthusiasm that is no less than that of the soldiers on the front lines. However, the direct relationship between a steel wire and the Greater East Asia War is a bit difficult for these honest young workers to understand. No, it is of course difficult to understand, and needless to say, the issue of counterintelligence must also be considered; however, making them fully understand the relationship between the part and the whole in increasing production is the most important thing. Therefore, I believe that the only way to increase production is to inspire the gratitude of young people. It is necessary to explain to them in detail the relationship between their products and the soldiers on the front lines, and to make them fully understand the important uses of their products within the possible range. For example, if the driving cable manufactured in Factory A is not completed in time, it will prevent 20 or 30 aircraft in Factory B, which have already had their frames assembled, from being able to start assembling the airframes, and the workers will have to stand idle. This is a major issue that cannot be ignored. For young workers who are full of gratitude, it is necessary to use simple and sincere words to connect "a steel wire and the manufacturing sequence of an aircraft and the activities of the pilot" and explain it to them clearly so that they can understand it. This will inspire them from the bottom of their hearts, and the effect on increasing production will probably be beyond imagination. They may not want to hear empty and pleasant words such as calling them industrial warriors or praising them as first-line warriors in the rear. They would rather hear more about how the products of the parts they manufacture are related to the overall war situation. Only by making them aware of this is it the right way to expand production and the fundamental essence of expanding production. I know they have such a sincere and healthy demand, so I feel that there is great hope for future production increases. This is not what I am saying to the factory, but what I am saying from the bottom of my heart to the authorities.

I held two symposiums with the employees of the factory and heard many beautiful stories. However, what is called a beautiful story here should not be regarded as a beautiful story, but as an ordinary thing. The gas team did not rest on New Year's Day, and they voluntarily donated the wages they earned to the country.

"The wages for working on a holiday should not be paid."

This is their honest assertion. Those who greedily want to earn wages without working should be ashamed to death when they hear this.

The brother of a certain worker in the silk manufacturing department was being treated for war wounds and died in critical condition. He sent a letter to the worker, which read:

"Your brother fought for the country and unfortunately lost his life. You are now serving the country and should not neglect your duties for even one day because of your brother's funeral. On a day off, you may go out and pay your respects at your brother's grave."

As a child, I once read "The Sailor's Mother" and was moved to tears, but the spirit of the Japanese mother model expressed in this letter is no less magnificent than that book. There are currently 00 female labor service corps members from Yamagata Prefecture working in an important part of this factory. These women from the snowy country are all so simple and sincere, and they work so seriously that they make people bow their heads in admiration. There are also several women who graduated from girls' schools among them. They take advantage of the winter agricultural off-season to come to the military supply factory, and when the soil and water warm up, they return to their hometowns to take up hoes and engage in food production increase. I believe that among these women, women like the mother of that worker are certainly growing.

After visiting this factory, I spent the night in the factory's dormitory that evening, and the next morning I went to visit the factory's farm, which covers an area of two hectares. Everything is regular, neat, and military-style. The dormitory is clean, the meals are nutritious, and the welfare facilities are also complete.

Before eating, the workers always make the following reflection:

"We, who are lacking in virtue, feel ashamed to enjoy such food. We will never have any complaints or dissatisfaction, at any time or in any place."

After listening to this reflection, I could not help but deeply reflect on myself as well. (Original by Tsunehisa Sakurada - Ding: Translated from the March 18th Yomiuri Hochi)

### Postponement of Food Ration Coupon Issuance by One Day; Mixed Grain Rationing Imminent; Sales with Certificates Expected to Begin on April 1st

In order to fully ration household food, the Concession authorities, in addition to issuing rice and flour certificates on schedule, based on which people can purchase from the designated 665 contracted rice shops, will also issue an extra set of mixed grain certificates, the first and second coupons, for the rationing of mixed grains and beans. Shanghai Social News reporters learned yesterday from rice industry sources that the rice industry association was originally scheduled to collect the sales coupons for the 31st period of household food rations from the Public Works Department rationing office yesterday and distribute them to its member rice shops. However, due to insufficient procedures, the collection has been changed to today. However, according to rice industry sources, the 31st period will also include an additional rationing of mixed grains, which can be purchased from the designated rice shops with mixed grain certificates, but this will only be clear after the sales coupons are collected today. As for the quantity, type, and price of rice, flour, and mixed grains to be sold, this is subject to the official announcement by the two Concession authorities. The next period of household food ration sales will be from April 1st to the 9th, and failure to collect within the deadline will render the certificates invalid.

### Secret Investigation of the Unemployed by the Concession Authorities; Householders Responsible for Reporting

In order to establish security within the Concessions, the Concession authorities have begun a secret investigation of the unemployed within the Concessions. With regard to the activities of the unemployed, the leaders of the Jia (neighborhoods) were secretly instructed to order the householders to pay close attention. If there is any transgressive behavior or illegal activity found, the householders should immediately secretly report to the Jia leaders, who will then report to the Lianbao (community) leaders and submit it to the competent authorities. If the householders conceal and do not report, they will be subject to a considerable fine. If the circumstances are serious, the householders will be subject to a severe wartime legal judgment.

### Reorganization of the Grain Management Bureau; Establishment of a Rationing Office

In accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Food, the Municipal Grain Administration Bureau will soon be reorganized into a Grain Bureau to suit the wartime food policy. The internal organization will also be changed. Matters related to the rationing of rice, mixed grains, oil, sugar, etc., will be managed by a newly established Rationing Office. In addition, Sections 1, 2, and 3 will be responsible for agricultural production matters. The Bureau is currently actively planning this, and it is expected to be implemented around April 1st.

### Spokesperson of the Japanese Army Press Department Reports on the Situation in Burma and Introduces the Revival of Jinhua

Yesterday afternoon (25th) at 3:00 PM, the press department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, as usual, held a reception for the Chinese press corps of the city. A staff officer of the Japanese army unit coming from Jinhua, Zhejiang East, introduced the current situation of Jinhua's revival in detail. Subsequently, the spokesperson reported on the recent situation in Burma, which lasted until after 3:15 PM.

General Construction in Jinhua. It is said that the revival of Jinhua is under active construction, especially the major transportation routes, such as bridges, which have been gradually restored. For example, the "Tongji Bridge" and "Yulong Bridge" in Jinhua were damaged in the war, causing inconvenience to the people. After the joint construction and repair by the Japanese army and local people, they have been completed. In addition, a "Wanfo Pagoda" is under active renovation. A brief explanation of the Wanfo Pagoda follows: the pagoda has twelve levels and was severely damaged by artillery fire. After the Japanese army occupied Jinhua, in order to preserve China's cultural heritage, they worked hard to renovate it in order to restore its former appearance. Next, it was mentioned that Jinhua is the birthplace of Zhejiang financial magnates and has a huge influence on China's finance and economy. After the Japanese army stationed there, they worked hard to replenish supplies. Currently, in terms of entertainment, three theaters have been opened. In terms of education, fifteen elementary schools and one junior high school have been established. There is also a senior girls' high school in preparation, which is expected to open soon. Students generally understand the spirit of the National Government's life and death with friendly nations after the war. They also have a deep understanding of the Anglo-American powers who are fighting the common enemy in East Asia. The people and students have a considerable understanding of the true meaning of Sun Yat-sen's Greater Asianism.

Military Situation in Burma. Subsequently, the spokesperson of the military headquarters gave a detailed account of the situation of the war in Burma, as follows: Recently, the Allied nations, including Britain, the United States, and Chongqing, have made the recovery of Burma their main goal. The Chongqing side is preparing to launch an offensive on the Yunnan-Burma Road and has specially appointed Chen Cheng as the commander-in-chief of the Expeditionary Force. Chen Cheng's former position as the commander of the Sixth War Zone has now been taken over by Sun Lianzhong. Currently, Chen Cheng's troops are stationed in western Yunnan. The British army in India is also preparing to launch an offensive from India. Overall, it is currently impossible for the Chongqing army to launch an offensive against Burma independently. They can only defend their own territory to resist further offensives by the Japanese army. Observing the current situation in Yunnan, although Chen Cheng's troops are stationed in western Yunnan, eastern Yunnan is still under the control of Long Yun. Chen Cheng's military strength now consists of twenty-four divisions and seven brigades, organized into the Eleventh Army Group. In addition, there is the Fifth Army Group, commanded by Du Yuming, the former commander of the Fifth Army in Burma, which includes the Seventy-first Army (with Song Xilian as the commander) (with four divisions and one newly编师), the Sixth Army (with three divisions), the Fifth Army (with three divisions), the Second Army (with three divisions), and the Eighth Army (with three divisions). The Seventy-first Army under the Eleventh Army Group is currently stationed in Dali, Yunnan. The Sixth Army under the Fifth Army Group is stationed in Yunnan, connecting to the Burmese border area. The main force of the Fifth Army Group is in Kunming. A part of the military force is in the northeast of Dali, and the rest is the Second Army, which has been moved from Guiyang to Fengyi, and the Eighth Army, which has been moved from Changde to Kunming. Currently, there are only ninety American Air Force planes in Chongqing.

Recent Military Situation in India and Burma. Regarding the general situation in Burma and India, the army in India is controlled by the British, and the air force is controlled by the Americans. Since the British army withdrew from Riyue in mid-February last year, they have suffered heavy losses due to fierce attacks by the Japanese army. The enemy is also facing difficulties in supply due to geographical obstacles. Therefore, they are increasingly anxious to recapture the Burma Road. In order to prevent the British and Americans from making any further moves, the Japanese army launched a large-scale offensive in early March, and the enemy was defeated in a rout. Subsequently, the enemy, whose army was blocked, launched a counter-offensive by air. Therefore, in early February, the enemy launched as many as eighty-seven air raids, with a total of four hundred and fifty-one aircraft sorties. These air raid locations are all in indefinite locations on the front line. This further proves that the Anglo-American and Chongqing regime's attempts to seize Burma have become a fantasy after being severely attacked by the Japanese army. It is expected that large-scale guerrilla warfare will be launched in the future. Finally, it was mentioned that the Indian army is unwilling to assist the British and Americans in the war, while the Indian people are fully serving the Japanese army. This has proved that the Japanese army is in an absolutely superior position. The enemy army in India currently has ten divisions and two brigades under Wavell, with an air force of more than 400 aircraft, which is the responsibility of the Americans. As for the Chongqing expeditionary force in India, there are a total of seventeen divisions, also commanded by Chen Cheng. Finally, it was pointed out that He Yingqin's report on his inspection of India was full of boastful words.

### Newly Purchased Radios Must Be Registered with Invoices; Those Who Have Registered but Lost Their Documents Must Send Their Radios for Inspection to Reissue

Since the registration of wireless radios in this port, all residents with radios have completed the registration procedures. The police stations in each district have already submitted the registration books to the General Registration Office. According to a report from a Datong News Agency reporter, residents in the two concessions who have newly purchased wireless radios should go to the Wireless Radio Registration Office at No. 610, Jianshe Building, Jiang Si Road, Fuzhou Road, with their purchase invoices to complete the registration procedures. As for those who have already registered but lost their registration certificates, they must personally bring the radio to the registration office in Jianshe Building to complete the re-issuance procedure.

Overdue Registration Fines

The military and police authorities in this city have strictly managed wireless radios and ordered registration. The registration has been quite enthusiastic, and all radios have been inspected, and shortwave radios have been dismantled. The results have been quite satisfactory. The registration deadline has also been closed. However, in order to take into account ignorant citizens who may still not have registered, the authorities are still continuing to handle the registration procedures, but they must be punished according to the regulations, with fines ranging from ten to one hundred yuan, depending on the length of the overdue period.

According to investigations: There are more than forty offices of various organs of the National Government in Shanghai. If we add the offices of the Peace Army or those related to special agent work, the number will be even more alarming.

Including the Japanese side, the so-called excessive establishment of institutions and the complexity of types have always been regarded as a problem, whether in Shanghai or inland. However, the Japanese side, since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry and the implementation of new policies to adapt to the new situation after the National Government's participation in the war, has been improving the institutions that were generally criticized by the public. What about the Chinese side? Because this is China's internal affairs, we are not in a position to comment, but we can only hope from the standpoint of collaborators. If we were to express our hopes frankly, then the integration and reorganization of central and local administrative institutions is the current practical need, especially in Shanghai.

When will the recovery of the Public Concession take place? In what form will it be implemented? This cannot be predicted, and the sooner or later is unknown, but it will inevitably be realized in the near future. This can be understood by simply reading Ambassador Shigemitsu's remarks. Once recovered, it can be asserted that the new municipal form will necessarily simplify the complex and disorganized Shanghai administrative institutions. We firmly believe in the necessity of this move and hold the highest expectations.

I think that the National Government or the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, which is responsible for recovering the concessions, is probably preparing all the recovery steps, but the problem of the offices stationed in Shanghai is not known

### Translation and Commentary: Adjustment of Offices Stationed in Shanghai

what considerations will be given. We sincerely hope that the National Government will make a wise and appropriate decision on this issue. The merger, reorganization, and abolition of offices stationed in Shanghai is a separate issue from the recovery of the concessions. In short, in order to strengthen the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and promote the integrated relationship between Nanjing and Shanghai, the above-mentioned hope can be understood without explicitly stating it. (Yunpeng: Translated from the March 25th edition of the Continental New Daily)

### Short Comment: Welcome President Takashima

Mr. Kikujiro Takashima, who succeeded Mr. Kenji Kodama as the president of the Central China Revitalization Company, arrived in Shanghai safely from Tokyo yesterday. While extending our respectful welcome, we would like to raise several expectations:

The Central China Revitalization Company is the largest economic institution in Central China, and its affiliated businesses include mining, industry, transportation, communications, public utilities, etc., with a total of sixteen units. The success or failure of its management has an impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood, especially for those who are participating in the total war. Based on the principle of daily renewal, reviewing the past and planning for the most perfect operational strategy is the most important thing to pay attention to in the future.

The past task of the Central China Revitalization Company focused on revitalizing the war-torn industry of Central China, operating diligently, and laying the foundation, which was a great achievement. From the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War to today, after the National Government's participation in the war, there is an even greater need for resource development and smooth transportation. The company's mission in the future will shift from revitalizing post-war industries to accelerating industrial development to adapt to wartime needs, with the aim of directly contributing to the total war. This is the second point.

We have repeatedly advocated that in the future, to achieve the highest efficiency in handling China's economic affairs, the following principles should be followed: (1) Those that are more beneficial for China to handle on its own than for Japan to handle should be handed over to China; (2) Those that are more beneficial for both China and Japan to handle jointly should be handled jointly by China and Japan; (3) Those that are more beneficial for Japan to handle than for China to handle on its own should still be handled by Japan. Based on the above principles to determine the businesses to be handled, the selection of the main responsible persons must absolutely adopt the principle of talent, this is the third point.

At the reception for reporters yesterday, Mr. Takashima said, "The cooperation between China and Japan should not only be in words or on paper, but also in practical aspects, so that the daily lives and behaviors of the people of the two countries are combined... I am willing to do my best to promote its success." This is the same as our long-held view that the true friendship between the two countries must be based on the feelings of the people, that is, the daily lives and behaviors of the people. We especially hope that Mr. Takashima will do his best to promote its success, this is the fourth point.

Mr. Takashima is one of the most prestigious entrepreneurs in Japan, with rich experience. As the president, he will be more than capable. We are willing to wait and see the future performance of the Central China Revitalization Company.

### Rice for Registered Households in Western Shanghai

The seventh phase of household rice distribution in the western Shanghai district began yesterday (25th). These rice purchase certificates have also been issued to residents by the Lianbao Office a few days ago. It is heard that this household rice is 2.4 sheng per person, and the selling price is 6 yuan and 0.05 fen. The previous rumor that it would be increased to 2.5 sheng is incorrect.

### Brief News

Fundraising for Fuyouyuan. The Shanghai Fuyouyuan (Children's Welfare Institute) has been fundraising for ten days since it started. There have been many people who have voluntarily donated funds. The current fundraising committee of the institute believes that there are many orphans in the institute and the expenses are huge. It is difficult to achieve the goal without a comprehensive promotion. Therefore, it is planning to organize Yue opera, drama, radio broadcasting, and invite famous Chinese and foreign football teams to participate in a charity match.

Fundraising for the Ciyou Association. Yesterday, according to the Chinese Ciyou Association, the association will hold its annual fundraising campaign for the education and upbringing of orphans in April, but the fundraising target and date have not yet been officially decided. Yesterday's report mistranslated that the Chinese Children's Happiness Association would hold a fundraising campaign.

### Sports: The Donghua vs. Saint Francis Xavier Match is Rescheduled to the Afternoon

The Italian Navy vs. the Sucor Match is Advanced. According to the temporary notice from the Western Union Secretariat, the order and time of this Sunday (28th) have been slightly adjusted. The two matches in Group A will be switched. The Italian Navy will play Sucor at 10:30 AM, and the Donghua vs. Saint Francis Xavier match will be rescheduled to 3:30 PM, the venue is still Jiaozhou Park. The situation of the previous match between the Jewish team and the Portuguese Merchants in Group A has not changed. The Italian Navy still ranks first, followed by Lianyi, Donghua, Jewish, Portuguese Merchants, Saint Francis Xavier, and Sucor at the bottom.

### Mr. Kikujiro Takashima, President of the Central China Revitalization Company, Arrives in Shanghai and Receives Chinese and Japanese Journalists Yesterday

Mr. Kikujiro Takashima, the newly appointed president of the Central China Revitalization Co., Ltd., has arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo with Vice President Ueba and Secretary Hamada. He received the Japanese press at the Broadway Mansion at 6:00 PM yesterday (25th) and the Chinese press at 6:30 PM, explaining the focus of future operations, saying, "Now that the relationship between China and Japan has returned to its proper state and is striving to move forward on a new track, I am honored to take over the important position of president of the Central China Revitalization Co., Ltd. after my predecessor Mr. Kodama. I feel honored, but I am not capable enough to take on this important task. In the future, I will do my best to follow the government's policies in order to fulfill my duties and mission. As for the cooperation between China and Japan, the Japanese government has always stated this, and recently Prime Minister Tojo visited the National Government, and Chairman Wang also made the same statement. I have no need to repeat it, but I will follow the new policies of the two governments so that the cooperation between China and Japan is not only in words or on paper, but also in practical aspects, so that the daily lives and behaviors of the people of the two countries are combined to create a foundation for permanent cooperation based on mutual trust. Although I am not talented, I am willing to do my best to promote its success. As for the future operations of our company, we will also follow the main points of the government's policy toward China, and strive to respect the Chinese side's capital and creativity. When necessary, we will also make appropriate adjustments to the company's business. After a detailed inspection here, we will consider adapting to the actual situation and handling it well. Therefore, I hope for the guidance of the army and navy and officials and people here, and at the same time, I sincerely hope that the National Government will give its cooperation for favorable progress."

### Economy

Military scrip is slightly softer. Since the Japanese Ministry of Finance announced that the issuance of new military scrip would be abolished from April and that all public and private payments would be made in savings certificates, its use has inevitably decreased. Inter-dealer trading is slightly lower at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3 li, and 4 hao.

The Lianhe Banknote's price rises sharply, breaking through the 4 yuan mark. After the issuance of new military scrip was stopped, its demand increased. Traders bought in from 3 yuan, 9 jiao, 5 fen to 4 yuan, 1 jiao, and sold at 4 yuan, 2 jiao, a rise of 3 jiao and 8 fen.

### Commentary: Preliminary Strengthening of the Central Reserve Bank Note

The previous commentary focused on how to strengthen the purchasing power of the Central Reserve Bank Note, with strengthening the public's psychological belief in the Central Reserve Bank Note as the decisive factor. Yesterday's news reported that the friendly nation has decided to abolish the issuance of new military scrip from April 1, thereby achieving complete uniformity of currency in Central and Southern China. In other words, the unification performance of the Central Reserve Bank Note has been reaffirmed, which has a great relationship with the stability of finance and the suppression of prices. Such a measure can be said to be a preliminary strengthening of the Central Reserve Bank Note.

Why is it called a preliminary strengthening? Because among the factors that determine the strength of a country's currency, at least two factors are indispensable: one is the currency's liquidity, and the other is the currency's issuance amount. Yesterday's commentary already said that a basic principle cannot be ignored in a concrete plan to strengthen the purchasing power of the Central Reserve Bank Note, that is, the public's psychological belief in the Central Reserve Bank Note must be stabilized and consolidated. If the currency's circulation can be consistent, the public's concerns about the currency's volatility can be eliminated. If the currency's issuance amount is limited, the public's concerns about the currency's inflation can be eliminated. As a result, the public's psychological belief in the currency will be strengthened.

Since the issuance of new military scrip has been stopped, and after April 1, all national treasury expenditures involving military scrip will be converted to Central Reserve Bank Notes; the deposits, loans, and remittances of various banks, money houses, and guilds in various places cannot be paid with military scrip. The liquidity of the Central Reserve Bank Note has become more widespread. Therefore, it is called a preliminary strengthening of the Central Reserve Bank Note. As for further strengthening - that is, the restriction of the issuance amount -, it is at least hoped that the financial authorities can constantly provide the public with open and factual reports, which is what the public most likes to hear.

### Minister Tajiri Issues a Statement After the Issuance of New Military Scrip is Stopped

Central News Agency, Shanghai: The fact that the issuance of new military scrip in Central and Southern China will be stopped from April 1 was clarified on the 24th by the authorities of the Japanese Army and Navy Embassy and the Minister of Greater East Asia and the Ministry of Finance. However, some of the public still do not fully understand the significance of this measure and mistakenly believe that the issuance amount of reserve certificates will increase after the issuance of new military scrip is stopped, or that this will cause inflation of the reserve certificates and hold unwarranted worries. Minister Tajiri of the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office, in view of this, issued a statement on the 25th, stating that the above is purely a misunderstanding. The Chinese and Japanese authorities will take all measures to maintain the price and credit of the reserve certificates and sincerely explain that there is absolutely no worry about inflation of the reserve certificates. The contents of Minister Tajiri's statement are recorded as follows:

Since April 1, the issuance of new military scrip has been stopped. The purpose of stopping the issuance of new military scrip, which was officially announced by the Japanese authorities on the 24th, is to complete the work of unifying the currency of Central and Southern China with the Central Reserve Bank notes. The various measures taken to maintain the price of military scrip, such as the sale of imports from Japan, North China, and Manchuria with military scrip, and the sale of local products such as tobacco with military scrip, will henceforth be limited to sale with reserve certificates in order to maintain the value of the reserve certificates. The Japanese side will take all necessary measures to maintain the price of reserve certificates and fully assist the National Government in its currency work. Because the issuance of new military scrip has been stopped, the payments of Japanese military departments and government offices, as well as the payments of bank deposits and loans, will all be made with reserve certificates and no longer use military scrip. The military scrip will be gradually withdrawn, and the reserve certificates, which will replace the military scrip, will have their circulation range expanded.

Although the circulation range of reserve certificates has been expanded after replacing the military scrip that has been circulating, and the circulation amount has increased, this is only to replace the military scrip that was circulating in the past, so the total amount of currency in Central and Southern China has not increased. Moreover, as mentioned just now, the various measures taken by the Japanese side to maintain the value of military scrip will henceforth be used to maintain the value of reserve certificates. The Japanese side will do its best to take necessary measures regarding the maintenance of the value of reserve certificates and will make even greater efforts than before to cooperate with the National Government's currency policy. Therefore, since the issuance of new military scrip has been stopped, the circulation of reserve certificates has increased, which is due to the expansion of the circulation range of reserve certificates, and it is also a sign of the completion of the unification of the currency of Central and Southern China with reserve certificates. Therefore, reserve certificates have now become a unified currency, and their value is becoming more stable. This can be clearly seen from the above points. Reserve certificates have now become the unified currency of Central and Southern China, and the stability of the people's livelihood and the preservation of property in Central and Southern China all depend on the stability of the value of reserve certificates. Therefore, the Japanese side has repeatedly stated that it will cooperate with the National Government in stabilizing the currency value and take measures to cooperate as much as possible, even more effort than in maintaining the value of military scrip in the past.

The ratio of reserve certificates to military scrip has always been set at 18 yuan, and it has been firm since June last year. Since April 1, the ratio of reserve certificates to Japanese yen has also been set at 18 Japanese yen to 100 reserve certificates. This has been announced by the Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, the Ministry of Finance, and the Army and Navy Embassies in China. In addition, Zhou Fohai, the Minister of Finance of the National Government, has also stated that he will adhere to the 18 yuan exchange rate. Therefore, reserve certificates will be set at 18 yuan for both military scrip and Japanese yen. The policy of adhering to this has been clarified by both the Chinese and Japanese authorities, so the value of reserve certificates will become more stable.

### Readjustment of the City's Economic Bureau and Economic Institutions

Central News Agency, Shanghai: In order to comply with the wartime economic policy guidelines promulgated by the National Government on February 13 this year, the Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau has decided to readjust and reorganize all old economic institutions in the city that are not suitable for the wartime economic system. It is heard that the bureau regards industrial and commercial groups in the city as a type of economic institution. In order to actively readjust the economic institutions in the city, all joint associations, business offices, trade associations, and other similar organizations in the city that have not been approved in the past must report to the bureau before April 10 for verification and handling. It is hoped that all industrial and commercial groups in the city will comply with this and not delay.

### Circulation of Materials Expedited, Transit Tax Revenue Will Increase

After the establishment of the National Commercial Control Council, it was stipulated that permits must be obtained for the removal of 12 categories of goods such as cotton yarn and cloth, and for the import of rice, wheat, etc. Goods not subject to the permit system are allowed to be transported freely within the peaceful area. Therefore, various industries in Shanghai are quite active. As a result, the transit tax collected by the Jianghai Customs branches has increased significantly. The reason for this is that the establishment of the National Commercial Control Council has expedited the circulation of materials. According to this trend, transit tax revenue can be further increased in the future, and the previous tendency of materials to be concentrated can also be alleviated. The agencies for collecting transit tax are the various customs and their branches, totaling 24 as of March 20.

### Hua Zhong Tobacco Allocation. Distribution of Goods Implemented Yesterday. Collection by Card Ends Tomorrow

After the Hua Zhong Tobacco Allocation Association applied to the authorities to announce the fair prices of cigarettes, the unified allocation has been prepared and the first phase of distribution was implemented yesterday. The goods distributed are temporarily limited to the goods produced by the military-managed Zhongyan Company and the Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco Company. The allocation method adopts a 1, 2, 3, 4 system, based on the ABCD ratings of the cigarette retail stores (for example, A is allocated 4 packs of cigarettes, B is allocated 3 packs, C is allocated 2 packs, and D is allocated 1 pack). Collection is made with the previously issued allocation card. (1) 300 large wholesalers collect from the designated distribution points. (2) More than 5,000 small wholesalers collect from the designated large wholesalers, and the deadline is March 27. As for the distribution of Huacheng, Nanyang, Datong, Fuxin, and Dadongnan and other Chinese factories, due to procedural reasons, it will be implemented on March 29 (Monday). The authorities are responsible for strictly implementing the cigarette price limit, and violators will be severely punished. Therefore, from yesterday, all cigarette stores have sold in accordance with the price limit, but the quantity purchased is limited to one or two small packs.

### Translated Commentary: New Development in Currency Policy

The Japanese side has always actively cooperated in the circulation and strengthening of the Central Reserve Bank Note. Its circulation area is expanding day by day, and its currency value is extremely stable. This time, the Japanese authorities have decided to stop issuing new military scrip, and the Central Reserve Bank Note has become the only currency in Central and Southern China. Its status is becoming more and more important.

Stopping the issuance of new military scrip aims to gradually create a monetary system with the Central Reserve Note as the sole currency. There is no change in the economic sector, and economic operations can still proceed smoothly. The monetary system will be unified in the short term. In the future, the military and government authorities will no longer pay with military scrip, and all deposits and remittances will be made with Central Reserve Notes. It goes without saying that the authorities' policies are appropriate and thorough.

In the past five years, military scrip has completed major tasks. The currency war against the old legal tender and the work of assisting the Central Reserve Note's circulation have all accomplished indelible achievements. At present, the task has been completed and the period of unifying the currency system has been reached. However, we still need cooperation between officials and the people to make the best efforts to ensure that the military scrip has a beginning and an end, and reaches the stage of successful retirement.

### Rice Production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces: Ministry of Food Establishes Production and Sales Office in Jiangsu

Suzhou, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Ministry of Food considers Wu County, Changshu, Kunshan, Taicang, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Wujin, Yixing, Songjiang, Wujiang, Qingpu, Jinshan, Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Pinghu in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces as central rice-producing areas.

Upon receiving the order, the Municipal Grain Administration Bureau immediately instructed its subordinate districts to report accurately.

### A Look at the Past and Present of the China Commercial Bank (1)

— Jian Zhi

"Finance is the hub of all industries." This is not only a common saying in society but also a generally recognized economic fact. In the eyes of the people, economic stability is synonymous with financial stability; the two are different in name but the same in essence. The Chinese government has always believed that stabilizing finance is equivalent to stabilizing the economy, and all economic measures should start with finance. Given the importance attached to finance in the economy, it is only natural that banks, as the most important institutions in finance, are regarded as the hub of all industries.

In Chinese economic history, banks have indeed been the hub of the economy, and their power has not only influenced economic activities but also formed the backbone of political power. This was especially true before the "August 13th Incident," before the implementation of the legal tender policy. The China Commercial Bank possessed the largest amount of capital in the economic sector and was the sole trustee of general social savings. At that time, industrial and commercial enterprises with capital exceeding several hundred thousand yuan were already considered large enterprises, while larger commercial banks had deposits of over ten million yuan. Due to the disparity in financial strength, and in the absence of direct investment interest in society, industrial and commercial enterprises had no choice but to rely on banks for turnover, allowing banks to manipulate the economy through the power of finance.

Moreover, since the founding of the Republic of China, governments have often resorted to borrowing as a simple way to manage finances due to financial difficulties. Banks, as holders of large amounts of capital, naturally became creditors. Politicians and bankers often supported each other, actively participating in the political arena, thus establishing a close relationship between banks and politics. This was the golden age of the China Commercial Bank. After the establishment of the Nationalist Government, the situation changed slightly, but the economy continued to require the assistance of banks. Therefore, although their power diminished, they remained influential as before.

### Fear and Life

— Xiao Lin

From a beneficial perspective, "fear" is an indispensable psychological medicine for the "life," motivating progress. Whoever fears the punishment of the law will avoid committing crimes. Whoever fears hunger will work hard. Whoever fears getting sick will take care of their body and pay attention to hygiene. Whoever fears being ridiculed by others will strive to improve and prove themselves... These kinds of fears are all necessary for life.

However, from another perspective, the failure of many people is also due to fearing everything, which leads them to hesitate in any undertaking, destroying all self-confidence, enthusiasm, creativity, and decisiveness. "Fear" makes them feel that everyone around them is looking for their faults to criticize. "Fear" makes them feel that all things are filled with difficulties that human power cannot overcome. In this way, fear will forever control their will, preventing them from ever achieving balance, until "death," when they are still afraid that "death" will cause them pain.

How unfortunate, how many people have been buried alive by fear.

Fear is mostly expanded from one's own personal thoughts. They lock the enemy in their own hearts, allowing it to wreak havoc freely.

To cure this psychological problem, one's own wisdom is the best medicine. Only clear wisdom can dispel the fear in one's heart and cleanse the mind of fear. To prevent fear from acting up, take direct action, forget fear, and prevent your spirit from being entangled by the environment. "Calmly" and freely engage in creative efforts, without fearing failure. The important thing is to strive to correct shortcomings.

Conquering fear is the only way to embark on the path to success. If you allow fear to grow in your life, it is tantamount to slow suicide.

### Rainy Day

— Ya Qi

It's raining in the street. The rain isn't heavy, it only wets the center of the street, and a few drops fall on the window curtains. The slight sound doesn't disturb me. I feel that the rain should have come long ago. Lovely rain, it's spring. A few raindrops can irrigate the budding new leaves and moisten the hearts and lungs of people who have gone through the severe winter. It's the gentle drizzle.

When I was in Sichuan, I lived in Rongyu for two years. Although that place isn't as beautiful and gorgeous as Jiangnan, I have a bias towards liking that place because there is a pleasant rainy day.

"Western Sichuan Plain" is a flat basin with a very mild climate. Rain rarely shows its cruel methods in this happy place, whether it's pouring down or dropping like pearls. It's also the weather after spring. The rain becomes a close friend of the people. I hate that the streets of Rongcheng are dusty, but the rain often makes up for it. It's very clever, it only wets the flying road dust and then leaves with the dark clouds. The face of the sun is smiling again. I rarely have a hard time with the dark clouds when I go out. At night, there are probably a few days without rain. It will be interesting to drop for a while. The sound of rain is detected in the leaking tube, hitting the banana leaves in the courtyard, clear and full of poetic rhythm. Sometimes I wake up from a dream and think that I should go to Shao City Park for tea tomorrow morning!

After a night of washing, the yellow dirt road in Shao City Park is very easy to walk on. Its characteristic is that it's soft, but it doesn't wet your soles. Sipping light tea in a rattan chair in "Jiminglou," watching the small creek flowing beside you, the water is overflowing, flowing very fast in a grayish yellow color. The evergreen trees as long as the gallery are washed so smooth by the rain? There are not many water droplets left on the leaves. The children selling newspapers and groceries went upstairs. The clock tower in the imperial city struck, nine o'clock, I went downstairs with a stack of newspapers.

However, I also lived in the nearby countryside for a short time. The rain here didn't give me a good impression. It became an annoying thing. The country's yellow dirt road has no sand. After the rain, it all becomes a muddy road. Chicken carts can't carry people. We have to walk barefoot into the city. If we're not careful, we often slip down the fields.

Staying in Kunming for the autumn is also a rainy season. The rain and I have a sense of intimacy again. I describe it as a beautiful rain angel.

Everything is very strange. I believe that the rain will not be blamed by the residents of Kunming. It's called a "rainy season", but this is different from the tropical "rainy season". It doesn't rain for a few days, and it doesn't cause floods. It has a very rich storage capacity. The fine rain silk floats, floats on the faces of pedestrians, and who will care about it.

While I was there, I spent a lot of money to buy a raincoat, so every time I went into the city from "Daguanlou," I always wore it. I realized that the people of Kunming despise "rain," and I felt that it was very beautiful.

Here, in Shanghai, the rain has stopped early, and a car drives by, a burst of water sound, I really hate the sound. Rain is indeed a double-edged thing. I love it, and I hate it equally.

### Roots

— Xin Bo

There is a road, going along Wangjiajing. The water in Wangjiajing has risen a lot because of the rain for a few days. In some places, there are patches of algae, scattered in patches, and in some places, there are newly born wild water caltrops, floating in plates. Schools of small fish shuttle back and forth between their roots and leaves.

After passing Wangjia Village, A-Wu soon arrived at the foot of Little Ling Mountain. The only road up the mountain is the larger and flatter one in the center, so everyone takes this central path, and people are crowded together. But the crowd doesn't make A-Wu unhappy, but increases his happiness. So many people, how lively. How many times a year is the lively scene! He knows how to cherish this opportunity.

Although his feet are very strong, and the mountain is not high, and he can reach the top in a few steps, he walks very slowly, and often looks back at the scenery at the foot of the mountain. He can see the entire view of Chongwen Town at a glance. It extends east and west along the long river, also two or three li away. The dense houses, white walls, and black roofs reflect each other. Because it is after the rain, it is like a landscape painting that has just been brushed, the colors are not dry yet, and there is some damp meaning.

He found it interesting, so he simply left the surging crowd and stood next to a rose field. This field is enclosed on the hillside. The yellow soil is planted with clusters of roses, which are almost the same as the tea mountains in Hangzhou. The roses have already formed buds, and when the weather is clear, they will bloom red petals.

Next to the rose field, there are a few mulberry fields. The mulberry branches have already sprouted leaves, and the light yellow color is somewhat like the newly born leaves on the willow branches a month or two ago. A-Wu suddenly felt interested in them, like meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign land, so he stopped looking at the distance and instead focused on them. He remembered the scene of his family raising silkworms when his parents were alive. (20)

### Third Place in the February Essay Contest: How to Read? What to Read?

— Xie Tingxin

(1) How to Read?

(A) How to Obtain Books. Currently, the production of new books has decreased drastically, the import of foreign books has been cut off, and book prices are dozens of times higher than before the war. Ordinary people's purchasing power is already inadequate. The only way is to open up other channels:

(1) Utilize Libraries. Utilizing libraries is the most economical principle of "obtaining maximum utility at the smallest cost." (2) Borrow Books from Relatives and Friends. As long as you return them on time and cherish the books. (3) Browse Used Bookstores. First, you can get books at a low price, and second, you can get books that are out of print. (4) Exchange Books. Allow those in need and those who supply to get what they need, eliminating middlemen from profiting.

(B) What Attitude Should You Have When Reading?

(1) Have a Skeptical Attitude. Mencius said: "To believe everything in books is worse than having no books at all." Every writer has his era background and his personal views. Readers should analyze them, why blindly follow them? (2) Do Not Read for Entertainment. The Japanese writer Lafcadio Hearn said: "Although London publishes more than 6,000 books every year, very few people actually read. They buy books for entertainment, just like what they call 'leisure.'" I think this situation is very common in our country as well. Reading for entertainment only results in the intoxication of the mind and destroys the ability to think. (3) Read to Enrich Life. Dr. Hutchins, former president of the University of Chicago, said, "The lives of people with higher education are the most fulfilling. They can enjoy and appreciate many things that wealth cannot buy." Reading is educating yourself, to achieve the goal of enriching life.

(C) When and Where to Read?

(1) Utilize Spare Time to Read. The accumulation of many short periods of time will quickly exceed the entire teaching time of university education. (2) Read Anywhere. Japanese and Americans also read on the train. Their spirit is worthy of emulation. We must develop a constant reading habit in the changing free time of life.

(D) How to Read?

(1) Recognize the Author's Background. Recognize the various backgrounds in which the author is located before reading their text. (2) Grasp the Central Idea. Grasp the central idea, and the entire logic will be solved. (3) Find the Main Sentence of Each Paragraph. Find the main sentence, and the logic will be clear. (4) Underline. Underline the essence of the full text or the main theme to clarify the outline. (5) Read a good book more than once.

(2) What to Read?

(A) Read Books that Have Been Rigorously Tested by Time. To avoid wasting energy, only read the best books. The greatest critic of books is society. The fame of famous books is not created by a few critics, but by the accumulation of centuries of human opinion. Sometimes we cannot understand the advantages of great works praised for centuries. But after careful study, you will eventually understand the reasons for the praise. The essential value hidden in famous books will never pass, but will reveal new meanings due to the progress of the reader's personal life experience.

(B) Read Books that are Related to Our Lives. All frivolous, ethereal, and imaginary books do not need to be read. These are of no benefit other than anesthesia. A person's life is multifaceted. Basic books in each category of life must be read to make life full of vitality and not fall behind.

(C) Read Books Towards Your Own Aspirations.

The British scientist John Lubbock wrote a "List of World Classics," with a hundred literary classics. Other scholars have also proposed different classics. Now that time has passed, and these classics tables have become worthless. In short, each person has different goals, and only by deciding on a reading list according to their aspirations. Choose the best ones to study. It is better to be specialized than broad.

(D) Read Biographies of Successful People. Many people have read biographies of successful people, been inspired, and achieved great careers in one fell swoop. Success is not accidental. There is a certain path to follow. Whether you aspire to be in politics, business, industry, or agriculture, biographies of successful people can indicate the path to success and the elements of success. Use a scientific mind to analyze, and never read it like a novel!

### The Needy New Pututang Shelter Awaiting Rescue

The largest refugee shelter in Shanghai is the New Pututang Shelter on Guohuo Road in the Nanshi district, founded by the Catholic friend Mr. Lu Bohong. For 30 years, it has been sheltering the elderly, weak, disabled, orphans, and widows, requiring annual funding of two million yuan. Because there is no fixed fund, the annual expenses rely on the annual assistance of local charitable organizations, or donations from foreign churches and individuals, to maintain it until now. With the prices of all things rising, it is even more difficult. The enthusiasm and perseverance of the person in charge for charity can be imagined. Yesterday, we received a letter from Dean Yu Keqin: "Our hall currently cares for 202 elderly men and women, 136 disabled people, 432 orphans, 156 poor and sick people, and 111 refugees, totaling 1,037 people. Each person eats five he of rice per day, and the monthly rice consumption is 150 dan. Due to insufficient funds, food and clothing are sometimes in danger of not being provided. Last year, thanks to your enthusiasm for charity, you appealed loudly in the newspapers, and you received sympathy and assistance from great philanthropists in society, who generously donated funds. The people in the hall were deeply grateful. Recently, prices have skyrocketed endlessly, and expenses have increased sharply, making funding even more difficult. If we don't urgently seek remedies, then more than a thousand elderly and weak people will inevitably become starving corpses. Therefore, we specially request your newspaper to continue to provide assistance, and we respectfully ask people from all walks of life to pity the poor and care for orphans, generously donate funds, whether cash or goods, to enable the poor people in the hall to rely on sustenance for their lives. (Editor's note: All people of integrity cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the death of compatriots. This office will do its best to inform the public and hopes that all sectors can visit in person and provide financial assistance to save these orphans and widows. The collection points are: (1) Jihua Hall, (2) Huamei Pharmacy, (3) Yangjingbang Catholic Church, (4) Silk Industry Bank. After receiving the funds and goods, the above-mentioned places will hand them over to the hall for public announcement to show great faith.)
