### Air Defense Drills and Citizen Responsibility

Since yesterday, our city has begun conducting summer public air defense exercises. The significance of these exercises lies not only in training air defense baojia (neighborhood units) and local security personnel in various air defense tasks, but especially in enabling the general public to become accustomed to air defense life, to familiarize themselves with various air defense rules, to strictly adhere to discipline, and to help each other.

Although society has experienced air defense exercises before, there are still quite a few people who hold erroneous views. The first type has never seen actual warfare since the incident and regards Shanghai as a haven of peace, living as if in peacetime. Due to this mistaken notion, they are indifferent to air defense drills, at most considering them a novelty, remaining aloof. Thus, on the nights of air defense exercises, restaurants and dance halls are particularly lively. The second type harbors an excessive fear of air defense drills, even becoming neurotic, believing that the exercises are a prelude to an actual air raid. Therefore, whenever there is an air defense exercise, they express excessive tension, staying indoors and refraining from lighting lamps at night, seemingly complying with the law, but actually missing the point of conducting the exercises. Furthermore, there is a third type who holds half-baked military knowledge and political understanding, either misunderstanding that Shanghai has no high mountains or deep caves and no reliable air raid shelters, rendering air defense ineffective, or misunderstanding that air defense is entirely the concern of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, having nothing to do with us ordinary citizens. If these erroneous ideas are not fundamentally dispelled, they will have a negative impact on the effectiveness of air defense exercises.

The international war situation is approaching a decisive stage. Although our ally Japan is in a superior position in the battles in the Pacific, the enemy's ambition has never been abandoned. In terms of strength, the enemy has no possibility of counterattacking, but we cannot dismiss the concern of aerial guerrilla warfare. China is a participating country, and every citizen has the obligation of a participating national. Whether you are willing or not, the enemy's invasion is inevitable. Therefore, every citizen should have the necessary vigilance and preparation. Therefore, during air defense exercises, adopting the mindset of an actual air raid, earnestly understanding and complying with all air defense laws and regulations, and strictly observing order during the exercises are our most basic responsibilities. At the same time, during air defense exercises, we hope that baojia personnel and air defense commanders, in addition to faithfully performing their duties and striving to serve, should gently advise and explain in detail to those who violate the rules, and strictly deal with stubborn individuals who refuse to listen to advice according to the law.

Air defense exercises are an education in wartime life for the people and a test of the character of the national psyche. We hope that everyone will respect themselves and others, and everywhere demonstrate the spirit of self-governance and mutual assistance, and even outside of exercise periods, always be prepared and vigilant.

### Summer Hygiene Matters

This summer, the climate is extremely abnormal, but as a result, some people neglect summer hygiene issues, which can easily lead to illness. The weather has gradually become hot these past few days. Although the authorities in charge are actively working on public health, such as epidemic prevention and sanitation, given the vastness of Shanghai's area, the density of its population, and the decline in the economic strength of the general public, maintaining public health and well-being still depends on the individual attention of citizens.

First of all, in terms of diet, due to the soaring prices recently, there have been extremely unhygienic phenomena in the market. (1) Families with relatively ample economic means are desperately hoarding rice, flour, grains, and other foods. After this year's particularly long rainy season, most have become infested with insects and have changed in quality. (2) Middle and lower-class restaurants, greedy for cheap prices and profits, not only hoard food but also use inferior and stale goods, showing no regard for the health of their customers. (3) Middle and lower-class families, given the high prices, indiscriminately eat coarse and spoiled food, knowingly consuming fermented stale food and food infested with flies, and are unwilling to discard it. This phenomenon not only affects individual health but also greatly harms public health. On the one hand, we hope that the authorities will strictly inspect the hygiene conditions of all restaurants and cold drink and food stalls. On the other hand, we urge citizens to advise each other that the harm of indiscriminate eating is greater than starvation, and to be especially vigilant about outside food and cold food. Refusing meat and fishy foods and cold foods, and not hoarding food, are of great benefit to frugality and the national economy.

The housing of the general population in this city is already overcrowded, and private and public hygiene are in a state of neglect. The purpose of ordinary sub-landlords is only to collect more rent, and they do not fulfill their responsibilities for household hygiene at all. Ordinary tenants, either due to ignorance or lack of cooperation, take no responsibility for the cleanliness and hygiene of the same house, the same alley, or the same street. The pigeonhole-like rooms, the disorderly disposal of filth, the foul smell, and the swarms of bedbugs, mosquitoes, and flies have become a widespread phenomenon. In some quieter places, excrement from people and animals is visible everywhere on the main roads. As for spitting everywhere, it has returned to its old state. As a result, public health is greatly affected. We hope that baojia and self-defense corps will come out to guide and advise, and we also hope that each head of household and tenant will spontaneously organize hygiene inspections, cooperate and help each other, and launch a clean and hygienic movement.

In addition to active epidemic prevention and sanitation campaigns, we cannot help but express our greatest regret over certain phenomena in this city. The first is the trend of hoarding medicines, regardless of the nature and efficacy of the medicines, simply hoarding them and selling them at inflated prices. Often, very ordinary medicines are priced like gold, even creating a shortage in the market. Some medicines, due to the expiration of their effectiveness, are still useless for treatment even when bought at high prices, and there are also instances of shoddy workmanship and counterfeiting of medicines. The threat to the health of citizens is greater than this. The second is the high medical fees charged by some hospitals and a few doctors, which often exceed the general price level. This is not a problem for the rich, but it is unbearable for the general public, so that the number of people who dare not seek medical attention when they are sick is increasing day by day. As for the perfunctory and negligent attitude of some doctors in diagnosing and caring for ordinary patients, and the free practice of medicine by a few doctors with no knowledge or experience, it is an even more dangerous phenomenon today. For all these, in addition to hoping for the proper handling of the relevant authorities, we earnestly hope that all colleagues will conduct self-examination and that the general public will boldly report them.

### Full Text of Speeches by Chinese and French Representatives

The Shanghai French Concession was returned to our country, and the signing ceremony of the agreement was held in Nanjing on the morning of the 22nd. The following is the text of the speech by Consul Bosson of France and the reply by Foreign Minister Chu of our country:

Foreign Minister Chu's Reply

It is a great honor for me to be the chairman of the signing ceremony of the agreement on the return of the Shanghai French Concession today. Although France is in a difficult period, it resolutely implemented the declaration of February 23 this year at the earliest possible time, and successively returned the administrative rights of the Beijing Dongjiaominxiang Legation Quarter, the Gulangyu International Settlement, and the French Concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Now, the agreement on the return of the administrative organs of the Shanghai French Concession has been signed. We are sincerely grateful for this wise measure and expression of friendship. From the beginning of this negotiation, the representatives of both sides had mutual understanding and a spirit of peace, so there were no major difficulties in the negotiation process, and they were able to smoothly complete their mission. I respectfully express my admiration on behalf of the government. Regarding the Shanghai French Concession, which is about to be returned, the Chinese government will develop it into a city that is envied by the world. Under the new system, the French people do not have to worry about their future, and they will continue to be protected by us, so that the inherent friendship between China and France will not be affected. As for charitable and cultural undertakings in the concession, we will also try to develop them more and more, and the subsidies will continue to be maintained, because these undertakings are of great benefit to the communication and closeness of Chinese and French cultures. Finally, I firmly believe that the agreement signed today will be the cornerstone of our future relations and will enhance the inherent friendship between China and France.

Consul Bosson's Speech

One of the most important points of the French government's declaration of February 23, 1943, has been implemented through the agreement signed just now. The French authorities are now returning the administrative rights of the Shanghai French Concession, which has a history of nearly a hundred years, to China, and are confident that this valuable measure will be recognized and valued by China. The Shanghai Municipality and the vast area of the French Concession are of great importance in the history of the increasingly close and prosperous relations between China and other countries in the world. For a hundred years, this has been a major commercial port, a hub of commerce and finance, which has enabled China to occupy a significant position in the world economy. France dares not boast that it has done its best to help build this great city, but on the occasion of returning the administrative rights it has long assumed, it is fortunate to be able to transfer the great buildings and the model equipment and organization that can be compared to modern cities to China free of charge. We are confident that under the new system of management in Shanghai, the cooperative enterprises established in the French Concession will be able to take into account the common interests of the people of both countries. The representatives of the two countries conducted various negotiations in a spirit full of friendship, and did not focus solely on economic or practical issues. The agreement of July 22, 1983, based on the importance of cultural and charitable undertakings, can further promote the cultural cooperation between the two countries, which has had a special nature for centuries up to the present day. What is even more important is that in this new era in history, China and France should take moral spirit as the first priority and maintain the customs and traditions that have contributed greatly to the evolution of civilization in the world, and the two sides should work together to transmit and restore the inherent glory in spirit, science, and knowledge in the future. I would like to congratulate the future of the two countries with this belief, and I firmly believe that the Sino-French cooperative undertaking presided over by Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Chu Minyi will become more and more prosperous, and I wish the friendship between China and France will become more and more consolidated.

### English Literature and the Rise and Fall of England - Three

— A Dandy Ruskin

There is another person worth remembering in the Victorian era, and that is Ruskin. Ruskin was most influenced by Carlyle, and even if someone said that he was Carlyle's disciple, he would not express dissatisfaction. However, he had his own unique position. He was the only son of a wine merchant in London, loved by his parents beyond measure, a so-called dandy. The temperament of a dandy did not change until he died at the age of eighty-odd. He was known to the world as a critic of painting. Part of his great work "Modern Painters" was written during his time at Oxford University, which shows that he was precocious.

Compared to Carlyle, he has extremely fine senses of beauty. He looks at wildflowers and clouds as the infinite beauty of the universe. He advocates that truth, goodness, and beauty must be combined to be called beauty. The beauty he speaks of contains goodness, goodness contains truth, and truth contains beauty. These truths, goodness, and beauty are consistent for him, and he often summarizes them as beauty. Therefore, he does not want to satisfy himself with a virtuous life alone, but also takes care of others. Here, although he greatly opposes socialism, he also considers himself a friend of the workers. He personally built St. George's Hall, established a hall for the workers, and personally gave lectures. This shows one aspect of him.

He is not satisfied with the criticism of painters such as Daye, and he goes on to establish his personal economics. He went to Manchester, which has been the stronghold of liberal economics since Adam Smith, to lecture on his economic theories. His economic theories can be summarized in one sentence: using mutual labor and cooperation to replace the free competition of liberal economists. He advocates that, like Mencius, the state should have the obligation to support the elderly, nurture orphans without protection, and subsidize the poor. He opposes head-on the laissez-faireism that has swept England since the early 19th century. His theories are naturally unacceptable at that time. However, he calmly and quietly does what he believes in. He often leads Oxford students to personally repair the roads of Oxford. He also donates the treasures he has collected to the establishment of the Oxford Museum. He does not like to use steam power. For example, for his works, he wants his disciples to establish a publishing house and complete everything manually. In short, his articles have a unique sense of humor, and his literary grace is like a spring gushing out endlessly.

### Further Remarks on English Tragedy - Four

— ——Tokutomi Roka

Although he was such a person, he failed in love throughout his life. In that aspect, he was a complete bankrupt. First, he invited Millais, the painter who portrayed Ai Li's portrait, to his villa. When the painting was about to be completed, Ruskin's wife and Millais had already fallen in love. The wife sued Ruskin for abuse in court. Ruskin did not make any defense, so the woman left Ruskin and became Mrs. Millais. The model in Millais' famous works was often depicted according to that woman. Near the end of his life, he fell in love with a certain young girl again. The girl was also quite interested in him, but the woman refused to talk about marriage because of the difference in religious beliefs. What Ruskin believed in was not the same as what the woman believed in.

Thus, Ruskin lived a very lonely life. However, the British people had opinions about him that were not very approving, but many people also sympathized with and respected him. Ruskin is a little more feminine than Carlyle, but he is also a hot-blooded man, and he uses radical words to criticize opponents. Therefore, Whistler, the American painter who skillfully applied the design of Japanese prints, sued Ruskin for criticism that damaged his reputation. This judgment caused a stir in the world, and Ruskin's sympathizers donated all the expenses. Ruskin was sentenced to pay a penny in damages. Thus, Whistler left a laughing stock in the world.

The Romantic Dandy Oscar Wilde

The above is about the early Victorian period. In the later period, as mentioned above, such people almost disappeared. Naturally, there were so-called masters such as Meredith and Hardy. However, they were relics of the past, and there was someone else who dominated the atmosphere of the time. From the mid-Victorian era to the late Victorian era, it was like Gulliver's Travels, from the land of giants to the land of little people. Here, only Oscar Wilde obscured the true direction of the beautiful life. Wilde eliminated Ruskin's truth and goodness and inherited the mantle of beauty. He opened up a path on his own. Reading his works, witty remarks come out of his mouth, which are full of interest. But in short, he is the leader of the frivolous dandies. It can be said that he promoted the decadent atmosphere at that time, and he is also its representative. He was imprisoned for homosexual impropriety, his reputation was temporarily lost, and few people cared about him. But can only he be blamed? The people who allowed him to spread his wings should also share the responsibility. When Wilde was regarded as a sinner and buried his life, most people pretended not to know. This is so-called English hypocrisy. (End of Chapter Two) (Xiang: Translated from Mainichi Shimbun)

### France Returns Shanghai French Concession: Foreign Minister Chu's Statement

Following the completion of the signing ceremony for the agreement on the return of the Shanghai French Concession to China, Foreign Minister Chu issued the following statement:

Since the National Government joined the war, our friendly nation, Japan, first demonstrated a spirit of righteousness by declaring the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions. This sincere expression deeply moved all of our people.

Subsequently, France also voluntarily followed the example of our friendly nation, Japan. On February 23rd of this year, it declared the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. On March 29th of this year, it exchanged notes with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the relinquishment of administrative power within the Beijing Legation Quarter. On April 8th of this year, it further exchanged notes regarding the relinquishment of administrative power within the Kulangsu International Settlement. On May 18th of this year, it signed an agreement on the detailed implementation of the return of administrative power over the French concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Thus, all French concessions in China, except for Shanghai, have already been returned. At the beginning of this month, I met with the French Ambassador to China in Shanghai for preliminary discussions on the return of the Shanghai French Concession. On the 12th of this month, the French delegation came to Nanjing and consulted with the members of our Receiving Committee regarding the detailed implementation agreement. After several rounds of negotiations, opinions converged. Today, representatives from both sides have formally

signed the agreement,

stipulating that the handover ceremony will be held on the 30th of this month. From then on, all French concessions in China will be completely returned to our government and people. We are deeply grateful for France's wise and friendly measures, and we will never forget our friendly nation, Japan, for initiating this righteous act and providing strong mediation this time. Shanghai is the economic hub of our country and a major commercial port in East Asia. The importance of its position is self-evident. The fact that the administrative power of the French Concession and the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement are being returned within the same week will once and for all eliminate the abnormal system of local administration in Shanghai that has existed for a century. Its impact on international perception is significant, and its contribution to the restoration of our sovereignty is enormous. The formation of concessions was due to the unequal treaties that existed for many years. The teachings of our Founding Father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, emphasized the abolition of unequal treaties. Our entire nation has been

longing and yearning

for this for decades. Now, thanks to the spirit of our Founding Father in heaven and the arduous struggle of our supreme leader, Chairman Wang Jingwei, with his noble character, we have been able to inspire the sympathy of friendly nations and achieve the great cause of revival. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, I am deeply honored to have participated in this event. During the negotiation process, the representatives of China and France engaged in discussions with mutual understanding and a sincere attitude, resulting in the smooth completion of their mission today. I am deeply impressed by this and anticipate that the friendly relations between China and France will be further enhanced in the future.

I hereby reply accordingly for your reference.

### Observations from Tokyo Political Circles on the Scheduled Return of the French Concession

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to observers in Tokyo's political circles, the return of the Shanghai French Concession by France indicates that the Japanese government earnestly hopes that China can achieve autonomy and complete integrity. Therefore, after the previous return of the exclusive concessions, it signed an agreement with the National Government on June 30th regarding the return of administrative power over the Shanghai International Settlement, which is scheduled to be implemented on August 1st. The Japanese government's fundamental administrative policy for Greater East Asia is based entirely on righteousness, and it sincerely hopes that all countries concerned with China will also adopt the same attitude as Japan. In particular, the date of implementation of the return of the Shanghai French Concession, which is the same as the Shanghai International Settlement, is highly anticipated by all parties. Now that China and France have signed an agreement in Nanjing today regarding the return of the Shanghai French Concession, and it will be implemented two days earlier than the International Settlement, it can be said that China's century-long aspiration for self-reliance and independence since the Opium War has been realized. The rapid development of the National Government's politics and economy in the future is deeply anticipated. From Japan's perspective, it is deeply fortunate for China. It is natural for the French government to take the same measures as Japan in terms of friendly relations between Japan and France. The resolute attitude of the French government in resolutely implementing the return of the Shanghai French Concession under these complex international circumstances is truly commendable. All of this has a great impact on the promotion of the construction of Greater East Asia and on all countries in the world, including the enemy, Britain and the United States.

### Elite German Troops Arrive in Sicily for Reinforcement: Central Region Adopts Flexible Defense Tactics: No Change in the Situation in Catania

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Algiers: The headquarters of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa issued a communique on the 21st, stating that elite German troops have successively arrived in Sicily for reinforcement.

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - After the Axis forces in Sicily severely damaged the U.S.-Canadian joint forces on the 20th, in order to avoid being surrounded by superior enemy forces, they have withdrawn from Enna and Caltanissetta in the central part of the island. There is no significant change in the situation in the Catania lowlands in the east. On the 21st, the German authorities expressed their views on the situation on the island as follows: The most noteworthy aspect of the current situation in Sicily is the increased resistance of the Axis forces in the eastern coastal area. The British Eighth Army, with its powerful tanks and infantry units, under the cover of naval artillery fire, is attempting to advance forcefully, but its advance has been completely blocked by the Axis forces. The fighting in the eastern coastal area has entered a stalemate. In contrast, the fighting in the central and western regions has made considerable progress due to the flexible defense tactics adopted by the Axis forces. The Axis air force is also active in the eastern and southern regions of Sicily, cooperating with ground forces in the fighting in the Caltanissetta and Enna regions, carrying out low-altitude bombing and inflicting heavy damage on the U.S. mechanized supply units. They also bombed British positions in the Licata area and shot down five Spitfire enemy aircraft in the Catania lowlands, strafing the U.S.-Canadian joint forces with machine guns.

Heavy Air Raid on Malta

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Major Freytag, Air Defense Officer of the German News Agency, stated: On the night before July 20th, a group of Axis bombers raided Valetta Harbor on the island of Malta, which is the main base for British and American operations in Sicily. Axis reconnaissance aircraft confirmed that the entire port area, especially the port itself, suffered significant damage. According to reconnaissance aircraft reports, two freighters totaling 18,000 tons were sunk, with only the masts remaining. Two other merchant ships totaling 15,000 tons were severely damaged by explosions and fire. A 5,000-ton ship was severely damaged on one side and caught fire, and its loss is almost certain. In addition, four merchant ships and transport ships totaling 21,000 tons were hit in many places and injured. The fires on each of these ships continued to spread for several hours after the attack. Although the enemy's fighter and anti-aircraft defenses were strong, the Axis forces lost only one aircraft, and the rest returned to their base.

### Soviet Troops Land in Norway Without Success

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Haishentong Agency, news from here last night: The Soviet troops on Vardo Island attempted to land in Norway with 40 to 60 ships. On the night of the 19th, the Soviet troops took advantage of the dense fog and planned to land in Vadsø Bay, Norway, from Vadsø and Nyborg. However, they were discovered in time by the German troops along the coast. The landing ships were protected by light warships. When they were within the range of the German artillery, the German artillery opened fire, and at least ten Soviet ships were sunk and many were injured.

### Situation on the Eastern Front

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - Colonel Hama, military correspondent for the German News Agency, stated: In the great defensive battle on the Eastern Front, the Orel region is gradually becoming the central point. Although the Soviet troops have added strong units to the fighting in the central part of the Mius and Donets, it is clear that the Soviet troops want to complete the decisive battle of their summer offensive in the Orel region. The original plan of the Soviet telegram must have been more ambitious. The enemy planned to advance northwest from Kursk in an attempt to threaten the entire central front of the German army. However, the counterattack launched by the German army on July 5th resulted in the annihilation of three Soviet divisions, causing the Soviet army's plan to fail completely, and forcing the military actions of the Soviet army to be limited to the Orel region. The Soviet army concentrated its tank reserves and heavy weapons in this area in an attempt to break through the German line at any cost and regardless of any losses. Within the area where a German infantry division was stationed, it was possible to see no less than three battalions of Soviet tanks. These tanks had just arrived a few days ago and bombarded the German line all day from morning to night on Tuesday. On Tuesday, the Soviet army lost 133 tanks in this area. Although the Soviet army suffered heavy losses, the result was only to create a few local indentations in the German line, and these indentations were soon filled by local German reserves, cutting off Soviet communications and making it impossible for them to carry out operations with a large number of troops.

### Comprehensive War Results of the Japanese Army in the Solomon Islands: New Georgia and Other Islands Repeatedly Attacked by Air

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to the announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters, the comprehensive war results obtained by the Japanese army in the Solomon Islands from the landing of the U.S. troops on Rendova Island on June 30th to July 20th are as follows: Sunk and bombed enemy cruisers, 5; large destroyers, 5; destroyers, 1; special service ships, 1; ship type unknown, 2; transport ships, 8; torpedo boats, 1. Damaged cruisers, 1; destroyers, 1; transport ships, 4; torpedo boats, 1. One cruiser was hit and caught fire. Shot down more than 265 enemy aircraft. Japanese losses were 66 aircraft.

Shaonan, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese naval air force in the Solomon Islands area attacked the enemy's positions in Rice Bay north of Munda on New Georgia Island and the Bairoko area, and the enemy at Rubiana Island, Guadalcanal Island and other places on the night of July 19th, inflicting great damage on the enemy.

### Recent Situation of Naval Battles in the South Pacific

At the last meeting on the 16th of the Japan Central Cooperation Conference, Lieutenant Commander Tashiro, a reporter from the Japanese Navy, gave a detailed explanation of the recent situation of naval battles in the South Pacific. The following is the full text of the joint speech:

Fierce Enemy Counterattack

Since the beginning of June, the battle situation in the Solomon Islands area has entered the stage of air force decisive battle. Our air force has been carrying out air force annihilation battles against the enemy's air bases on Guadalcanal, Russell Island, and other places from time to time, bombing air bases and blocking their transportation. The number of enemy aircraft coming to attack has also become more intense, averaging 70 to 80 aircraft per day, and increasing to about 100 aircraft per day in the middle and late parts of June. Our land forces have inflicted heavy losses on each decisive battle. However, the enemy disregards everything and constantly replenishes, launching fierce counterattacks. Although the enemy's counterattacks have suffered huge sacrifices and heavy losses, they continue unabated, indicating that the enemy's attempt is by no means temporary, but rather a very determined offensive. Therefore, the air battles in June were particularly fierce. On June 30th, the enemy's air force, cruisers, destroyers, and a dozen or so merchant ships, maritime cargo carriers, and a powerful division composed of landing craft suddenly appeared in the area of Tutuba Island, and began landing on that island.

Heroic Human Bullet Warfare

Here we will briefly describe the battle situation centered on New Georgia Island: Geographically speaking, the distance between our base Rabaul and the enemy's base Guadalcanal is about 600 miles, with Bougainville Island in the middle. Between this island and Guadalcanal is New Georgia Island. In terms of shape, New Georgia Island is like a gourd shape, with the head in the northwest and Munda below the head. Seven to fifteen nautical miles from the location of the head is a lotus leaf-shaped island called Kolombangara Island. The sea surface five nautical miles from the bottom of the gourd head is the Rentaba Island, which resembles the head of a wild goose. Between Rentaba Island and Munda on New Georgia Island is Robiana Island. The fierce battle is currently centered on this area.

After learning that the enemy had landed there, the naval air force immediately launched a fierce attack on them, sinking and destroying six transport ships, three cruisers, and one destroyer, and shooting down more than 77 enemy aircraft. 31 of our aircraft did not return in this air battle. In the great naval battle in the South Pacific since the first Solomon Sea battle, 40 aircraft did not return. This was the second major sacrifice. We can easily imagine the fierce battle situation in which the air force attacked with human bullets.

Brave Battle of Seaplanes

From July 1st to 2nd, the enemy gradually appeared from Rentaba Island to New Georgia Island. On the 3rd and 4th, they reappeared at Robiana Island. On July 7th, part of the enemy landed on the south side of Munda. The results of our attacks on this have been announced each time. Among them, what I want to particularly mention is that even our seaplanes broke through the enemy's lines and attacked the enemy's positions or the anchorage of the destroyer fleet, or the patrol area of the enemy's boats, and achieved results. The speed of the seaplanes is slow and their performance is inferior to that of the enemy's P38 fighter planes. Therefore, whenever they are pursued and attacked by enemy aircraft, they often turn around and attack and shoot them down. The enemy is now extremely afraid of seaplanes.

Great Achievements of the Mine Warfare Squadron

The miracle of the destroyer attacking the cruiser has fully demonstrated its fighting spirit in the Battle of Bali Island. On the 12th, the enemy's cover force, which attempted to land in that area, consisted of more than ten cruisers and transport ships. It fought with our mine warfare squadron and sank two enemy cruisers, one of which caught fire. Our side also had one cruiser severely damaged in this battle. This was the night battle of Kolombangara Island on the 12th. On the 14th, the enemy advanced towards Munda from both the north and south sides at the same time. Our troops immediately launched a fierce counterattack. On the morning of the 14th, they defeated the enemy forces that had released smoke screens on the eastern coast of Munda and came to attack. A fierce battle is currently underway. The enemy's counterattack attempt is indeed quite strong. We are prepared to lure the enemy who landed on the eastern side of Munda deep into the area and strike them, in order to crush the enemy's large-scale counterattack attempt and make the battle situation favorable.

The Hongkou Navy Garrison Area has been decided by the district chiefs' meeting to start district injections from the 26th of this month. The methods are exactly the same as in the first phase. The disease prevention certificates from the first phase in April will be invalidated and must be reinjected to maintain public health within the area.

### First Day of Air Defense Training Yesterday: Comprehensive Training Today: Residents Should Pay Attention to Signals and Not Cool Off Outdoors: Pedestrians Should Stay Close to Walls or Buildings When Hearing an Alarm

After the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters stipulated yesterday and today as the dates for civil air defense training, the city's Baojia authorities have been actively preparing various air defense measures. Yesterday (22nd), after issuing a warning alarm at 5:00 AM, the Baojia districts' self-defense corps, fire brigades, lighting brigades, lookout teams, rescue teams, traffic control teams, and others all mobilized and patrolled their respective Baojia districts. Warning ropes were laid along the route, vehicles stopped driving, and two aircraft soared into the sky, simulating enemy aircraft attacks. The sound of anti-aircraft guns rumbled, shaking all of Shanghai, and the performance was quite realistic. It was lifted at 10:30 AM, but the warning alarm was still in effect. The second air raid alarm was issued at 2:00 PM and lifted at 3:15 PM. The third air raid alarm was issued at around 9:00 PM and lifted at around 11:00 PM. At the same time, a blackout was held. Comprehensive training will still be carried out today.

No Loitering Outside to Cool Off

The authorities concerned sincerely hope that the public can pay close attention to various signals. Given that during the summer season, residents generally have the habit of cooling off outside their doors, during the air defense period, residents should go indoors except when walking, and should not loiter on the roads to avoid obstruction. When pedestrians hear an alarm, they should try to get close to the road wall, or use buildings to shield their bodies, and then try to return home as quickly as possible.

Air Raid Alarm Iron Gates Closed

Since yesterday, after the air raid alarm was activated, the entire district of Nanshi was under the guidance of the Air Defense Command of the Municipal Police Bureau. All police officers and self-raising corps and Baojia personnel immediately launched air defense preparations. All traffic was cut off, and vehicles and pedestrians were all prohibited. The iron gates at the intersection of the Chinese and French borders were also closed. Only after the alarm was lifted did the self-defense corps hold an emergency meeting. Allied gendarmerie also attended, reviewing the preparedness measures. A blackout was implemented in the evening, and all civilian lights were covered. Police patrols and Baojia patrols were dispatched to patrol the entire district to prevent villains from taking advantage of the opportunity to act. At the same time, the Police Bureau's Inspection Department dispatched inspectors to be on duty at all times to ensure thoroughness.

Self-Defense Corps Members Serve All Night

During this training period, self-defense corps members in each district serve all night, that is, lookout teams, rescue teams, fire brigades, lighting brigades, etc., must also take shifts all night, serving in their respective Baojia offices and rescue stations. Liaison officers are always in contact with their respective police stations.

### Preventing the Encouragement of Speculation: Thorough Investigation of Bank and Trading House Loans, Special Attention to Large Overdrafts, and Reporting of Non-Members Engaging in Hoarding

Following the authorities' efforts to eliminate speculation and hoarding and suppress commodity prices, those who hoard major commodities will be severely punished in accordance with the "Punishment of Hoarding Commodities Statute." An investigation of the inventory in various banks, trading houses, and private warehouses has been completed, and the stored goods have been reviewed to determine whether there is any hoarding for profit, in order to impose penalties. To prevent the use of bank and trading house funds to fuel speculation and hoarding, a thorough investigation of the loan ledgers of various banks and trading houses has been conducted, focusing on loans secured by goods and large overdrafts. Non-members of trade associations who hoard major commodities for profit will be reported and prosecuted, and banks and trading houses that lend to those dealing in these commodities will also be sanctioned according to law. A Shanghai News Agency reporter learned yesterday from the banking and money industry that various banks and trading houses are deeply aware of this and are conducting strict reviews of loan requests from members of various trade associations, refusing loans that are deemed likely to fuel speculation and hoarding. The selection of collateral for loans is limited to items that do not violate current laws and regulations and do not encourage speculation and hoarding. Daily necessities such as grains and cotton yarn are generally no longer accepted as collateral. As for approved loans, they should be limited to borrowers who genuinely need them for their primary business. Factories applying for loans may be assisted as appropriate, depending on their production status. However, overdrafts and credit loans have been particularly tightened, and previous old loans that have expired will not be extended and will generally be recovered.

### Two Chinese Residents' Associations in the Inner Tax Areas to Dissolve; French Concession Taxpayers' Association to Meet Today to Discuss

The two Chinese residents' associations in the two concessions of this city have decided to dissolve themselves honorably, as the concessions of this city are about to be returned to our National Government, and the two associations are no longer needed. It is learned that the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association will hold a meeting today (23rd) at 5 p.m. to discuss the dissolution procedures. In addition to Chairman Xi Xiafeng, Vice Chairman Huang Xianggu, and all executive committee members, standing committee members, and all Chinese directors and commissioners of the French Municipal Council, representatives from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and the Ministry of Welfare's Shanghai Office will be invited to participate. It is also expected that the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession will convene a meeting within days to dissolve itself voluntarily.

### Japanese Residents' Toilet Soap to Be Rationed with Tickets

According to the Japanese-language Continental New Daily, the Japanese Embassy and Consulate General authorities and military distribution associations are actively preparing for the ticket rationing of toilet soap. It has been decided that the rationing will be implemented on the 26th of this month, with each person receiving one bar per month, priced at eight yuan. The designated distribution stores will be announced before the 24th.

### Fifth Round of Sugar Sales in the Urban Area to Begin on the 26th

The fifth round of sugar distribution based on population in the two special districts of the city has been widely implemented. The Municipal Food Bureau has also ordered the sugar merchants' cooperative business offices to distribute sugar in the urban area based on the actual population. It is learned that the Municipal Food Bureau has stipulated that sales will begin in the urban area from the 26th of this month to the 5th of next month. The quantity of sugar will remain at half a catty per person, and the price will not change.

### Reflections on the Recovery of the French Concession

— Xia Qifeng

Minister Xia Qifeng, a member of the Concession Recovery Committee, broadcast his reflections on the recovery of the concession at 9 p.m. yesterday (22nd). The full text of the recording is as follows:

Fellow compatriots:

Since our country joined the war on January 9th of this year, the friendly nation of Japan, in order to help our country restore its sovereignty, first signed an agreement with our country on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. On March 30th, the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, it returned all Japanese exclusive concessions in China. It also cooperated in mediating with various countries to smoothly recover the Beijing Legation Quarter and the Gulangyu Public Concession. This action by Japan, its vision of grandeur, the integrity of its ideals, the sincerity of its friendship, and the greatness of its courage, not only greatly inspires the Chinese people, who live and die together in the Greater East Asia War, but also inspires and admires the people within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and people around the world who advocate humanity and justice, and regards it as a model. Regarding this point, we can use France's actions as proof.

When France's national affairs were turbulent and the environment was tense, and a myriad of matters were awaiting resolution, it was still able to recognize the situation, overcome difficulties, and voluntarily declare on February 23rd of this year that it would return concessions in China and abolish extraterritorial rights. Subsequently, the governments of both countries consulted on the details of implementation, and on May 18th, they signed an agreement, and on June 5th, they implemented the return of the French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, Anqing East, and Shamian. At that time, I used the radio to report the progress to you. After this, France only had one concession in China, Shanghai, which had not yet been returned. The government and public opinion, up and down, expressed their hope that it would be returned early, along with other concessions. In fact, the authorities of the two countries never slackened in preparing to negotiate on this matter. The Shanghai French Concession in our country has a wider area and a more complex organization. All survey and management and other preparatory procedures require considerable time. In early this month, I met with French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, in Shanghai, along with Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and conducted preliminary consultations on the return of the Shanghai Concession, and formulated principles. On the 12th of this month, all French representatives arrived in Beijing, and the members of the Reception Committee conducted trade-offs and consulted day by day. The opinions of both parties converged, and today the agreement on the details of implementation has been signed, and the date for the return ceremony has been set. After this, all the French concessions in China will be completely returned, and once this ceremony is held, the task of the Reception Committee will be completed.

When this task is about to be completed, I feel that the repeated negotiations have been smooth and satisfactory, thanks to the French government's sincerity towards friendship and its clear judgment of events. At the same time, the French representatives have made beneficial trade-offs with a sincere attitude. We are deeply grateful to them. In addition, our friendly country, Japan, has consistently mediated and generously helped us, and we are sincerely grateful.

Shanghai is the economic hub of our country and a major commercial port in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Its importance is self-evident. For a century, British and American imperialism, based on the Shanghai concessions, infringed on our country's sovereignty and hindered our country's development. Economically, they exploited us, and culturally, they indulged in麻醉. Our people were heartbroken and wanted to take it back for a long time. Because the forces of Britain and the United States were entrenched in it, it was difficult to realize. Fortunately, our friendly country, Japan, launched the Greater East Asia War, fundamentally eliminating the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia, enabling all ethnic groups in East Asia to gain freedom and liberation. Our Supreme Commander Wang Zhaoming complied with public opinion, realized the opportunity, and resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States. Therefore, our country became one of the countries participating in the Greater East Asia War, and our friendly country, Japan, warmly assisted in restoring the integrity of our territory and sovereignty, and removing the amulet of aggression and麻醉. Other friendly countries also闻风而起 and followed suit. Thus, the late Father of the Nation's legacy of abolishing unequal treaties and the enthusiastic expectations of the people of the whole country for many years have all been realized one by one.

When we try to trace the evolution of the above-mentioned facts, we will know that when we are rejoicing and grateful for the return of the integrity of our territory and sovereignty, we must not stop at rejoicing and gratitude. From now on, we should more服齐 the legacy of the Father of the Nation and the major policies and guidelines indicated by the Supreme Leader Wang Zhaoming, support Leader Wang in leading the people of the whole country and the friendly nation of Japan to work together and bravely move forward, so as to express our ambition to participate in the Greater East Asia War, implement the purpose of the Greater East Asia War, and hopefully the great cause of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be completed early, so that China can be restored to its former glory. Finally克遂

The colleagues of the Reception Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the government, are about to complete the handling of this matter, and I am sincerely happy. The labor of writing and speaking is not enough to count. On the day when the agreement is signed, I will report the process and the feelings to the compatriots of the whole country.

### Nanjing Road Fang Jiuxia Robbery Case: Remarks by the Police Superintendent; Heartbreaking That Police Officers Killed People; Respect and Condolences Expressed for the Spirit of Sacrifice of the Self-Defense Force

Police Superintendent Watanabe, the police superintendent of the Public Concession, made the following remarks yesterday regarding the robbery and injury case at Fang Jiuxia Silver Store on Nanjing Road on the 18th of this month:

Punishment According to Law for Murder

"At 0:30 p.m. on July 18th, a shooting murder incident occurred near Fujian Road, within the jurisdiction of the Laozha Police Station. The arrested offender was identified as a Chinese police officer in plainclothes. This fact is extremely regrettable. The authorities have not only immediately dismissed him, but also filed a lawsuit. After further careful investigation, we have some clues. He has been sent to the Special Court today (23rd) for trial on charges of robbery and murder, and will be punished according to Chinese law. It is heartbreaking that there are such illegal offenders among the police officers, resulting in the death of one police officer and two members of the Self-Defense Force. In view of the occurrence of this incident, we are determined to strengthen discipline and live up to the expectations of society.

Promoting the Spirit of Self-Defense and Martyrdom

When the offender was arrested, the bravery of the Indian police officers was undeniable. The head of the Self-Defense Force, Mr. Shen Heqing, and the members of the Self-Defense Force, Mr. Jiang _, stepped forward bravely and fulfilled their mission. Their outstanding sense of responsibility and lofty spirit of sacrifice can be said to be the true essence of China's Baojia Self-Defense. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Baojia Self-Defense Force education, which has been cultivated with the spirit of sharing weal and woe, has blossomed and borne fruit today.

Sincerely Expressing Condolences for Lofty Sacrifices

We sincerely express our condolences for the lofty sacrifices of the martyrs. In the future, we will reward their merits in accordance with the regulations, so as to commemorate their immortality. We hope that the members of the Self-Defense Force will further consolidate unity to ensure public security and achieve the purpose of self-defense, and that is my prayer."

Funeral Arrangements for Martyred Self-Defense Personnel

Regarding the funeral arrangements for the martyred Self-Defense Force members Shen Heqing and Jiang _, the Baojia Association of the Laozha District Police Station has arranged the following yesterday: (1) The funeral procession will depart from the funeral home with the coffin, pass through the designated route, and then return to the funeral home to disperse.

### A Word for Students Seeking Assistance: Learning Should Be Practical, Not Vain; Business Students Are Not Proficient Enough in Arithmetic; It Is a Pity That Female Students Do Not Learn Home Economics

Our newspaper's student aid campaign received a letter from China Xingren Enterprise Company yesterday, stating that on the occasion of Chairman Xiao Xiling's 51st birthday last month, friends sent congratulatory gifts. Xiao insisted on refusing them, and donated a portion of the congratulatory money, 5,000 yuan, to our newspaper for student aid. Mr. Shao Jigao of Zhongfu Bank also contributed his opinions in addition to donating 500 yuan, saying that there are still few schools that emphasize practical knowledge. Business students are not proficient in abacus and handwriting is too bad, especially women's schools often lack cooking and embroidery, which is a pity. Mr. Xu Zhongyong also wrote a letter stating that he is more than willing but unable to help students. He was very grateful to Mr. Han Yiqun of Ruixin Cotton Cloth Company for soliciting 2,000 yuan for student aid.

Fan Association Student Aid: Mr. Yan Zhushi has been studying seal script for nearly ten years and has a deep foundation. Recently, in response to our newspaper's student aid campaign, he is willing to work hard, writing fans and four-foot couplets, charging 50 yuan per piece. After deducting 20 yuan for paper and ink expenses (fan and rice paper are not charged separately, and 10 yuan is added for the paper for five-foot couplets), the remaining 30 yuan will be used for the newspaper's student aid. The items should be sent to Yan Zhushi, Window No. 5, 2nd Floor, Shanghai Postal Administration, Sichuan Road Bridge (time: 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.). The couplet styles are displayed at the Shanghai Painting Hall at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Ningbo Road.

Student Aid Received Yesterday: The following is a list of the student aid received by our newspaper yesterday: Chairman Xiao Xiling of China Xingren Enterprise Company, 5,000 yuan (friendly birthday gifts); Lay Buddhist Huicheng (brought by Mr. Zhao Puchu), 3,000 yuan; Mrs. Xue (moved from birthday gifts), 2,000 yuan; Colleagues of the General Office of the China Cloth Industry Bank, 2,000 yuan; Yifu, 2,000 yuan; Han Yiqun of Ruixin Cotton Cloth Company (solicited by Mr. Xu Zhongyong), 2,000 yuan; Yutai Zhengji Hardware Store, 1,000 yuan; Xi Caiquan and Shao Quan, 500 yuan each; Zhou Xiuju, Xiuyue, and Xiuzhi combined, 200 yuan; Chen Yueqin, 100 yuan; Pan Shixian and Ruibao combined, 100 yuan; totaling 18,400 yuan in reserve notes, with a balance of 1,167,308 yuan.

### Cigarette Distribution to Be Based on New Grades

The Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association will divide the cigarette shops in the city into four grades: A, B, C, and D, with a distribution ratio of 8:4:2:1. The association, in view of the fact that some tobacco shops with insufficient capital and small scale obtain A and B cards through illegal means, which is unfair if the goods are distributed accordingly, sent personnel to conduct on-site investigations of various tobacco shops to adjust the grades. It is found that there are 6,000 tobacco shops in the city, and the investigation of 2,400 tobacco shops was completed in June. The remaining 3,600 tobacco shops have also been investigated within this month. Most of the grade adjustment work has been completed. The distribution of cigarettes from August onwards will be based entirely on the new grades.

### New Licenses for Chartered Vehicles to Be Reissued on a Regular Basis; Approved Numbers to Be Burned to Prevent Theft

The Municipal Council Information Office announced that private rickshaw owners who wish to apply for licenses for the second half of this year must send their vehicles to the Vehicle Inspection Office of the Police Department for inspection and have the "approved number" matching the license plate number burned on them. This procedure is the same as the bicycle licensing method to prevent the theft of private rickshaws.

Strictly Observe Vehicle Inspection Dates

Private rickshaws parked overnight in the area south of Suzhou Creek should obtain license application forms from the Vehicle Inspection Office at 557 Gordon Road. Private rickshaws parked overnight in the area north of Suzhou Creek should obtain these application forms from the Vehicle Inspection Office at 612 Fair Road. The dates for obtaining the application forms are set from July 26th to July 31st, from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. each day. All vehicle owners must strictly observe the dates, times, and locations for vehicle inspection specified in the application form in order to reduce inconvenience and delays. Those who fail to send their vehicles for inspection at the specified dates and times will be fined a special registration fee of 10 yuan.

Bring Citizen Certificate for Inspection

In addition, the following important regulations should also be noted: (1) When applying for a license at the Vehicle Inspection Office, applicants should bring their citizen certificates for inspection. If it is a company or factory, the citizen certificate number of the representative should be filled in the application form, and the citizen certificate should be presented for inspection when receiving the license. (2) If the address of the owner of a registered vehicle changes from one administrative region to another, a transfer certificate should be obtained from the issuing agency so as to apply for a new license from the administrative region to which the owner has moved and have a new approved number burned on the vehicle. The same procedure should be followed if a vehicle owner intends to transfer the vehicle to a resident living in another administrative region. If a vehicle owner is unable to personally collect the license from the Vehicle Inspection Office due to special circumstances, a representative may be sent to collect the license on his/her behalf, but the representative should bring the vehicle owner's citizen certificate for inspection.

### No Change in Flour Rationing

Recently, wheat from various areas has been arriving in Shanghai one after another. Sino-Japanese flour mills in the city are about to start production. The planned flour production in Central China this year is 10 million bags, and the estimated annual consumption in the Shanghai area is 4 million bags. After being produced by the flour mills in the city, they will be handed over to the Business Statistics Association for supply. The rationing system is unlikely to change.

### My Opinion on the Student Aid Campaign

— Wang Haibo

Our newspaper has recently received letters from all walks of life expressing their opinions on student aid, which shows their concern. We are publishing them to show our respect.

The newspaper has been organizing student aid for four sessions to help out-of-school youth obtain opportunities to continue their studies. The past achievements have won the praise of society. This is the beginning of the fifth student aid campaign, and it is expected that this year's harvest will exceed the past. The student aid campaign is a most meaningful work. Every youth hopes to study for a few more years and gain more knowledge in preparation for entering society in the future. However, with the current high cost of living, it is difficult for parents to cope with the daily necessities, let alone spend a considerable amount of tuition fees. It is heartbreaking that the issue of tuition fees limits the youth's pursuit of education. Moreover, there are often many outstanding talents among poor children, and there are many so-called promising talents, but social conditions force the poor to sigh with regret about seeking education. It is even more heartbreaking. Some people say, can't schools universally establish free or reduced-fee places? But one must also think for the schools. Schools are not for-profit organizations. Whether public or private, they all have budgets, and teachers are already very poor. If the majority of students have to be free or reduced-fee, how can the school's funding be injected, and wouldn't the teachers' lives become a problem again? The so-called "saving the frog but starving the snake" is not a win-win solution. Therefore, the advantage of the student aid campaign is that it can not only benefit poor children, saving them from the pain of dropping out of school, but also prevent the schools from being economically affected. It takes care of both sides and is a win-win situation, which is worthy of praise. We have unlimited sympathy and hope that people from all walks of life in the community will unite and actively donate to help them succeed. More student aid means more talent cultivated, which is of great benefit to the country and society.

Economic Commentary

### Thrift in Shanghai!

Thrift in Shanghai is most urgent because Shanghai is the distribution hub for the entire nation's supplies. If Shanghai can cut back on consumption, then the entire country can save over half of its resources. However, thrift is also most difficult in Shanghai because Shanghai has become accustomed to the bad habits of Europe and America, with their emphasis on extravagance. This has taken deep root. Adding to this the speculators, who have no sense that "money doesn't come easily" and "material resources are scarce," they all adopt the "live for today" approach. They become wealthy overnight and treat money carelessly, like dirt. The extravagant social atmosphere has only become more and more outrageous!

Therefore, we believe that the practice of the thrift movement must begin with the kind of people mentioned above, because every one of them stands in opposition to thrift. At the very least, we must advise them on one point: even if they cannot achieve our ideal level of consumption thrift, they must still save a portion, even a small portion, of their consumption and use it for acts of generosity and public assistance, or to donate to the poor and needy, or to aid the elderly and weak. This would still be somewhat satisfactory.

### Explanation of Qualification Registration Procedures for Wheat Merchants in Various Regions; Unregistered Merchants May Not Participate in Buying and Selling

The National Trade Control Council, following the Executive Yuan's approved plan for centralized wheat purchasing, is handling the yellow form and buying and selling registration for members of the Chinese Grain Trade Association and the Japanese Flour Milling Trade Association's members. The original intent was to unify the purchasing steps to prevent malpractices. Any wheat merchants who have not participated in qualification registration may not participate in buying and selling. Our reporter has investigated the explanation of the registration procedures for wheat merchants, recorded as follows:

Wheat Firms in Centralized Areas: (1) All members of the local Grain Trade Association who engage in the wheat business must obtain certification from the local Grain Trade Association where the firm is located, and then register with the local branch office to obtain a Wheat Firm Registration Certificate for Centralized Areas and receive a Wheat Firm Buying and Selling Report Form for Centralized Areas. They must report the actual buying and selling situation to the branch office every day. (2) Wheat firms in centralized areas may also engage in sales businesses, but they must obtain sales qualification and follow all the procedures stipulated for sales businesses.

Sales Businesses: All members of the Grain Trade Association may become sales businesses, but they must obtain a Sales Business Registration Certificate from the branch office in the area of export. The procedures are as follows: (1) Those who go to other places for purchasing must obtain certification from the association where the firm is located, then register and obtain certification from the association in the purchasing area (export area), and then register and obtain certification from the branch office in the purchasing area. They must obtain a Sales Business Registration Certificate and a Sales Business Buying and Selling Report Form and report the actual buying and selling situation to the local branch office every day. (A sales business must obtain a registration certificate from each branch office in each area where they purchase). (2) Those located in the export area must obtain certification from the local association and register with the local branch office to obtain a Sales Business Wheat Buying and Selling Report Form and report the actual buying and selling situation to the local branch office every day. (3) Sales businesses may also operate as wheat firms in centralized areas, but those who also operate as such must obtain two types of qualification registration certificates. However, the deadline for qualification registration for wheat firms in centralized areas is fixed (July 20), while the deadline for qualification registration for sales businesses is not fixed. (4) Sales businesses must purchase wheat from qualified and registered wheat firms in centralized areas and may not directly purchase from rural areas or unregistered wheat firms.

Commissioned Businesses: (1) All members of the Grain Trade Association designated by flour mills and approved by the committee will be granted a Commissioned Business Certificate. (2) After obtaining the association's Commissioned Business Registration Certificate, if the commissioned business goes to various places to purchase wheat from wheat firms in centralized areas, they should take the above-mentioned registration certificate (or a photograph of the original certificate) to the Grain Trade Association in the purchasing area for certification, and then register with the local branch office to receive a Commissioned Business Wheat Purchase Report Form. They must report the actual purchase situation to the branch office every day. (3) Commissioned businesses may purchase wheat from wheat firms in centralized areas in various regions. Commissioned businesses may purchase wheat from sales businesses. For those transporting wheat into Shanghai, the commissioned business should apply for an entry permit on behalf of the applicant. (5) Commissioned businesses may also operate as sales businesses. Although there are no explicit provisions in the interim plan, wheat purchased by sales businesses can be sold to any commissioned business, while wheat purchased by commissioned businesses must be completely handed over to the commissioned flour mill and may not be resold to others. Therefore, in fact, commissioned businesses may not operate as sales businesses to avoid potential malpractices. (6) Commissioned businesses must purchase wheat from qualified and registered wheat firms in centralized areas or sales businesses and must not purchase from wheat merchants who have not obtained the above-mentioned qualification.

### Unified Purchase Price for Cotton

The Cotton Industry Special Committee has recently completed a centralized purchase plan for cotton and is actively purchasing it in various regions. The committee, noting the inconsistent pricing in various regions, which hinders the purchasing work, has carefully calculated the cost of each unit of cotton and set a unified price to ensure smooth purchasing. Furthermore, the cotton collected from various regions is uniformly centralized in public warehouses.

### Materials Adjustment Committee Holds Second Meeting

The Materials Investigation Committee, led by Chinese and Japanese investigators, dispatched all investigators last Tuesday to conduct zonal investigations of the materials stored in various warehouses and godowns. The initial work has been completed, and the materials resulting from all investigations have been roughly reviewed. The committee is now scheduled to hold its second committee meeting this afternoon (the 22nd) at 3:00 PM to discuss all important cases related to the investigation of materials. It is reported that after this meeting, the committee will conduct further expanded investigations to completely eliminate the hoarding situation in this city.

### Ninety-Five Banks in the City Increase Capital

The Ministry of Finance of the National Government previously instructed the Shanghai banking and money industries to increase their capital within a six-month period. The capital of money shops was to be increased to 6 million yuan, with 3 million yuan actually paid up. Ordinary commercial banks with trust departments were to have a minimum capital of 5 million yuan, with 3 million yuan as bank capital and 2 million yuan as trust capital. Therefore, the banking and money industries have been discussing capital increase plans since receiving the order. It is now learned that there are a total of 166 banks of all sizes in the city (including 16 banks currently applying to the Ministry of Finance for registration), with a total capital of 503,512,183 yuan. Among them, 36 banks have capital of 5 million yuan or more, 33 banks have 3 million yuan or more, 37 banks have 1 million yuan or more, 38 banks have 1 million yuan or more, and 22 banks have capital of less than 1 million yuan (all of the above are paid-up capital). Therefore, there are a total of 95 banks in the city that must increase capital within six months.

### Trends in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the performance of Chinese stocks continued to decline sharply, as the sentiment after a long rise had already turned weary, and sellers flocked to the market, resulting in a dramatic turnaround, which was expected. Gold prices fell sharply, and buyers were hesitant. It was expected that after a significant drop, those holding stocks mid-way attempted to rally the prices, resulting in some fluctuation, but it was difficult to reverse the downward trend. The cultural industry uniquely stood out, with Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Co. rising to key levels. World Book Co. saw an increase due to high demand and low supply. Among department stores, Wing On Department Store once fell to 500, then rebounded, with Sincere, The Sun, and China Emporium also seeing minor gains. The newly issued shares of The Wing On Department Store rose amid buying pressure. Innerwear and King Lun & Company and Liangfu Shirt & Hosiery also fell initially but rebounded slightly at noon. Wing On Textile fluctuated around the 1,500 level, advancing and then retreating. Smaller stocks like Rong Feng, Sin Fung, and Greater China Weaving all underperformed, while Kuo Hsin Weaving and Hong Sheng Weaving were more stable. Among new pharmaceutical companies, New Asia once approached a key level, then rebounded with Sino-French Pharmacy, while Five Continents remained flat. Banking stocks were slightly weak. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company broke through a key level again. Greater China Match Company was sluggish. Utilities also saw lower prices, with China General Edison Company dropping to a key level, and Chapei Water & Electricity also falling sharply. Industrial stocks saw Chiu An Real Estate retreat to a key level, Greater China Industrial Corporation was slightly weaker, Kuo Hua Investment was stable, and although there were rumors of a capital increase for Union Land Investment, supply exceeded demand. Transactions for Sin Yick within the Customs were quite active. China Water & Electric continued to rise. Tung Yih Trust, Tuck Fung Knitting Factory, Fumin Dairy, Kang Yuan Confectionery, and China Clock Factory remained around the previous day's prices. Financial and food stocks saw no selling pressure. Tatt Yew Stock Farm made its debut, with its price showing a strong edge, about 30% higher than the par value.

### Warehouse Rental Revised to One Yuan Per Cubic Foot

The Shanghai Warehouse Trade Association decided at its board meeting yesterday (the 21st) to revise the warehouse rental prices to one yuan per cubic foot, effective from August 1st.

### The Most Urgent Tasks of the Trade Control Council: Discussing Seven Important Issues

Although all 22 federations of the Trade Control Council's lower-level organizations have been established, their future still faces many difficulties. To solve these problems, it is hoped that the National Government will strengthen its political power. The most urgent tasks at present are the following:

(1) Price Issues: Regarding price issues, Tang, the director-general of the Trade Control Council, has issued statements explaining that the Trade Control Council and its lower-level organizations, such as the industry federations and trade associations, should bear full responsibility for price control. However, prices are still rising continuously. It is widely rumored that many influential figures in the Trade Control Council's lower-level organizations are involved in speculation and hoarding. Therefore, it is hoped that the Trade Control Council can launch a rigorous campaign to eliminate these illegal elements. The Materials Investigation Committee is currently engaged in a comprehensive investigation. It is also learned that the Shanghai Office of the Materials Control Review Committee is scheduled to be established in mid-August. It is hoped that the Trade Control Council can implement effective price policies as soon as possible.

(2) Allocation and Procurement Issues: Among the Trade Control Council's lower-level organizations, the most important purchasing work is related to wheat and other grains managed by the Wheat and Flour Special Committee. Its procurement and allocation are relatively smooth compared to other major commodities. General prices have risen two-fold since the establishment of the Trade Control Council, but the price increases related to flour milling have been minimal. This can be considered a preliminary success of the Trade Control Council's work.

(3) Financial Issues: The Trade Control Council has signed a 100 million yuan loan agreement with the Central Reserve Bank for the purchase of wheat. If this is still insufficient, additional loan agreements will be signed. Therefore, the funds for purchasing wheat should not be short.

(4) Materials Investigation Issues: The materials investigation began on the 13th of this month, temporarily limited to cotton yarn and cotton cloth. As a civic autonomous organization, the Trade Control Council naturally does not need to send investigators and investigators. However, the cotton yarn and cotton cloth records from the council's previous investigation have been submitted to the Investigation Committee for reference. Regarding methods of handling materials, the council will provide advice to the relevant authorities whenever necessary and provide maximum cooperation. (To be continued)

### Thrift and Increased Production

— Le Xiuliang

The soaring prices are forcing every middle and lower-class citizen to cry out that life is difficult. In this time of war that has spread across the world, the lack of materials and high prices are unavoidable in every country. What lies ahead for us may be even more difficult. To adapt to the environment and to prepare for an even more difficult stage, we should all earnestly practice thrift and at the same time earnestly strive for increased production.

Thrift - although everyone knows about it, it is easy to talk about but difficult to practice. The reason for this is generally due to a lack of self-confidence and a strong sense of vanity. For example, let's talk about clothing. In this society that "only values clothing," one has to be particular in order to maintain appearances. One would rather have bare walls at home but must be well-dressed when going out. As the saying goes: "Silks and satins on the body, no rice for dinner at home." This is a true portrayal of a strong sense of vanity in maintaining appearances. We should point out that this is wrong. We do not deny that there is a phenomenon in this society of only valuing clothing, but we do not need to decorate ourselves by debasing ourselves and selling our belongings in order to avoid the "discrimination and cold treatment" of ordinary people. We should use our true talents to gain the respect of others and do not need to prop up our image with beautiful clothing.

Let's talk about the issue of food! Everyone knows that in this stage where the food problem has become extremely serious, most middle and lower-class families have already cut back as much as possible. However, it is undeniable that the phenomenon of banquets costing thousands of gold, or even ten thousand gold, is still common in brightly lit, music-filled grand hotels and restaurants. "A rich family's banquet is half a year's worth of grain for a poor person," and now it is even more like "a rich person's banquet is ten disaster victims' lives." We hope that wealthy families can consciously practice thrift.

Regarding the issue of "travel": we should promote walking, which not only saves transportation costs but can also be considered exercise.

In short, in this difficult era, we should all strive for thrift and not pursue vanity. There is no need to "force oneself to maintain appearances and love face."

However, in addition to passive thrift, we should even more actively strive for "increased production" to balance the supply and demand of materials.

Lack of raw materials and inconvenient transportation are among the factors hindering increased production. However, because the costs of starting a business are so high and it is difficult to maintain, the goods produced are not as easy to earn money from as hoarding raw materials. Who would not be happy to avoid the difficult and choose the easy?

In order to increase production, we hope that the authorities should resolutely crack down on hoarding and protect the development of legitimate industries and businesses, providing as much convenience as possible in various business aspects.

In short, if speculation and hoarding are not cracked down on, legitimate enterprises will have no way to develop, and increasing production will only become words on paper. It is equally wrong and unreasonable to blindly criticize those who run businesses without foresight or to disregard reality and only ask those who run businesses to love themselves.

At this time, promoting thrift in materials and increasing production is an urgent task that cannot be delayed. We hope that insightful people in society will enthusiastically advocate it, lead by example, and earnestly do it so that this movement does not become an empty formality and remain at the level of knowledge and slogans.

### A Visit to the Sacred Heart Hospital in Xujiahui (II)

The Lives of Infants

At either end of a grassy area stand two old Western-style buildings. Because they are frequently repaired and painted, one cannot tell that they were built seventy-four years ago. It is said that there were plans to renovate them into new buildings the year before last, and everything was well prepared. Unfortunately, the Pacific War broke out on December 8, and it could not be realized. Now, these old buildings have been divided into bedrooms for the orphaned infants, with seven rooms in the front and back. The children each have their own small copper cribs with mosquito nets made of tulle. The blankets, mats, and quilts are all clean. Some are still sleeping, and some are being fed milk by the Sisters. Almost all of them are plump and lively. Especially the group of three- and four-year-olds, they are all innocent and lovely, each one is fair and beautiful. The reporter could not help but sigh, "Even the children of middle-class families today cannot enjoy such a life?" However, Sister Jin said, "A few months ago, each of them was sallow and emaciated, and their nutrition was really inadequate. The nannies and older girls who cared for them shed tears for these poor children almost every day. Fortunately, the Poor and Sick Relief Association has repeatedly provided subsidies and restored the supply of milk and eggs, so they have become plump, fair, and rosy again, like they are today."

When the orphaned infants reach the age of four or five, they receive kindergarten education. According to a set schedule, they have talks, games, meals, and rest. The children have various toys such as small cars, bicycles, rocking horses, and slides. Because the children are isolated from the outside world as soon as they enter the orphanage, various charts and models are prepared so that they can gain new knowledge about ships, trains, cars, airplanes, and so on. In addition to two congees and one rice meal each day, there is also a snack once a day. After lunch, they must take a nap, and after waking up, they go to the garden for a walk. The daily life of the children is supervised by the nuns, nannies, and older orphans, completely in accordance with hygiene and education principles, which is more affectionate and reasonable than the way mothers and older siblings treat their children and younger siblings. There is absolutely no knowledge of gambling, drinking, or bad language. In the peaceful environment and reasonable upbringing, they can all preserve their good innate nature. For older female orphans from outside, they are adopted separately. They (currently about 50 people) have three large bedrooms and a dining room, separated from the female orphans who have been in the orphanage since childhood. Male orphans are sent to the Tushanwan Orphanage after the age of five. Therefore, the life of the orphaned infants in the Sacred Heart Hospital is completely pure, innocent, and reasonable.

The integration of work and learning, life is education, the orphans in the Sacred Heart Hospital have been practicing it for a long time. The education here can be divided into two departments: first, general education. After completing kindergarten education at the age of six or seven, the general female orphans are taught public education, from primary school to senior primary school. In addition to subjects such as language, literature, history, geography, arithmetic, and calligraphy, they are also taught various household chores, such as making beds, cleaning bedrooms, sweeping classrooms and work areas, setting the table and washing dishes, and washing and cooking in the kitchen, as well as planting and watering in the garden. They are taught and practice at any time, and the older ones take care of the younger ones, helping them with work and learning, which is similar to the so-called "little teacher system." At the same time, according to the orphaned girls' natural abilities, they are assigned to learn various crafts such as embroidery, lace, sewing, and weaving in order to prepare them for supporting themselves in society after leaving the orphanage, so that they do not become parasites of society.

Second, for disabled female orphans, these most unfortunate of the unfortunate, appropriate education is also provided separately. Particularly noteworthy is the seriousness of deaf-mute education. They are first taught to pronounce sounds with French letters, assisted by gestures, and then gradually taught to recognize words, read, and write. After three or four years, they can talk to others, with clear pronunciation that is easy for listeners to understand. After five or six years, they can be compared to those who are not mute. There are currently eighteen mute individuals, divided into classes. Each teacher teaches a maximum of only four people, which is already extremely difficult. The reporter visited during the summer vacation, but the deaf students were still in class. A nanny was teaching each of them individually, using both her mouth and hands. A seven- or eight-year-old deaf girl wrote on the blackboard, "Welcome distinguished guests to visit, we are all orphans without parents." They were also able to answer the reporter's questions, and the teacher's diligence and patience were even more moving. In almost every workshop in the orphanage, there are deaf-mute girls, and their achievements are worthy of praise.

Those orphaned girls with particularly superior talents and aspirations can go on to higher education. There are currently about thirty orphaned girls studying at Xujiahui Attached Primary School, one is studying in middle school, and a group is taking advantage of the summer vacation to hire female teachers to tutor them in English and other subjects in order to obtain better grades after entering middle school in the fall. The nuns' emphasis on and love for the orphaned girls' future is truly like that of their own daughters.

Workshops and Daycare Centers

In order to teach the orphaned girls the skills to maintain their lives, and for the orphaned girls who have married to come to the orphanage to work when they need to make a living, the Sacred Heart Hospital Nursery has opened several workshops in the orphanage, including an embroidery workshop, a lace workshop, a sewing workshop, a wool workshop, a laundry, and a repair room. To meet the practical needs of the female workers, a small-scale daycare center has been opened. There are currently 33 outside female workers and 10 orphaned girls in the embroidery workshop, embroidering various flowers, birds, animals, landscapes, portraits, and other items of various sizes, most of which are pre-ordered by people from all walks of life. The reporter saw that among the embroidered gift scrolls that had already been embroidered, there was one with colorful landscapes and figures embroidered within the three characters of a person's name, which was very exquisite. Most of the embroidered products can be compared to Xiang embroidery seen in Changsha and Xiangtan, and are by no means as crude as the products sold on the market. There are currently 17 outside female workers and 3 orphaned girls in the lace workshop, making bed sheets, pillowcases, wool blankets, napkins, tea towels, handkerchiefs, women's and children's clothing, etc. Anyone who has praised the Shantou lace craftsmanship will be amazed at how delicate and exquisite the handiwork of the orphaned girls and deaf-mute girls is. There are 28 outside female workers and 2 orphaned girls in the sewing workshop. There are many new-style sewing machines, all working busily, mostly for orders from all sides. The scope of the laundry is also not small, divided into washing, starching, and ironing departments, with water troughs and electric ironing equipment, which are extremely complete. In addition, there are also wool workshops, repair departments, etc., which meet the current needs of society and specialize in repairing clothes, socks, woolen knitwear, etc. There are knitting machines and hosiery machines. There are currently 13 outside female workers and 10 orphaned girls in the wool workshop, and 45 outside female workers and 4 orphans in the laundry and repair workshops. Older orphaned girls are already teaching the younger girls how to work, and their skills are so pure that they can match the skills of factory technicians.

Social Service

### Appeal for Deaf-Mute Refugee Children

Deaf-mute children are born with disabilities, and now they have suffered disasters and hardships, with their families broken and their homes destroyed. Alone and destitute, they wander the streets, suffering unspeakable hardships. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Section and charitable organizations have discussed with the Fu Dumb School, a disability education institution in this port, to receive and educate these helpless children. More than a dozen children have been admitted so far, and they are all working hard in their studies. However, since the war, the Fu Dumb School's financial resources have been cut off, and it is difficult to maintain. This semester's shortage of more than 20,000 yuan cannot be made up, and it is feared that it will be suspended. Therefore, we appeal to warm-hearted people in society to help these poor, helpless deaf-mutes. Donations should be sent to this newspaper for collection, or to 33 Huangjiasha Garden Road, Shanghai Fu Dumb School. An official receipt will be issued and presented respectfully. All matters of the school are open, and you are welcome to visit and give guidance at any time.

### Establishment of the Poor Children's Crafts Institute

Since the Shanghai Poor Children's Crafts Institute moved to the West District Fire Brigade on Zhonghua Road in the South City, and later because the number of children was too large and not enough to accommodate, a second institute was added. The chairman of the board, Yuan Ludeng, and the president, Chen Fukang, respectfully invited people from all walks of life to visit the institute the other day.

### YMCA Introduces After-School Jobs

In order to serve high school, vocational school, and university students in finding after-school jobs, the Shanghai YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge has established an employment agency to help introduce jobs, such as tutors, office workers, translators, editors, secretaries, proofreaders, stenographers, Chinese and English typists, copyists, accountants, designers, cartoonists, musicians, and seamstresses. Families or organizations that need the above-mentioned workers can also register with the association. The association operates entirely on a service basis, without charging any fees. Office hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, located in the Student Department on the third floor of the association.

Recruiting Trainees: The Jiangnan Copper Factory is recruiting two trainees with the following qualifications: (1) Ages 16 to 18, with good character and appearance, and in good health. (2) Junior high school graduates from poor families who are unable to continue their education. (3) Able to ride a bicycle. (4) Able to find a suitable guarantor. Those who meet the qualifications can be introduced by this newspaper.
