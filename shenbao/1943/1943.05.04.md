### Regarding the Current Political Situation: What We Hope from the Japanese Government and Public

For days, we have been arguing that the National Government must strengthen its political position. Internally, it must achieve complete peace, solidifying the already changing sentiments of the people in the pacified areas, and thereby liberating the majority of compatriots imprisoned under the rule of the Chongqing regime, bringing them to our side to isolate the minority in Chongqing who cling to the Anglo-American-dependent regime, preventing it from continuing the war. Then, we can enhance our cooperation with Japan and jointly advance towards the path of defeating the United Kingdom and the United States, completing the task of victory as soon as possible. Therefore, we propose that "Public Opinion" and "People's Participation in Politics" are the two major forces for promoting enlightened politics and strengthening political status, hoping that the government will sincerely accept and develop them. We are confident that this judgment is not based on temporary emotional impulses or representing a certain position. We base our consistent arguments on the intentions of various sectors of the people, combined with the unique character of the Chinese people and historical lessons, using an objective and rational attitude as a foundation for analysis and understanding.

Because people have different views and different interests, and at the same time, in order to emphasize our arguments, we feel that our words may be straightforward and sincere. We hope that the authorities who value public opinion will take a "superior man rejoices on hearing of his faults" attitude.

Our expectations for the government will naturally be offered at any time. Today, we would like to discuss the issues of recent days and, based on the fundamental perspective of Sino-Japanese cooperation, explain our views to our friendly nation, Japan, and its government and public as follows:

First, what we want to ask is, to date, who are the people cooperating with Japan in China? Or which departments are they? If cooperation is with certain levels of people, to put it bluntly, people in the Chinese bureaucracy, then the results of "cooperation" will absolutely not be as effective as imagined. Even more unfortunately, if "cooperation" is with corrupt officials, bureaucrats, politicians, and local bullies, or institutions and organizations that are all show and no substance, then not only will there be no good effect, but the more closely they "cooperate," the more the Chinese people will suffer. We are not saying that "cooperation" is harmful, but that the choice of "cooperation" target is important. If the "cooperation" target is correct, the closer the "cooperation," the more effective it will be. We believe that the most correct target of cooperation is the vast majority of the Chinese people. Of course, this does not mean that Japan should cooperate with every Chinese person, but rather with those people and departments that can represent the wishes and interests of the majority of the people, including wise officials in the government, fair local gentry, clean political organizations, and legitimate people's groups. We also solemnly tell our friends in the friendly nation that to understand China, you must first understand the people's will; to understand the government, you must first understand the people's will. With this most fundamental understanding and knowledge, you can choose the correct target for cooperation, and you can achieve the expected results of cooperation.

Second, the essence of the change in Japan's policy towards China should lie in helping China move towards independence and autonomy, strengthening the position of the National Government, cooperating in completing the victory in the war against the United Kingdom and the United States, and jointly undertaking the task of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Chinese people will understand the deep expectations and sincere reliance. However, the Chinese people have been hoping for a change in Japan's policy towards China for ten years, and now it has suddenly become a reality, which is the most gratifying thing. However, the general public values reality, especially since the level of education of the Chinese people is shallow and uneven, and they are not easily interested in all the good-sounding terms or grand political ideals. They only ask what is actually different for the people before and after the friendly nation Japan's change of policy towards China? In other words, if Japan's new policy towards China is only of interest to a few people, then the majority of ordinary people will be disappointed. Therefore, we believe that if the change is more completely targeted at what the Chinese people need, it will be able to receive cooperation that is twice as effective as it is now. This reason, we believe that friendly people who are familiar with the situation in China and concerned about Chinese public opinion, already understand very well, and there is no need to reiterate it.

Third, "The Chinese problem must be solved by the majority of the Chinese people themselves." This point is already felt by all friendly people who are familiar with the situation in China. Because any party in China accounts for only a small minority of the people. The current Nanjing National Government is indeed the only government leading the Chinese people in their revival and nation-building. At the same time, it is undeniable that there is also the Chongqing regime entrenched in the southwest and the Communist Party entrenched in the northwest. China has three kinds of people in form, but in essence they are still "Chinese people," who will eventually return to the intention of unification. That is to say, although they are formally divided into three kinds of people, they are only waiting to choose a government that can represent their will, and they will all be concentrated under the rule of a government that takes the interests of the country and the people as its premise. In other words, the Nanjing National Government now grasps the Chinese people's desire for peace and the Chinese people's long-cherished wish to oppose Anglo-American imperialism's invasion of China. If it can achieve practice from advocacy, then it will naturally make the people's minds in the Yu and Communist areas converge. Therefore, the policy of friendly people towards China, with the people's will as the target, is the most effective direction to directly strengthen the National Government.

Fourth, the people in the pacified areas are psychologically less chaotic than those under the rule of the Chongqing regime, and there are no political factions. We have discussed in detail yesterday the psychology of the people in the pacified areas. Regarding the peace movement, they have changed from an indifferent view to a recognition and belief that it may be successful. Therefore, the people in the pacified areas today have a unified psychology. As long as this point can be grasped and the belief can be further strengthened, there will be no problem in supporting the government's policy implementation. Therefore, today, the public opinion in the pacified areas is only concerned with the government, urging the government, with the sincerity of putting politics on the right track. This is the intention of the majority of the people, and there is no trace of factional struggle.

In summary, the intentions of the Chinese people will ultimately converge. At present, the intentions of the people in the pacified areas have been unified in recognizing and accepting the movement. As long as the government's politics are enlightened and can cooperate with this intention, then the intentions of the people under the rule of the Yu and Communist parties will inevitably converge, which is the success of complete peace. Therefore, we deeply hope that friendly people, under the principle of Sino-Japanese cooperation, recognize the importance of this "people's will"; at the same time, recognize the "simplicity" and "unanimity" of this intention, and determine the "correct cooperation" target, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

### On the Southwest Pacific Front: Japanese Naval and Air Forces Achieve War Results. Japanese Submarines Active, Sinking Three Enemy Ships. Darwin Port Bombed, Suffering Major Damage.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM today: (1) In late April, imperial naval submarines sank one enemy oil tanker (12,000 tons) in the Southwest Pacific. The war results in May are as follows: one transport ship sunk (12,000 tons), one cargo ship sunk (8,000 tons). (2) On May 2, imperial aircraft bombed Darwin, causing great damage to enemy military facilities, and shooting down 21 enemy fighter planes. We suffered no losses.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from San Francisco, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters announced on the 2nd: On the 2nd, a large formation of Japanese aircraft heavily bombed Darwin Port, an important base of the Anti-Axis forces. The port suffered great damage, and the Anti-Axis Air Force also suffered heavy losses in the air battle. Commander MacArthur also stated that the Anti-Axis Air Force suffered heavy losses in the battle with the Japanese Air Force.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The General Headquarters of General MacArthur in the South Pacific announced today that Darwin Port was attacked by Japanese aircraft again last night, causing significant damage. Many Anti-Axis aircraft were shot down in the air battle.

### Japan's Strength Increases, Australia Deeply Threatened

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a message from Brisbane: Australian Army Minister Ford warned at a reception for the press on Sunday evening, "If the Allied Nations do not correctly apply their strategy, Australia may be ravaged." He urged the Anti-Axis countries to send more troops, aircraft, and supplies to Australia, saying, "I frankly tell you that we are still in real danger of being attacked by Japan." He also said that Japan has increased its submarine strength in an attempt to cut off Australia's lines of communication.

Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from San Francisco: General Kenney, Commander of the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Air Force, previously went to Washington to request US government and military leaders to strengthen aid to Australia. Now that Kenney has returned to his post, he recently spoke about the weakness of the Anti-Axis Air Force in the Pacific, saying that it takes a considerable amount of time to replenish even one aircraft for the Anti-Axis Air Force, so its numbers are actually inferior to the Japanese Air Force, and therefore we are also in a difficult situation. From this, it can be seen that Kenney's visit to the United States has failed, and it is difficult for American aid to Australia to be realized soon.

### Yu Party's Yang Jie States: The Threat of Japanese Military Strength. Japan's Position in the Pacific Becomes More Solid. Calls on the Anti-Axis Countries to Pay Attention to Australia.

Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Yu Party has constantly criticized the insistence of the United Kingdom and the United States on the Europe First strategy. Recently, it has repeatedly urged the United States and the United Kingdom to take measures to avert the crisis. Yang Jie, who has always been regarded as the Yu Party's number one strategist, published an article in the Chongqing Sweeping News on the 1st, saying that if the United Kingdom and the United States do not take any countermeasures, Japan's position in the Pacific will become more solid, clearly pointing out the threat of Japanese military strength. The general idea is: Japan calls this year the year of the decisive battle and is making solid preparations that can determine the fate of the Pacific. Therefore, Japan now seems to be actively building its southern occupied territories. The key to determining the Pacific War is Australia. If Japan conquers Australia and New Zealand, it will be difficult to shake Japan's position in the Pacific, even in the centuries to come. In this way, the Anti-Axis countries' strategy against Japan must be readjusted, and it will take a very long time to defeat Japan. Once Australia is occupied by Japan, Japan will not only no longer be a country lacking resources, but will become a country with abundant resources, and it will not be able to move its hair, even if it is to cope with any long-term war. Moreover, Japan has now included all the important islands in a semicircle north of Australia into its sphere of influence, so Australia is actually surrounded. Today, the Anti-Axis countries should reflect again. If they miss the opportunity, they will regret it too late.

### Japanese Military Situation Around Wuhan

Hankou, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese army recently launched a mopping-up operation around Wuhan.

### Japanese Army in Central Hebei Occupies Zhangjiazhuang

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from the front line in Central Hebei, since the Japanese army began a fierce attack on the strongholds of the 3rd Military Sub-district of the Yu army, it rushed into Shijiazhuang, the location of the army, and Zhangjiazhuang, the location of the Central Hebei Military Region Command, on the 2nd. Both places are 30 kilometers north of Tang County, and both areas have been turned into ruins due to the fierce bombing by Japanese army aircraft. After the Japanese army completely occupied the above two places, it continued to advance. The Tang River there has greatly increased in water volume due to the heavy rain in the previous days, but the Japanese army has now crossed the Tang River to pursue the remaining Yu army.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from the front line in Central Hebei, after the Communist army entrenched in central Hebei was pursued by the Japanese army last spring and fled into the deep mountains in western Hebei Province, it set up the Central Hebei Military Region Command in Zhangjiazhuang, 30 kilometers north of Tang County. It is now known that Commander Lu Zheng was extremely embarrassed by the sudden attack by the Japanese army and seems to be attempting to escape alone. Since no one is in command of his troops, they have fallen into an extremely chaotic state.

### Police Officers Internally Trained Must Be Selected Formal Police Officers

Central News Agency Shanghai Report – Since the Ministry of Interior's Central Police Officer School began training police officers from all over the country, the police officers sent by various places have often been employees and clerks, learning patrol officers and acting patrol officers, etc., to make up for the training in Nanjing, which is not appropriate. Because these personnel are not clear about the basic knowledge of preliminary policing, the training results have not been excellent, and the country's money has been wasted in vain. In order to rectify this situation effectively, in the future, the trainees sent by various places must be formal patrol officers or formal police officers who have served for more than six months before they can be selected. The Ministry of Interior yesterday issued a special order to all police agencies across the country to strictly abide by it.

### New Weapon in Japanese War Science (3): Manufacturing Equipment for Fuze Parts

Any invention is by no means achieved in a day or two. It requires a long period of arduous training and the dedication of a lifetime before any clue can be seen! Mr. Shoichi Teruichi, recipient of the Army Technological Achievement Award, embodies this undeniable truth. Born in Nagase Village, Kawachi County, Osaka Prefecture, he defied his parents' wishes to apprentice him after graduating from the village's elementary school, choosing a different path.

Subsequently, he worked at the Sakaue precious metal refining industry and the Fujiwara dental machinery industry. Although the Battle of Mukden during the Russo-Japanese War resulted in a great victory, it was achieved through manpower, not the strength of weapons. Recognizing the inadequacy of Japanese weaponry, Shoichi was inspired and resolutely entered the Osaka Artillery Arsenal in April of the 38th year of Meiji (1905).

Since its merger with the Shell Manufacturing Plant, the Osaka Artillery Arsenal seemed to have begun manufacturing shell fuzes. The fuze injects life into a round iron block, turning it into a shell. With a fuze, a shell can penetrate thick iron plates and instantly reduce people and objects to ashes. During the Russo-Japanese War and the Sino-Japanese War, Japan skillfully overcame the enemy's "material" strength with its vigorous and intense spirit, but at a considerable cost. The Japanese army suffered 200,000 casualties, while the Russian army suffered 140,000 (including 80,000 prisoners). This great sacrifice in the Russo-Japanese War illustrates how the Japanese army fought fiercely against enemies equipped with superior firearms, using their flesh and blood.

If the Japanese side had also possessed excellent weapons, the number of casualties could have been greatly reduced. Therefore, Shoichi, a fuze manufacturing worker, dedicated all his energy to his work and became Japan's only fuze worker. On his days off, he went to other factories, trying every possible way to learn in secret workshops. Every important factory in and out of the city was visited by Shoichi. His careful and prudent character, his tenacious enthusiasm in starting a task and not stopping until he fully understood it—all based on the spirit of "serving the nation"—soon allowed his talent to stand out and gain recognition from his superiors.

He was only thirty-eight years old when he was awarded for inventing the Type 88 small shell base fuze cover screw. He was neither a young inventor nor a genius inventor; it was not until middle age, at the age of thirty-eight, that he produced an invention.

For half his life, he worked with machines, which led to his current position. One cannot be careless with machines, and machines cannot have unfinished states. The completion of an invention is not due to its peculiarity that wins people's praise or surprise, but entirely for its practical utility. One completed invention can serve as a bridge for completing the second.

Instantaneous fuze firing pin cover, pressing for charge chamber bottom, safety pins for various fuzes, automatic screw cutting machine, and various automatic machines that use machines to replace manual manufacturing of various fuzes were all completed thanks to his efforts. It laid the foundation for mass production and endured the long-term attrition warfare of modern times. Fuzes can be divided into timed fuzes and instantaneous fuzes based on their function; they can also be divided into nose fuzes and base fuzes based on their assembly position. Timed fuzes begin to operate at the moment of firing, sensing the impact within the gun barrel, and the shell explodes after a few seconds. Instantaneous fuzes explode upon impact with the target due to vibration. Further subdivisions include instantaneous, short delay, tracer, and medium-range fuzes.

Instantaneous fuzes explode the moment the shell reaches the ground but before it sinks into it. Short-delay fuzes explode five to six meters or ten meters above the enemy's head. When fired, the shell's acceleration is equivalent to hundreds of times the Earth's gravity, and its rotation speed reaches over 20,000 revolutions per minute. Naval guns commonly have fuzes installed on the nose of the shell, while armor-piercing shells for army guns that target tanks and fortified positions have their fuzes installed on the base. During the Nomonhan Incident, the enemy's blindly advancing tank battalions and their fortified positions were destroyed by these base fuzes.

In addition to receiving thirteen awards of merit, Shoichi has also received fifteen awards for diligence. For forty years, except for business trips and holidays, he has not left his post for a single day. His second son, Private First Class Shoichi, died in action during the fierce battle of Mount Daibetsu in May of the 14th year of Showa (1939). (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, April 19)

### Establishing Wartime Economic Measures: Japanese Cabinet Passes Three Plans

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Japanese government, in order to establish various economic measures during the decisive battle period, has drafted various national plans for this year. First, at the regular cabinet meeting on the 30th of last month, the Material Mobilization Plan and the Transportation Mobilization Plan were submitted and formally decided by the cabinet. Today, at the regular cabinet meeting convened in advance, three plans, including the Production Expansion Plan, Power Mobilization Plan, and National Mobilization Plan, were also formally decided by the cabinet. The Japanese Information Bureau specifically released a statement by Suzuki, the President of the Planning Board, regarding the fundamental policy of this year's Production Expansion Plan at 4:00 PM today, which mainly stated: (1) The focus of this plan is to increase the production of steel, coal, light and heavy metals, warships, and aircraft. Efforts will also be made to strengthen and maintain the balance of important national defense industries related to the above-mentioned production. (2) Actively strengthen ships, vehicles, and land and sea transportation facilities, and, considering the storage conditions of raw materials and local conditions, establish various production countermeasures on the premise of conserving maritime transportation capacity. (3) For materials with extremely high demand and low self-sufficiency, make every effort to investigate, develop, or increase production within the vast Greater East Asia. (4) Improve domestic and foreign industries and utilize various industrial equipment and materials to actively increase productivity. (5) Make every effort to increase the production of major food crops necessary to ensure the wartime livelihood of the people, and so on. Furthermore, the plan's guidelines for implementing national mobilization this year are: (1) The focus of this plan is to expand military demand and increase the production and transportation of five major essential materials and other urgent materials, and to ensure the necessary personnel for the above-mentioned projects. (2) To expand the supply of administrative manpower, and to ensure timely and appropriate placement, restrict or prohibit men from filling positions as clerks or in lighter tasks that can be handled by women. Additionally, reorganize unnecessary schools, strengthen the implementation of national conscription, and expand the organization of the National Labor Service Corps to engage in forceful mobilization. (3) Improvement of industries necessary for national mobilization should be carried out quickly and vigorously.

### Japanese Representatives Attending the Literary Association: Report Meeting Held

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Japan International Cultural Association held a report meeting at the Imperial Hotel here at noon today, inviting representatives of the cultural mission group who had decided to go to China to attend the Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Literary Association. Except for Mr. Ikezaki and Mr. Kawakami, who were absent, all others attended. Representatives from various related organizations such as the Japan Greater East Asia Ministry Information Bureau also sent personnel to participate. During the meeting, each person expressed their impressions and spoke freely. In particular, Mr. Kiyoshi Nobutoki's report that few Japanese people knew about the Chinese national anthem was a common feeling among the participants. At that time, specific methods for popularizing it were considered. The main points of each representative's report are recorded below. (Mr. Tetsuzo Tanikawa) This congress, because it was the Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, failed to thoroughly discuss Sino-Japanese cultural issues, which is deeply regrettable. I hope that a Sino-Japanese cultural discussion meeting can be convened separately next year. (Mr. Todao Ogushi) Japanese cultural life has recently tended towards Europe and the United States, and has not paid much attention to neighboring China. This is not only the case for individuals, but also for the International Cultural Promotion Association and other organizations. As a result of attending this congress, I have become more fond of Chinese people, and the other party also hopes to establish active contact with Japan. Therefore, I hope to publish cultural magazines related to China and establish an organization to promote communication between Sino-Japanese cultures as soon as possible.

### Overseas Chinese Assist in Construction Work: An Overview of Economic Progress in the Philippines

Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) May 7th marked the first anniversary of the pacification of the Philippines. Recent economic measures on the island have made progress, and the increase in local autonomy is particularly noteworthy. A brief introduction is provided below: "Establishing Comprehensive Price Countermeasures" The Japanese military administration will begin to improve price countermeasures after the start of the military administration's fiscal year and will establish a Price Countermeasures Committee to formulate an outline of price control and establish a procedure for price countermeasures. After comprehensively studying currency production and other issues, prices will be determined. Therefore, the committee's future activities are highly anticipated. "Increasing Bank Deposit Interest Rates" The Philippine Island Bank Association previously agreed to increase deposit interest rates, which have been implemented since May 1st. This will contribute greatly to absorbing floating purchasing power from the public. "Enhancing Local Autonomy" The officials of the Philippine executive branch, in order to make the Philippines a relay base for the southern front, have actively sought food production. In order to increase the industrial production capacity on the island, equipment for textiles, strong soda, and various daily necessities is also ready. The harvest of cotton in the first year was 15,000 dans, and the local cotton industry production plan has been successful.

In the past, overseas Chinese in the Philippines monopolized the entire Philippine economy with their tight economic organization. However, today, they deeply understand the meaning of building East Asia and are gradually changing their past practices, unanimously and enthusiastically supporting the National Government, and actively striving to make the most rational progress in order to adapt to the new situation after the expulsion of British and American forces. The goal of the Greater East Asia War is to establish a new world order, so the exploitation mechanisms and self-interest economic organizations of British and American imperialism must be expelled, so that all countries and nations in the world can engage in their own affairs for a long time. At the current stage, the controls and reforms implemented in various departments to complete the war are necessary measures. Therefore, the Philippines today has undergone considerable reforms in political, economic, and industrial aspects compared to the past. The overseas Chinese in the Philippines, who in the past aimed to absorb Chinese interests, must also reform their economic organizations and institutions and start under a new outlook. Since June of last year, overseas Chinese in the Philippines have established overseas Chinese associations in six locations, including Manila, Cebu, Davao, Legazpi, and Baguio, as central organizations to cooperate in the construction of the new Philippines. They have also organized the registration and compilation of Baojia (collective responsibility system) for overseas Chinese in the Philippines to assist in maintaining local order. In addition, the Philippine Daily Necessities Materials Association guides commercial reforms, etc., to assist in the economic construction of the Philippines. Furthermore, they provide employment for unemployed Philippine overseas Chinese, handle remittances and mail for overseas Chinese to their home country, and actively seek welfare for overseas Chinese.

### 500,000 US Coal Miners to Resume Work Today: Miners Union President Declares Understanding Reached with Government

Argentina, Capital City, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Washington: Lewis, the president of the US Coal Miners Union, issued an order on the 2nd for the 500,000 miners belonging to the union to resume work starting on the morning of the 4th. It is reported that the US government and the union's political committee are scheduled to negotiate a new contract and wage issues before the 15th of this month.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency)

According to reports from Washington, Lewis, the president of the US Workers Union, announced last night that the American mining strike would be postponed, saying that he had reached an agreement with the Washington government that the strike would be postponed for two weeks. The date for the general mining strike was originally set for today, as more than 500,000 miners had already stopped working last weekend. Lewis's announcement of the postponement of the strike came twenty minutes before President Roosevelt's appeal to the miners. According to Lewis, he had ordered his miners to resume work tomorrow to avoid plunging the country into chaos, and solemnly declared that this was the result of the current situation. Lewis also said that the postponement of the strike was a unanimous decision of the Mountain Miners Union's "policy committee." When Lewis declared to the miners, he urged them to remember that the American government was their only employer and deeply hoped that the government and the entire American nation would deeply understand the significance of the miners' demands. President Roosevelt had not formally received any news about Lewis's meeting with the US government, which was held before the Miners Union president made this announcement. Therefore, although the postponement of the strike was announced before Lewis's appeal, Roosevelt did not mention this point in his broadcast address at first. At the request of the government, Lewis had previously discussed the matter with Fuel Secretary Ickes for two hours, and it is generally believed that the postponement of the strike was likely due to the mine owners having agreed to the miners' demands for increased wages.

### Roosevelt Appeals to Miners to Return to Work

Lisbon, Today (Central News Agency) Washington News: Because the White House order requiring all striking miners to return to work before 10 AM on Saturday was resisted by Lewis, the president of the Miners Union, President Roosevelt tonight again made an urgent appeal to the 500,000 striking miners in the East, denouncing them for staking the lives of American soldiers and the safety of the people on a single throw, and indicated that if the strikers did not obey the order to return to work, he would take stern action. He added that the war had reached a new crisis stage, and any delay in coal production would affect the progress of the war effort. President Roosevelt also invoked the strikers' patriotism, continuing, "Fellow Americans, I am speaking to the American people tonight, and especially to those of our citizens who are coal miners. Our country is now facing a serious danger. The future of the country depends on the victorious outcome of the war in which we are now participating." President Roosevelt also said that he had recently toured more than twenty states in two weeks and had witnessed tens of thousands of workers manufacturing aircraft, artillery, and ammunition, all engaged in difficult work for long hours, and their living conditions were very difficult. Our current collective effort is not excessive for the current war. We will need everything from ourselves and our allies. We have not yet won the war; only by intensifying production and mobilizing all our strength for the war effort can we win. The suspension of domestic coal production, even for a very short period of time, is tantamount to staking the lives of soldiers at sea and on land and the future safety of the nation on a single throw, and this gamble is unwarranted, unnecessary, and extremely dangerous. Therefore, I am making a declaration to all miners and to the American people at home and abroad that coal production must not be allowed to stop. President Roosevelt pointed out that his speech was to invoke the patriotism of all miners and traced back to the events after the attack on Pearl Harbor, when the three major labor organizations in the United States—the American Federation of Labor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the Railway Brotherhoods—all vowed not to strike during the war, and Lewis was also a participant in this guarantee. Roosevelt also pointed out that in the current coal industry strike, attempts at mediation had failed, and the matter had been submitted to the War Labor Board, but the Miners Union had refused to participate on the grounds that the board was prejudiced. Therefore, the responsibility for this strike clearly lies with the Miners Union and not with the US government. The consequence of this arbitrary action is that we are all threatened by it. He is well aware that the high cost of living has troubled the families of miners and millions of other workers, and the government has decided not to allow the cost of living to rise as it did during the last war and has decided to maintain a balance between wages and prices. We have not yet lowered the prices of certain goods, not only in coal-producing areas, but also in many other cities. Violators of price restrictions will be dealt with strictly. The war is currently underway, and all miners should set aside their personal opinions and continue to work in their positions, because we must supply weapons to the troops overseas. If any patriotic miners need protection to resume work, they will be given full and proper guarantees. If it is necessary for the military to manage the mines and protect the returning miners and their families, it will be done for the sake of the nation and especially for the needs of the soldiers in the army, navy, and air force. President Roosevelt concluded with a hopeful remark, saying that he believed that all miners would not continue to strike, but at the same time issued a warning, "The meaning of my words is not to neglect my duties as President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy? The first thing I intend to do is to ensure that the coal mines resume work."

The Miners Union's Struggle

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Washington: 450,000 workers belonging to the American Miners Union went on strike at midnight on the 30th on the orders of the union's president, Lewis, with tremendous momentum, which shocked President Roosevelt and left him at a loss. The Miners Union, led by Lewis, has a sound organization rarely seen in American labor history. When a strike occurred in the coal mines belonging to the steel companies in the autumn of 1941, the union insisted on its demands without making any concessions, causing a steel and iron plant in the Pittsburgh area to be forced to shut down due to insufficient coal. Later, President Roosevelt asked the workers to prioritize the country's future, and they resumed work. The current strike was caused by Lewis's demand on March 10 that the Price Adjustment Bureau raise the wages of miners nationwide due to high inflation and rising prices after American inflation, so that workers could work with peace of mind. The Union of Anthracite Mine Owners in northern America refused to accept this, which led to the current strike. Lewis was re-elected as president of the Miners Union this spring. During the industrial recovery era, he was very close to Roosevelt. Since Lewis left the Labor Union and formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1936, his power has grown due to Roosevelt's protective labor policies. Therefore, in order to repay the favor, he vigorously supported Roosevelt during the 1936 presidential election. Since then, the international situation has become increasingly urgent, and Lewis's isolated stance has become more pronounced. At the same time, Roosevelt's labor policy has also changed, causing the feelings between the two to become increasingly distant and gradually opposed. During the 1940 presidential election, Lewis publicly declared his support for Wilkie, which shocked the entire United States. After Wilkie failed to be elected, he resigned from the chairmanship of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and presided over the Miners Union with his daughter, Cassery.

### Axis Forces Counterattack from Strongholds: British Forces' Sharp Momentum Halted: British Convoy Attacked Outside Benghazi

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) A military commentator from the Hai Tong News Agency stated today that the fierce attack launched by the anti-Axis forces in an attempt to drive the Axis forces out of Tunisia has now completely stalled. The situation in North Africa has not changed in the past few days. After the British army heavily bombarded the Axis positions northwest of Enfidaville with artillery on Thursday night and Friday morning, it launched an infantry attack on Friday afternoon, but this attack was only a small-scale battle of a local nature. Its purpose was obviously to change the positions or to contain the Axis forces in that area. The British infantry was then driven back to its original positions, and the bombardment by British artillery was greatly reduced. On Saturday, there were only a few skirmishes by scout teams in the south. The battle situation at Pont du Fahs was calm. The Majaz al Bab area was more active. The German army made some progress in a local attack northwest of the El Hamma salt lake. The enemy increased pressure on the highway from Majaz al Bab to Tebourba, but without significant progress. In the mountainous area between Medjez el Bab and the Mediterranean coast, American and French forces cooperated in combat, with only minor contact.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) Since the general offensive on the Tunisian front began on April 16, the anti-Axis forces have lost 294 tanks, 211 armored vehicles, 64 artillery pieces, and 53 aircraft up to April 30, and 1,700 people were captured. In addition, the tanks and aircraft destroyed by the Axis forces with anti-tank guns and fighter squadrons are not included in this list. Therefore, the losses suffered by the anti-Axis forces in this offensive were extremely heavy, and they have been unable to launch another offensive in the past few days. Integrated frontline news reports that (1) the Axis forces have completely occupied important mountain positions in the northern coastal area. The British army launched several reconnaissance attacks in the Medjez el Bab area, and there were frequent small clashes between the two armies; (2) The French rebels in the southwestern region received reinforcements and are working hard to strengthen their positions. It is reported that the Axis artillery is repeatedly bombarding them.

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) According to German News Agency reports, military sources stated: The German military report on Sunday regarding the attack by German bombers on a British convoy off the coast of North Africa was an outstanding success. The enemy convoy was spotted by German long-range reconnaissance aircraft. Before 8:00 AM on May 1, German bombers flew near Benghazi and were covered by British fighters. An air battle immediately broke out. The German bombers then attacked the largest unit in the enemy convoy. A 6,000-ton freighter was hit and caught fire. Several medium-sized freighters were also damaged. Another 5,600-ton freighter was also directly hit. German bombers launched three aerial torpedoes, hitting a 10,000-ton mail ship, which immediately caught fire. The total loss of the mail ship is undoubtedly certain. Another 7,000-ton freighter was hit by a torpedo, tilted, and stopped sailing. It is feared that it will not be able to reach port. One German aircraft did not return.

### The Focus of Eastern Front Battles Shifts to the Kupiansk River Area; Soviet Forces' Five-Day Offensive Unsuccessful

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The main focus of battles on the Eastern Front has now shifted to the Kupiansk River area, with only localized engagements in other sectors and no major changes in the overall situation. According to frontline reports, the Soviet offensive against the Kupiansk bridgehead was well-organized and planned. Following heavy artillery and air strikes on German positions, large tank groups and infantry units were repeatedly launched in fierce assaults. After five days of intense fighting, the Soviet forces suffered enormous casualties and material losses, but achieved no results. The German positions remained unchanged. Furthermore, among the battles of the past five days, the one on the 2nd of this month was the most intense. From dawn that day, the German air force launched an offensive, destroying 42 Soviet aircraft by noon alone. In addition, German ground forces fought bravely against the superior Soviet forces, conducting suicidal attacks on Soviet tank formations, destroying 31 tanks. Also, it appears that the Soviet forces launched a new offensive in the Orel area, south of the central sector, on the 2nd. Although the Soviet Information Bureau has announced that Soviet troops have advanced into the area, the German side has not yet confirmed this.

Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Late-night news from the front last night hinted at potentially more intense fighting, but yesterday only saw battles in the Kupiansk and Orel areas. News from Moscow also stated that Soviet forces launched a new offensive in the Orel area, but this attack is still only of a localized nature. According to the Associated Press, Soviet forces occupied three radio stations between Smolensk and Kharkov. There was also some activity in the Kalinin area of the northern front, with both sides engaging in fierce melee combat in the trenches, but no significant changes to the frontline were observed.

### Chief of Staff of German Stormtroopers Dies in Car Accident

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - It was announced here today that Rozs, Chief of Staff of the Stormtroopers, died from severe injuries sustained in a car accident. He was born on December 28, 1890, and served in the postal service. He was wounded four times in the First World War and lost sight in one eye. After the war, he joined the National Socialist Workers' Party (Nazi Party). As a Stormtrooper leader, he was quite active in the Ruhr region. In 1930, he became a member of parliament, and in 1933, he became a representative of the Province of Hanover, until March 1941. He served as Chief of Staff of the Stormtroopers from June 30, 1940, making many contributions to the organization.

### German Efforts in Production

Lausanne, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Berlin correspondent for the Basler National-Zeitung reports that Germany is now making full use of every minute of work, which has increased by 4.5 times compared to May 1940. Swiss newspapers are widely discussing the comparison between Germany's increased production and the threat of strikes by American miners against military supply industries. This year, Germany celebrated Labor Day with the special slogan "Increase Production."

### Italy Announces Formation of Air Assault Unit with the Task of Capturing Enemy Airfields

Rome, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The details of a newly organized "Offensive Wing" of the Italian Air Force were announced today. The main task of this Wing is to capture enemy air bases for the use of the Italian Air Force. Therefore, the Wing is divided into three groups: the first group is a battalion of experienced airmen, mostly volunteers, whose task is to defend airfields that have already been captured and to make these airfields available for use by the Italian Air Force as quickly as possible. The second group is a battalion of paratroopers, all of whom are volunteers, whose task is to occupy and defend the areas surrounding the airfield, protecting it from attack. The third group is the army's ground forces.

### U.S. Attempts to Occupy French Martinique, Has Announced Severance of Relations with the Island

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a United Press report, reliable sources said today that diplomatic figures in Washington are actively discussing the possibility of U.S. military intervention in French Martinique. While there is no formal action on this step at present, influential figures in Washington have made informal overtures on the matter.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to reports from Washington, the U.S. government, because High Commissioner Robert of French Martinique remains loyal to the French government, severed relations with the island on the 26th. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox, in a meeting with reporters on the 30th, stated that the U.S. government cannot yet specify what measures it will take against Martinique and the French warships moored in the island's waters after the severance of relations. The U.S. Navy is currently patrolling near the island, and observers stationed on the island will report on the situation there at any time. In addition to six oil tankers and two merchant ships, there are also the aircraft carrier "Béarn" (25,000 tons), the cruiser "D'Entrecasteaux" (6,496 tons), and the "Jeanne d'Arc" (5,886 tons) moored on the island. A portion of the French fleet has sailed to the port of Dakar, engaging in activities under U.S. command.

Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Dissident French elements in Washington believe that if Robert, the French commissioner of Martinique, does not accept U.S. demands, U.S. forces may occupy Martinique. Washington sources, quoting these elements, said that the United States will implement a military occupation based on the provisions of the Havana Treaty, and will recognize the Giraud-Lethière joint government established on the island to remove Commissioner Robert. At the same time, these elements pointed out that the U.S. cancellation of its agreement with Commissioner Robert is merely one step in its consistent policy of exerting pressure on Martinique to make the island join the anti-Axis front. The United States stopped shipping grain to Martinique last autumn, and on the 45th, U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles announced to the world that if necessary, the United States was prepared to take military action. However, it is believed that Commissioner Robert will strongly resist any landing attempt. Information received here reveals that Robert, in addition to a portion of sailors on the repatriated French fleet, also has 3,000 soldiers. Martinique's defense equipment, in addition to the cannons on the French warships, also includes the machine guns of 105 aircraft from the aircraft carrier "Courageous."

### Giraud Invites de Gaulle to Meet in North Africa

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to sources in London, General Giraud's letter to de Gaulle arrived in London last night. Giraud does not agree with de Gaulle's proposed political plan for the French government-in-exile. According to Reuters, Giraud does not approve of de Gaulle's proposed centralized organization. Giraud believes that the political aspects of this issue should be discussed at a later date, and that unity between the two factions should be limited to military and diplomatic matters. Giraud asked de Gaulle to meet in North Africa immediately, but at a location more secluded than Algiers. De Gaulle has now telegraphed General Catroux, who is mediating, expressing his agreement to meet immediately, but insists that it should be held in Algiers so that he can have daily contact with various figures.

### Changes in British Naval Personnel

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - It was announced in London today that Rear Admiral McGrigor has been appointed as a member of the Admiralty and Director of Supply and Transport. Vice Admiral Cunningham, who previously held this position, has been transferred to a new post. Rear Admiral Rawlings will succeed McGrigor in his former shore duties.

### Changes in British Indian Government Officials

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London, the Secretary of State for India issued a statement this morning announcing changes in senior personnel in the British Indian government. In addition to a reduction in the number of Indian cabinet members in the wartime cabinet, the High Commissioner has also been replaced. Sir Mudaliar, who represents India in the wartime cabinet, has been transferred back to the Executive Council of the Governor-General of India. Sir Huddleston, the Indian High Commissioner in London, has also been transferred back to the Executive Council of the Governor-General of India, and his vacant position will be filled by Sir Runganadhan, the former advisor to the Secretary of State for India. Sir Rowlands, the former Advocate-General of Bengal, and Dr. Khare have been appointed members of the Executive Council, with the latter also serving as Commissioner of Overseas Affairs. Ahmed has been appointed Minister of Information and Broadcasting. Mudaliar is also Commissioner of Supply. Huddleston is also Commissioner of Commerce. The reason for the above reorganization is that three cabinet members resigned when Gandhi began his fast, and there is now a need to fill the vacancies. As for the position of India's representative in the wartime cabinet in London, as Sir Mudaliar will not leave England for several weeks, there are no plans to appoint another person to replace him at present.

### Anglo-American Monetary Debate: Anglo-American Conflict on Post-War Currency

On April 5th, U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau officially released the post-war currency plan. Then, on the 7th, British economist Keynes also released a proposal of the same nature, revealing the deep conflict of opinions between Britain and the United States on this issue. The detailed content of the two plans is not yet clear, but summarizing various fragments of reports, the points of conflict are mainly the following three:

(1) Different Views on Gold - The Morgenthau plan extends the concept of the Exchange Equalization Fund, using 500 million "Unitas" (a newly established international monetary unit, with one "Unitas" equivalent to ten U.S. dollars, freely convertible with gold) to establish an international exchange equalization mechanism. The currencies of various countries maintain a certain exchange ratio with gold through "Unitas." This equalization fund is used to prevent drastic changes in the international exchange market, and the difference between buying and selling exchanges is settled in cash. Clearing agreements are not recognized without special permission. The Keynes plan extends the concept of clearing agreements in the form of a clearinghouse, establishing an international financial hub. International settlements only need to transfer an entry in the accounting books of this central institution. This is the theoretical basis of currency management. As for the role of gold, it is used as the final means of settlement, with "Bancor" as the value benchmark for the international currency unit.

(2) Issue of Speaking Rights in the International Financial Hub - The Morgenthau plan uses gold, foreign exchange holdings, and national income as the basis for determining the funds that should be invested in the central institution. The Keynes plan uses the trade volume in the three years before the war as the basis. Obviously, the former is beneficial to the United States, while the latter is beneficial to Britain.

(3) Different Post-War Trade Plans - According to the Morgenthau plan, the exchange rates of various countries cannot be lowered without the permission of the central institution. If there are difficulties in maintaining parity, it will be settled with gold. According to the Keynes plan, if a country's overdraft exceeds a certain limit within a certain period, it is allowed to automatically lower its currency value because lowering the currency value can promote exports. In other words, commodity exports are used as the final means of international settlement.

The Theory of Submitting to Politics

The truth of the above-mentioned issues shows that it lies not in economics but in politics. According to Keynes' clearinghouse proposal, the deficit party in the settlement uses commodity exports as the final handling method, so the "Bancor" unit he assumed does not necessarily have to be linked to gold. This is to prevent the gold-producing South African Union from leaning towards the United States. Judging from Keynes' previous theory, it is a kind of degradation, a submission to politics.

But the Keynes plan also has its limits. If it restores the gold standard, the British Empire will have no room to intervene under the U.S. gold hegemony. Therefore, it came up with a compromised and eclectic plan, which is neither complete currency management nor completely based on gold.

The Self-Interested Morgenthau Plan

The distribution of gold in the world is now completely biased towards the United States. If it is not redistributed, it will be difficult to hope for the stability of the currencies of various countries based on gold. This is the difficulty of the Morgenthau plan. The United States believes that gold will no longer be distributed to various countries in the world, and to put it bluntly, the United States hopes that various countries will exchange their military bases, or political and economic interests, for gold.

In fact, what the Keynes plan implies is to make the United States an importing country, with various countries exporting goods to the United States, and the United States releasing gold. This is indeed a true balance. However, the United States itself will experience a phenomenon of overproduction after the war, so how can it accommodate the dumping of goods from various countries in the United States? Here, after the direct currency issue, the gold issue closely follows.

Before the war, the United States established the world's highest tariff barriers, with an internal free market of 9 million square kilometers and 130 million people. Everything can be done immediately. This is completely different from Europe, where a one-day train ride involves crossing several political, economic, and cultural borders. In the United States, no matter where you go, the language, customs, habits, and thoughts are all the same, and the basic characteristics of the U.S. economy are unified standards, industrial rationalization, and mass production. Only the British Empire group wants to confront it, and the difference is too great. The fundamental reason is that the group members scattered around the world cannot be defended militarily. Therefore, a European wide-area sphere - that Britain wants to dominate politically, economically, and militarily - is necessary no matter what.

This economic trend of Britain was politically expressed as the term "European Family" in Churchill's speech on March 21st. The meaning of "European Family" is that the sovereignty of small countries can no longer exist as before.

European Wide-Area Sphere Theory

The United States previously held suspicions and anxieties about the League of Nations and the Pan-European movement, and is now observing the British movement with the same eyes. The U.S. Lend-Lease program – becoming the true meaning of the arsenal and granary of democratic countries – is to maintain absolute superiority in military power and productivity in the post-war world. The U.S. plan still adheres to the Monroe Doctrine and uses it as the core for developing towards the world market and the world economy.

This plan is expressed politically in the free trade doctrine and national self-determination doctrine in the Atlantic Charter. Upon closer examination, this is the free movement of U.S. capital and U.S. goods, which is the basis for opposing the European wide-area theory.

Anglo-American Anxiety

The ambitions of Britain and the United States for the post-war world have been exposed through the currency debate. This is an anxious expression of the need to enhance combat power at the current stage of the decisive battle.

(1) Thinking about the major problem of post-war overproduction, Britain and the United States - especially the United States - want to prevent increased production. However, this overthinking cannot but be rejected at present. The rumored anti-Axis agricultural conference is one of the manifestations of this effort.

(2) U.S. politicians and capitalists will not be able to work with peace of mind unless they eliminate their concerns about the gold hidden in the Kentucky Mountains, which once becomes worthless.

(3) If the post-war issue is raised, the currency issue cannot be avoided, and the United States cannot but advocate the gold standard. The United States also knew that Keynes was drafting a currency plan, so it launched it first, so that the people would get the impression that the United States has leadership in the international economy, and improve their confidence in the government. The prior launch of the gold standard advocacy is a manifestation of the anxiety of Britain and the United States, especially the United States.

### Anglo-American International Monetary Disputes

The anti-Axis powers' ideas about postwar management often gloss over the fact of defeat. This deception is a propaganda tactic, aimed at spreading the illusion of an assured victory in this war throughout the world. However, it has resulted in political and economic opposition between Britain and the United States, exposing contradictions and divisions within their own camp. This is truly a gratifying development.

A recent prominent example is the ugly dispute between Britain and the United States over the postwar international monetary security plan. This issue originated with Keynes' proposal for international monetary reform. Keynes is a world-renowned economist and currently a director of the Bank of England. After Britain submitted this proposal to the pre-determined anti-Axis financial conference in London, it was officially published this month, on the 7th, by Finance Minister Wood in the form of a white paper. In response, the United States, as expected, showed its displeasure and issued a rebuttal. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau wants to replace Keynes' proposal with his assistant Harry Dexter White's "Proposal for a Stabilizing Fund of the United and Associated Nations." On the 5th of this month, Morgenthau presented it at a joint closed-door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Banking and Currency Committee, and the Postwar Economic Policy and Planning Committee.

The content of Keynes' proposal is based on the following five main points: (1) Establishing an International Clearing Bank with hubs in London and New York; (2) Establishing an international accounting unit based on gold, called "Bancor"; (3) Creating an international commodity association mechanism; (4) Establishing an international investment institution; (5) Drafting an international economic plan. In other words, it is to establish an international monetary system based on gold for settling international trade, with "Bancor" as its monetary unit. Based on the maintenance or change of gold price controls, Britain and the United States would be responsible for its operation, thereby setting international commodity prices. Thus, each country can determine the external value of its own currency based on Bancor. The contributions of member countries to the International Clearing Bank would be converted into Bancor, deposited as reserves, and recorded in the books for exchange settlement between countries. Furthermore, to maintain a stable relationship between Bancor, commodities, and gold, an international commodity regulatory agency would be established to engage in the purchase of surplus materials and the release of existing goods. It also aims to develop and industrialize economically backward countries and to meet the capital needs of countries lacking financial funds. The International Investment Institution would provide financial assistance in the form of international loans to countries with trade deficits in the aforementioned multilateral exchange clearing system based on Bancor, to aid postwar economic recovery. Moreover, to ensure the smooth operation of international clearing on a permanent basis, an international-scale economic plan would be drafted to ensure international economic equilibrium.

In contrast, White's proposal focuses on the revival of the international gold standard, with gold controlling the currencies of all countries in the world from beginning to end. A world currency stabilization fund would be established through contributions from various countries, and an International Monetary Control Board would be created, managed by an international supervisory committee. It advocates a new international monetary unit, "Unitas" (set at an equivalent of ten US dollars and freely convertible to gold), on the condition that member countries are prohibited from freely devaluing their currencies. It also declares that the United States will spend half of the exchange balance fund, 5 billion US dollars, to facilitate trade transactions between countries. The true intention of the United States, needless to say, is to rescue the gold worth hundreds of millions of dollars, scraped from all over the world and now hidden in Fort Knox in Kentucky, as well as the American gold mining industry that was shut down during the war.

As pointed out in a special dispatch published in the evening edition of this newspaper (Yomiuri Hochi claims) on the 17th, Keynes' proposal is to link the settlement currency unit Bancor to gold, negate the restoration of the gold standard in its strict sense, and advocate the reorganization of the world economy through a multilateral exchange clearing system. This is completely close to the Axis powers' idea of establishing a world economy by using non-gold currencies. In terms of the basic concept of international economics, it can be said to be imitating the Axis powers. However, Britain, which has already fallen from the throne of the world economy, wants to flatter the United States, so it wants to thoroughly place the foundation of international currency on the gold standard. Now it is expressing its reluctance to part with the gold standard, so the function of its multilateral exchange clearing system cannot be developed after all. In other words, due to the constraints of gold, most countries still have to be under the hegemonic monopoly of the international economy of Britain and the United States. Therefore, if Keynes truly intends to rebuild the world economy, he will naturally have to be consistent with the direction of the Axis powers' new world order. Furthermore, the United States' imperialistic ambition and its self-serving attitude are deeply resented by us as it seeks to solve its own gold storage problem by using the pretext of rebuilding the world currency, and to fully restore the international gold standard of "Unitas," with the immediate abolition of exchange restrictions, restrictions on the movement of unsound capital, and the prohibition of clearing agreements as preconditions, and thereby to restore the pre-war international economic order and rebuild its own prosperity.

Today's world economy is gradually shifting from a gold standard economy to a commodity standard economy, and the gold standard has already been negated by history. As this war is raging, East Asia and Europe are carrying out the magnificent construction of a wide-area financial zone through the conclusion of exchange clearing systems centered on their central countries. Moreover, the value ratio established between countries within the new zone is the most appropriate currency value for the smooth exchange of materials within the zone without relying on gold, so that a self-sufficient relationship of coexistence and co-prosperity can be established. Through the adjustment of planned settlement measures by the guiding countries, it is gradually leading to an economic structure of shared destiny. Not only that, but even in trade between friendly zones, like the Japan-Germany payment agreement, gold has been excluded. At this stage of economic history, it can be said that even the final stronghold of gold as a means of payment between zones has been severely limited, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The reconstruction of the world economy by a wide-area economy, as advocated by the Axis powers, is possible if trust is established between the guiding countries of each zone, mutual consultation is made to conclude payment agreements for the adjustment of materials, and a certain amount of credit borrowing is allowed for unavoidable payment differences. We believe that this is the inevitable result of history. (Ding: Translated from Yomiuri Hochi, April 21)

### Director of the Materials Compilation Office Issues Statement: Investigation of Rumors of Corruption by Investigators – Punishment Guaranteed if Found – Hope that Businessmen from All Circles Will Exercise Self-Restraint – Do Not Attempt to Bribe to Avoid Penalties

The Public Works Bureau issued a notice at the end of last month, stating that ten investigators from the Materials Control Office would be dismissed and their names and photos published. This matter has attracted great attention from all circles in the city, but because the reasons for the dismissal were not explained, there have been many speculations, some of which are quite sensational. Inagaki Noboru, Director of the Materials Control Office, believing that the outside world's groundless speculation is prone to causing various rumors, specially issued a written statement yesterday, expressing the Public Works Bureau's attitude towards the work of the investigators. He also hopes that businessmen from all circles will cooperate and not allow investigators to have any opportunity to commit dereliction of duty and corruption. The full text of the statement is recorded as follows:

Employees Guilty of Corruption Should Be Severely Punished

"Recently, there have been rumors that employees of this Materials Control Office have been using their positions to solicit money from businessmen or accept gifts from businessmen. I was deeply saddened to hear about this. After conducting a thorough investigation, we have not yet obtained solid evidence to prove that any employee of this office has accepted bribes. However, this office does not ignore certain cases simply because solid evidence has not been obtained. For example, employees are asked to leave their posts if they are suspected of corruption due to observations of their daily life, appearance, and actions. Therefore, if evidence of corruption is obtained, we will cooperate with the police to take legal action against the employee, even if he has already left the Bureau. The Bureau has already taken severe measures against merchants who seek excessive profits or violate price limits, so it goes without saying that employees of the Bureau should be dealt with severely.

Merchants Must Not Attempt to Bribe

The Bureau will continue to do its best to cultivate a clean and honest atmosphere among its employees, thereby proving the rumors that employees of this office abuse their positions to be untrue. However, maintaining a clean and honest atmosphere cannot be achieved without the full cooperation of the citizens. It is hoped that merchants will exercise self-restraint and not bribe employees of this office in an attempt to evade penalties or operate illegally. It must be understood that one bribery case is enough to affect the reputation and credibility of millions of people. The Bureau has always notified citizens to pay attention to those who impersonate employees of the Materials Control Office and not to be fooled by them. These swindlers have not yet disappeared, and it is hoped that all parties concerned will pay great attention to them.

Procedures for Issuing Removal Permits Can Be Inquired About

Finally, regarding the work of the Bureau's removal permit office, I would like to explain as follows: Currently, only two items, cotton yarn and cotton cloth, require a removal permit. The issuance of removal permits is very systematic, so that employees have no opportunity to engage in corruption. Outside rumors that a certain amount of money must be paid to apply for this permit are purely nonsense. Those who spread such rumors have other intentions. Citizens who are still unclear about applying for a yarn and cloth removal permit should contact the Materials Control Office of this Bureau at Office No. 191 for inquiries."

### All Citizens Must Be Injected Before the 18th – Disease Prevention Campaign Enters Third Week

The citywide disease prevention campaign has entered its third week. More than 10,000 residents of this city have been injected. The relevant authorities will intensify their efforts to ensure that all residents of the city receive preventative injections before May 18.

A Glimpse of the Work in Various Districts of the City

In order to strengthen the effectiveness of the disease prevention campaign, the authorities of the Public Concession launched a street cleaning campaign last Saturday. The health authorities of the French Concession will increase the number of injection teams by fifteen, for a total of twenty-one, and send them to densely populated areas to help the Baojia organizations provide services. The first phase of the disease prevention campaign in the Binbei District has ended, and the second phase will begin today, with special publicity to explain how to improve hygiene, maintain cleanliness, and prevent disease.

The Hudong Area is Planning to Establish a Pandemic Hospital

The Hudong area is full of factories, densely populated, and mostly poor. Once they get sick, they will be helpless. There is no pandemic hospital or isolation hospital in the Hudong area, which has a large population. In case of an emergency, patients must be sent to the city center for treatment, but at this time, when there is a lack of fast cars, it is very inconvenient. It is now heard that Yuan Judeng and Wang Boyuan of Wenlanting are organizing a Chinese pandemic hospital, which is being prepared in the Hudong area. It has been supported by the authorities, and it is hoped that gentlemen from all walks of life will do their best to help make this a voluntary effort and benefit the sick.

Physical Examination for Chinese Nannies

In order to maintain the health of infants, a certain pharmaceutical school in Shanghai conducted physical examinations of infants in the Hongkou district last Saturday. In the past, an infant in the Hongkou district died of tuberculosis. After examination, it was discovered that the disease was transmitted by a Chinese nanny. Tomorrow and the day after, 1,000 nannies employed by Japanese residents in the Hongkou district will continue to be examined.

### Automobile Fuel Allocation – Apply Within One Week

According to news from the Traffic and Air Defense Section of the Police Headquarters of the Joint Concession Public Works Bureau, the allocation of fuel to automobiles or freight vehicles (trucks) equipped with charcoal or coal engines was announced in the Bureau's Announcement No. 6294. The car owners have already filled out the application forms, and everything is now in sight, and it will be implemented soon. However, most car owners have not yet received the application forms for June. The section intends to deprive those who have not applied of their allocation quota starting from the 11th of this month.

### City Authorities Disapprove of Rickshaw Price Increase

Regarding the case of increasing rickshaw fares, it is reported that the city authorities are still studying the matter because the amount of the increase requested by the rickshaw companies is too large. At a time when the authorities are trying their best to suppress prices, in order to take care of the business of each company and avoid increasing the burden on passengers, they cannot but consider both aspects. The rickshaw guild recently published a notice in the newspaper that it had been ordered to increase fares. The city authorities stated that they had not approved it, so how could the guild claim to have been "ordered?" They have been ordered to correct it. They have also been instructed to continue to collect fares according to the old rules until they have been approved, in order to emphasize the power of the law.

### City Education Bureau Holds Japanese Teacher Training Course – Selects and Assigns Eighty People to Attend

With the assistance of the Shanghai Japanese Language Education Research Association, the City Education Bureau will hold the first session of the Japanese language teacher training course for primary and secondary schools from May 1 to June 30. Eighty current Chinese Japanese language teachers from public and private primary and secondary schools will be selected and assigned to attend. The venue will be at the Xinhuan Middle School on Chongqing Road. The class time will be from 3:00 PM to 6:30 PM and from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM on Sunday mornings. Each Japanese language teacher will attend the class for one day, and the association will provide transportation expenses every day, as well as free books and lecture notes. Director Lin of the Education Bureau will serve as the president of the association. The opening ceremony will be held on May 1, and classes will officially begin on May 2. The list of responsible personnel and lecturers of the association is as follows: 1. President: Director Lin of the Education Bureau. 2. Dean: Ma Jinren. Deputy Dean: Arima Heizo Saburo. 3. Secretary: Ma Bingnan. 4. Lecturers: Nakagawa Kunimasa, Tokushima Toshihisa, Migaki Nobutaka, Morisawa Kaoru, Abe Bunji.

### Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Cooperative – Full Allocation, Severe Punishment for Refusal to Sell – Personnel Will Soon Be Dispatched to the Suburbs of Shanghai to Implement

In order to fully distribute cigarettes and maintain city sales, the Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Cooperative stipulates that the goods will be dispatched three times a month, in the first, middle, and last ten days. It was recently announced that the fourth phase of dispatch will begin on the 5th, and all wholesalers and retailers have been notified to pay and pick up the goods at the distribution centers and Da Tong Bank. From now on, the dispatched goods will be sold in ten days, with one-tenth being sold on average every day. In order to prevent hoarding, reselling, and profiteering, the business of each distributor will be strictly supervised. All supervisors have been mobilized to check whether distributors are hoarding or refusing to sell. Those who violate the regulations will be given penalties such as suspension of distribution or forced closure, depending on the severity of the circumstances. Anyone who discovers that any licensed cigarette sales store has illegal refusal to sell behavior is allowed to report to the cooperative or the nearest police station for investigation.

Amount of Fourth Phase Dispatch Increased Appropriately

In view of the fact that the demand for cigarettes exceeds the supply, the cooperative has appropriately increased the amount of the fourth phase dispatch. The goods are distributed in a four-level system of A, B, C, and D. The goods distributed include products from Zhonghua Tobacco Company, China Tobacco Company, and Huashang Datong, Fuxin, Nanyang, and Huacheng factories. The goods are only sold at the licensed stores and absolutely no illegal acts such as reselling are allowed. The supervisors are very serious in their random inspections, and they have prepared sales reports for each store for verification. The dispatch of goods in the suburbs of Shanghai will be implemented this month, and all registration matters for wholesalers have been completed. The dispatch of goods in other parts of Huazhong will be handled by the local branch of the cooperative. The selling price of cigarettes is completely the same everywhere, so after the cooperative's organization is sound, the cigarette black market will inevitably disappear, and resellers will have no profit to make.

Person in Charge Talks About Cigarette Price Limits

According to the person in charge of the Tobacco Cooperative, the cooperative has been ordered to handle cigarette distribution for a short time, but it is working hard and does not dare to be selfish. However, it is suffering from registered merchants who refuse to comply with the price limits for selling cigarettes and falsely claim that the cigarette price limits have not yet been announced. This statement is actually specious. The cooperative has long announced the price of cigarettes. The price of some cigarettes that have not yet been announced will be announced in the shortest possible time. If any wholesaler or retailer sells cigarettes at a price that does not conform to the publicly set price, the cooperative will fulfill its responsibilities and severely punish them, and it is hoped that the police authorities and people from all walks of life will provide assistance.

Manipulation and Forced Purchase Should Be Eliminated

Cigarette distribution has already been implemented, but ordinary smokers have not yet received the benefit of distributed cigarettes at parity prices. The sale of parity-priced cigarettes is either manipulated by retail stores or snatched up by those who rely on force to "squeeze purchases." In addition to striving for fair distribution, the distribution authorities will eliminate this phenomenon.

### Shen Bao Reader Scholarship – Donation Report

### Announcement of the Opening of the "National Forum" in This Newspaper

A newspaper is the mouthpiece of the people, and public opinion is a reflection of the will of the people. Based on this point of view, this newspaper has opened a "Reader Forum" and publicly provided space for readers to convey their opinions. However, reviewing the content, we feel that it is mostly biased towards local issues. In order to further expand the scope, it will be renamed "National Forum" from now on. As the name implies, it is not difficult for us to understand the purpose. All suggestions and criticisms related to politics, economy, education, culture, and social undertakings that are constructive are welcome. Once disclosed, a generous reward will be given. However, due to the limited space, the number of words in the submitted articles should be within 2,000 words. We hope you will understand.

### National Forum – Banning the Nanshi Gambling Houses

— Wu Chengkang

At a time when public opinion is unanimously demanding that silk speculation and the hoarding of opium and gambling be banned, the government authorities have already heeded the public's wishes and thoroughly investigated the speculators in Shanghai. Although it still needs to continue to work hard to achieve the expected results, this alone is enough to make the treacherous merchants feel cold and frightened, and slightly restrain their rampant and fierce flames, which makes us sing praises!

The Nanshi gambling houses, which have the same harm as speculation and hoarding, have not yet heard of any action from the authorities and are still allowed to exist逍遥. According to statistics, an average of 60 people per day go bankrupt and become beggars because of this. The increasing number of criminal cases in this city is mostly related to gambling. We are very sorry about this.

What is most surprising is the "Special Club Management Office" specially established to manage the gambling dens. Huang Huang's notice is posted at the entrance of each gambling house, saying something like "Those without identity cards are not allowed to enter" and "Those with improper behavior are strictly prohibited from entering the venue." Armed personnel are stationed at the door to protect the safety of the gambling house, which is really puzzling.

We ask the authorities to think again: Is it a smart move to spend a lot of money to maintain local治安while simultaneously protecting the existence of these "dens of sin," which in effect commits the suspicion of trapping the people in crime? In Shanghai, which is known as the largest city in China and is connected to international views, and at a time when various countries are returning concessions and abandoning extraterritorial rights, seeing such a contradictory phenomenon is unacceptable in any case.

It cannot be denied and cannot be denied that the existence of the Nanshi gambling houses has its complex reasons, which have gradually developed. The biggest of these is of course the economic reason; but we do not believe that gambling donations will be included in the local budget, let alone the central budget, then the so-called economic reason is still an unspeakable thing!

Therefore, if you do not talk about refreshing politics, then you are already talking about it; if you do not seek to win the hearts of the people, then you are already talking about it. Otherwise, after cracking down on speculation in Shanghai, the next thing to do is to ban the Nanshi gambling houses. "It is better for one family to cry than for everyone to cry." We pray that the authorities will understand this purpose and quickly implement this virtuous policy that all people look forward to!

### Adjustment of Store Prices Must Be Approved by the Public Works Bureau – First Passed by the Evaluation Committee of the Guild – Those Who Increase Prices Without Authorization Will Be Dealt With After Investigation

If the company or store in this city, regardless of whether its business nature is (wholesale or retail), wants to adjust the price due to cost reasons, it must submit a table to the trade association in advance with its store name, address, type of goods, purchase price, and selling price, and state the reasons. After being approved by the evaluation committee of the guild and approved by the Materials Control Office of the Public Works Bureau, the selling price can be changed. If the selling price is increased without the above procedures, it will be dealt with upon discovery.

### Printed Proofs Must Be Submitted for Inspection

The Criminal and Special High Section of the Laozha Police Station previously ordered all printing shops in its jurisdiction to submit samples of printed materials to the section for inspection after completing their daily work before they can be issued to customers. It has now been found that many people are complying with this order, but some printing shops inevitably disobey it to avoid trouble. The section recently explained to the shop owners again that they must strictly comply in the future, otherwise they will be severely punished if discovered.

### Investigation of Food Distribution

In order to thoroughly understand the situation of food distribution in various districts of the city government, the Food Department has specially created a survey form and ordered the food administration office of the city food bureau to conduct a detailed survey and fill in the following items separately: (1) Issue number, (2) Number of days per issue, (3) Population number, (4) White rice, (5) Broken rice, (6) Corn, (7) Flour, (8) Miscellaneous grains, etc. Among the above eight items, items (4) to (8) all include the quantity, selling price, cost, and source of each type of rice and grain that is allocated and sold per issue.

Food Rationing for the 12th Issue Has Been Determined in the Urban Area

The 4,520 bags of white rice or red rice for the 12th issue of food rations for the first and second districts of the Huxi District are expected to be available for sale this weekend. The household rice for the 11th issue was all red rice, and because the price of rice on the black market has fallen, most citizens have been slow to go to purchase it.

There is no change in the selling price of the 12th issue of food rationing in the urban area. Each person, regardless of age, is entitled to two liters of rice, all of which is Du rice. Only in the Nanshi District is Du rice combined with Xian rice.

### The Science of Victory　(4)

The reason why the Japanese army and navy achieved great victories in the Greater East Asia War was not only due to the bravery and loyalty of the soldiers but also to the excellent scientific weapons supplied to the battlefield, such as airplanes, tanks, guns, various, as well as food, medicine, construction materials, and so on. On the army side, the Second Army Technical Achievement Medal was awarded to the inventors of such victorious weapons. Here are the award winners and the main inventors: (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, April 17)

Invention of New Mosquito Coil

…Army Captain Tiáncūn…

Captain Tiáncūn Xiǎng, Chief of the Procurement Section of the Osaka Branch of the Army Quartermaster Factory, is a well-known authority on maritime affairs. The captain is the owner of Tiáncūn Trading Company, a trading company in Kōbe, the president of Japan Rice Milling and Flour Milling Company, and also holds the official position of Deputy Head of the Hyōgo Prefecture Youth Corps, which is somewhat strange for an active-duty soldier. Called to serve at the Osaka Quartermaster Factory, his task was to improve pyrethrum products and investigate their prices.

He began studying products at Shiseido Chemical Industry in Minoshima Town, Wakayama City, and the Imperial Pyrethrum Company. He found the past spiral mosquito coils troublesome because they had to be bent one by one by hand to form a circle, so he wondered how they could be produced by machine. In order to accomplish the task he had in mind, he began working hard with his employees to research this new work. Later, he discovered that a rectangular shape for the mosquito coil had a wider burning area than a circular shape and was more convenient for extrusion machine production. In addition, mosquito coils are only lit when there are many mosquitoes, so at first, they should produce more smoke, and finally, it is enough to keep mosquitoes from biting. This was his own experience, so he made the front end of the mosquito coil thicker and the tail end thinner, which also had the effect of saving costs. At the same time, he made the mosquito coil like a two-headed snake, with the front end divided into two heads, hoping to achieve the effect of producing smoke at first.

In addition, the form of the mosquito coil like the past clamping type, often extinguished halfway, so he put a small hole in the end of the mosquito coil, put in a thin piece of foil, so that it will burn well, and at the same time based on his own experience and attention to mechanization, he invented a machine for mass production of mosquito coils. Due to this production relationship, labor can be reduced by 25%, volume can be reduced by 25%, and the circular shape of the mosquito coil is changed to a rectangular shape, and its transportation force is increased by more than 20%. The southern army, which was well-served by mosquito groups, welcomed the new type of mosquito coil invented by Captain Tiáncūn.

Research on the Progressive Operation Method of Aircraft Production

…Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Nagoya Aircraft Manufacturing Plant Engineer Sasaki Wataru (37 years old) plus collaborators…

Sasaki, who won the championship, was selected from the typical team of Japanese technicians in the past, which means that he is not only a technical trainer, but he loves technology and takes technology as his second life. Undertaking this research, he was so absorbed in his work that he forgot to eat, shared the difficulties with his subordinates, and worked desperately. Last summer, he finally fell ill and is now hospitalized for recuperation, but he stubbornly said to his colleagues, "I can't work with this kind of illness, it's really unreasonable," so he continued to bury himself in research while still in his sickbed. In the past, production technology in Japan was managed by foremen, so the productivity of each person could not be improved, which was several times lower than that of Germany. This kind of state would continue for a long time. In order to improve the productivity of each person, it is necessary to improve technology and job management. In order to realize this point, government and civilian technicians will spend the greatest effort. Especially in aircraft production, the construction of the airframe occupies an important factor, so after improving its job management, it actually received the effect of expanding production.

Sasaki has been engaged in this research since 1932. First, he made employees understand true technology and trained them to become cadres and employees serving the empire. Then, he continued for a year to conduct basic investigations for research. Finally, in September 1941, he completed the "Progressive Operation Method of Aircraft Production." According to this production method, the productivity has increased by 0%, which really adds a lot of glory to the Japanese army's aircraft production. This research is also expected to be properly adopted in all production ranges. Due to the adoption of this method, aircraft factories across the country are developing rapidly, which is a great contribution to the army aircraft that expands production and defeats the Anglo-Saxon nation. The authorities are further improving the technical management in the engine and other departments according to this research in order to strengthen production.

### Economic Circles　Commentary　Consumer Self-Defense

Under the heavy pressure of soaring prices and rising living expenses, the general consumer, in addition to appealing to the government to intervene to lower prices and reduce living expenses, can only make up his mind and unite to resist those who hoard and speculate.

In recent years, there have been so-called consumer alliances in various countries, which are used to resist the exploitation and exorbitant profits of producers, such as the British Anti-Corn Law League from 1839, the American Anti-Meat Trust League before the First World War, the German Anti-Beer Trust League, and the French Anti-Gas Trust League. In addition, the establishment of temperance societies, anti-smoking societies, abstinence societies, vegetarian societies, simple clothing societies, anti-killing societies, and consumer social alliances by socially conscious people around the world is not only aimed at safeguarding the self-interests of consumers, but also at maintaining the morals of the world.

Recently, the rise of the consumer cooperative movement in Shanghai has a momentum of wind and clouds. In addition, consumers have risen up to resist hoarding tigers, which is a kind of automatic behavior, and we deeply sympathize with it.

However, we feel that in this chaotic world, large and small hoarding tigers are as numerous as carps crossing the river. The best way for us general consumers to deal with them is probably to save on consumption. No matter how the hoarding price stimulates people's hearts and raises it every day, we must not panic because of this and rush to buy it. Let the top-grade leather shoes rise to one thousand and several hundred yuan a pair, the top-grade bicycles, eight thousand yuan a piece, the top-grade carpets, twelve thousand yuan a piece; let them get dizzy and rise! Let the general hoarding tigers make a fortune of national crisis on empty paper! When peace comes in the near future and prices plummet, what will be the result of the hoarding tigers who now think they are invincible?

### Revitalizing Rural Finance　Government Conducts Large-Scale Rural Loans　Amount Accounts for One-Fifth of Bank Deposits

In order to revitalize the countryside and enhance production, the Ministry of Finance has assigned the Transportation Bank to handle the revitalization of rural loans. The bank has sent personnel to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Kunshan in Jiangsu Province, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Xiashi in Zhejiang Province, and Wuhu, Bengbu in Anhui Province along the two railway lines to investigate the rural situation and planting conditions as a guideline for rural loans. The investigation work has now been completed, and a complete plan for rural loans is being drafted, which will be submitted to the Ministry for approval and then implemented step by step.

Four Rules for Loans

The organization will also send investigators to investigate the rural economic situation in (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui), and then each bank and village will determine the loan amount. The methods are stipulated as follows: (1) The target of rural mortgage loans is rural mortgages; (2) The target of rural warehouse mortgage loans is agricultural warehouses; (3) The target of loans for cattle and agricultural tools is limited to farmers who have joined rural cooperatives; (4) The target of loans for green seedlings is limited to farmers of agricultural cooperatives.

Lowering Rural Loan Interest Rates

The banks will also intend to follow the laws and regulations of the authorities, using one-fifth of the total deposits as agricultural loan funds. In order to assist this undertaking, the authorities will do their best to lower the interest rate on rural loan funds to help revitalize rural production.

Loan Amount Reaches Tens of Millions of Yuan

It is also learned that the total amount of deposits of member banks in this city's banking industry is 190 million yuan, and the total amount of deposits of member money shops in the Money Exchange Industry Association is 60 million to 65 million yuan. If calculated by one-fifth of the banking industry's 190 million yuan deposit, the total amount of loan funds can reach tens of millions of yuan. Therefore, the recent 500,000 yuan loan established by various banks and China Silk Industry Co., Ltd. is entirely for the purpose of helping the company purchase spring cocoons and develop the silk industry.

### Implementing Wartime Economic Policy　Grain Industry Five-Industry Federation　To Be Fully Established Around the 10th of This Month

In order to implement the wartime economic policy and strengthen the control mechanism of the grain industry, the Ministry of Food has supervised the reorganization of the six industry associations (miscellaneous grains, flour, animal husbandry, edible oil, sugar, eggs). Those in the Shanghai area have been organized and established before April 30 as scheduled. Regarding the joint association of these six industries, the Ministry of Food originally scheduled to complete the organization uniformly on the 5th of this month. Among them, in addition to the National Flour Industry Joint Association, which was established on the 2nd of this month, there are also five industry joint associations (miscellaneous grains, flour, animal husbandry, edible oil, and eggs), which are also actively preparing to complete the organization within the deadline. However, the Ministry of Food authorities believe that the industry associations in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have not yet been organized and established, so they ordered that after the industry associations in various places are completely established, the founding meeting of the joint association will be convened so that the industry associations in various places can send responsible representatives to participate in the meeting and expect the organization of the joint association to be sound. It is heard that the industry associations in various places can be fully established in three to five days at the latest, and the five-industry joint association can be established separately around the 10th of this month.

### Industry and Commerce Association Federation　Reorganize Grassroots Associations　Reorganization and Establishment Limited to the End of May

In order to implement the wartime economic policy outline and adjust economic opportunities, the National Government authorities promulgated the Industry and Commerce Association Implementation Regulations, ordering the competent authorities to supervise and adjust the original major commodity, industry and commerce associations in accordance with the regulations, and reorganize or organize them to adapt to the new system of the wartime economic institutions. After receiving the order, the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau has designated (1) the cotton industry, (2) the yarn number industry, (3) the cotton weaving factory industry, (4) the cloth industry, (5) the grain number industry, (6) the coal ball industry, (7) the New Asia industry, (8) the industrial grease industry, (9) the match soap candle industry, and (10) the tobacco industry. The initiators of the industry associations have first set a deadline for organization. The established industry associations have already handled the re-registration and membership procedures for new and old members. Because the Economic Bureau stipulates that companies and firms that have not joined the industry associations as members will be suspended from business from May 1, the companies and firms in each industry have gone to the respective industry associations to handle membership registration procedures to protect their business rights and interests. The above ten industry associations have now been reorganized and established, and they intend to start handling the membership organization of the sixteen industry association federations designated by the Ministry of Industry. According to reports from the Ministry of Industry, the industry associations under the sixteen industry association federations designated by the Ministry of Industry will be reorganized into a new system of wartime economic institutions. Therefore, after the reorganization and establishment of the ten industry associations handled by the Economic Bureau, the other industry associations belonging to the federation will be supervised by the Economic Bureau to reorganize and establish them within this (May) month in order to participate in the material control, raw material purchase, allocation, sales, manufacturing, and all other rights in the lower-level institutions under the Chamber of Commerce.

### Translated Commentary　Expectations for Rural Finance

Discussions on increasing wartime agricultural production are frequently mentioned, but there are still many problems in the stage of investigation and research, and they have not been realized as concrete countermeasures. However, only in the financial aspect, there are organizations such as the Rural Financial Group and the agricultural overdraft of the Central Reserve Bank, which are all measures to enhance agricultural production and are worthy of attention.

Looking at the current financial situation in rural areas, we can only rely on pawn shops and cooperative societies to mobilize a little capital. At the same time, there are also some personal loans from business owners and loans of existing goods from merchants, but the numbers are small and the interest rates are too high, so this kind of loan does not have the characteristics of increasing production capital, but only loans for farmers to overcome temporary difficulties. The biggest issue in Chinese agriculture today is how to get the capital for increasing production to reach the countryside, how to enrich irrigation equipment and plowing cattle, and how to purchase fertilizer. But fortunately, the assistance of the Ministry of Finance authorities has approached the direction of resolution, which is a happy thing.

Although it is not clear in what form the current Rural Financial Group provides loans, in short, it follows these few realities: first, extremely low interest rates; second, long loan periods; third, the loan targets are not wealthy rural households, but ordinary people. In the past, the local loans of the Central Reserve Bank and other banks seemed to charge too high interest rates, so those who could use their loans were not farmers and real producers, but only those businesses that used these loans to lend at high interest rates. The interest rate on the capital that farmers can use for production should be at most about 1% per annum. At the same time, the loan period should be at least ten years or more. If it is capital used to build irrigation tools or plowing cattle, it should be repaid in three to five years on a regular basis.

What we most hope from the authorities is that rural loans must not cultivate high-interest loans in rural areas. If the loans are only targeted at so-called wealthy people, or if emphasis is placed on collateral, then the capital will inevitably flow into the hands of the wealthy, and the result will be to promote the wealthy's high-interest exploitation of borrowing and lending. Although it is difficult to lend to poor people who have no collateral, it is not impossible. We should think of ways to use cooperatives and even the actual loans of plowing cattle and other categories to help rural areas.

In any case, it is always a welcome phenomenon that the financial community can focus on rural loans. The National Government authorities should further promote this trend, and at the same time, force various banks to stipulate that a certain percentage of their total loans should be rural loans. This may not be a good method. We urgently hope that we will actively strive to focus on rural finance. (Yún Péng: Translated from the Continental New Daily, May 3)

### Counterfeit

— Zhōu Sù

I heard that there are counterfeit "× Flower Brand" cosmetics. Why would anyone want to buy counterfeits? However, people do want to buy them, and the sales are not bad! Because: the counterfeits are "almost indistinguishable from the real thing," and they are simply indistinguishable from the real thing. -- This really surprises the ignorant.

However, in any case, it can also be seen here the "greatness" of the Chinese people's imitation ability. It is just a pity that this "great" imitation ability is not used in other useful undertakings, but is simply drilling into some unimportant dead ends. This is not only not admirable, but also feels quite sad and shameful.

However, this guilt cannot be entirely attributed to the manufacturers of counterfeit cosmetics: if these "lovers of decoration" were not so fond of imported goods, if they had the psychology and action of loving domestic goods, the rampant counterfeiting would certainly not be so great.

If we just imitate others and follow behind them, we will always only be "subordinate to others," and there will be no day to "compete with them," let alone think of running ahead of others and becoming their leader.

Not only is imitating cosmetics like this, but in art, science, industry, and commerce, if we just imitate, if we just "imitate brands," if we just pick up the scraps of others' ideas, if we don't want to create at all, if we don't have any independent spirit, we will just have to follow behind others forever and be a laggard.

### Random Talks on Suicide

— Zhen Diao Ge

If you hear of a suicide case where the truth is unclear, you will definitely guess the reason for the suicide: if the person was a big businessman, you would guess that he failed in speculation; if he was a young person, you would assume he was disappointed in love; if she was a 19th-century woman, you would assume she couldn't bear the abuse from her in-laws; however, these are just the general superficial reasons that we generally know.

Suicide is very common in today's world. In the United States, an average of one person commits suicide every half hour. Even in our Shanghai, according to newspaper statistics, it is also very common.

The statistics in European and American countries are indeed very interesting: most suicide victims are unemployed, relatively educated, and middle-aged people around 39 years old. The age of suicide ranges from as low as fourteen or fifteen years old to as high as seventy years old. Regarding the gender of suicide victims, men are more than three times more likely to commit suicide than women. The season for suicide is generally most common in summer and least common in winter.

Regarding the tools of suicide, women are generally gentle and men are straightforward: of course, they are also progressing. In the past, most women committed suicide by hanging themselves, but now they use sleeping pills, lysol, and opium instead. Even recently, they have used other chemical substances to commit suicide. The suicide methods for men are mostly jumping from buildings, jumping into the sea, and using guns. There is also another statistic: when the coffin of a person who committed suicide by eating opium is reopened, the body has been moved in four or five out of ten cases.

According to psychological explanations, the main cause of suicide is the extremely complex subconsciousness lurking deep in the mind. The occurrence of this effect starts as early as childhood: when a child wants something and does not get it, he will develop a hatred psychology! If he encounters this situation without stopping, it will keep increasing, and eventually, the hatred will turn into a murderous abnormality. This psychology lurks, and if it encounters external stimulation, coupled with the loss of self-control, thoughts of murder will occur. If the murder fails, he will commit suicide. Therefore, many experts have said, "One will not commit suicide without harboring the intention to kill."

The method of preventing suicide: that is, in childhood, eliminate as much as possible all factors that can cause mental anxiety. For adults, there are methods to increase self-cultivation and supplement it with mental comfort.

### "Ideals"

— Qing Jun

Views and opinions on ideals seem to vary. Some people regard ideals as an impossible thought, like a sentence we often hear: "Hey, you are too idealistic about this matter:" contained in this tone, there are clearly two different emotions, one is well-intentioned persuasion, and the other is malicious mockery: of course, this needs to be determined from the speaker's attitude and emotion.

Treating ideals as "fantasy" or "imagination" - it is the value of a transcendent, progressive idea that can be put into practice is dismissed without consideration. I believe that anyone who holds this view is a fool's thought: otherwise, this person is either an idiot, or his brain has already lost the ability to think.

Therefore, when correctly and reasonably explaining the two words of ideal, I feel that an ideal should be something that exists based on the real world, and through someone's thinking, dissolved in the accumulation of this person's life experience, and then created an ideal through the judgment of his thinking organization. Then, this ideal is based on all the unsatisfactory phenomena in the real world, or a facility that should be thoroughly reformed, and becomes a planned and created sublime "plan."

In this way, an ideal is not only not a fantasy or imagination, but an engine that organically promotes society, even the world, and the progress of all mankind. In this way, if there is no transcendent, progressive, perfect ideal that improves the unsatisfactory aspects of this world, then this world will only decay day by day, and eventually head towards the path of destruction, and the people in this world will not have a trace of vitality.

Therefore, we should welcome the correct existence of ideals in everyone's thought system. And the fact that most people today have a positive and brave spirit towards the world, walking towards the light, we cannot but attribute this to the greatness of ideals. Otherwise, the number of world-weary people in the world would probably increase many times over?

In short, we should have planned ideals, cultivate the development and growth of these ideals, so that there will be a bright future for the whole world and all mankind. However, ideals are a matter of principle, and the most important thing is the word "do," otherwise, empty ideals are still difficult to put into practice.

### The Soliloquy of Depression

— Meng Niu

I don't know why, but I've been getting more and more depressed lately! My friends go out laughing and want me to go too, but I plead, "You guys go!"

Despondency, selfishness, indifference, anxiety, lethargy... Ah! These many strange nouns used to just flash by my ears, but now they are all added to me. They are like countless steel needles, flying towards my heart one by one, and I feel terrified and don't know how to deal with them.

Every day, every day, I just face the window, look at the sky, watch the flowing clouds, soaring birds, the terrifyingly blue sky, and the thin treetops in the distance... My friends say I've "changed," they all say I've "changed." "Change" is another strange name.

They advised me to go for a walk outside, and I agreed and followed them. I walked with my head down, counting every stone, staring at every blade of grass, every grain of sand, and every speck of dust on the road. They seemed to be talking excitedly and laughing. I looked up at them, and they laughed even harder, and I seemed to be laughing too, but I didn't know what they were talking about.

One day, an old professor said to me like this: "Negativity is a youth disease, a poisonous disease that buries youth. You are young now and most vulnerable to this poisonous demon's attack. You are dissatisfied with reality, and the surrounding environment is oppressing you. You must resist with all your might. But, unfortunately, you have been subdued by this poisonous demon. In its giant palm, you are like a defeated rooster, crouching in a corner, powerless. However, your heart is still burning, the embers have not yet been extinguished, and in the future, it will still be able to spew out a raging fire of ten thousand feet. So I hope you work hard to protect and nurture the embers that are about to die out, because this is your priceless treasure - at the same time, you must cheer up and focus on your work, you should go to the practical side, and not go on the path of fantasy. Remember: 'Youth is the spring of life.'"

I nodded silently.

### Stimulation

— Luo Chaifu

Only a sharp "thorn" can "stimulate" his inner strength. "Suffering is the seed of "happiness," and this seed will not sprout and grow luxuriantly unless it struggles through the harsh cold of winter and kills all the underground pests.

"Stimulation" is a seasoning in life. Without it, people will live a mediocre life. The more stimulation, the wider the experience. The so-called "experience" is the accumulation of facing stimulation every time.

We are all victors of opposition. When stimulation comes, we must calmly respond. If there is no resistance, we will have no way to consolidate our will, like a big tree, after thousands of storms, it will not only not be broken, but also become more and more consolidated.

Sarcasm, ridicule, humiliation, contempt... are the best kinds of stimulation. As long as we have courage, even though these are like sand, we must learn from the spirit of clams, and we will forge pearls.

### Talking About "Wealth"

— Shao Da

"People die for wealth" has become a common saying among later generations. In fact, this is only a seemingly correct statement. The meaning contained in this sentence is too general, neither pointing out what kind of person, nor saying what kind of wealth. It is not appropriate to include all people and wealth in the world with just the four words "people die for wealth."

"People die for wealth," indeed many people have entered its cage. For the sake of wealth, they do not hesitate to sacrifice their own lives, sell out the affection of their fellow beings, do evil, harm others and harm themselves. However, although its power is great, it still cannot encompass all the people in the world. Looking back at the history of China and foreign countries, the deaths of many great heroes and patriots did not die here. Wealth can certainly make people die, but which of "faith, righteousness, propriety, shame, morality, fidelity, filial piety, and ambition" is not worth making people regard death as home?

### Appearance and Interior

— Hu Ruoliu

Henry David Thoreau said: "If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away." We believe that the purity and flawlessness of the interior creates the shining light of the exterior; however, most people pursue the exterior and never pay attention to the interior.

We see in today's society that many people are pursuing the exterior and neglecting the enrichment of the interior. Therefore, on the surface, it looks like a person, but you don't know that it's a "fancy pillow and rotten straw"! They only look at the exterior.

Therefore, a person with real knowledge and talent must start his cultivation from the interior: first pursue the enrichment and cultivation of the interior, so that the interior creates a pure and flawless soul, and then the exterior will naturally shine brightly.

### Silken Threads Collection

— Jian Ping

A vain person can only get a small amount of sincere enjoyment.

Timidity is the key to defeat.

When you are at the end of your rope, it is the time for new life.

Those who put their dreams into practice are the successful people in their careers.

Those who want to be quick will certainly not achieve their goals.

Hesitation cannot turn facts into reality.

Those who like to slander others will be lonely for the rest of their lives.

"Humility" is a good teacher for seeking knowledge and learning.

Happiness gained from suffering is true happiness.

### "Philosophy" · "Life"

— Hai Lin

To truly understand the value and meaning of something, one cannot rely solely on the monotonous changes of facts and their appearance, but must study the causes and effects of facts and the truth hidden within them. This is what "philosophy" includes. If life is separated from philosophy, it is a meaningless life, and similarly, if philosophy is separated from life, it is also of no value.

Philosophy is not a mysterious thing, it is just a specialized discipline that studies people's daily lives. Philosophy can portray the right and wrong of real life, and find a way for you to live your life, so that "life" is not wasted.

To study philosophy, one must have the spirit of "breaking the casserole and asking to the end." Only with this spirit can one discover "life." For example, if you catch a robber, ordinary people will immediately send him to the authorities for prosecution, but those who study philosophy are different. They want to study why he became a robber? Why doesn't society have other jobs for him to do? Why can his inner vices overcome his virtues? … By asking these questions, he can further understand life, understand society, and become the insight of his philosophy. Therefore, philosophy is a kind of evolution from small things to big things, from the internal meaning. It is derived from the integration of real-world foundations, so-called political philosophy, social philosophy, life philosophy... are all derived from asking questions and clarifying them from life problems.

The great Greek philosopher Socrates once said, "The unexamined life is not worth living." Therefore, if you want to make life meaningful and live a rational life, you must evaluate your own life, study the relationship between society and ourselves, and have a "doubtful" spirit to explore the causes and effects of facts, so that "life" can embark on a reasonable track.

Have you ever examined your life? I think it is necessary for every "living person" to understand the value and meaning of their own life in this world!

### Establishing a Joint Guarantee Newspaper Reading Room

— Ye Suichu

Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce in our country, and a gathering place for culture. Although the popularization of newspaper reading is a small matter, it is actually very important. Newspapers contain detailed news, such as international current events, improvements in agriculture, industry, commerce, and learning, as well as common sense that everyone should have. However, there are many people in Shanghai who do not read newspapers, especially the general coolies and farmers who cannot afford to buy newspapers. They know nothing about world affairs, which leads to low intelligence and the agricultural and industrial products they produce are not improved, which affects the welfare of the people. It is not a superficial matter. To trace the cause, not paying attention to reading newspapers is one of the reasons. Therefore, it is advocated to use the Baojia organization, and the joint Bao chiefs should jointly initiate it. Each Lianbao should set up a newspaper rack and prepare various newspapers for public reading. The promotion should start from the urban area and extend to the countryside, so that ordinary people who cannot afford to buy newspapers can also see the news on the newspapers and increase their knowledge. This matter is easy to do, and I hope the Baojia authorities will pay attention to it.

### A Small Opinion on Group Weddings

— Jiu Hong

In recent years, there are many places in Shanghai that host group weddings, some are run by the government, some are run by private individuals, and some are run by organizations such as hometown associations, with no fewer than six or seven places. Group weddings are the only simple, economical, and solemn way now, especially when everyone gathers together, it is a rare coincidence. However, as time passes, everyone becomes strangers again. Although there is a group photo, it is still not easy to recognize each other. Such a rare encounter is scattered in an instant, which is a pity. Therefore, I suggest adding a mailing list, detailing the names, ages, native places, occupations, permanent addresses, etc. of each married person, and sending one copy to each person to maintain permanent contact. In the past, there was the friendship of "same year" and "same office," and this can also be called "same marriage" or "same joy." In the future, when celebrating silver wedding anniversaries, everyone can gather together again.

Secret Prescription for Quitting Smoking (1) Four catties of tender cottonwood bark, four taels of Eucommia ulmoides, four taels of Cordyceps sinensis, two taels of Fritillaria cirrhosa, one tael of licorice, one tael of Yunnan earth, grind these six herbs to fine powder and decoct them three times, filter out the residue, concentrate, and sieve. Then add half a catty of red sugar, melt it, sieve it again, and mix it over a low fire until it becomes a paste like opium. Burn the foam and put it in a pipe to replace opium, and smoke it as usual to satisfy the craving. After a long time, you will naturally quit without any pain, and you can work as usual, quitting smoking unconsciously. If you are traveling and it is inconvenient, you can make it into pills according to the prescription and carry them with you, which is even more convenient, but you must eat more for the first time to get drunk, so that you know how much to take each time in the future. (2) Preparation method: First, take two taels of cigarette ash, put it in a copper pot, add water and decoct it, let it boil in the front, do not stir it (the white foam floating on the surface of the pot during decoction is the foam, stirring it will cause the foam to disperse into the water). After decocting, sieve it to clarify it, then put the cigarette ash on the cage back into the pot and decoct it again, sieve it as before, and let it settle, decocting it five or six times in a row. If you think there is too much moisture, you can put the clarified cigarette water into the pot and decoct it slightly. When it is decocted to the size of a vegetable bowl, pour it out and set aside for later use. Take twenty taels of white rice, wash it clean and put it in a pot to stir-fry until it is hot, add one soup spoon of the clarified cigarette water and stir-fry again, adding it as you stir-fry, until all the cigarette water is used up (add only one soup spoon each time to make it easy to dry), grind the rice into a fine powder and put it in a porcelain jar. Dosage: Take one qian of powdered rice (containing one fen of tobacco substance) with brown sugar for each cigarette craving, take it half an hour before the craving, increase or decrease the amount according to your own size, always to the point where you feel comfortable. After taking the powdered rice, do not smoke again, and you must reduce the powdered rice once every day or three or five days, for example, those who take one qian each time should reduce it by one fen or several li, do not be impatient to seek quick results, but you must not stop reducing it, in order to eliminate the stubborn addiction, reduce it to the end, if your body is strong, you can stop taking it.
