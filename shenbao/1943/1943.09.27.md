### Expressions of Wartime Enterprise

There was a time when the American hat-making industry, due to mutual competition and unplanned production, fell into a tragic cycle of boom and bust. Because most capitalists at that time gathered and focused on the hat-making industry, believing it would be profitable, they each, without consulting each other, simultaneously established numerous hat factories, accelerating production. Subsequently, due to overproduction, sales stagnated; and because of stagnant sales, prices were cut for competitive sales, wages were reduced, workers were laid off, and the factories eventually could not sustain themselves, all heading toward ruin. After several years, hats became scarce again, and new competition arose in response. This formed a cycle of creation and destruction.

These American capitalists engaged in the hat-making industry, and it cannot be denied that they were pursuing a business. Their mutual competition and accelerated production cannot be denied as expressions of an entrepreneurial spirit. However, the result was that they all headed toward ruin due to overproduction and stagnant sales. Then, wasn't it harmed by the "entrepreneurial spirit"? In fact, that is not the case. Engaging in the hat-making industry was indeed pursuing a business; mutual competition and accelerated production were indeed expressions of an entrepreneurial spirit, but their failure was due to the "entrepreneurial spirit" not being complete!

A complete entrepreneurial spirit must have the spirit of striving for the success of the business with unwavering determination; for the purpose of the business, the desire to benefit oneself, benefit others, benefit society, and benefit the country; for the ideal of the business, the ambition to last forever; for the environment of the business, the method of adapting at any time to maintain survival.

Although American capitalists engaged in unplanned hat-making with an entrepreneurial spirit, their purpose was only to benefit themselves; their ideal was only to obtain huge profits in the short term; they could not adapt to the environment at any time. Everyone only knew how to compete with each other to obtain huge profits in the short term, without considering the future environment of mutual ruin due to overproduction; at the same time, having encountered the initial environment of stagnant sales, they failed to discuss adaptation methods with each other to maintain survival; and by deduction, they all headed toward ruin. Therefore, we say that the failure was due to the incompleteness of the "entrepreneurial spirit".

Of course, the "complete entrepreneurial spirit" mentioned above is not easy to achieve. However, for the success of personal undertakings, the success of social undertakings, and the success of national undertakings, everyone should hold this "complete entrepreneurial spirit" as a self-expectation. The scope of undertakings is extremely broad and large. Whether it is scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants, or even serving as officials and doing good deeds, they are all undertakings. It can also be said that everyone has their own undertaking. It is by no means only running factories and forming companies that count as undertakings.

We have a saying, "The predecessors plant the trees, and the descendants enjoy the shade." This saying, if interpreted positively, can be metaphorically used as the spirit of "entrepreneurial spirit". Because in order to facilitate the descendants to enjoy the shade, one must plant trees oneself. This is embracing the purpose of benefiting others; embracing the ideal of lasting forever, is a complete entrepreneurial spirit. During the late Qing Dynasty, Zuo Zongtang served as the Governor-General of Shaanxi and Gansu. For the sake of water conservancy in the desert areas, he planted willow trees, which are still convenient today. The local people are grateful for his continuous merits and call them Zuo Gong Willow. Zuo was an example of the expression of a "complete entrepreneurial spirit."

However, the above proverb, if interpreted negatively, is enough to be a portrayal of the entrepreneurial spirit of the general public today, because why should I work so hard to plant trees if it only makes it easier for future generations to enjoy the shade? With this kind of concept, the purpose of the undertaking is entirely based on the desire to benefit oneself, and even if the ideal of lasting forever is embraced, it is nothing more than planning for future generations. From the perspective of individuals, the undertaking may be successful, but from the perspective of society and the country, it is ultimately a failure.

All undertakings, in peacetime, already need the expression of an entrepreneurial spirit, and in wartime, they especially need the expression of an entrepreneurial spirit. Everything should be based on the national interest as a prerequisite. When personal interests conflict with national interests, personal interests should be absolutely abandoned. For example, the newly established Rice Control Committee is an undertaking that serves the people in wartime. Considering the scale of the organization and the complexity of personnel, of course, every staff member, especially the person in charge, needs to express an entrepreneurial spirit. First, there must be an unwavering spirit of striving for success; second, there must be an ambition to benefit the people and benefit the country; third, there must be a merit that lasts for a long time; fourth, there must be a method of adapting to the environment at any time.

We also sincerely offer "entrepreneurial spirit" to encourage ourselves and others, especially hoping that political leaders, social leaders, industrial leaders, and other leaders who have leadership responsibilities and play a model role, will pay special attention to it. The achievements of national and social undertakings in wartime rely on it!

### New Treaty Between Japan and Burma Formally Signed in Rangoon; Shan State and Karenni States Incorporated into Burmese Territory

Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - After declaring independence on August 1st, Burma decided on the basic policies for nation-building, embarked on the path of war and construction in accordance with these policies, and actively strengthened the wartime system at home to consolidate the position of an independent nation. Today, a new treaty was concluded between Japan and Burma in Rangoon on the 25th. According to this treaty, Shan State and Karenni States, as well as the Wa region, will be incorporated into Burmese territory. The area of the above-mentioned regions is about one-third of the territory of Burma proper, and the majesty of the new Burma will be further strengthened. This new agreement was formally signed by Burmese Prime Minister Ba Maw and Japanese Ambassador to Burma, Sawada, at 4:30 p.m. in the Burmese government auditorium. Those attending the ceremony on the Burmese side included Deputy Prime Minister Thakin Mya, Foreign Minister U Thein Nu, as well as the presidents and vice-presidents of the Privy Council and representatives of the indigenous peoples of Shan State and Karenni States. On the Japanese side were Consul-General Shimazu, rural Lt. General Naka, military attachés, and embassy staff. After the signing, Ambassador Sawada delivered a speech, and Prime Minister Ba Maw delivered a reply. The ceremony was then completed. As a result, Shan State, Karenni State, and the Wa region will abolish military administration this year and be directly under the jurisdiction of the Burmese government. Therefore, Burma will incorporate 46,950 square miles of territory. When Burma was independent, the area of its territory was 171,157 square miles. After the incorporation of these three places, it has increased to 218,107 square miles. The distance from north to south is 1,300 miles, and the distance from east to west is blank miles. The area of its territory ranks fourth among the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere countries. The population was previously more than 15 million, and with the addition of the newly incorporated territory, the residents are now about 16.6 million. The incorporation of Shan State into Burmese territory has the following important significance: The new territory has been completely separated from Burma for more than 50 years since the British conquered Burma. Now, it is incorporated into Burmese territory, and the east will be merged. Shan State has important resources such as minerals and timber. After being incorporated into Burmese territory, it will enhance Burma's national power in terms of economy, and it will also be beneficial to the development of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. After the people of Shan State and Karenni people are incorporated into Burma, the Burmese spirit of nation-building and the harmony of the nation have become the expected conditions. At the same time, Prime Minister Ba Maw's previously announced basic national policy for Burma can strengthen the foundation for establishing national mobilization. In the military aspect, it completes the geographical defense system of Burma against the Chongqing army in the north. Due to the unity of the Burmese nation, the promotion of national spirit, and the cooperation with Japan and its allies, Burma's determination to fight has entered a decisive stage.

### Ambassador Sawada's Congratulatory Remarks

Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Burma Sawada, after the signing of the Japan-Burma treaty, addressed Burmese national representative Prime Minister Ba Maw, saying: The treaty concluded between Japan and Burma this time incorporates all states of Shan State (excluding Kengtung and Mong Pan) and the Wa region into Burmese territory. The treaty has been signed by Burmese Prime Minister Ba Maw and Ambassador blank. Today is the day for Burma to celebrate its independence. It can be said that the signing of this meaningful treaty is a celebration with Heaven. This treaty is a manifestation of Japan's policy of righteousness based on the great ideal of creating a nation, with the goal of liberating East Asia and building a new world order. In order to complete Burma's independence, Japan not only provides all cooperation and support, but also signs this treaty in this spirit. Burma has been poisoned by the British policy of ethnic discord under British rule for the past half century. Now, after incorporating the new territory, all ethnic groups in Burma have become a natural entity. This move can be described as icing on the cake for Burma's independence, which is truly commendable. Therefore, this treaty is a pivotal point for promoting the unity between Japan and Burma. I deeply hope that the two countries will strengthen their mutual cooperation in the future and move forward with blank to complete the common war.

### Analysis of Soviet War Power (1) Translated from Allied World Weekly, No. 1223

Introduction

The unprecedented two-year-long German-Soviet war on the battlefields has now entered a critical juncture. Although the second winter counteroffensive of the Soviet army, which began on November 19th last year, suffered great losses in personnel and equipment, the Soviet army almost completely regained the territories lost in the German army's major offensive in the summer of last year. Moreover, the "Stalingrad Drama" was embellished in the middle, making Germany feel that it was really necessary to re-examine the Soviet war power. German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels recently wrote an article for a certain newspaper, saying: "At that time, Germany was in a state of near despair. Wasn't the autumn when the Soviet Union invaded the German mainland imminent! We all felt this impression deeply." He frankly admitted that Germany was in a major crisis of air in the winter war.

From Summer to Winter

However, Hitler's brave and decisive operations took effect. The German-Soviet winter war temporarily came to an end in late March. Germany's war situation was stabilized again. After that, the German and Soviet armies engaged in local positional battles. Although the German authorities repeatedly warned that the Soviet army's so-called "summer offensive" was about to begin, neutral blank and even the United Kingdom and the United States believed that the Soviet army, which had suffered heavy losses in personnel and equipment in the winter counteroffensive, would break the usual practice and start the summer offensive on its own. It was impossible.

In fact, the German-Soviet war is a kind of seesaw battle. In the summer, the German army took the offensive, and in the winter, the Soviet Union counterattacked. Because of the previous concept, it did not break the balance of the seesaw by the Soviet army and started the so-called summer offensive.

Soviet Union Breaks the Balance

Regarding the Soviet army's war power, Germany already needed to re-examine it. However, the Soviet army's offensive, which began at dawn on July 5, also urgently felt the need to re-evaluate the Soviet Union's resistance force within the anti-Axis line. In short, the fact that the Soviet army broke the previous balance and began to attack in the summer is worth caring about. As the history of war says, no matter what the method of close combat is, the party that takes the offensive, that is, the party that secures the initiative of the war, occupies an advantageous position.

Since the start of the German-Soviet summer war, the President's Headquarters has issued daily communiqués stating that the Soviet army has suffered extremely heavy losses in manpower and equipment, but has ultimately recaptured Orel, Belgorod, and Bryansk, Kalathof, and its sharp edge is difficult to resist. The encirclement of Smolensk, the most important point on the central front, is also a matter of concern for the German army.

The Center of Gravity is Still on the Eastern Front

On the day when the Anti-Axis Forces opened the Second Front in Europe, the Eastern Front remained the main battlefield for the German army. Even if the Second Front in Europe was opened, the German army could not but carry out two-front operations. The Eastern Front is still the main front, with a decisive impact.

Let us try to examine the Soviet Union's movements in terms of military, political, and diplomatic aspects in order. Needless to say, the Soviet Union's movements are blank by the Soviet Union's war power. It is almost impossible. Only the essential aspects are presented for examination.

### Agricultural Implement Experiment Factory Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday; Director Chen Made a New Speech

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - In order to increase production and improve agricultural cultivation, the National Government has established an agricultural implement manufacturing experiment blank in Wuxi.

### Ba Maw's Representative Thanked for Assistance

Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - When the Japan-Burma territorial treaty was signed, Burmese national representative Ba Maw delivered a reply, the main idea of which was that the Japan-Burma territorial treaty concluded today stipulates that blank Shan State (excluding Kengtung and Mong Pan) and Karenni State and the Wa region will be incorporated into Burmese territory. This will not only benefit the unity of Burma, but also make a great contribution to the strengthening of the East Asia blank order and the western region of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The unity between Japan and Burma and the countries of East Asia will inevitably become closer because of this. The various states of Shan, Karenni and the Wa region mostly belong to Burma and constitute the main part of Burma, but because Burma lost the war in the Anglo-Burmese War, it was forced to cede it to Britain. The British rule of the states did not take into account their welfare and interests at all, and all means were used to provoke them as much as possible. In order to extend its power, Britain tried its best to prevent the development of Guizhou. This kind of pollution point can now be eliminated due to the kindness and assistance of Japan. We are deeply grateful for this. Shan, Karenni, and Wa are now fulfilling their due obligations based on the common destiny of the country. I am convinced that under one command and one voice, we can unite and achieve the final victory.

It is the place where the Japanese air force exerts its spirit of war to learn and drop its planes.

### City Chamber of Commerce Holds Members' Congress: Resolutions on Important Matters; Silk and Silk Products Should Be Allowed Free Transport; Subsidy-Free Discounting of Yarn and Cloth Value Certificates Requested

The Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce held its annual members' representative meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday in the main hall of the Tianhou Temple Bridge branch. Tao Guoxian from the Ministry of Industry, Sun Mingqi from the Ministry of Social Welfare, and Ji Hua from the Ministry of Food attended to provide guidance. The presidium of the congress was composed of the chairman of the board of directors, the chairman of the board of supervisors, standing directors, and standing supervisors. The hall was decorated in a solemn and simple manner. The meeting commenced promptly at 2:00 PM with the ringing of a bell. First, the chairman of the board of directors, Yuan Lvdeng, delivered an opening speech, followed by Qin Runqing reporting on the work of the past year, Pei Yunqing reporting on the financial situation, Shen Weiting reporting on the commercial situation, Lin Kanghou reporting on the progress of guidance work, and Ye Fu reporting on the survey situation. Subsequently, representatives from higher authorities delivered instructions, with many words of caution. Article 2 of the articles of association was also revised, and then the proposals of various industry associations were discussed. The details of each situation are recorded below:

Attending Associations

The industry associations attending the congress included: Iron and Steel Industry, Banking Industry, Money Exchange Industry, Cotton Mill Industry, Timber Industry, Gold Industry, Enamel Industry, Bicycle Industry, Insurance Industry, Straw Braid Hat Material Industry, Hot Water Industry, Cotton Fluffing Industry, Cut Noodle Industry, Pancake and Mantou Oil Braising Shop Industry, Silverware Industry, Straw Felt Hat Industry, Stationery and Instrument Industry, Book Industry, Fur Industry, Fourth Clothing Industry, Letterpress Printing Industry, Coal and Charcoal Industry, Coarse and Fine Pigment Sundry Goods Industry, Pharmaceutical Factory Industry, New Medicine Industry, Coal Ball Industry, Cloth Shop Industry, Coal Shop Industry, Silk and Satin Shop Industry, Silk Shop Industry, Silk Weaving Factory Industry, Cloth Factory Industry, Tea Food Industry, Miscellaneous Grain Industry, Animal Husbandry Industry, Seafood Sundry Goods Industry, Tobacco Factory Industry, totaling 128 units with 340 representatives.

Chairman's Address

Yuan Lvdeng, Chairman of the Presidium, delivered the opening address, saying: "Today is the annual members' congress of the City Chamber of Commerce. Recalling the restoration of this association, more than a year has passed. According to the regulations, the annual members' congress should have been convened in June of this year, but because at that time, various industry associations were ordered to reorganize and merge one after another, it was impossible to convene it, so it was delayed until today. Recalling this year, it coincides with the period of the Greater East Asia War. Under this extraordinary situation, everything is in turmoil. The first to bear the brunt is naturally industry and commerce. The decline of industry and the desolation of commerce are naturally no exception. What is hoped is that this is a temporary abnormal phenomenon, and we look forward to the arrival of permanent brightness. Also, in this autumn of industrial and commercial difficulties, this association, in this environment, has tried to do its best to alleviate the pain of industry and commerce, but we are ashamed that the effect is very small, and we regret it. However, this association has always adhered to a steady position, earnestly guarding itself, and has always taken the interests of industry and commerce as the premise. This is what we can say with a clear conscience, and we can also comfort the members. However, in the world, if you do not advance, you will retreat. We review the past, examine the present, and think about the future, walking on thin ice, deeply fearful. Under this environment, how should this association promote its affairs and improve the current situation? These are all major issues that should be viewed from a long-term perspective. Lvdeng is incompetent and would like to hear your wise teachings."

Discussion of Proposals

The discussion of proposals then commenced. The Silk Shop Industry, Silk and Satin Shop Industry, and Silk Weaving Factory Industry jointly proposed: Silk and silk products should be allowed to be freely transported within the area of three provinces and two cities in accordance with the law. The order of the Shanghai Economic Bureau stipulates that the movement of major commodities in this city should be submitted to the bureau for approval and issuance of permits, which conflicts with the law. It should be reported to the ministry for correction. It was resolved to report to the ministry for correction. The Cloth Factory Industry Association proposed that yarn and cloth are related to all industries. Because the government has explicitly ordered the purchase of banknote cloth, the turnover of funds is not working, and the reconciliation mechanism is on the verge of bankruptcy. It is proposed to forward the request to the authorities for relief and to allow the special fixed-term deposit certificates for the price of yarn and cloth to be discounted in order to maintain operations. It was resolved that the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce would submit a report in the name of the congress to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, to state the difficult situation of various industries after the purchase of yarn and cloth, and to request financial relief and permission to discount the special fixed-term deposit certificates for the price of yarn and cloth without interest, and to pray for instructions to be followed. The Tea Food Industry, Soda and Fruit Juice Manufacturing Industry, and Candied Fruit Industry jointly requested that the association needs to use sugar for various products. In the past, there was still inventory to barely maintain operations, but in recent months, the inventory has been exhausted, and the allocated quantity has been reduced. As for the tea food industry and the candied fruit industry, although they have applied for allocation, they have not been approved, so the source of raw materials is severely lacking. They request that the Shanghai allocation agencies be asked to provide as much sugar as possible to avoid difficulties in production. It was resolved to hand it over to the board of directors for handling. Jiu Chunxin proposed: It is found that the allocation of raw materials for coal balls to various factories is decreasing month by month, and it is even worse this winter. The reason is that transportation on various roads is difficult. Can it be requested that the Standing Bureau designate Shanghai coal ball raw materials as an item to be transported as soon as possible, and order all roads to comply, so as to stabilize people's livelihood, and for the authorities to find ways to purchase foreign coal to increase reserves and avoid panic? It was resolved to be paid to the public for a decision. It was resolved that the association would request the authorities to do so. Wu Xiaohou proposed to initiate the organization of a national chamber of commerce federation. It was resolved to be retained. Temporary motions: Representatives from the Cotton Fluffing Industry and the Pancake and Mantou Oil Braising Shop Industry all requested to negotiate for the allocation of raw materials. It was resolved that a written report must be submitted for verification.

### Encourage Reporting of Hoarding; Reserve Huge Sum of Bonus; Considerable Imports of Canned Food; But Market Prices Have Risen to Their Peak

Currently, the main foods in this city that have not yet implemented per capita distribution are as important as soap and matches, and it is urgent to implement control. For example, canned foods and other foods have already raised prices to the highest point, and citizens have no intention of buying them. Although the import of canned food is still considerable during this period, as a result of the activities of hoarders, it has recently risen by 200% to 300%. As for the vegetable market, the public also hopes that the Standing Bureau will pay attention. According to the reporter of the Times, in order to implement more advanced sanctions against hoarders of major items, the authorities have recently decided to reserve huge sums of rewards to encourage all citizens who secretly report hoarders. It is found that the decision of this method was decided at the Materials Investigation Committee held at the racecourse on Friday. The committee also agreed on a method of punishing those who have not registered yarn and cloth.

### Thrift Movement Meeting Established Today; Citizens Welcome to Participate

The Shanghai Citizens Thrift Movement Meeting will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Association at 3:30 PM today.

### Household Oil Sales in District 1 End Tomorrow; Oil Sales in District 4 Started Yesterday

District 1 of this city, after District 8 started selling the fifth phase of household oil on the 19th of this month, will end sales tomorrow (28th). Those who have not yet purchased it should go to the designated retail oil store to purchase it in the next two days. With the fifth phase of the virtuous oil certificate, each person can purchase half a catty. At the same time, according to a reporter from Datong News Agency, District 4 (West Shanghai) also started selling the household oil of that phase yesterday.

### Fire Drill in District 8 Continues for Two Days

At 6:30 this morning, it will be practiced in Gujiazhai Garden on Luban Road, with a total of two hours of practice.

### Deputy Director of Baojia Office Should Be Permanently Stationed

After the establishment of the Baojia offices in various districts under the City Baojia Committee, in accordance with the organizational regulations, a deputy director was also established to supervise. The committee yesterday specifically instructed the deputy directors of the various offices to be stationed in the office permanently. Unless there is a special accident, they should also report in advance and not leave their posts without permission.

### Police Officers Receiving Training Should Not Avoid It

The Ministry of Interior, in order to improve the quality of cadres and police officers in various places, and to strengthen the maintenance of local public security forces, has successively held various training courses for implementation. The Second Police Bureau of the city found that once the police officers of its subordinate sub-bureaus were transferred, they often tried to avoid it by seeking help and making excuses. If they were not strictly prohibited, it would not only waste the country's money, but also in the long run, the available people would not be available. It should be eradicated. In the future, if anyone dares to deliberately evade, or seek opportunities, they will be dismissed and demoted. Yesterday, a special order was issued to all subordinates to comply.

### The Confucius Society Prints Images of Confucius

### Third Anniversary of the Tripartite Pact Between Japan, Germany, and Italy; Talk by Information Minister Hirota

Central News Agency, Shanghai: The 27th of this month is the third anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy. Information Minister Kyoda of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai issued the following statement:

"The Tripartite Pact was concluded on September 27, Showa 13 (1938), which was one year after the outbreak of the European War. One year after the conclusion, the Greater East Asia War broke out again. On December 11 of the same year, the additional agreement of the Tripartite Pact was issued, and the character of the Tripartite Pact was changed from a political alliance to a military alliance. The decisive determination to build a new world order was fully understood. Now that the third anniversary has been reached, one of the contracting parties, Italy, has withdrawn due to violating the treaty. The core of the alliance is now Japan and Germany. However, in addition to Japan and Germany, there are several countries that have joined this treaty. Under the strong cooperation, they continue to fight. Such breach of faith is only a test in the Axis camp and does not cause any pain or disadvantage. This can be seen from the joint statement issued by the Japanese and German governments on September 15.

The joint statement of Japan and Germany stated that "the breach of faith of the Badoglio government has no effect on the Tripartite Pact, and the effectiveness of the treaty has not changed in any way. The government of the Great Japanese Empire and the government of Great Germany jointly have the determination to make every effort to carry out this war until the final victory is achieved." Before achieving the final victory in this war, the unity of the Axis countries will become even closer. Because of Badoglio's breach of faith, the Italian people temporarily lost their combat reputation. However, the two peoples are now starting to regenerate under new political efforts. We also hope that they will achieve results soon.

Building a new world order is by no means easy. It must have a strong will. Those who are weak-willed and opportunistic are not enough to talk with. The war purpose of the Axis countries, in other words, is to liberate freedom and people's livelihood. The purpose of the anti-Axis countries is to complete the outdated world domination ambition of Britain and the United States and the maintenance of the status quo obtained by ambition in the past, and the expansion of financial power. They plan that after the war, all air routes in the world must be exclusively occupied by American planes, and maritime efforts must be controlled by Britain and the United States. All financial organizations are managed by the financial consortiums of Britain and the United States. From this, it can be seen that their sole purpose is to dominate the world, but to oppress all the nations of the world to be their subordinates. For this point, in particular, Chinese people of insight must review the past history and think about it.

At present, the world war has been transformed into an offensive and defensive war in history, and it has evolved into a long-term war. I believe that the number of people in the world who understand the concept of this Tripartite Pact and the war purpose of the Axis army is increasing day by day. It is clear whether the Tripartite Pact will bring light to the development of mankind and whether the treacherous Anglo-American alliance can bring happiness to mankind. As the countries of the Tripartite Pact are now entering the fourth year of conclusion, they are determined to face the profound trials that will be encountered in the future. Hereby, for the third time, we declare that we will never stop until the final victory is achieved in this holy war aimed at saving the people of the world. Goodness will overcome all difficulties and be carried through to the end. It is firmly believed that the connection between the contracting countries of the alliance will become more solid and consolidated."

### Destroyer on Bella Bay Smashes Enemy Submarine, Establishes Great Achievement; Adopts Ramming Tactics to Rescue Allied Vessel

Before dawn on August 2nd, on Bella Bay in the waters surrounding Kolombangara Island, the site of fierce battles in the central Solomon Islands, an enemy high-speed torpedo boat was destroyed with a violent ramming attack, splitting it in two before sinking it. This unprecedented martial skill of our destroyer far exceeds common naval warfare knowledge and is an unparalleled heroic feat in world naval history. The unparalleled bravery of this vessel not only strikes fear into the hearts of the enemy but also significantly boosts our side's morale.

A Daring Assault

In the waters off Kolombangara Island, our mine warfare squadron operates with great elusiveness and activity, constantly threatening the enemy. The enemy, attempting to hinder our operations and possessing numerical superiority, relentlessly bombs from the air. Simultaneously, when the sea is calm, they continuously deploy torpedo boats in batches, weaving a seamless net in the air and on the sea to counter our attacking vessels. This is the current situation. To charge head-on under these circumstances, dedicatedly covering our transportation and cutting off the enemy's resupply, is like rushing into a prepared gauntlet of enemy gunfire, repeatedly demonstrating a truly daring assault. The miracle performed by Destroyer 〇〇 was not an accidental stroke of luck. It was like abandoning a slashing sword to rescue an allied vessel in dire straits, a strategic move that turned a desperate situation into victory. The following is an account of the battle from Commander 〇〇, who directed the ramming tactics from the destroyer that achieved this great feat.

Sinking Enemy Boat with Allied Vessel

On the night before the incident, the first of August, Destroyer 〇〇 was carrying out a certain mission, carefully covering several allied vessels, sailing south on Bella Bay. While en route, six enemy torpedo boats preparing to engage were suddenly spotted. To preemptively strike, it joined forces with the allied vessels in a fierce attack from multiple directions. Our side unleashed a dense rain of intense gunfire, quickly sinking two enemy boats, disabling one with heavy artillery, and scattering the others. Before long, our vessel entered the anchorage of Kolombangara Island. After the mission concluded, at 00:00 on the second, it formed a line and set out on its return journey.

On the Dark Sea Surface

Sailing north on the sea near Kolombangara Island, 〇〇 served as a perimeter guard, following behind the allied vessels. At this time, the Commander had already anticipated that the enemy torpedo boats that had escaped the previous day would surely be lying in ambush somewhere, seeking revenge. All crew members were at their stations, paying close attention and maintaining vigilance. On the dark sea surface, leaving a trail of white wake, they swiftly sailed north. Although the weather wasn't ideal, the moonless sea was pitch black, completely enveloped in darkness, making visibility extremely poor. Just as the squadron was observing the shadow of Kolombangara Island on the right, a lookout on the left suddenly shouted urgently, "Torpedo boats ahead on the port side!" The Commander, Captain, and others standing on the bridge could see with their own eyes that three dark shapes were heading straight for the allied vessels on the ship's port bow.

Rush to Save Allied Vessel

The distance was only 〇〇 meters, making it too late to open fire. If the unsuspecting allied vessels were hit by torpedoes, they would be in serious trouble. In that instant, Commander 〇〇 made a decision, and everyone tacitly understood the Captain's only option: ramming. They would sacrifice themselves to save the 〇 allied vessels.

"Ram them!" This unprecedented command in modern naval warfare was issued. With full power, our destroyer charged towards the nearest torpedo boat. Watching the dark shape of the enemy torpedo boat rushing past in front, the razor-sharp hull of the destroyer cut through it in an instant. The screeching sound of the impact shook everyone. Immediately afterwards, on the left side of number one turret, it suddenly felt as if a fire had started. Oily smoke fell towards the bridge, splashing on the faces of the Commander and others like drizzle. Hitting a torpedo boat felt like hitting a torpedo.

"Was it a torpedo explosion?" Initially, they thought they had rammed the wrong target. But shortly afterwards, they saw two large fireballs burning and passing to the side, flowing to the rear. This was because the destroyer's hull had severed the enemy torpedo boat in two at the engine compartment. The piece flowing on the right side immediately disappeared from sight, but the piece flowing on the port side suddenly reappeared as another torpedo boat amidst the flames.

Renewed Fierce Bombardment

Destroyer 〇〇 promptly subjected it to another intense bombardment. Perhaps seeing that the severed torpedo boat was beyond saving, it braved the rain of bullets and vanished into the sea. This was like drawing a sword to cut down an enemy. Another strike in a mountain-pressing-down manner, it could be said to be as sharp as a Japanese sword. The other one also disappeared at some point. Destroyer 〇〇 only sustained a superficial cut on the bow, which did not affect its speed in any way. The 〇 allied vessels advanced northward in an orderly and imposing manner. The destroyer, chasing behind the allied vessels, gradually left the battlefield.

Being able to smash the enemy before they could launch their torpedoes and prevent any damage to the allied vessels can be considered the best strategy.

Regarding his determination to self-detonate and the tragic state of mind when ramming the enemy torpedo boat, the Commander only said one sentence, "I wanted to keep fighting." (Translated from the September 11th edition of the Mainichi Shimbun)

### Heroic Tales of Bloodshed in the South Pacific

The decisive battle between Japan and the United States centered around New Georgia in the Solomon Islands intensifies day and night. Our valiant garrison forces, enduring relentless attacks by the enemy from land, sea, and air, face hardships that defy description. On July 14th, under the cover of U.S. fast warships and fighter planes, seventy landing craft launched a major offensive from the sea towards the eastern side of Munda. Our defending forces immediately sank twenty of them. Simultaneously, to coordinate with the operation, 500 enemy soldiers attacking from the land were also driven into the water, becoming food for the fishes. Below is an account of this heroic battle.

### Munda Garrison

The position of the Shimizu Unit (led by Lieutenant Saburo Shimizu), part of the 〇〇 unit stationed at the Kiyomizu Heights in front of Munda, New Georgia Island, had been subjected to continuous enemy shelling. A forest area that had never been felled by axes in thousands of years was reduced to a scorched earth devoid of even small trees. On July 12th, the Shimizu unit, which had been engaging small enemy detachments, anticipated that the enemy would attempt a landing from the direction of nearby Rubiana Island, given the continuous enemy shelling. Therefore, they moved their position to the east coast of Munda.

Lieutenant Masao Kuramoto's artillery unit also positioned all of its artillery on the coast, preparing to fight alongside the Shimizu unit. On the third day after the position was moved to the coast (July 14th), the weather was very clear, allowing a view of Rubiana Island floating on the blue sea 3,000 meters away.

At 7:00 AM, Unit Commander Shimizu received a report that the enemy, under the cover of fighter planes and fast warships, was approaching Munda with seventy landing craft. He and artillery unit commander Kuramoto decided to use artillery and machine guns to engage the enemy ships coming from the sea and rifles to engage the 500 enemy soldiers coming from the land.

When the enemy's seventy-odd boats sailed within 700 meters of our forces, Commanders Kuramoto and Shimizu simultaneously shouted, "Fire!" The gunners, who had been ready, opened fire all at once. Several enemy boats and frantic soldiers disappeared into the sea together. The enemy boats, relying on their numerical superiority, returned fire with artillery. Their shells were very accurate. When we fired forty or fifty shells, the enemy began to change direction and flee. The enemy boats were in utter chaos amidst the splashes of water, the smoke from artillery fire, and the smoke screens they released. Our gun barrels became completely red-hot, and the soldiers, with their faces covered in the red blood splattered from enemy shells, became even more spirited.

Seeing this miserable situation, the enemy soldiers coming from the land, though already terrified, still rapidly approached our position. Our infantry unit then concentrated their firepower on the American soldiers. The enemy was completely surrounded by our intense hail of fire and suffered heavy losses. Our Imperial troops seized this opportunity, fixed bayonets, and, thinking "Damn it, these American bastards!", charged towards the American soldiers. The enemy, crying out in misery, began to retreat.

Seeing that our troops were engaged in melee combat with their infantry, the enemy fighter planes were unable to carry out machine-gun strafing. The fierce battle on land and sea continued for half an hour and then stopped.

In this fierce battle, twenty enemy boats were sunk, and over 1,500 enemy soldiers were killed in action on land and sea. Our side only suffered 15 killed in action and 5 wounded, and only one gun carriage was damaged among the 〇〇 artillery pieces.

### The Seven Scouts of Salamaua

The fierce battles near Salamaua, New Guinea, are no less intense than those in the Solomon Islands. The following is a story of seven courageous officer scouts who routed a small enemy unit, gathered intelligence, and raided a mortar position, capturing two mortars and returning.

The enemy forces in front of Logahun Heights in Salamaua were advancing towards the coastline day by day, and were quietly preparing to land with landing craft. The commander of our forces stationed at Logahun Heights decided to deliver a blow to the enemy before they were fully prepared. Prior to a general assault, it was decided to select seven scouts led by Lieutenant Kaichi Hirayama: Sergeant Tanaka Kurata, Corporal Otsuka, Private First Class Tsubonotani, Private Mashiko, Private Tanida, and Private First Class Nagayama.

Early in the morning of [Date Omitted], the scout team, carrying two light machine guns, two captured automatic rifles, two rifles, multiple hand grenades, and two days' worth of rations, set out. Around noon, as the Hirayama scout team advanced through the forest near a valley, they suddenly heard American soldiers speaking. Five enemy signalmen were resting. Private Tanida quietly advanced and wiped them all out with a burst from a machine gun. As the sun was setting, the scout team, having circled behind the enemy's right flank, discovered about 500 enemy soldiers camping on the beach in front of Logahun Heights.

At approximately 8:00 AM the next morning, while descending a steep slope into a valley, they spotted a mortar position constructed by the enemy. There were two mortars set up, and upon closer inspection, twenty enemy soldiers were guarding the area. Lieutenant Hirayama smiled and said, "Let's take it." The seven men crept through the forest and reached within twenty meters of the mortar position without being detected by the enemy. The seven men suddenly opened fire with machine guns and automatic rifles, and the enemy soldiers, startled by the gunfire, panicked and fled to the rear. However, seeing that there were only a few of us, they stopped and returned fire with automatic rifles and grenade launchers. Sergeant Kurata and Private First Class Nagayama bravely charged towards the enemy, intending to engage in sword combat. At that moment, the daring Lieutenant Hirayama ran into the enemy position and dragged an enemy mortar away. Seeing the enemy soldiers in disarray, the lieutenant ran back and dragged the other mortar away as well.

During this time, his subordinates had nearly wiped out all the enemy soldiers. Lieutenant Hirayama ordered, "Kurata, Otsuka! Carry the mortars!" The two men then dragged a mortar each back into the forest. At that moment, Private First Class Nagayama was struck in the left thigh by an automatic rifle bullet. Blood stained Private First Class Nagayama's uniform red. Private First Class Nagayama said painfully, "Commander! Please don't worry about me!" In a moment, he lost all strength, and with one last cry of "Long live the Emperor!" he died. Lieutenant Hirayama and the other six men sorrowfully parted ways with the body of Private First Class Nagayama and continued their advance. To avenge their fallen comrade, they encountered twelve signalmen and ten liaison soldiers along the way, eliminating them all without leaving a single survivor.

On the evening of the second day, they quietly moved behind the enemy lines, cutting the enemy's telephone lines attached to a fallen tree. They quickly threw hand grenades into the trenches where enemy soldiers were stationed and agilely fled.

The Hirayama scout team carried the two mortars all night, and arrived at their own unit on the morning of the third day. That evening, the 〇〇 unit, based on Lieutenant Hirayama's report, launched a fierce attack on the enemy in front.

### The Old Furnace Worker's Sorrow

— Ling Zuren

July – a day in a hot season.

I stepped into the furnace room, and a wave of intensely hot air rushed at me, causing me to take a step back involuntarily. The cement on the floor and walls seemed about to crack from the heat of the furnace. Entering the room was like running into a fiery pit.

At this time, our old furnace worker, A-Neng, was standing in front of the fire door at the front of the furnace, his strong arms hoisting a bright coal rake, filling the furnace belly with a full load of coal.

Inside the two open fire doors, burning coal chunks emitted roaring flames, constantly hissing and crackling. The fiery red flames painted A-Neng's aged and swarthy face with a flush of crimson. After skillfully feeding each fire door with sufficient coal dust, he closed the fire doors, casually tossed the coal rake onto the coal pile behind him, and came over. He sat down at one end of a long bench near me, pulled a dark and dirty towel from his shoulder, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and exhaled a long, deep breath, like a sigh and a pant.

Instinctively, I cast an inquisitive gaze upon his face, and I felt that it was still a rather ugly face! The aged and withered face was covered with a thin layer of coal dust, its color reminding one of the hazy twilight. The forehead and face were covered with deep wrinkles, etched by the grinding of "life", further coated with a greasy mixture of sweat and coal dust, like the tracks of a cartwheel after being run over in the rain. Buried within the deeply sunken eye sockets were two listless eyeballs, revealing a glimmer of despair and bewilderment. This was an ugly, coarse, painful face, the face of an elderly laborer. Seeing him sweating and panting, I asked him with concern:

"A-Neng! It's very hot, isn't it!"

"Mmm! Very hot," he raised his head.

"Are you feeling weak?"

"Oh! Mr. Ling! No! I'm still alright! But... as the years pass, people age, and when you get old, you lose your strength." His tone was filled with a melancholy sentiment, mixed with a hint of gratitude for my concern.

He lowered his head again.

"Then, how old are you now?"

"Fifty-three years old, ah!"

"Mmm! You are getting old! How long have you been a furnace worker?"

"Probably... nearly thirty years, I guess!" He spoke like someone awakened from a dream, trying to trace the remnants of the dream, his eyes gazing at the roof, counting on his fingers.

"Ah! Already thirty years!" My expression revealed surprise, and also a hint of lament.

"That's right! It's been thirty years. Most of my life has been burned away by the flames in this furnace..." His tone was somewhat agitated, as if regretting lost youth and lamenting the cruelty of reality. I seemed to see the elderly man's old heart trembling. Before I could interject, he continued, his tone even more agitated, sounding unlike an elderly man:

"The fate of us poor people is destined to suffer. Although, when I was young, I had ideals just like other young people. I created many beautiful illusions. In the furnace fire, I even built an imaginary paradise. I earnestly hoped for its realization, year after year, working hard and waiting with hope. But: thirty years have passed, and cruel reality has shattered my beautiful illusions and imaginary paradise. I even prayed to God, but: He did not give me any real strength. Now I am in despair. I let my remaining years gradually erode and diminish in the flames, until the end of my entire life. I understand very well that we poor people will never be happy, and will never see any light." I saw his aged, swarthy face convulsing in pain, and a surge of emotions that he could not express in words flashed in his eyes. I knew that emotion was violently battering his old heart.

"Don't despair. For every bit of effort you put in, you will gain a bit of reward. Poor people are not entirely without happiness, without hope," I said to him, both comforting and encouraging.

"Huh! For every bit of effort you put in, you can gain a bit of reward. Isn't that just a deceptive saying? For thirty years, I have put in no less effort, but what has been the reward? Am I not still being tormented by life? I can't even support my wife and children, and I have to make them use their own strength to support themselves!" His resentful tone dragged on with bitterness.

I couldn't help but lower my head beside him, taking a deep look at the old furnace worker shrouded in deep shadows, and a wave of sympathy surged in my heart. I felt that the surrounding air was exceptionally cold, no longer fiery. I silently lowered my head. We both fell into silence.

As I stepped out of the furnace room, that bitter sentiment still vaguely lingered in my ears.

### Twenty Vows

— Sha Yun

As if ten years of dust,
Accumulated on the edge of a worn hat,
But --
Unveiling the thin film of awareness,
I bid farewell forever to childhood!
May you be ten thousand west winds,
Facing the great ocean of life,
I boldly
Drink up the cup of challenge once more.
With a million degrees of flame, I bathe my
Indomitable ethnic spirit,
An ever-young heart,
I thrust forth my
Iron will!

### Little Tea Boy

— Situ Qi

(I)

It was before the first class in the afternoon was about to begin.

"Hey! Where did this little tea boy come from? Haha, taro head, haha..."

"This little imp is quite amusing, like a mud doll."

"………………"

The students in classroom number ten, seeing the newly arrived little tea boy walk past the door yesterday, the more mischievous ones immediately began laughing, making a commotion, and reaching out to touch his somewhat prominent back of the head.

The little tea boy's current task was to deliver thermos bottles to the office.

He encountered the students' teasing, but only turned his purplish-red face red, his large eyes wide, shining with surprised light, and grinning stupidly. This added much amusement to the mischievous group. After he finished his duties, when he passed by outside again, they grabbed him and arbitrarily sought materials for laughter, making a ruckus.

"How old are you, little tea boy?"

"Fourteen years old and already serving society, alas! Amitabha, limitless prospects."

"Haha, but isn't he a little Chongming, can't be wrong, right?"

"Hey! What's your name? Have you studied!"

"A-Xiang? What A-Xiang A-Pan, it's still more practical to call him little tea boy."

"Hahahaha, little tea boy! Little tea boy!..."

The little tea boy was busy answering the questions of the group, so flustered and bewildered that he was at a loss. But thanks entirely to the timely arrival of the Director of Student Affairs, he was freed from the great encirclement. However, it was still the little tea boy whose eyes were still wandering who received a few scoldings.

(II)

After school, the little tea boy was sweeping the classroom. He looked at the many white powder marks on the blackboard, feeling baffled. Except for the character "中" (middle), which he recognized from mahjong tiles, out of curiosity, the little tea boy also wanted to learn to write. He picked up a piece of chalk and copied it on the blackboard in the same way, still holding the broom in his left hand. After a long while, he finally produced a satisfactory character "中" (middle), but nothing else.

Lifting his hand, tilting his head, the little tea boy felt unusually strained. He was about to give up when, coincidentally, two students from classroom number ten, who hadn't gone home yet, walked past outside. The little tea boy remembered them very well. The two of them immediately shouted unconsciously:

"Good ah! Little tea boy is learning to write, haha..."

The little tea boy's face turned red, and he quickly threw away the chalk and bowed his head to sweep the floor.

(III)

The next day, the little tea boy was once again being entangled by the mischievous schoolchildren. Even one from classroom number ten ordered him to quickly pour a cup of tea. He immediately earnestly complied, busying himself with finding a cup and so on. Just as the mighty "King Yama" Director of Student Affairs happened to walk by, the student panicked in great fear, urgently whispering:

"Ah, ah ah, no need..."

However, the little tea boy was being toyed with and didn't know what was going on, staring wide-eyed, not understanding what kind of game this was.

(IV)

Every night, after the school gates were locked, the little tea boy sat and thought after finishing his tasks, just daydreaming.

"A-Changgen said, they are what middle school students are. Oh, middle school students, that must be so good?" The little tea boy thought. He thought that one first became a middle school student, and then had the status of a young master to order others around.

Therefore, this was his opponent. The little tea boy believed that the young masters' questions or orders must also be as Changgen had instructed: diligent and loyal. Originally, hey, it was master and servant, ah.

Over time, the little tea boy gradually no longer felt that the world had any contradictions, everything was progressing on a natural trajectory.

### Feather Song

— Cun Ting

One day at the end of last autumn, I strolled in the western Junshan mountains of the ancient city for a whole day. The weather that day wasn't very good, gloomy as if it were about to rain, but my heart was filled with joy.

Standing at the foot of the mountain, I could vaguely see the distant village, light smoke drifting, gradually rising and gradually disappearing. Behind me was a crimson forest, as vibrant as women's vermilion lips; in front of me was a vast expanse of rice paddies, golden waves constantly rolling in the wind. Although it was a long and dreary day, I felt an inexplicable sense of comfort pervading me. In that instant, I felt as if I were the only force in the world, the master of nature!

Lost in deep thought, I pondered the towering, overlapping peaks, the gently flowing rivers… and the place where I stood was the epitome of all mountains and rivers. I rejoiced that I had come to this microcosm of mountains and rivers to be its ruler! So I casually picked up a bird's feather, blew on it, and let it drift with the wind. Watching it soar into the sky, a surge of praise arose in my heart, whispering softly, murmuringly.

"Bless you, I don't know if you were lost from a white dove or a hawk, but I know that in my eyes you are pure white, and you are pure white as you float in the air. Now that you are drifting from my hand, I hope you find a happy ending.

"Perhaps you will fall into the nearby swamp, obediently enduring all filth, darkness; perhaps you will be swept into a vast river, swallowed by a fish, or tossed about in the waves. Perhaps you will rest temporarily on the rice stalks, quietly waiting for the next gale; perhaps you will fall into the flourishing weeds, accepting the embrace of thorns; perhaps you will fly into a sweet spring, or perch on a tall tree.

"But I still want you to fly! Fly with all your might! Float forever in the air. I don't want you to fall on the filthy ground, and I don't want you to linger in the dense clouds. I hope you can break through the shackles and soar straight into the blue sky!"

I almost forgot myself, and only exhaled when I realized I was still standing there.

It was starting to drizzle, and I hurriedly took shelter under a red maple tree. When I looked up again, the feather was already gone.

### Fate

— Liu Jiali

It's early autumn again, reminding me of a cruel reality I witnessed in my hometown around this time last year.

One afternoon, nearing dusk, I was reading Ba Jin's "Life and Death" in my bedroom when Fangmei suddenly ran in to tell me that the Yu family in front—our neighbors!—had taken in a child bride today, and urged me to go see. Driven by curiosity, I hurriedly put down the book and followed her to the front. As soon as I entered the parlor, it was already crowded with people. Neighbors from all around had come. A pair of red candles were lit on the table in the center, covered with a red felt blanket. A girl of fourteen or fifteen, with two small braids tied up, adorned with some flowers, wearing a flowered cloth jacket, very neat and tidy, with a round face and a pair of dark, sparkling eyes, was quite endearing. Perhaps because she was shy, she kept her head down, her eyes fixed on the pair of red flower-print cloth shoes on her feet, sitting on a small bamboo chair next to the table. "Is this the girl?" I asked Fangmei. "Yes, she's quite pretty," Fangmei smiled and nodded. Many people were making comments, judging her appearance.

Later, I learned something about the girl's background. She—Meilan—was a girl from a nearby village. Due to the death of her parents, she was sold by her distant uncle to the Zhang family in the same village to be a child bride. Less than a year later, the Zhang family's son died, so she was now resold to the Yu family. Meilan had to take care of all the household chores, cooking, laundry, and needlework, always toiling away. When she had free time, she would take care of her five-year-old little uncle. Gradually, she became acquainted with us, sometimes telling us some sad stories. But to avoid reminding her of painful memories, we always comforted her wounded heart with other words.

Unexpectedly, three months later, her future husband, the Yu family's fourteen-year-old son, contracted a severe case of typhoid fever. Due to their delay, they didn't call a doctor for treatment early on. By the time the illness became serious, it was too late to save him and he died. Meilan couldn't bear this shock, and she cried out loud. She wasn't grieving the boy's death; he had ignored her when he was alive, and there was no emotional connection between them at all. What she grieved was her future fate. Terrible misfortunes always befell her. She didn't dare think about what the future held. Some malicious curses were gnawing at her wounded heart. Her mother-in-law even cursed her as a "widow star," saying she had brought bad luck and caused her son's death. Even though they had consulted a blind fortune-teller and matched their horoscopes before, they had now forgotten all about it. Meilan could only express the indescribable pain she felt inside through heartbroken weeping.

A week later, we watched as an elderly country woman took Meilan away. Without a doubt, the Yu family had resold her again. She silently followed the old woman, not looking back as she left. I watched her go—this unfortunate, pitiful girl. Who had shattered her fragile heart? Who had caused her to suffer these hardships? Was it fate? Or was it...?

Now it's that time of year again. I feel very sad when I recall this incident. We sympathize with her, we pity her, but we can't help her escape this inhuman life and this unfortunate fate. Even now, I still feel guilty inside. I wonder if she is living safely now. I wish this poor girl eternal well-being! (With gratitude)

### Recent Promotion of Round Gate Ball: Combining Chinese and Western Ball Games Based on Sports Principles

Round Gate Ball is a newly created ball game invented by Mr. Sun Xucang two years ago. Mr. Qian is an education scholar. He also deeply studies physical education and sports. In addition to guiding basketball and track and field competitions, he invented Round Gate Ball based on sports principles, combining Chinese and Western ball games into one. Since its introduction, it has gradually become popular and has been well received in the sports community. The Popularity Cup Round Gate Ball League will be held soon. Our newspaper has specially invited Mr. Qian to write an article on Round Gate Ball, so that people in the society can read it and better understand the meaning and rules of this new type of ball game.

### Motivation for Creation

I knew nothing about sports in my life. However, when I was young, I liked to be with the village children and played with small balls all day long. Later, I became interested in football, basketball, and volleyball. After studying at university, I majored in education. I read famous Chinese and foreign books on education and sports theories. I learned that exercise can not only improve physical health, but also improve people's psychology and morality. It is the initial stage of education. Physical education is indispensable to education. Without the skin, what will the hair cling to? Reading and understanding must first have a strong will, perseverance, a healthy body, and a sound mind to be able to speak of reading and understanding. Otherwise, you will get sick before you even read, or die in the evening after hearing the truth, or your mind will be distracted, or your energy will be easily exhausted; or you will not be able to think deeply, or you will not be able to learn widely and inquire carefully. Even if there is a famous teacher, he will not be able to help. I once said that Confucius' disciples, such as Yan Hui's intelligence, Zilu's courage, and Zeng Shen's popularity, were all related to their physical condition. It is a pity that Zhongni did not know the good and bad of personality, and the length of life depends on health maintenance. Otherwise, in addition to the four subjects, if you can also take care of personality and physique, wouldn't Confucianism be even better?

Therefore, physical education is the foundation of education, and the promotion of physical education lies in the popularity of sports. To promote the popularity of sports, we must first arouse the interest of the Chinese people in sports. The sports that are most likely to arouse the interest of the general public are ball games. Ball games have been popular in our country for a long time. In the pre-Qin period, there was Cuju. Liu Xiang's "Separate Records" of the Han Dynasty said: "Cuju was created by the Yellow Emperor, or it originated in the Warring States period. Ancient people used Cuju as a game." The "Biography of General Wei" in the "Historical Records" says: "Crossing the city and trampling," which is annotated as "the current Daqiu." The annotation to the "Biography of Huo Qubing" in the "Book of Han" says: "Cuju is made of leather, filled with fur, and played by kicking." Cuju is interpreted as kicking, which is the game of kicking the ball. In the Song Dynasty, there were more detailed instruments, with wooden posts erected as ball gates, divided into left and right gates, which are closer to modern football. In the Yuan Dynasty, polo was popular, and its scales and claws can often be seen in Yuan Dynasty paintings, which makes people yearn for it. At present, the various ball sports popular in our country are mostly directly from the West, and there are many disagreements with the social conditions of our country, so it is still impossible to make them popular. I once had an article published in the "Sports Weekly," which said:

"There are about four taboos in popular ball sports: first, the fixed position of players, second, the intensification of movements, third, the aristocratic equipment, and fourth, the specialization of skills. The reason why basketball cannot be popularized is that it is specialized in skills. The problem with volleyball is the fixed position. Tennis, polo, water polo, and golf are aristocratic. American football is intense..."

Therefore, I am eager to create a new type of ball game, hoping to meet the interests and environment of the Chinese people. I have been thinking about it for several years, but I have no clue. One day, during the spring holiday, I happened to pass the deserted field at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Route Cardinal Mercier. I saw nearly a hundred children gathered there, some flying kites, some chasing and running, and some watching with their hands in their sleeves. Among them, the game with the most participants and the most enthusiastic was the game of throwing small balls. Most of the participants were elementary school students and street children. The method of the game seems to refer to the rules of basketball and small ball. Throwing, passing, transporting, and throwing are very active. Although the atmosphere is not very tense, it is quite interesting. Because I think that in general schools, although there are sports field facilities, the students who can actually participate in sports are rare. Now the children in this deserted field can find open space by themselves and gather dozens of people to engage in the game of throwing small balls. Isn't this enough to be a research material for educators? After returning to school, I based the game's interest and method on the children of this deserted field, and referred to the etiquette of Cuju in the Song and Yuan Dynasties in our country. I also extracted the essence of basketball, this ball, volleyball, German handball, and water polo, and integrated the rules of the four ball games into one, making its fun as rich as basketball and football, but without the disadvantages of being too intense. After several months of calculation and experimentation, the rules of the round gate ball were completed.

### Overview of the Ball Game

The round gate ball field is rectangular, slightly larger than a basketball court, and can be used indoors or outdoors. At both ends of the ball field, a round gate is erected. The field is divided into side lines, end lines, center lines, serving lines, and goal area lines with white lines. The number of players in each team is seven. (That is, one goalkeeper, one center back, one left and right full back each, one center forward, and one left and right winger each. The area and number of players in a large ball field are the same as in football.) One of them is responsible for the goalkeeper, and the rest of the players can use their hands and limbs above the knees to pass, pat, and throw the ball in any way. (However, the goalkeeper can use his feet in the goal area) to enter the opponent's gate as the goal. At the same time, the players must closely defend the opponent's players to enter the water team's round gate.

### Significance of the Round Gate

The ball gates are erected at both ends of the ball field, forming a regular round corner shape, 210 cm high and 360 cm wide, the size is equal to a small football gate. Because players throw the ball with their hands to attack the gate, it is more accurate than using their feet. The ball enters the upper left and right corners of the ball gate. It is most difficult for the goalkeeper to defend. In order to reduce the difficulty of the goalkeeper's defense, and to avoid unrecoverable dangerous saves, and to increase the interest of the competition, the two corners of the ball gate are cut into semi-circular shapes with equal radii. This is the simple meaning of becoming a round gate.

### Rules of the Game

The rules of the round gate ball are compiled with reference to basketball and football. All actions such as dribbling, patting the ball, throwing the ball, passing the ball, and jumping ball are similar to basketball. The regulations on fouls and fouls are also based on the established rules of double ball. Its penalties, divided into side line ball, corner ball, goal ball, Ren Yu ball, six-meter ball, etc., are similar to football. As for the rules of the goalkeeper and the goal area, it is slightly different from football. Among them, the restrictions on players entering the goal area are the most strict. The goal area is semi-circular. Except for the goalkeeper, any player who enters the goal area line is considered a foul and punished accordingly. Other rules, such as competition officials, competition time, start of competition, suspension and progress, competition terms, victory or defeat, reaches, fouls, free kicks, corner kicks, six-meter balls, etc., are all specially stipulated in the rules, which are detailed and not omitted.

### Results of the Trial Competition

The game of the round gate ball is as described above. For fear of building a car behind closed doors and not cutting into the real world, a trial competition was held on November 10, 1941. The following is an excerpt from the newspaper's record at the time:

"Since the advent of the round gate ball, people in the sports world have been talking about it. Whether this ball game can be popular all over the world is not to be discussed. Basketball originated in the United States. At first, it was a game of throwing the ball into a wooden bucket. Today, it has become popular in countries all over the world. Even the inventors at the time could not have imagined it. The potential of the round gate ball in the cradle is unlimited. After the news of the round gate ball table spread, many fans came to watch it. At about 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the opening middle school was crowded with people. It was an unprecedented grand occasion in the history of the founding of the country. The founder is also satisfied. The round gate ball has today's harvest, which is worthy of his painstaking research. At 3:00 p.m., the game started, and the blue and white teams first started the ball..."

Since this trial competition, it has been warmly supported by people from all walks of life, and the Western Sports Association has also paid attention to it. The association automatically participated in three Sino-Western confrontations, and the results were very satisfactory. There was also a women's team participating in the performance. The following paragraph is a record of the chapter, which can give a glimpse of one of the grand occasions at that time:

"The round gate ball double heroes friendship match was held at Guangxia Middle School yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. More than 2,000 people came to watch, and the emotions were enthusiastic. Liangyou Bao Songwei Da Shen Dun, Xi Shi said:

All walks of life have held round gate ball leagues, such as the "Guobin Cup," "Chang Cup," and "Middle School Cup," which were very popular for a while.

### Future Development

The birth of the round fighting ball coincided with the year of the national suffering. The flames of war were everywhere, and transportation was blocked. Even the rules were mostly restricted. In the future, it may be promoted again to make it popular, and often widely consulted and interviewed, gathering opinions and criticisms from all parties to improve it. This requires the support and guidance of advanced people at home and abroad, which cannot be done by sole effort.

### Famous Female Swimmer in East Asia, Yang Xiuqiong, Will Give Up Swimming, The Sports World Hopes That the Mermaid Will Continue to Work Hard

Ms. Yang Xiuqiong, the mermaid, has been living a family life and has not engaged in swimming since she married the famous jockey Tao Bolin in Xiangdao. It was not until last year that she intended to come to Shanghai, but it was cancelled due to transportation reasons. Now she has arrived in Shanghai on September 11, and the ladies in Shanghai are all happy.

Times Pictorial 1. The new Japanese army active on the southern front. 2. When Chairman Wang arrived in Tokyo on the 22nd to visit Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, the host and guests raised their glasses to congratulate each other (transmitted photo). 3. Japanese military instructors enthusiastically teach flight trainees. 4. On the 20th of this month, the "Air" Commemoration Day, a girl presented flowers to a pilot at the aircraft naming ceremony dedicated by Japanese expatriates. 5. This newspaper held a tea party for the elderly at the Ningbo Township Association during the Mid-Autumn Festival to study health preservation and good deeds. 6. Japanese naval propaganda team instructors guide civilians in gymnastics. 7. The situation when American expatriates boarded the ship before the departure of the third exchange ship of Japanese and American expatriates.

After arriving in Shanghai, Ms. Yang's whereabouts were kept secret and she avoided seeing guests. She first stayed at the Jinmen Hotel and changed rooms three times before moving to the International Hotel. It was not until 3:00 p.m. on the 21st that she met with people from all walks of life in the Three Provinces Sports Association. Ms. Yang is more plump and lovely than before. She practiced tennis in the association. She also watched the international tennis match yesterday. In order to promote women's swimming in Shenjiang, the Three Provinces Sports Association had long planned to have Ms. Yang perform publicly, but it was recently learned that she has not yet agreed. Some people also said that she has no intention of engaging in swimming again.

Ms. Yang is from Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, and lives in Hong Kong. Her father, Yang Yinan, was the director of the swimming department of the Hong Kong Sports Association. Her mother, Long, her sister, Xiu, and her brother, Changhua, are all good at swimming. Ms. Yang is now twenty-five years old. She started practicing swimming in Hong Kong at the age of twelve. The following summer, she participated in the Hong Kong Cross-Harbor Race and won the women's championship. When Mr. Smith, the world's top swimmer, passed through Hong Kong, he praised her swimming talent. He immediately asked her father to train her, and she finally achieved outstanding results. In the 10th Far Eastern Games, she won all the women's swimming championships. In the 6th National Games, she created a record of one minute and 23 seconds for the 100-foot freestyle and one minute and 37 seconds for the 100-meter backstroke, both of which broke the Far Eastern Games record, and represented China at the 10th World Games held in Berlin. Her glorious history is imprinted in our minds. Ms. Yang is beautiful and good at swimming, so people are used to calling her "a mermaid." After her arrival this time, people in the sports world are eagerly hoping that she will continue to display her great spirit of the past.

### Talking About the Suhuai Football Team

— Bixian

The Suhuai team, which gathered the elite of Northern Jiangsu, arrived in Shanghai on September 13 and left on the 23rd, staying in Shanghai for ten days. They played four games, winning against the Three Provinces, tying with Lianyi, and losing twice to Donghua. The record is not bad. Now I want to analyze the team:

All the players of the team are quite energetic, which is a typical feature of the Northern School. This is the only thing that is appreciated by the fans in Shanghai.

Talking about its offensive strategy, it completely adopts five forwards in parallel, and rarely uses the two wings. The three forwards advance from the middle to achieve the goal. Unless the opponent's defense is weak, or the position is absolutely inaccurate, there is little hope. We only need to think about it. Donghua only intercepts from the middle, which reduces the team's offensive opportunities. The team's performance on the two wings can be said to be non-existent. After getting the ball, they always want to dribble. As a result, due to qualifications and skills, they all become cakes. Therefore, in terms of offensive power, I think they should train more on using the W-style and triangular offensive methods. The two wings should practice cutting in and heading more. As for the defensive aspect, the center back line, Lao Jiang sits in the center, which does not lose the demeanor of a veteran, and can respond from front to back. Lin and Sun, the two full backs, mark people to people. Because they have enough energy, they can be said to be good. However, when they block the ball, they cannot control it. They just kick it far away, which is considered a matter. They cannot respond to the forwards, and they lose offensive opportunities. This kind of full back is not worth taking. They should practice the ability to control the ball and the foot of the ball's landing point. Let's talk about the guards, the two Lis and one Wang, their skill in marking people is appreciated by general fans, especially in the second game against Donghua, Li Qingyu's dead marking of Lao Jin is particularly wonderful, but there are also many shortcomings. Li Qingyu puts all his energy on Lao Sun, and does not want to take care of Ling Yao at all. So Ling Yao is free and active, causing a lot of labor. Donghua especially uses the two wings, and the victory lies in this. The goalkeeper Gao Chen is a little scared, and he also lacks experience!

In summary, the team has enough physical strength and energy. If they are given good training and more opportunities to compete, they can become a good team. They have left this time, and I hope they will come again in the future and give us a better performance.

My humble opinion, I hope those who know me will teach me!

### Simple Fitness Training Methods (3)

— Written by Tom, Translated by Yide

12. Back Breathing

Stand upright in the correct posture, with your chest automatically raised. Place your thumbs on both sides of the base of the spine and press firmly. Slowly inhale a deep breath through your nostrils. At the beginning of inhalation, you will feel a kind of outward movement resisting the thumbs.

Back Breathing: Place your hands on your waist; inhale, resist diaphragm movement, and exhale slowly.

Note: Practice in class, three breaths are enough; practice individually, you can use your own judgment.

Back Breathing

13. Belt Breathing

Combining abdominal breathing, intercostal breathing, and back breathing into one is called belt breathing.

Stand upright in the correct posture, with your chest raised. Place your hands on your waist, stretching your fingers as far as possible. Slowly inhale deeply through your nostrils. When you start inhaling, you will feel your waist expanding, imagining a flexible belt around your waist. Try to expand it equally on the left, right, front, and back. Practice the three types of breathing separately, with the same number of breaths. Belt breathing should be the normal breathing method, so that you can feel more powerful.

Belt Breathing: Place your hands on your waist; inhale; resist diaphragm movement; exhale slowly.

Note: Practice in class, three breaths are enough; practice individually, you can use your own judgment.

14. Chest Expansion

With your arms at your sides, as shown in the picture. Slowly raise your hands upward and forward until they are higher than your face, then bring your hands together, palms facing your face, little fingers touching.

Raise your elbows (do not raise your hands together) until the tips of your middle fingers touch each other. Turn your palms down, with the tips of your middle fingers still touching, and spread your elbows further to the left and right. Turn your palms up, with the tips of your middle fingers still touching. (The above movements are only a preparation for expanding the chest.)

At this time, clench your hands tightly and slowly pull your arms back, but when they fall to your sides, the posture is the same as at the beginning. Do not bend your wrists, turn your palms outward, and keep your forearms close to your upper arms.

After learning the above movements, take a deep breath, from the time your arms are in place until they return to their original position, without exhaling.

Exhale as much as possible each time; when inhaling next time, you can make the air sacs in your lungs expand one by one.

Chest Expansion: With your arms at your sides; breathe; forward; backward, forward, backward, exhale.

Note: Practice in class, three times is enough; practice individually, you can use your own judgment.

15. Shoulder Exercise

With your arms at your sides, as in the circle. Extend your arms forward, relaxing your muscles. Open your hands, palms down.

Slowly raise your hands, clench your fists tightly, and slowly pull your arms back, making your elbows reach back as far as possible (at this time, your arms gradually close together). Then slowly lower your elbows, with your forearms up, still clenched tightly, your little fingers against your ribs, without bending your wrists.

Chest Breathing
