### Public Opinion and National Policy

The highest political ideal of China, and indeed of all East Asian nations, is the "Kingly Way," which stands in opposition to the hegemonic intentions of Europe and America. The concrete manifestation of the "Kingly Way" must originate from the principle that "Heaven sees as the people see; Heaven hears as the people hear." While we cannot definitively assert the reality of the rule of Yao and Shun in ancient history, King Wen's governance of the realm from eighty square miles, which extended for over eight hundred years, marked a period of national prosperity and cultural flourishing. The reason for this, upon investigation, is none other than the enlightened monarchs and virtuous ministers like King Wu and the Duke of Zhou, who, in contrast to the actions of the tyrant Zhou of Yin and the hegemons of his time, promoted the "Kingly Way" and reform. In modern terms, this means being able to discern the support or opposition of the people in order to determine national policy. Thus, the hearts of the masses were won, and the nation flourished. From this, we can see the close relationship between public opinion and national policy. Although there are differences between past and present in terms of time, this fundamental principle remains eternally unchanged. For this reason, we have repeatedly urged the authorities to respect public opinion, establish institutions of public opinion to assist the government, advance national policy, and consolidate the foundation for national and ethnic revival. However, perhaps some people, taking the words literally, believe that the establishment of public opinion organs risks repeating the mistakes of so-called democratic politics in Britain and America, which seems inappropriate today, as the battle against Britain and America is approaching a decisive stage? The question of whether or not to have public opinion organs still exists and deserves to be studied first.

Indeed, the so-called capitalist democracy of the British and American type has reached a dead end in the twentieth century, with flaws emerging one after another. If we want to achieve political enlightenment, we must not repeat this misguided path. Mr. Sun Yat-sen had already clearly indicated this. However, at the same time, we must recognize that it is the failure of British and American politics, which has democracy as its shell and hegemony as its soul, that absolutely cannot be confused with the "Kingly Way" politics of respecting public opinion and promoting national spirit. On the contrary, precisely because we oppose the hypocritical and hegemonic politics of the British and Americans, we must concentrate public opinion and unite national strength in order to achieve ultimate victory. In terms of academic theory, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of Democracy, and indeed the entire Three Principles of the People, had already laid the theoretical foundation for us. Not only do members of the Kuomintang have to establish public opinion organs, as indicated in the oft-recited will that "it must be realized in the shortest possible time," but other people also have the same desire, so it seems there is no need to elaborate further. From the perspective of the political theory and practice of totalitarianism in the Axis countries, the so-called "totality" is "the concentrated expression of political power," which is in harmony with our country's "hearts of all people returning" in the "Kingly Way" politics. As for the practical aspect, in order to realize totalitarianism, it is first necessary to pass through various mass organizations and public opinion organs. On the one hand, they convey the government's policies and decrees, and on the other hand, they reflect the people's aspirations. Only then can the spiritual and material strength of the masses be gathered around the government, and the whole country can move towards the path of victory as one. Otherwise, empty slogans of totalitarianism are just another form of opposing totalitarianism. In fact, all countries that practice totalitarian politics today have genuine public opinion organs. Whether it is Japan or Germany and Italy, they build national policy on public opinion, so the state does not have to be distracted by preventing infant people, as the United States does in dealing with the strike movement and Britain in dealing with rebellions in India and elsewhere. After studying these facts, we can say more firmly that in order to concentrate public opinion and unite national strength to consolidate the government and promote national policy, we can only boldly establish a true public opinion organ that has long been expected by all parties.

The next question that arises, and the one that we must carefully study today, is what kind of public opinion organ do we need? Researching and answering this question requires attention to several basic conditions: First, it must be in harmony with China's national conditions. For more than thirty years, we have tried several bitter medicines. In the first ten years, we suffered the consequences of trying out European and American parliamentary politics. In the second ten years, we suffered even more from "Soviet politics." In the third ten years, we also suffered from one-party dictatorship and even tyrannical rule. In short, the suffering of the past thirty years has arisen from blindly trying things without regard to the national conditions! Having learned our lesson, we can no longer repeat the mistakes of the past thirty years! We must adopt the most appropriate method for our own national conditions. Second, we must take into account the facts. This is also different from the situation mentioned above. In the past thirty years, we have also suffered from pursuing ideals without regard to reality. Even with public opinion organs, in the period of imitating Europe and America, we only emphasized form, piecing together a parliament and forming a cabinet, treating national policy as child's play. In the era of imitating the Soviet Union, regardless of the extent to which the Chinese working class was willing to advocate revolution, or whether the peasants themselves had revolutionary demands, we formed "Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Soviets" in the same way, again disregarding reality and treating national policy as child's play. As for the later one-party dictatorship and tyrannical politics, they only knew how to pick up on what others had said, fabricate public opinion, and enslave the people, which was even more heartbreaking.

Now, if we want to establish a true public opinion organ, we must address the reasons for past failures, adapt to national conditions, and value reality. The most important thing is: First, it is currently impossible to convene a National Assembly or a National Conference, so we must never issue such political checks in order to maintain the government's credibility. Second, the current national conditions in China are complex, the interests of various classes are not entirely the same, and there are indeed various political parties in existence. Therefore, there is no need to shout empty slogans of "one-party dictatorship." Shouting will be of no use and will only increase turmoil. It is better to absorb talents from all parties through public opinion organs and promote national policy under the unified leadership of the government.

Therefore, the public opinion organ we need today must be suitable for national conditions and reality. First, in terms of its functions, it is not an organ for performing actual political affairs, but an organ for concentrating public opinion and uniting national strength to assist the government and supervise the government's implementation of national policy. Second, at the same time, the public opinion organ we need must not be a redundant organization that decorates political form, nor can it be a simple advisory body for government consultation. It must be able to genuinely reflect public opinion and exert national strength in order to improve national policy. Third, in terms of organizational composition, in order to achieve the above two points, we must carefully consider the following points: (1) We must earnestly absorb talents from all aspects who come from the people and are trusted by the masses, and we must not harbor narrow-minded sectarian prejudices; (2) Incumbent officials must not intervene in public opinion organs. At the same time, the number of members of the ruling party must not exceed one-third in the public opinion organs, so as not to lose the authenticity and purity of the public opinion organs; (3) The selection criteria for members of public opinion organs should focus on their prestige in society, especially the general public's trust in them, that is, emphasizing their past virtues and achievements, followed by political knowledge and ability, etc. Age, gender, and past thoughts should not occupy an important position.

Perhaps some people doubt that after such a public opinion organ is established, it will be manipulated by a few ambitious people or dissidents, thereby hindering the government's administration? We can clearly say that any truly sound government or ruling party will not have such concerns. Because what a sound government and ruling party fear is not having contact with the people, it is the people's indifference to everything the government does, not the evil deeds of so-called ambitious people and dissidents. What the government urgently seeks is to be able to understand the people's hardships at any time, to understand the people's wishes at any time, to hear the people's opinions and criticisms of the government at any time, to obtain the people's concern and cooperation with all the government's policies at any time, and to point out certain malpractices and errors. Because only in this way can political affairs be improved, public opinion concentrated, national strength united, and national policy implemented. Only a true public opinion organ can consolidate the government's connection with the people. Even if a few ambitious people have conspiracies here, they will not have an effect. At present, we must cooperate with friendly countries to win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War externally, and we must complete the realization of comprehensive peace as soon as possible internally. The government is only afraid that the people's cooperation is insufficient, so establishing a true public opinion organ to promote national policy is a major event that brooks no delay. We not only hope that the government will carefully consider it and implement it as soon as possible, but we also hope that advanced people from all walks of life in society will jointly plan and research for the government, so that the brightest page can be unfolded in the history of the new China in the future.

### Ambassador Gu Visited Chairman Wang Yesterday to Explain in Detail the Results of His Discussions with Various Authorities in Japan. The Return of the Shanghai International Settlement Will Commence Immediately.

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese Ambassador to China Gu Zhengzhi returned to his post on the 22nd and immediately paid a visit to Chairman Wang on the afternoon of the 23rd to explain in detail the discussions he had with government authorities during his recent return to Japan. He departed at approximately 3:00 PM.

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese Ambassador to China Gu Zhengzhi returned to Japan earlier this month for official business, where he discussed various important issues with Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and other key government figures. After more than ten days, he safely returned to his post in the capital via Shanghai on the 22nd. He received reporters at his official residence at 2:00 PM on the 23rd. He made the following remarks regarding the revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and other issues: "My recent return to Japan for discussions with Prime Minister Tojo and relevant ministers was highly satisfactory, enabling me to accomplish the major objectives of this trip. The Japanese government's new policy towards China, the Central Authorities' views, and the opinions of all parties are now in complete alignment. Going forward, we will commence the implementation of various measures based on this correct and unwavering principle. The first issue to be addressed will be the return of the Shanghai International Settlement. The Shanghai French Concession will also naturally be included as part of this issue. This will allow the political power of the National Government to permeate the entire Greater Shanghai area. The issue of abolishing taxation rights within extraterritorial rights will be resolved by accelerating the abolition as much as possible in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on the Exercise of Jurisdiction. The issues of consular jurisdiction and police power are also under study. The reorganization of Japanese policy companies will be implemented sequentially, with due consideration for the various relationships involved. Prime Minister Tojo's statement during the recent Diet session regarding a fundamental revision of the existing Sino-Japanese Treaty is stronger and more forceful than previous statements, and its significance is self-evident. As for the timing and content of the revised treaty, since it has not yet been formally discussed with the National Government authorities, it will not be announced for the time being. However, I am confident that these facts will be realized concretely in the near future. The existing treaties between China and Japan, as well as those concluded by Britain and the United States in an attempt to maintain their influence in East Asia, will undergo a transformation as a result. In particular, it should be emphasized that Prime Minister Tojo's special emphasis on the fundamental revision of the treaty as the centerpiece of this statement demonstrates that Japan's new policy towards China will advance even further, and the epoch-making progress in Sino-Japanese relations can be foreseen.

### The Japanese Military Authorities in North China Express Support for the North China Food Policy

The North China Political Affairs Commission recently issued a public notice, stipulating that new grain will be purchased at the new price limit starting from June 21st. The Japanese garrison authorities in North China, recognizing the importance of solving the North China food problem, issued a statement at 3:00 PM on the 21st, expressing support for the North China food policy and clarifying the North China Japanese military's concern for the North China food problem. They also stated that anyone who violates the Chinese side's policies will be punished according to military law. The North China Japanese Military's statement and the attitude of the Embassy authorities' North China Price Cooperation Conference are both concrete manifestations of the Japanese side's active cooperation with the Chinese side's policies, which is noteworthy.

Statement by the Japanese Military Authorities in North China (Issued at 15:00 on the 21st) The North China Political Affairs Commission has made painstaking efforts to solve the increasingly serious food problem in North China, and fortunately, it has gradually achieved results, which is deeply gratifying. We particularly admire the enthusiasm of Chairman Zhu and all the others.

The Beijing Office of the Japanese Imperial Embassy in China also issued a statement in response to the Chinese side's policy, hoping that Japanese residents would cooperate as one. The Japanese military authorities in North China also believe that the current food problem is an urgent task to stabilize the livelihood of the people in North China, and the food problem has a great impact on the Japanese military's mission and the security of North China. Therefore, we are deeply concerned about its trends. Regarding the Chinese authorities' various food policies, we will not hesitate to give full support, and we will also provide as much assistance as possible in terms of procurement and transportation. At the same time, those who violate the Chinese side's policies or attempt to sabotage them, regardless of Chinese or Japanese nationality, will be severely punished according to military law.

### After Premier Tojo Expounded His Beliefs, the Prime Minister of Thailand Sent a Letter of Thanks, Resolving to Complete the War and Strive for Final Victory So That East Asian Nations May Achieve Independence and Glory

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) Premier Tojo of Japan, in his policy speech at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet, stated that Japan would provide further cooperation to its ally, Thailand, to help it develop, and expounded the beliefs of the Japanese government. The Thai government and people were deeply grateful for this. Premier Phibunsongkhram of Thailand decided to represent the people and express his gratitude to Premier Tojo of Japan for his speech. On the afternoon of the 22nd, Thai Ambassador to Japan Direk Jayanama visited Premier Tojo at his official residence and presented him with a letter from Premier Phibunsongkhram. Premier Tojo expressed his sincere thanks for this and reiterated his belief, stating, "Regarding further cooperation with Thailand, we will gradually strive to make it a concrete reality." The content of Premier Phibunsongkhram's letter and Premier Tojo's words of thanks are as follows.

Content of Premier Phibunsongkhram's Letter

I respectfully represent the people of Thailand in expressing my deep gratitude for the general policy speech that Your Excellency made at the Imperial Diet, which is in line with the current situation. If we Asian nations are still subject to the rule of foreign nations as in the past, then the development of Asia standing on the position of a civilized continent cannot be completed, and we have long hoped to ensure the independence and integrity of national sovereignty. Now, Your Excellency and the Japanese people have enabled the nations of Asia to achieve the glory of national independence, which is deeply appreciated by all Asian nations. As Your Excellency knows, we have been devoting all our efforts to cooperate with Your Excellency and the Japanese people in all aspects, and there is no doubt about this. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify to Your Excellency that the point in Your Excellency's speech regarding

is the point that the Thai people are most grateful for. The sovereignty and independence of the nation, and the future of the nation, are what we are most concerned about. The achievements of today are the foundation of the achievements of tomorrow. Now that Your Excellency has clarified the resolution to further assist Thailand's development, I am very optimistic and full of joy about the future development of the Thai people. We are also firmly determined to complete the war until final victory is achieved, so as to contribute to Your Excellency and the Japanese people.

Main Points of Premier Tojo's Reply

The Japanese government respects the sovereignty and dignity of Thailand, which is an unshakeable direction. We will continue to adhere to this policy to promote Japan-Thailand relations, which goes without saying. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to restore the original face of the nations of Greater East Asia. This is Japan's consistent and unchanging purpose, which is the same as the understanding that your country has gained based on my speech in the Diet this time. This objective will gradually become a concrete reality as the war progresses. The Japanese government appreciates Thailand's sincere cooperation with Japan and Thailand's long-cherished aspirations, so we have made clear our determination to provide further cooperation to Thailand this time, and we will gradually strive to make it a concrete reality.

### Thailand Revolution Memorial Day: Speech by Japanese Ambassador to Thailand

Bangkok, 23rd (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of Thailand's Revolution Memorial Day on the 24th, the Japanese Ambassador to Thailand, Mr. Taira, delivered a speech, the gist of which is: For anything to achieve extraordinary success, it must have determination and be carried out decisively with strength. A major reform of a country's political system is no easy task; it cannot be expected to succeed without the resolve to die for it. Eleven years ago, Siam, in a corner of Asia, sought only to maintain the status quo, but now it has emerged before the world as a modern nation. In addition to reorganizing its national structure, it has been striving daily to reform its internal affairs, strengthen its military, promote cultural advancement, and expand its territory. Its development can be described as rapid and ever-changing. The development of Thailand in the past eleven years is unprecedented in its thousand-year history. On June 24th, eleven years ago, young Thai patriots, unable to suppress their patriotic fervor, rose up resolutely. Their comrades crossed the line of death, endured hardships, and finally achieved today's glory. Since then, the Thai people, under the leadership of these young statesmen, have also re-bet their national destiny. This includes the Thai-Vietnamese War and the current Greater East Asia War. The outcome of the Greater East Asia War is either victory or destruction. In this war, the Thai people must again re-bet their national destiny. Now, Japan and Thailand are fighting together to liberate themselves from the oppression of Britain and the United States, betting their national destiny. If this war is victorious, all the peoples of East Asia will be able to enjoy infinite freedom and prosperity. If it fails, not only will they return to the dark ages before the abolition of extraterritoriality, but they will also become slaves of the Anglo-Saxons for at least five hundred years. Therefore, the fate of the East Asian peoples rests on this one battle. Any nation that wishes to prosper must take risks. A nation that does not have the courage to take risks is a nation doomed to perish and is not capable of accomplishing great things. Therefore, we not only express our respect to the Thai people, who have established great achievements under the leadership of Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram for the past eleven years, but also hope that the Thai people will use their past courage to strive to complete this Greater East Asia War.

### Australian MP Proposes Vote of No Confidence

Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Canberra, at the beginning of the Australian Lower House meeting on the 22nd, Mr. Nance, a member of the United Australia Party (Opposition Party), proposed a motion of no confidence in the government. Subsequently, Mr. Fadden, the leader of the United Australia Party, also severely criticized the government for "neglecting national affairs and engaging in politics" and demanded a vote on the motion of no confidence in the government. The main points of Fadden's attack are as follows: (1) Lack of administrative power due to insufficient ability and experience; (2) Unnecessary interference by the cabinet in the industrial sector, while neglecting strikes and other slowdowns in important military industrial sectors regarding constructive control; (3) Major failure in increasing food production; (4) Shortage of essential commodities; The current cabinet's improper policies have led to the precarious state of Australia's economic structure, and no clear direction has been established for post-war reconstruction. From the above points of attack, it can be seen that almost all aspects of the current cabinet's policies are inappropriate. However, this motion of no confidence in the government has not yet been put to a vote. The case has been discussed for twenty hours in the past and is scheduled to continue for another twenty hours.

### Bose Broadcasts to Germany and Italy, Vows to Cooperate with the Axis Powers to Defeat Britain and the United States and Strive for Indian Independence

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Indian patriot Subhas Chandra Bose, speaking from the Central Broadcasting Station here on the 23rd, broadcast appeals to the German and Italian people in their respective languages. The main points of his speech are as follows: (1) Main points of the broadcast to Germany: When I was in Germany, I had talks with President Hitler and other German government leaders, and therefore I was able to deeply understand that Germany is very concerned about the Indian issue and has deep sympathy for Indian independence. Germany is fighting against Britain, the traditional enemy of our Indian people. I know that the entire German people, even if they have to make any sacrifices, will strive to win the final victory in this war. No matter how much the enemy threatens and attacks Germany, they can never shake the firm determination of the German people. Japan, Germany, and Italy are currently maintaining a close relationship of complete coordination. There is no disagreement among the three countries regarding war objectives, as falsely speculated by the anti-Axis camp. Japan still possesses vast human resources, and its economic situation and food situation are very good. The abundant resources previously controlled by the anti-Axis side before the war are now being rapidly developed after being occupied by Japan. It is difficult for me to understand why the United States and Britain are still dreaming of victory. Finally, I sincerely extend my greetings to my fellow Indians residing in Germany and other European countries. The final victory and the freedom of the Indian people are as certain as the coming of daylight after the end of the night. It is about to arrive, there is no doubt. (2) Main points of the broadcast to Italy: This war is a struggle between two major groups of countries in the world, one maintaining the old order and the other building a new order. We are joining hands with energetic young people to move towards overthrowing imperialist countries. All the people of India have a duty to take up arms in this war to defeat British and American imperialism. I am convinced that the time has come for all the people of India to fulfill this duty. The spirit of the immortal Marshal Yamamoto is alive in the hearts of the Japanese people, which is the most reliable proof of achieving final victory. Here I would like to reiterate that all the people of India are determined to cooperate with the Axis powers to fight until the final victory is won.

### Son of Premier Ba Maw to Study in Japan

Rangoon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Since Japanese Prime Minister Tojo made his statement, the gratitude of the Burmese people has reached its peak. Mr. Charlie (one of six siblings), the eldest son of Premier Ba Maw, who bears the heavy responsibility of Burma, has long aspired to study mechanical engineering. He will go to Japan to study aircraft manufacturing technology. After receiving permission from his parents, Premier Ba Maw is currently considering which school he will attend in Japan and will decide before his departure. The reporter visited Mr. Charlie at Premier Ba Maw's residence on the 22nd, and he said, "I am very pleased that my hope of studying in Japan has now been realized. This time, I plan to enter an industrial school to become an aviation technician to strengthen Burma's air defenses. I decided after discussing the situation in Japan with my father and hope to go to Japan to study as soon as possible."

### Japanese Planes Attack Guadalcanal

### Major Race Riot Erupts in Detroit, USA; Troops Deployed, Over a Thousand Arrested; Miners' Strike Still Unresolved

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to news received here last night, Detroit, the center of the American automobile industry, returned to normal yesterday under military suppression after 36 hours of bloody conflict. A total of 23 people died in the riot, 20 of whom were black. 1,300 rioters were arrested, 85% of whom were black. Yesterday, federal troops wearing helmets and carrying rifles and machine guns patrolled the city in trucks. Martial law was declared in the important wartime factory area, which covers about three towns with a population of over two million. It is reported that a total of 700 people were injured in the riot, and 1,300 people were arrested by the military and police. According to the martial law declared by the Governor of Michigan, those who participated in shooting and illegally carrying weapons will be severely punished. This racial riot reached its peak yesterday morning when troops used multiple platoons to attack a building occupied by blacks. The blacks had turned the building into a fortress, and dozens of them, armed with automatic pistols, rifles, and other weapons, refused to surrender to the troops and opened fire in resistance for several hours. The troops attacked with hand grenades and tear gas, and only surrendered after running out of ammunition. Before the troops arrived, these blacks ambushed at windows with unique obstacles and shot at any white people they saw. When the troops took the building, two blacks were killed and several were injured. Due to the riot, many workers at the welfare general, and Chrysler automobile factories did not go to work yesterday morning, and all black workers at each factory were absent. Brigadier General Ganse, who commands the troops, warned the rioters that he still has soldiers as reserves and can come to suppress them at any time if there is any sign of unrest.

### German and Soviet Forces Engage in Positional Warfare; Tank Groups Deployed, Tensions High Along the Entire Line; German Forces Attack Soviet Positions on the East Bank of the Donets River

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German-Soviet War entered its third year on the 22nd, and fierce positional warfare is still ongoing along the entire Eastern Front, a prelude to the summer decisive battle. As such, tensions are high along the entire line. According to reports received here, German and Soviet forces have been continuously engaged in large-scale tank group and mechanized unit encounters in the Volkhov area east of Leningrad, the Kirov area 70 kilometers southeast of Smolensk, Kursk in the northeast, and the areas 130 kilometers southwest of Smui and northeast of Belgorod. In addition, air and land battles have also taken place between German and Soviet forces in the Balakleya and Izyum areas. After a long period of offensive, German forces have reached the east bank of the Donets River and attacked the main Soviet positions. In response, the Soviet Information Bureau issued a communiqué on the 22nd stating: (After severely damaging the German forces, they have been repelled). There has been no further confirmation. Furthermore, according to German news agencies, German combat bomber formations in the Volkhov area have launched a full-scale bombing campaign on Soviet supply lines. Soviet fighter squadrons have intercepted them, shooting down 29 Soviet aircraft. In addition, they have been intensely bombing Soviet heavy industrial areas in the upper reaches of the Volga River day and night.

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports: A British reporter who stayed in the Soviet Union for fifteen months told the London Daily Express yesterday that the equipment of the Soviet army is now better than before, and there is no need to fear German attacks. However, the Soviet Union's manpower is not inexhaustible. He believes that since the beginning of the war, the Soviet side has lost a total of 30 million people. This number includes men and women who have died, been injured, gone missing, been captured, or been sent to Germany to work, as well as those who have died from disease. The rations for soldiers are very meager, only two pounds of bread and ordinary vegetable soup. Soldiers hope to get better clothing, books, movies, and vacations in the future.

At the same time, Tegor has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces in "other" territories. It is said that people from the Tegor faction are very disappointed that French North Africa is under the command of Giraud. The committee has not answered questions regarding who will command the navy, as well as who will govern Syria, French Equatorial Africa, French Upper Volta, and Madagascar.

### The Posture of German Wartime Enterprises

— Masayoshi Iijima (II)

Rationalization of Material Allocation

Next, how are materials allocated? In the past, organizations that planned and were allocated materials often asserted their rights of use and wanted to obtain priority, which led to competition. Since the implementation of national management, appropriate disposal methods have been studied. A Military Supplies Bank was established in Berlin, guided by a consensus system involving Deputy Director Keilner of the Four-Year Plan, Minister of Munitions Speer, and Marshal Milch. Needless to say, the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as others who have obtained the right to use and allocate materials according to the Material Mobilization Plan, must deposit funds in this Military Supplies Bank. Each military branch that has deposits in the Military Supplies Bank can issue documents for military supplies to businesses. Businesses that receive these documents request the necessary materials from the issuer based on the quantity of military supplies required in the documents. Based on this request, each military branch notifies the Military Supplies Bank to withdraw its deposit. The Military Supplies Bank, upon receiving the payment notice, withdraws from the deposit book and provides the business with a purchase certificate for the required materials. If the Military Supplies Bank stipulates a deadline for issuing the purchase certificate, the business can fully obtain the required materials upon receiving the purchase certificate. The timing of issuing purchase certificates is guided by the director of the Four-Year Plan. This attitude ensures the smooth allocation of materials, thereby enabling key enterprises to operate effectively.

Utilization of Machine Tools

Regarding machine tools, Germany pays close attention to investigating machine tools that are not in operation domestically. In each economic region, there are survey agencies for machine tools called Industrial Committees. These are composed of technicians with a high level of expertise in machine tool processing who constantly inspect each manufacturing facility under their jurisdiction in rotation. They thoroughly investigate whether there are any machines that are not fully active, and whether machines that can be highly utilized are being used to their full extent. In cases where there are imperfections, the results are reported to a military supervision point that is separate from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Furthermore, under the production leaders, there is a "Purchase Permit Office for Machine Tools," and a "Need Review Office" is set up under those who guide the production of military supplies, making every effort to prevent the need for new machine tools. First, if a business needs a machine tool, it applies to the production leader who guides that industry to purchase the machine. At this time, the Need Review Office reviews whether there are ways to achieve the purpose without using that machine. Second, they review methods to prevent the need for machines by subcontracting to other places with idle machine equipment. At the same time, the Military Supplies Supervision Office investigates factories with idle machinery, and if necessary, it can requisition them and order them to be kept in custody. If, apart from all these cases, it is impossible to modify the idle machinery and new work is required, then. . . .

In this way, each enterprise can apply to the Purchase Permit Office under the machine tool production leader to purchase the machine. If the Purchase Permit Office considers it appropriate to enter into a contract with a certain company to purchase, it grants approval. The establishment of a Purchase Permit Office under the supervisors who guide machine tool manufacturing companies prohibits all machine tool manufacturing companies from producing machines arbitrarily. That is, in order to purchase machine tools, the vouchers for allocating materials are not truly delivered to the hands of machine tool manufacturers. The machine tool guidance committee delivers a purchase certificate in exchange for these allocation vouchers, and the guiding committee itself uses this to conclude a sales contract between the two parties. Based on the materials collected, it then considers future needs, designates the types and quantities to be manufactured by each machine tool manufacturer, and allocates materials. At this time, the types of materials produced can be reduced significantly, and the variety of products in the same manufacturing facility can be reduced to the greatest extent possible, while increasing the quantity of production. As a result, the variety of German machine tools has been reduced by about a quarter, from several thousand types before the war to about a thousand types. The types of similar machine tools are gradually reduced, and companies increase the production variety of the same machine.

Labor Mobilization and Efficiency Maintenance Measures

As for the labor problem, if each enterprise is left to its own devices, the number of personnel it requires will inevitably be unlimited. Therefore, Labor Use Monitoring Committees are established in each economic region to provide appropriate guidance and supervision on labor issues. These committees are also composed of machine tool technicians who inspect and investigate all manufacturing facilities under their jurisdiction. They thoroughly investigate the actual situation of idle labor or skilled workers and report how to properly allocate male and female workers to the local labor bureau. The local labor bureau, in accordance with the requirements of the military, summons male workers who are deemed necessary. Or, in newly built or expanded factories, it orders skilled workers who are considered unnecessary to change jobs or replaces skilled workers. After the male workers, it assigns apprentices, female workers, foreign laborers, and prisoners of war. Therefore, although the total number of employees in the country has not changed much from before the war to today, it has decreased in.

Using this decline in employees to maintain production efficiency, the production technology of each manufacturing facility will naturally not improve. Therefore, production technicians painstakingly study, break down work, and transfer it to skilled operations, and research single-skill tools or machines that even amateurs can use, so that production efficiency does not decline. In extreme cases, precision work such as the measurement and inspection of parts and products can be done by blind people. Or, blind people can be made to operate lathes.

### German Heavy Bomber Formations Fiercely Attack the Port of Bizerte

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Strong formations of German Air Force heavy bombers carried out a large-scale air raid on the port of Bizerte on the day, fiercely bombing anti-Axis ships, severely damaging two destroyers and six merchant ships (35,000 tons). Although the detailed results of the battle have not yet been determined, it is estimated that three of the enemy's destroyed merchant ships have sunk, and others are in a state where they cannot be used for a long time. Air Force Reporter Major Freitag of the German News Agency reported on this as follows: The German Air Force's blitz air raid on the port of Bizerte was carried out in good weather, so it was able to approach the target of the attack and repeatedly carry out thorough bombing. Initially, two enemy ships were hit and caught fire, and three 6,000-ton ships were also hit directly, and it is estimated that they have sunk. A 7,000-ton merchant ship also had a large explosion and may have sunk. In addition, a 4,000-ton merchant ship was hit and rotated from side to side, appearing to have been severely damaged. In addition, two destroyers were also bombed, but because there were many ships anchored in the port of Bizerte, the actual results of the German Air Force may be even greater.

### Germany Dispatches Large Army to Italy for Reinforcements

### Tokyo Changes to Metropolitan System, to be Implemented Next Month

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Since deciding to change Tokyo City to a metropolitan system, Japan has started preparations and has now completed them all. It will begin implementation on July 1st. As such, the Japanese capital, the largest city in Greater East Asia, will reappear with the new appearance of Tokyo Metropolis. The appointment of the Governor of Tokyo Metropolis has been carefully considered by the Japanese government. Recently, Prime Minister Tojo approved the appointment of Mr. Tatsuo Ota, former Vice Minister of Home Affairs and current Mayor of the Special City of Syonan, as the Governor of Tokyo Metropolis. It is planned to announce the appointment at the same time as the implementation of the metropolitan system on July 1st. Before the announcement, he will be assigned to prepare for the establishment of Tokyo Metropolis.

### Change in German Strategy for War Against the Soviet Union

A special dispatch from Berlin by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun on the 21st, reviewing the current state of the German-Soviet war, has been relayed in summary by the Central News Agency's Tokyo telegram and published on page three of this newspaper yesterday. Now, for the sake of a more complete understanding, we provide a full translation of the original text, hoping to attract the attention of our readers. - Editor's Note

(Berlin Correspondent, Shoushan, 19th) Half a month has passed in June, and on the Eastern Front, the two armies are facing each other, showing no intention of launching a large-scale offensive. Both sides are merely proclaiming that "the enemy's major offensive is imminent." This suggests that both sides may be waiting for the other to begin the attack, or that there are other reasons for the stalemate. The German army's favored mobile warfare, which could have been launched since early May, has now been allowed to pass through this valuable "time" of a month and a half without any action.

Last year, the attack on the Kerch Peninsula and the battle for Sevastopol were launched. After these two battles concluded, the day the main southern front began its real major offensive was June 30th. This year, or in the foreseeable future, the German major offensive may have to wait until that time. This is evidence that a fundamental change, different from last year's European war situation, is subtly taking place. From a military standpoint, it was possible to fight on only one side of the Eastern Front last year, but this year, due to the evacuation from Tunisia and the European fortress, preparations must be made for the landing of the British and American armies, thus forming a two-front war. At this time, it is difficult to say whether it is beneficial for Germany to concentrate all its forces on the Eastern Front.

On January 30th, when the Sixth Army suffered complete annihilation in Stalingrad, Marshal Goering declared in an angry tone the German "summer offensive." However, the situation today, with North Africa full of British and American troops preparing to attack, has changed considerably compared to that time. In addition to this change in the military situation, another extremely important phenomenon is that Germany's operational policy towards the Soviet Union is gradually changing politically. That is to say, Germany has begun to re-examine the limits of the "resourcefulness of the Soviet Union" from the initial starting point, that is, the sum of all Soviet land, resources, manpower, and its spiritual strength. Previously, it was only intended to use military force to solve the Eastern problem, but now a strong political element has been incorporated from a new perspective. The anniversary of the third year of the German-Soviet war is a matter of great concern.

Lessons Learned by Germany

On June 22, 1941, the German army suddenly began to attack the Soviet Union. Initially, its goal was not only to defeat communism, but also to fundamentally and permanently eliminate the threat of the Great Slavic nation to Europe. If the capital Moscow had fallen within a few months of its invasion, anti-government revolutions would have occurred everywhere inside the Soviet Union, and it was expected that the Red regime would collapse on its own. Germany launched its largest general offensive in the autumn of 1941 in an attempt to occupy Moscow, and immediately after a summer offensive, prepared to implement the political organization of the eastern occupied territories and incorporate the vast occupied territories into German territory. These facts are a manifestation of its intent.

However, after two years of repeated summer and winter offensives and defenses, Germany must now re-recognize the state of affairs on the Eastern Front in the following respects:

First, it is quite difficult to use blitzkrieg tactics against an enemy like the Soviet Union that possesses enormous combat power.

Second, because the Communist Party's organization is unexpectedly strong, although Germany has achieved great victories, the political collapse of the Soviet Union internally is still not to be expected.

Third, occupying a vast territory and losing a large number of troops and weapons is indeed a considerable blow to the Soviet Union, but this cannot be regarded as a decline in the Soviet Union's resistance.

Fourth, the Soviet Union's communist dictatorship does not take into account the lives and property of individuals in any way, and the Soviet Union is in fact the most suitable national organization for thoroughly conducting a tragic modern total war.

Fifth, the Asian character of the Slavic nation is different from that of Europe, and this new Soviet national character, combined with the inherent patriotism of Russia, has resulted in the Red Army soldiers having an indisputable fighting spirit that is difficult for Europeans to understand.

The lessons learned from the past two years have naturally prompted Germany to reflect on its new policy for war against the Soviet Union. Whether in military or political terms, it naturally comes from this reflection. Regarding this matter, the National Socialist Party's newspaper, "Völkischer Beobachter," published an essay entitled "Transformation" on June 4th. This article was written anonymously by a former military correspondent on the Eastern Front. It frankly pointed out the errors of the previous German view of the Soviet Union and hinted at a change in Germany's policy towards the Soviet Union. The main points are as follows:

From Military to Political

When we began to invade the Soviet Union in June 1941, we Germans used non-European astonishment to speculate on everything we saw there: the land, the people, and their lives. Therefore, when the victory reports "millions of enemies captured, tens of thousands of enemy tanks and aircraft destroyed" came one after another at that time, no one thought that this was a bitter war that would determine the fate of Europe and decide life and death. Our soldiers also believed that after a lightning attack, they could immediately enter Leningrad or Moscow, but we now know that to rule this vast Eastern region, it is completely impossible without a twelve-point grasp of the Russian people. The combat of Soviet soldiers far exceeds the constraints and habits of warfare that we have learned. Sometimes, a certain Soviet corps opens up different formations and arranges a reckless formation, attacking our side. Sometimes, they refuse to surrender in a completely surrounded situation, cutting off their own lives. Sometimes, a heavily burdened Soviet soldier exerts his last strength to shoot the German orderly who rescues him.

In the summer of 1942, when the second offensive began, the German army successively occupied the cities of Sevastopol, Rostov, the Caucasus, and Stalingrad. The German rear was greatly excited by these victories. Our soldiers on the Eastern Front, because they had already occupied the enemy's capital, thought that they had to wage a war against the Russian people. Compared with the vastness of the territory occupied, the number of enemies captured in the second offensive was extremely small. Stalin elevated the stubborn character deeply rooted among the Russian residents to the "War of Patriotic Love." Wherever we went, there was still a frantic stubborn resistance. Therefore, the Red Army did not suffer any decisive fatal injuries in the second German offensive, but instead took the winter offensive due to the supplementation of weapons aided by the United States and the rapidly increasing military industrial power in the Ural and Siberian regions. After two years on the Eastern Front, we cannot but look back and see that the German people at that time knew too little about the humanity of the Russian people. But now we know what kind of people Russians are. Without expression, behind the firm mask of the Russians, we should not see the hidden delicate sensibility and rich humanity. This humanity transcends the rulers and political forms, and remains unchanged at any time, remaining as part of the great Russian nature. In these two years, we have learned that we should use the Russian scale to estimate Russia. Chinese peasants, although repeatedly dominated by different ethnic groups, still exist aloof, as an example. Therefore, our view of Russia will have a great change, but this change comes from past experience, and we Germans will inevitably learn the key to solving the Eastern problem. Whether we can use this key to embark on the road of Eastern construction is the mission of our German soldiers.

Praise for Japanese Policy

The articles published in German newspapers unanimously believe that the background is the movement of "Organizing the Russian Liberation Army" led by Soviet defector General Vlasov on March 16. Germany's new Eastern policy has added a political element due to the opportunity of the last winter war. Whether the movement of General Vlasov will develop into the existence of the Chinese National Government depends entirely on the future situation. However, today, the Germans, who absolutely do not give up the anti-communist front, as mentioned above, are seeking new solutions in the war against the Soviet Union from both political and military forces. What we Japanese find deeply interesting is that in the past, the Germans have always paid attention to Japan's methods of resolving the Manchurian Incident, its policies for dealing with the China Incident, and the various measures taken by Japan in the southern occupied territories this time. Recently, Germany has become very concerned and has begun to study them. In particular, Prime Minister Tojo's declaration of Philippine independence on the opening day of the recent special session of parliament caused unexpected repercussions in German journalistic circles. Seeing "Japan's occupation and governing policies," they deeply scrutinized them. The various policies that Germany has begun to adopt in the Eastern occupied territories, such as eliminating Soviet-style forced labor, collective agriculture, recognizing private land ownership, preparing to grant land to surrendered Soviet prisoners, guaranteeing the lives of Soviet wounded soldiers, planning to rebuild destroyed cities and villages with German state funds, and liberating criminals sentenced by the Soviet regime, are all implementations of Germany's new policy towards the Soviet Union.

In short, Germany's policy for war against the Soviet Union was to annihilate the main force of the Red Army in the first year, to occupy the land and resources of the Soviet Union in the second year, and in the third year, the characteristic is to launch political power. There are still many difficulties in the future war against the Soviet Union, and a new method has been seen. (Translated by Yi: The Western Period News is from June 21st)

### Su Yizhi Case; Hearing Held Yesterday Without Verdict

The case of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at the Sacred Heart Elementary School, who was beaten to death by Liu Wangshi, the mother of student Liu Zhijun, was re-examined yesterday morning by the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The original defendants and witnesses made their statements. The police lawyer stated that the deceased had taken several tablets of gastric acid before the incident, which is noteworthy. It has now been chemically tested and no poison was found in the stomach. It is heard that the police believe that the circumstances of this case are serious and there are still several points that need to be investigated, so they requested a postponement. The court yesterday ordered Liu Wangshi to be detained and re-examined in seven days. The forensic examination report of Hou Guangdi has been disclosed, which considers that the rupture and bleeding of the left eardrum is proof of cerebral hemorrhage, and that death was indeed caused by the injury. The family of the deceased also filed a civil suit, requesting that the defendant be ordered to compensate (1) the plaintiff Su Fengying for funeral expenses on behalf of the victim, totaling 30,000 yuan in Central Reserve Notes, (2) the plaintiff Su Lu, the victim's grandmother, who needs the victim's support and funeral expenses, totaling 50,000 yuan, (3) the plaintiff Su Yingwei, the victim's brother, who is nine years old and has been supported by the victim. His future life will be in dire straits. The monthly living expenses are calculated at 500 yuan, and the annual cost is 6,000 yuan, which will be calculated up to the age of 20, totaling 11 years, for a total of 66,000 yuan, plus education expenses of 50,000 yuan, for a total of 196,000 yuan.

### Reconstructing Caohujing Prison

The Caohujing Prison in the western suburbs of Shanghai was large in scale before the incident, accommodating more than 2,000 inmates. The internal factory facilities and management were particularly strict, and it was known as a model prison. Unfortunately, since the incident, it was destroyed in a military mutiny. At that time, local order was not restored, and the timber doors and windows were all stolen, so it became desolate. The Ministry of Judicial Administration now intends to restore the prison. The Jiangsu High Court instructed the Shanghai Local Court to conduct a detailed investigation of the current situation of the prison, and draw a map of the four sites, and submit it to the court for transfer to the ministry for reference and preparation for restoration.

### Sanyou Sells Hangzhou Factory; Shareholders File Criminal Lawsuit

The Sanyou Industrial Society of this city is a joint-stock limited company, founded in the first year of the Republic of China. Since the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, it has established a textile and dyeing factory in Gongchen Bridge, Hangzhou. The factory base occupies an area of 118 mu, and has purchased more than 20,000 spinning spindles, 750 wide and narrow looms, and 220 motors, totaling 1,500 horsepower. In addition, there are various machines for dyeing, finishing, sizing, and preparation. Before the war, the cost was 1.808 million yuan. Calculated at the current market value, it is huge. On November 19th of last year, Wang Yunfu and others, as directors of the company, sold the factory to Guohua Industrial Investment Company at a price of 3.8 million yuan in the name of the board of directors. Now, shareholders such as Shen Jiucheng have filed a criminal lawsuit. The trial was held at the First Special Court at 11:00 yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Wang Cheng.

### French Concession Has Held Zonal Drills; Summer Lighting Control

In view of the fact that it is now summer, residents often like to open their windows wide to enjoy the cool, so the lights are fully exposed at night, which is contrary to the purpose of lighting control. The police authorities of the French Concession have decided that in late this month, the baojia in each district will, according to the order of the police station in each district, implement passive air defense lighting control in the form of joint guarantee units, especially focusing on arranging various tools to cover the lights to prevent emergencies.

### Letter

I have read the news in your newspaper on the 23rd about Wu Wenkui and others beating up market police officers, which involves our organization and is inconsistent with the facts. The market and the organization are originally one family, and there is no reason for the organization's personnel to beat up market police officers. Moreover, after searching our organization's membership roster, there are no such persons as Wu Wenkui and Xu Miaogen, which is obviously a false rumor. I am specially writing to request a correction, and I hope that the reasons will be published. Sincerely, Shanghai Special City Central Market Local Fruit Distribution Association, June 23rd.

### The Jiuxun Cup Mini Football Tournament: Xuhui Wins the Championship

In the Jiuxun Cup mini-football league, Xuhui and Guangshi competed for the championship in the final held yesterday afternoon in Xuhui. Xuhui's strength far surpassed that of Guangshi, and in a one-sided match, they defeated Guangshi by a score of six to one. The one goal conceded by Xuhui was due to a momentary lapse of attention by the goalkeeper, who inadvertently directed the ball into his own net. With a score of three to one in the first half, Xuhui ultimately secured the championship. Guangshi, with a record of seven wins, one draw, and one loss, will continue to battle with Zhongfa to determine the runner-up, with the match scheduled for 5:00 PM this Friday.

Yesterday's publication time for this newspaper was 7:00 PM.

### The Shen Bao's Scholarship Program Advances Rapidly; Fulfills Society's Expectations; Various Schools Report Outstanding Academic Performance of Scholarship Recipients; This Year, Earnest Appeals are Made to All Sectors for Donations and Encouragement

Since the launch of the fifth Shen Bao Scholarship Fund, it has received multifaceted assistance from all sectors, making gradual progress. Regarding the application regulations, in addition to distributing the scholarship regulations from July 1st, all procedures will be announced in this newspaper from time to time, and students are advised to pay attention.

The Urgency of This Year's Scholarship Situation

In past years, the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund, under the guidance of committee members Chen Qingshi, Shen Siliang, Lu Gaoyi, Nie Lingyu, and Zhao Zongyu, has handled the procedures for qualification review and examinations. Thanks to the support of society, it has fortunately not fallen short. At the beginning of this year's program, it coincided with the busy graduation and entrance examinations of various schools during the summer vacation. Therefore, the committee plans to hold the examinations at a set time when the committee members' school affairs are slightly more settled. Given the large number of students awaiting assistance this year and the urgent need, and the current insufficient funds for distribution, we earnestly request continued donations from all sectors so that impoverished children do not suffer the pain of dropping out of school, and outstanding students have the opportunity for achievement. All matters related to the investigation and examination for this year will be announced after the committee decides on a plan.

Academic Performance of Students is Still Gratifying

What is gratifying to those who have donated in the past is that among this year's graduates from major primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions, according to reports from the schools of the scholarship recipients, 70% of those with outstanding academic performance are impoverished children. Thirty to forty percent were able to complete their phase of study because of the scholarship money allocated by this newspaper. In this regard, (1) for the university graduates receiving scholarships this year, we respectfully request society to provide suitable employment opportunities. The students can immediately write a brief resume stating their expertise and send it for contact. (2) For the primary and secondary school graduates receiving scholarships this year, this newspaper will prioritize assisting them in continuing their education and allocating scholarship money to promote their development.

Impressions of Encouragement from Various Industries are Profound

Over the past four sessions, supporters of the Shen Bao scholarship program have come from all walks of life. Leaders from various sectors, pioneers in industry and commerce, and even apprentices, workers, vendors, and housewives have generously donated, either contributing large sums of money, or transferring funds intended for birthday, wedding, or baby full-moon celebrations, or offering profits, or selling calligraphy and paintings or antique seals, or saving fruit or piggy bank savings, or personally sending fox fur coats and valuable items to the newspaper. Such supreme virtue, for the various sectors, stems from their peace of mind, and for the scholarship recipients, the impressions they receive are even more profound. The diligent study of outstanding students and the inspiration and encouragement from the charitable actions of various sectors may even surpass the supervision of fathers and elder brothers. Compared to the wandering and wasteful habits of wealthy children, where fathers and elder brothers are ignorant of both gentle persuasion and strict discipline, the effects are vastly different.

### This Newspaper's Response to Three Matters

Yesterday, we received letters from many students seeking assistance, requesting that this newspaper (1) consider the difficulties of the times and liberally approve applications for assistance from students; (2) provide assistance to students applying to universities earlier so they can register and reserve seats, and urging the newspaper to use slogans to highlight and promote the scholarship fund. This newspaper hereby responds as follows: (1) Regarding the point of liberal approval, the boundaries of poverty and their character must be strictly observed. Those with excellent grades in the past who have temporarily had lower grades due to accidents this year, those whose families are extremely poor, those whose parents have passed away or are unable to provide support, and those who the school authorities believe are truly worth developing will naturally be liberally approved for tuition and fees. (2) This newspaper also sympathizes with university students registering and reserving seats. After all, late payment and backward seating clearly imply that the wealthy are ahead and the impoverished are behind. Such a lineup inflicts considerable pain on pure and youthful spirits. Often, students in the front seats, who supposedly have superior grades, are more likely to be inattentive in class, while those who are diligently studying are placed in the back seats, facing considerable obstruction. According to the current registration procedures of various schools, this newspaper will do its best to allocate scholarship money earlier. However, we also hope that schools implementing this registration method will find ways to improve this shortcoming and not use payment priority as the standard. This newspaper also hopes that wealthy children who are talented and worth developing can still be seated in the front row. The adjustment of this matter is up to the schools to consider reasonably. As for calling for prominent donations, students are deeply concerned that there will not be enough to go around, making widespread assistance difficult. This newspaper firmly believes that readers' concern for scholarship fund wording, one word or one sentence, can represent the students' drops of blood and tears. Even the editorials and narratives of this newspaper have repeatedly called for prominent donations. We will continue to do so in the future. Fortunately, the reputation of this newspaper has always been trusted by all sectors, and the students' desire to study will ultimately be fulfilled. After all, the expansion of the total amount of the scholarship fund that this newspaper is expecting, and the conscience-driven supervision, are more extensive and fervent than the personal hopes of the students.

### Tingyun Pavilion

— Grand Situation of the Charity Sale

The Painting and Fan Charity Exhibition hosted by Tingyun Pavilion, from the 22nd to the 24th, was held at the Daxin Painting Gallery on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company for three days. After the opening, because the calligraphy and paintings displayed were all exquisite, many people selected and purchased them. In just two short hours the day before, more than 100,000 yuan had already been sold. In the afternoon, the number of visitors was particularly crowded. The Lun Society and Zhengyi Society each brought 40,000 yuan to place orders. Chen, the president of this newspaper, also placed orders for multiple items to show his support. In total, more than 200,000 yuan was sold on the first day. Yesterday was even more enthusiastic, showing the vigorous enthusiasm of people from all walks of life for assisting education, and the urgent expectation of impoverished outstanding children to study, so that they can serve the country and society in the future, avoiding the regret of a lack of talent today. Furthermore, exquisite calligraphy and paintings by famous artists that are not easily obtained can now be selected and purchased at will at the exhibition, which is especially convenient for people of refined taste. The exhibitors, such as Tang Yun, Shen Zicheng, Zheng Shiqiao, Zhou Lianxia, Wu Qingxia, Ding Fuzhi, Gao Yehou, and Dong Tianye, are particularly excited and have repainted several pages to replenish the sold-out inventory, so that later visitors will not be disappointed. The exhibition period is only today, and we still hope that readers of this newspaper will actively visit and purchase, so that the "education assistance movement" can ultimately succeed.

### King Kong Company

— Righteous Act

Yesterday, we received a letter from King Kong Company saying: "Our company upholds the purpose of serving society and has decided to hold a charity sale for three days starting on the 23rd, and for three days starting on July 1st. We will not deduct cost expenses and will donate 10% of the total sales to the Shen Bao News Scholarship Fund. We believe that our company's actions are just a beginning, intended to inspire others and encourage various industries to follow suit." The actions of this company are a model for local businesses to assist education, and this newspaper expresses its deep admiration. Many companies are discerning and farsighted, and if they follow suit, the students who benefit will be numerous.

Enthusiastic Donation

The Shanghai Dairy Factory uses advanced equipment to produce Anjianer and Golden Lion brand national full-fat milk powder, which has long enjoyed a reputation. The factory's general managers, Zhu Haichu, Gao Mengfei, and Yu Bairong, have always supported charity causes. In addition to recently donating 4,000 yuan to the North China Emergency Relief Fund, which was transferred by this newspaper, they have now generously donated 2,000 yuan to the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund, tirelessly doing good deeds. We extend our sincere thanks.

Scholarships Received Yesterday

The list of scholarships received by this newspaper yesterday is as follows: Shanghai Dairy Factory, 2,000 yuan; Liu Dingxian (birthday celebration for mother, congratulations from friends and relatives), 500 yuan; Mrs. Li (sent by Pu Qiting), 250 yuan; Li Guipin, 200 yuan; Dahua and Rong Zhuhe, 50 yuan each; Zhang Qianfang, 25 yuan; Li Pinzhi and Li Yunchen (in memory of deceased brother), 20 yuan. Total received: paper money, 3,095 yuan. Remaining balance: 461,286.59 yuan.

Economic Circles - Course Discussion

### New Subject of Food Policy

Regarding the collection of major food staples such as rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains in Central China, the new institutions are gradually being perfected, and it is expected that efficiency will be seen soon. The food problem itself is extremely complex, with new difficulties arising at any time. We now point out the actual problems, which may provide a reference for the authorities' policy implementation.

The first thing we must pay attention to is that the current food prices are rising daily. Not to mention the price of rice, even wheat, beans, and other categories are extremely expensive. Although there are many reasons, the influx of funds into cities and their rampant activities is indeed one of the main factors, which cannot be ignored.

Secondly, due to the large influx of funds into cities, general small banks and money shops have the idea of establishing new institutions for purchasing agricultural products as incentives. For example, in Jiaxing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places, there are no lack of such income-buying agencies. The purchase targets are mostly food and local products, which are easily monopolized by speculators. It is not an alarmist theory. How to limit this and establish a complete new purchase mechanism is a necessary matter.

Thirdly, food collection is also an important material issue, and we should seek to streamline the exchange between urban and rural areas. That is, agricultural products should be provided as raw materials for industrial products, and industrial products should be used to meet the needs of rural areas. Using each other is the most effective method. If we only focus on passive restrictions, the effect will certainly not be great.

The above are all important issues in food policy, which cannot be taken lightly. The wheat unified purchase plan recently decided by the Commercial Control Commission has perfect content. For example, the regulations on the registration of the purchase quantity of the same industry and the prohibition of resale by the same industry are all good methods and have a lot of reference value. In the future, the realization of material exchange and financial strengthening will definitely improve the general food problem. It is hoped that the parties involved in the Commercial Control Commission Joint Association and food policy will make further active efforts. (Excerpt from the Continental News on June 21)

### Central Bank of China Devises Measures for Clearing Exchange Bank Notes for Chinese Banks

In order to strengthen financial control, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank of China took over the handling of interbank deposits of the Exchange Bank and the transfer of the exchange difference of cash notes between member banks by the Note Exchange Center of the Shanghai Banking Association from the 1st of this month. Detailed procedures have now been developed for handling the clearing affairs of the Exchange Bank for Chinese Banks and collecting notes on behalf of others, and the measures have been sent to each Exchange Bank for reference. The detailed procedures are recorded as follows:

Detailed Procedures for the Central Reserve Bank to Handle the Clearing Affairs of the Exchange Bank for Chinese Banks and Collect Notes on Behalf of Others

A. Opening of "Exchange Clearing Account":

(1) Each Exchange Bank must open an "Exchange Clearing Account" in this Bank from June 1st, and this Bank will issue remittance books, allocation orders, and co-deposit checks. One remittance book is specially used by each Exchange Bank to deposit funds into the "Exchange Clearing Account". Two allocation orders are specially used by each Exchange Bank to pay funds from the "Exchange Clearing Account". Three co-deposit checks are specially used by each Exchange Bank to cancel allocation orders and return the amount of returned notes.

(2) The notes issued by each Exchange Bank from June 1st do not need to be distinguished between cash and remittances for unification.

(3) The interest rate for the "Exchange Clearing Account" opened by each Exchange Bank is calculated at 2% per annum.

B. Collection

(1) Each Exchange Bank should handle various notes received daily separately as follows:

A. Allocation orders of the Exchange Bank and this Bank's notes should be directly deposited into this Bank and credited to the "Exchange Clearing Account" of each bank. They can be collected before 5:00 PM every day and before 12:00 noon on Saturdays. If there are special circumstances that prevent the processing within the prescribed time, temporary consultations can be made to handle it. During the exchange time, they can also be brought to the Exchange for exchange.

B. Allocation orders of the proxy Exchange Bank, in addition to still being brought to the Exchange for exchange with the Banking Association, can also be directly deposited into this Bank during the exchange time and transferred to the Banking Association on behalf of the bank. Notes of the Exchange Bank (except for allocation orders) should be presented for exchange at the Exchange and cannot be directly deposited into this Bank. Notes of the proxy Exchange Bank and the correspondent bank should be sent to the Banking Association for entrusted collection. The Banking Association will issue a temporary receipt, which should be sent to this Bank at the end of each business day to exchange for a formal receipt, and the amount listed on the receipt will be credited to the "Exchange Clearing Account" of each bank. If it cannot be processed on the same day due to time constraints, it must be completed before 11:00 AM the next morning and credited to the next day's accounts, with interest still starting from the current day. If it is overdue, it will be processed together with the funds received the next day, with interest starting from the next day. However, these notes can also be entrusted to this Bank for collection before 12:00 noon every day and directly deposited into the "Exchange Clearing Account" of each bank.

(3) Notes of member money shops, in addition to being entrusted to the Banking Association for collection as before, can also be directly deposited into the "Exchange Clearing Account" of each bank before 12:00 noon every day and collected by this Bank. (To be continued)

### Commercial Control Commission Seeks Information on the Production and Sales of Various Industries

### Strict Management of Cotton Yarn; Commercial Registration to be Completed by the End of the Month

The Yarn Industry Association was ordered to handle the registration of members within a time limit in order to manage and control them. Many businesses went to register enthusiastically, but many also did not understand the registration procedures. Now, the Bureau of Economic Affairs has set a deadline for registration by the end of the month. The Association yesterday re-announced to its members to quickly complete the registration. The current registration form has been slightly changed from the previous one. Members who have already filled it out should re-fill it out, and members who have not yet filled it out should do so quickly. If members are not familiar with the registration situation, they can go to the Association to inquire about the registration rules. The Association also remembers the registration fee and public fee as follows: (1) Registration fee is 2 yuan per 10,000 yuan of capital, and the form fee is 12 yuan (regardless of capital size). (2) There are four types of public fees: 1. 200 yuan for capital under or equal to 100,000 yuan, 2. 500 yuan for capital over 100,000 yuan and under 400,000 yuan, 3. 1,000 yuan for capital over 400,000 yuan and under 1 million yuan, 4. 1,500 yuan for capital of 1 million yuan or more.

### Hua Stock Trends

Yesterday, Hua stocks rose sharply and many have innovated prices. People from all sides are tight with confidence, because the rise in gold prices and other rewards is the main factor. The relationship in the national yarn market has made the buying style of the textile industry especially exuberant, and Yong'an Textile, Dasheng first, third and second factories, and Rongfeng have all advanced to the peak. The buying style of Xinnuo Yarn Factory has calmed down, and Guoxin Weaving's debut has risen by 50% of the face value. Da Zhonghua Weaving suddenly favored by buyers, and Xinfeng and Guoguang Printing and Dyeing are all in short supply. In the department store industry, Yong'an has risen quite a bit, and Xinxin, Guohuo, underwear and Jingfu shirts and socks have all seen rises, while Jinglun is alone. In the cultural industry, Zhonghua has crossed another major barrier, and Commerce and World followed suit, and the increase is difficult to predict. The buying style of the new pharmaceutical industry has also risen, and Zhongfa and Xinya have made progress, and Wuzhou and Zhongxi have also risen. In addition, Da Zhonghua Matches and Nanyang Tobacco Company. Zhabei Underwater Thunder and Huashang Electric are all expensive. The buying interest in Kangyuan Canned Food is growing day by day, and Jiu'an Industrial is also approaching a major pass.

### Brief News

The Metal Industry Association, which was organized under the order of the Ministry, has been prepared, and convened an establishment conference at 50 Hong Kong Road, Shanghai at 2:00 pm yesterday (23rd). Ninety-six representatives attended, and Commercial Control Commission representative Yu Qixi, Ministry of Industry representative Sun Zuji and others attended and guided the discussions, elected directors and supervisors, including Chairman Zhou Zhongqing, Standing Director Zhang Lianfang, Zhang Haoru and other twenty-one people, and Zheng Liang'e and other eleven supervisors.

The Shanghai West District Office (Jing'an Temple Road Difeng Road) of the Central Reserve Bank opened on June 24, 31st year of the Republic of China. For the past year, business has been very prosperous, and the bank has made considerable efforts to adjust the finances of peers and factories, promote the recovery of production, and have achieved remarkable results. The bank will convene all its staff today to hold a one-week commemorative ceremony. It is heard that Vice-President Qian and others will personally attend to instruct and encourage.

Guohua Real Estate Company, with a capital of 5 million yuan, recently held an founding meeting and elected Bao Linting as chairman, Li Bohan and others as standing directors, Xu Guanqun and others as directors, Zhang Xinchu as supervisor, and hired Xu Changzhi as general manager, Jingqiu Wei Shaoting as deputy manager, and Zhao Peikun and Xu Yuan as funeral managers, and started business immediately.

Since the Shanghai Dim Sum Restaurant Industry Association was ordered to prepare for the organization, it has been actively handling the registration of peers to join the association. Peers have enthusiastically gone to register and join the association. However, some peers do not understand the real situation, and some have applied to the wine and vegetable restaurant industry, which is a mistake. The Association has notified its peers to correct this to avoid mistakenly joining the association and losing their due rights. On the one hand, it has requested the competent authorities to order the wine and vegetable industry association not to indiscriminately accept members of other industries. It is also heard that the Association has scheduled to hold its founding conference at Yuqia Road tomorrow (25th). (To be continued)

### Commercial Control Commission and Sino-Japanese Economic Relations (2)

— Kurimoto Tora

Since the establishment of the Commercial Control Commission, Chinese and Japanese people may not yet be ready to actively assist in the business of the Commercial Control Commission explained above, because people have different views, so their thoughts are different. Some Japanese people believe that after the birth of the Commercial Control Commission, all the businesses of our Japanese expatriates in China will have to retreat, with this kind of fear in mind. Therefore, there is a so-called pre-thinking of ways to study competition methods and other adversarial ideas, which is really a strange thing that makes people feel inexplicable.

The Chinese also thought that taking advantage of the opportunity of the establishment of the Commercial Control Commission, they wanted to take all the legitimate economic relations businesses of the Japanese people with a mentality of recovering national rights - for the sake of their own interests - and actually wanted to seize the legitimate economic relations businesses of the Japanese from the hands of the Japanese. There are many people in the business world who hold this confrontational attitude. Both of these mentalities are unpleasant. In the former case, the prejudice of the Japanese is easy to correct as long as they recognize the situation, but in the latter case, that is, in the case of the Chinese, mentioning this is considered rude by the enlightened people of China. - However, this kind of consciousness is probably derived from the Chinese national character. We put forward this point in the hope that the Chinese authorities will pay attention to handling it well. Thinking of Director-General Tang's strict teachings, it can be considered that the Chinese side has understood this point. This point is willing to be cautious in doing things. If there is any error, it is tantamount to giving the future of the Commercial Control Commission an obstacle, involving the root of future troubles, which is even more unthinkable. I hope that this statement will become a worry, then both sides will be very fortunate.

Film Industry

### I Act in "Song of Rejuvenation"

— Hu Feng

"Song of Rejuvenation" is being produced very smoothly and is now two-thirds completed.

This is a tragedy, with the affairs of the art world as the theme, so it was once titled "Tears of Blood in the Art World", and later changed to "Song of Rejuvenation".

This is a story about a tortuous and moving love triangle between three men and women in the arts. The role I play is one of the corners of this triangle. The structure of the script "I think is a more satisfactory one in the current film themes, because most love dramas are very vulgar. However, the narration of "Song of Rejuvenation" about a love triangle seems extraordinary. One point worth mentioning is that the love between the two men and one woman in "Song of Rejuvenation" is built on their careers. This point is indeed the most commendable.

I think the script of "Song of Rejuvenation" is very good, and director Liu Qiong is so hardworking and dedicated, "Song of Rejuvenation" may still be worth watching.

### Review of "Beauty's Iron Blood"

— Lu Guang

"Beauty's Iron Blood" is a film directed by Zhang Shichuan, starring Zhou Manhua and Huang He. The plot narrates the facts of warlords and politicians bullying women in the warlord era. There are righteous young people, witty detectives, tense plots, and terrifying scenes. In the end, the warlord's evil deeds are full, the blood case is solved, the truth is revealed, and a satisfying ending is completed. The whole film always grabs the tense emotions of the audience. It is a film that caters to the general audience.

Director Zhang Shichuan's film, detailed introduction of the story's process, is his specialty. "Beauty's Iron Blood" maintains his style, clearly telling the audience the story in tight sub-scenes. In the two-hour screening, the audience can know this tortuous and bizarre story.

The sentence "The willows are dark and the flowers are bright, another village" can be used in "Beauty's Iron Blood". Screenwriter Jin Jian wrote the story step by step and section by section. When detective Ni Baochang scolded Qiao Liangcai, he must have thought that the plot had come to an end, but "the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, another village" until he went to find Xi Luju took a sharp turn, but the figure was nowhere to be seen, unfolding another tortuous story. This amazing stroke is the biggest harvest point of "Beauty's Iron Blood".

Zhou Manhua's Xi Luju is limited by the plot and has few opportunities to act, but in the scenes she performs, her acting skills have the weight to control the personality of the characters in the play. The angry resistance when forced to be unyielding has a deep portrayal. Finally, after the case is clear, she scolds Qiao Liangcai loudly. Her words and expressions express her eagerness. It is her most successful performance in the whole play.

Huang He's Xi Yifang is completely in the state of a knight, and the spirit of justice is active in his excellent acting skills. The opening fighting scene is extremely heroic! Yong Qi, who plays the director, perfectly portrays the personality of a public official. Xu Xinyuan, who plays Qiao Liangcai, fully exposes the typical warlord. Ou Hui, who plays Ni Baochang, and Xu Wu, who plays Feng Shouchang, have excellent acting skills.

### Movie News Snippets

The dance sequences for "Wan Zi Qian Hong" (Ten Thousand Purples and a Thousand Reds) were completed in the middle of this month. The part specifically for the movie will likely meet the audience around the beginning of next month. Dongbao actors are busy attending farewell banquets from various parties. It is said that after collaborating on a drama about the disaster in North China, they will travel eastward across the ocean. Afterward, those in the country who wish to see her vibrant dances will only be able to glimpse her stunning and graceful movements in "Wan Zi Qian Hong"!

During the plum rain season, the weather is unpredictable, causing delays in the location shooting for "Fisher Girl" in Suzhou and Wuxi. Bu Wancang, under orders from the production department, has instructed the First Studio to complete all indoor scenes before resuming outdoor shooting.

Yue Feng's "Dang Ren Hun" (Soul of the Party Member) requires a grand scale, with elaborate costumes, sets, and props, necessitating considerable research time. Currently, during this downtime, "Tian Luo Di Wang" (Heaven and Earth Net) is being filmed, starring Gao Zhanfei, Mei Yun, and Yu. The film depicts the conflicts between law and human sentiment, set against the backdrop of the North China drought, aiming to awaken the nation's awareness of the severity of the disaster in North China.

Yin's new work, "Qian Liang Ai Hong" (A Thousand Distressed Geese), starring Yan Jun, Wang Yuanlong, and Bai Guang, is currently in the script stage. It is planned to be filmed in northern Jiangsu, using the levee project as its backdrop. The film depicts the catastrophic danger of a levee collapsing and destroying fishing villages. Engineers are currently being hired to design the scenes, and preparations for filming are actively underway.

Fang Peilin, a native of Qingbo, often makes a lot of noise when directing work on the film set. One day, during the sound recording of You Fu's song for "Wan Zi Qian Hong," Li Lihua suddenly said to everyone, "We're officially recording now, Ah Fang-ge, please don't make so much noise." At that moment, Fang Peilin was not making any noise, sitting obediently behind Li Lihua.

Han Langen took many photos of the Dongbao actors at the First Studio, one after another, tirelessly. Wang Yin criticized his photographic art as being like a monkey, acting as if it were a serious matter.

Yada Shigeru, the dance coach of the Dongbao Troupe, most admired Li Lihua's genius acting. On the evening of the 12th, while filming a stage scene at the Lyceum Theatre, he actually knelt down at Li Lihua's feet during her dance. At that moment, Li Lihua was startled, thinking he was proposing marriage in public.

### Gao Lihen Joins Huaying

Gao Lihen, a famous director from Hong Kong who came to Shanghai, has officially joined Huaying and begun directing work. His first new film is "Xinsheng" (New Life), starring Huang He and Wang Danfeng. Filming has started at the No. 4 Studio in the Xujiahui Triangle Street area.

### "Huichun Qu" Director Completes Work

Someone once criticized: Liu Qiong's current position is the same as Jin Yan's before the war. This statement is very pertinent.

Now he is a director. He directed the film "Huichun Qu" (Song of Returning Spring) under the circumstances of writing, directing, and acting himself. He worked diligently for more than two months. He carefully handled every scene, every shot, and every character.

Although the entire crew worked for five or six consecutive nights during the filming process, no one complained. Instead of feeling tired, their spirits were even more invigorated.

"Huichun Qu" has been completely filmed under these working conditions. What remains are just a few scattered reshoots.

### From Manchuria to Shanghai (3)

— Hashimoto Kanrin

Retrieving National Treasures

This happened as early as twenty years ago. When I was traveling in Paris, the French government wanted to ask the British government to return Rodin's bronze statue of the Burghers of Calais, which had been sent to the City of London during his lifetime, to Paris. I don't know what happened to that matter, but it seemed to be unresolved until I returned home.

This is a problem between London and Paris, which are only separated by a strait. It shows how deeply a country cares about its own art. At that time, it was unimaginable for the Japanese, who were far removed from art countries. Recently, Germany returned the Emperor Jun'e's imperial portrait, which, although not solely an artistic issue, is still a pleasant thing.

One day, I discussed such matters with a Chinese person I knew well in a Chinese restaurant through writing. I believed that although it had not yet been seen in the United States, the treasures of Gaochang, Turpan, and other places in the United Kingdom, France, and other countries should be returned to Asia. I even wrote an article on this matter in a journal published among overseas Chinese in Japan. At that time, I heard that when the famous stone carvings of the Eight Horses of Zhaoling—the burial place of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty—were to be taken to the United States, some Chinese people were surprised and expressed their opposition. Although they were returned immediately afterward, how long they were taken and how many were taken are all legends. The things from Turpan and Dunhuang, needless to say, were taken disrespectfully without permission.

According to a certain antique dealer who runs a shop in Beijing, the stone statues scattered in Longmen or Tianmen were probably taken by the Chinese army. The people who bought them were very grandiose, saying it was for the military's provisions, and the military, in gratitude, sent soldiers to escort them to a safe location. Most of these were troops from the Communist Party system or warlords like Feng Yuxiang. Therefore, many things were loaded onto ships and taken abroad.

Before I went to Europe, I dared not speculate about the export of Japanese ancient art to foreign countries because my knowledge was limited. I wrote about such things in my travelogue and said: "The art of a country must be savored and appreciated in the environment where that art was produced. Art is inseparable from its land. Seeing Japanese art overseas is as desolate as a prostitute." The Ferscht collection in Germany's Cologne Museum is mainly composed of Japanese Buddhist statues. At that time, I, who was deeply interested in Buddhist statues, made a special trip to Cologne to admire them. I had heard of the Ferscht collection in Japan, which was quite famous, but because it was collected by foreigners, what I saw could only be a part of it.

The Chinese people have not mentioned "returning Asian things to Asia" since then. Not long before the Incident, that kind of movement seemed to have risen once. I also received promotional books from China. The Japanese authorities also often stated that Japan had no territorial ambitions. I think we should cooperate with China to urge the government to use the power of the people to recover many ancient art objects taken to the United Kingdom and the United States. This is not only my personal wish.

A few days before I was about to return home from Shanghai, a certain lieutenant colonel invited me to tea. When I went downstairs from the Cathay Hotel, what I saw was the scene of the sinking of the British warship HMS Prince of Wales at 5:20 AM on December 8th. Listening to the lieutenant colonel's description and recalling the scene, I couldn't help but feel my blood boiling. One cannot know where all the subjects of painting exist beforehand. Even in the same place, depending on one's perspective, the scenery can change. For example, in one's own garden, because a tree has been removed, the appearance looks completely different. The next day, I obtained permission and wrote a rough sketch. The first thing I saw, to the right of the place closest to the balcony where the HMS Prince of Wales sank, was a building with a large clock on the roof. The surrounding area was still blurry at 5 AM each day. I immediately thought that the hands of the large clock should be clearly remembered, as it was exactly 5:20 AM.

### First Special District Prosecutor's Office: Public Notice for Unclaimed Male and Female Corpses

(Letter Received) To Whom It May Concern: Dying away from home, without family knowing, the dead buried in mass graves, the living relying on inquiries and looking forward in vain—this is the most tragic event in the world. The Shanghai Municipal Police Department reports many cases of deaths every day. If there is an ID card, the family can still be investigated. All those whose names are unknown are collectively referred to as "unnamed male" and "unnamed female." Those with belongings are stored in the hospital and posted for public notice for a period of six months, but there is ultimately no way to reach the ears of the deceased's family. It is now planned to send the more important cases of inspection and public notice to your newspaper for publication, so that the relatives and friends of the deceased can know the news as soon as possible, which is beneficial for both the living and the dead. Sincerely, the First Special District Prosecutor's Office.

(1) Tang Deng Qianwen, on August 20 of last year, followed her husband, Mr. Tang, a native of Hangzhou, to stay at the Continental Hotel. She committed suicide by poisoning the next night. Her husband has not returned. The police reported the death as an unnamed female. After investigation, her name was found. She left behind books, clothing, and a diploma from Guanghua University. The deceased appears to be someone from academic circles. She must have relatives and friends in Shanghai and Hangzhou.

(2) Unnamed male child, about 14 years old, resembling a student, was found dead on April 19 of this year outside Anyi Village on Alabast Road. He was wearing a long dark robe, grey trousers, brown socks, cotton shoes, and a woolen hat. He was sent for inspection on the 21st. The corpse was mutilated. He left behind a bundle of rubber bands and a child's hat, which are stored in the warehouse for public notice.

(3) Unnamed female, about 40 years old, fell ill and was lying on the sidewalk near Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road on the afternoon of May 17 of this year. She was sent to the hospital and died. Her name and address are unknown. She left behind stored value certificates worth 124 yuan, 6.1 Japanese cents, a rice purchase certificate No. 396 from the Rice Store, and certificates for miscellaneous grains, flour, oil, and sugar, which are stored in the warehouse for public notice.

### Recent Situation of the Disaster in Chao-Shan

— Xiao Kangshi

Here is another report from my friend Mr. Lin Wenyi on the recent situation of the disaster in Chao-Shan, recorded below: (1) In Heping Township, Chao-Yang, there is a Biao River that flows into the sea, half a li wide. The river flows faster than the Huangyong River. Dozens of disaster victims from neighboring townships who are hungry and desperate come here to commit suicide by jumping into the river every day. (2) As the weather gets hotter, countless people die of heatstroke due to hunger. They are all buried with straw mats, and the charity halls are also helpless. (3) Some families cannot bear the hunger and commit suicide by poisoning. (4) More than 1,000 children abandoned by passing refugees in Yiying Township, Chaoyang, are left without relief. Dozens of them must starve to death every day. (5) Food prices are skyrocketing. The poorest people fill their stomachs with tree bark and grass roots. One jin of yam medicine costs about three yuan.
