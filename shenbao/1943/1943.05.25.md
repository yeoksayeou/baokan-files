### A Request to Local Authorities of Allied Nations

Yesterday, it was reported that a case of extorting money under the guise of the Japanese Military Police occurred in this city. Fortunately, the Military Police authorities detected it beforehand, and the perpetrators were arrested on the spot and transferred to the Military Tribunal for trial. The Japanese Military Police also stated that to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, anyone who uses the name of the military or the Military Police to commit wrongdoing, regardless of nationality, will be severely punished. It has been found that the perpetrators in this case were only three people: a fishmonger, a shop clerk, and an employee of the Tax Bureau, yet the target of the extortion reached a staggering one million yuan. It is truly worthy of close attention that two merchants and a minor police officer dared to commit such acts of wrongdoing. Based on common sense, the details of this case are definitely not that simple. Moreover, it was reported on the 2nd of this month that unscrupulous individuals in Shanghai often falsely claim to be undercover agents of the Japanese military or the Military Police, and extort money from innocent citizens. The Japanese Military Police authorities issued a statement in response, with the following key points:

(1) From the beginning of this year to the end of April, a total of twenty-seven cases of extortion under false pretenses were uncovered, involving thirty-six criminals, including twenty-three Chinese, thirteen Japanese, and other nationalities. Twelve cases have resulted in sentencing, five cases have been dealt with summarily, and three cases have involved perpetrators fleeing the country. Other cases are still under careful investigation.

(2) Military personnel and Military Police officers always carry identification cards and service record books when performing their duties. Not only do they not demand money or goods, they absolutely avoid any words or actions that resemble coercion.

(3) These unscrupulous individuals, who tarnish the reputation of the Japanese military, should be severely punished without any leniency. Citizens who suspect that someone is fabricating the name of the Military Police or undercover agents and engaging in illegal activities should immediately report it to the nearest Military Police station for arrest.

(4) It is hoped that Chinese and Japanese citizens will be vigilant and cooperate with the authorities to crack down on these activities, in order to achieve the goal of building a bright and clear Greater Shanghai.

Analyzing the above two records, the statement issued by the Japanese Military Police authorities on the 2nd of this month was undoubtedly a serious warning to these unscrupulous individuals. And yesterday, another case of impersonation occurred, only three weeks later. It is truly detestable that these unscrupulous individuals have relapsed into their old habits, and severe punishment is not enough. However, this is a case that has already been solved. Perhaps there are other similar cases that have not been solved. Although the authorities hope that the citizens involved will report the truth, many citizens, ignorant of the situation, choose to remain silent due to a "fear of trouble." This is certainly a "shortcoming" of the citizens. However, the consequence of this "shortcoming" is not only that citizens silently endure being defrauded, but it also encourages these unscrupulous individuals to commit wrongdoing and obstructs the Military Police authorities' crackdown. Therefore, the "shortcoming" of citizens who are defrauded but remain silent out of fear of trouble is not only not understood by the authorities, but it is certainly resented by the authorities. Because it is enough to prevent the authorities from vigorously carrying out the crackdown.

Based on the above analysis, we believe that to achieve vigilance among citizens, cooperation with the authorities, and a thorough crackdown on such cases, we must first raise the tide and eliminate the "shortcoming" of citizens' "fear of trouble" in order to achieve practical results. So, how exactly do we eliminate this "shortcoming"? Our humble opinions are as follows:

(1) We request the Military Police authorities to publicly announce the detailed location of each district's station, the area under its jurisdiction, and its office hours. They should also set up a special organization to accept citizens' reports or grievances, and provide trained interpreters so that citizens can report directly when they encounter unexpected threats.

(2) We request the Military Police authorities to further stipulate the identification marks of the enforcement personnel, especially undercover agents, and to show their identification marks before performing their duties, so that citizens can distinguish the real from the fake and prevent unscrupulous individuals from passing off fish eyes as pearls to achieve their extortion.

(3) Citizens should not panic when encountering military or police inquiries. If they believe that they have not engaged in any improper conduct, they can answer frankly. If they suspect the questioner, they should not be afraid of trouble and report the facts to the Military Police Department to which they belong. It must be understood that this is a proper action to assist the authorities in cracking down on unscrupulous individuals.

Furthermore, we are reminded by the above matters that the authority of the Japanese Resident Agencies in Shanghai should also have a clear and unified regulation. We would like to make a supplementary statement, hoping that the relevant authorities will consider and adopt it.

First, for all types of political, economic, security, and social events, the executing power should belong to which agency, should have clear regulations. Except for those that are absolutely confidential, everything should be publicly announced so that citizens will know and obey.

Second, for events of a similar nature, the executing power should belong to one agency. At the same time, a clear announcement should be made so that citizens will know and obey. For example, if economic investigation work or the requisition of houses in social events is stipulated to be carried out by Agency A, then Agency B should no longer have this executing power, so that citizens do not know who to obey.

We said in a short commentary welcoming Ambassador Gu on the 23rd of this month: "At present, the feelings between China and Japan, especially between the Chinese and Japanese people, have already begun to improve. However, we cannot ignore the obstacles that hinder further improvement, which have not been completely eliminated, especially the 'small details' that are easily overlooked...We advocate that 'major policies' and 'minor obstacles' should be adjusted equally. 'Small carelessness delays the big,' this is the most unfortunate thing." We sincerely hope that the authorities of allied nations in Shanghai will pay special attention to the adjustment of "small details" related to the citizens of Shanghai, so as to further enhance mutual feelings. We believe this is also the sincere expectation of people from allied nations. Therefore, we dare to repeat this as our conclusion.

### Special Article: Two Types of Pro-Japanese Factions

— By Yoshida Toyosuke

The other day, I published an article entitled "The Opportunism of the Chinese Intellectual Class." A Chinese reader sent me a letter, vehemently attacking it. He started from the contradictory stance of Japan's handling of the Three Eastern Provinces and the Greater East Asia Doctrine promoted by Japan after the Greater East Asia War, and concluded: "The entire Chinese people, regardless of whether they are intellectuals, hope to bomb Japan with ten thousand airplanes to avenge our people and to destroy Japan." There are quite a few people in China who hold this kind of sentiment towards Japan. Some people say that if we do not forget the ethnic hatred during the war and kill each other, then all the humans in the world would have been wiped out long ago. But losing the blind patriotism that cannot be changed is indeed not dangerous for the evolution of mankind and the development of the national destiny. If, according to the wishes of this Chinese reader, China relies on the assistance of Britain and the United States to destroy Japan, then there will not be a single independent country in Asia that can eliminate the pressure of Anglo-American imperialism in the future. In that case, China may be able to restore its independence and autonomy, but this is the same meaning as the "independent country" that Mexico is now, which is completely independent. We cannot assume that the Chinese national revolution is fighting for such empty "independence and autonomy." People who believe that China can achieve independence and autonomy by destroying Japan should read Sun Yat-sen's words again:

"Today, China wants to seek allied nations, and it cannot seek them except from Japan and the United States. The relationship between Japan and China is really related to survival and security. Without Japan, there would be no China; without China, there would be no Japan. China and Japan, from the racial point of view, are brother countries; China and the United States, from the political point of view, are teacher-student countries. China and Japan should use Asianism to develop the resources west of the Pacific; the United States should use the Monroe Doctrine to unify the forces east of the Pacific."

In the interdependent relationship of the fate of China and Japan, Sun Yat-sen recognized the historical indivisibility of "without Japan, there would be no China; without China, there would be no Japan." He wanted to develop China, so he hoped that Japan would develop; he was worried about the survival and security of China, so he was very concerned about the survival and security of Japan. According to Sun Yat-sen's theory, if Japan perishes, China will also perish; if Japan becomes a second-rate country, China cannot become a country above second-rate. This is really a position of "sharing joys and sorrows."

At the same time, he was as concerned about the tendencies that Japan, which has an inseparable fate with China, did not need, as he was worried about his own country. When Japan was previously poisoned by Anglo-American culture, Sun Yat-sen issued a warning:

"On the one hand, the Japanese nation imports the hegemonic culture of Europe and the United States, and on the other hand, it also has the essence of the royal culture of Asia. In the future, will Japan become a tool of Western hegemony for world culture, or will it become a supporter of Eastern royal culture? This is something that the Japanese people should carefully consider."

Comparing Sun Yat-sen's attitude towards Japan with the attitude of this Chinese reader, and the attitude of the Chongqing European and American faction that attempts to unite with Britain and the United States to destroy Japan, one can see how great the distance is between them.

We call Chinese people like Sun Yat-sen, who are aware of the historical destiny of "coexistence and death" between China and Japan and act based on this awareness, pro-Japanese. In other words, first, pro-Japanese people are based on the premise of being patriots of China. Chinese people who love Japan more than China are like men who love men more than women. It is a perversion, and this mental state is very suspicious. Chinese people who do not love their own country cannot love Japan. Second, pro-Japanese people are based on the premise of recognizing that Japan is a "supporter of the Eastern royal culture." In other words, it is based on the premise of recognizing the greatness of the Japanese nation as the driving force for liberating Asia. Those who ask England and the United States for the driving force to liberate Asia are, needless to say, not pro-Japanese.

The understanding of "new pro-Japanese people" has always been ambiguous, whether on the Japanese side or on the Chongqing side. Have you ever studied in Japan? Can you speak Japanese? Are you married to a Japanese woman? Can you spout pro-Japanese words? In the past, people simply distinguished whether they were pro-Japanese based on these conditions. In the era of rising anti-Japanese movements before the incident, "pro-Japanese people" with these conditions had a slower rise than "Anglo-American factions." But currently, "pro-Japanese people" with these conditions have more opportunities for "making a fortune" like this than "Anglo-American factions." The lack of understanding of the pro-Japanese faction has also created a sad situation in current politics.

Before December 8, in the era when Chongqing vigorously promoted Japanese aggression and most of the people believed it without a doubt, only two types of people could get close to Japan: those who sacrificed their reputation, which was more important than life, and sought a way out for the country; or those who had no reputation to sacrifice from the beginning and wanted to do anything for money. In the so-called "pro-Japanese faction," there was such a mixture of good and bad. To make it easier here, I would like to call the true pro-Japanese faction the first type of pro-Japanese faction, and the latter the second type of pro-Japanese faction.

The second type of pro-Japanese faction has the quality of easily becoming a so-called "traitor" from the beginning. They understand a little Japanese, and then create opportunities to contact Japanese people, thereby forming special relationships, taking advantage of the chaos of the war situation, and doing whatever they want. Some use the name of the official office to arrest people and extort huge sums of money, and some manipulate the gold market and plunder the savings of good people; in short, they do everything illegal, such as threats, extortion, and murder. The people in the peaceful area all look at those so-called "traitors" who have accumulated millions or even billions of fortunes by squeezing the people's fat with hatred. This fact, I don't know how much it has defamed the reputation of the first type of pro-Japanese faction?

Those who flatter and approach Japanese people, cater to their preferences, give gifts, and obtain special privileges that other Chinese people cannot enjoy and fill their own pockets are also the second type of pro-Japanese faction. When some Japanese people see many Chinese people approaching them with a very humble attitude, they say that the slave nature of the average Chinese person is like this and that; but there is no such muddled thing. They only saw the dregs of the Chinese people. Some Japanese people accepted a wrong view of China from these dregs of Chinese people, and then put forward a cheap "theory of solving the incident." This force is absolutely not to be underestimated. One of the reasons why the overall peace has stalled to this day is the influence of this wrong view of the Chinese people.

The second type of pro-Japanese faction is a Jewish-style existence without a national concept. In their eyes, there is neither China nor Japan. There is nothing but their own interests. Therefore, although the ultimate goal of the peace movement is overall peace, they will obstruct the progress of overall peace because it threatens their status. Knowing that hoarding is destroying the people's lives and making the country's finances tend to crisis, they themselves are the first to hoard and want to hinder the crackdown. On the one hand, they clearly know that opium and gambling are evils that are related to the rise and fall of the country, but on the other hand, they secretly attempt to exist.

Shen Bao published an editorial entitled "Clearing the Defeatists in the Peaceful Area," saying that "now the general public in the peaceful area, especially party and government officials, lack firmness in their belief in peace," calling them peace defeatists or vacillators. Zaobao emphasized how their actions affect the general public's belief in the peace movement, and advocated that it is necessary to eliminate them. It should be known that the peace defeatists mentioned here are also clearly a part of the second type of pro-Japanese faction. In order to protect their own reputation, the true pro-Japanese faction must also exclude the pro-Japanese faction that is like a fox pretending to be a tiger from the peace movement.

The first type of pro-Japanese faction is a patriot, and the second type of pro-Japanese faction is a traitor. In practice, these two should be strictly distinguished.

### Imperial General Headquarters Announced Yesterday Afternoon: Naval and Air Combat Results at Attu Island: A Total of Seven U.S. Ships Sunk, Destroyed, and Damaged; Japanese Troops on the Island Also Intercepted U.S. Landing Forces

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 24th: (1) On the 23rd, the Imperial Navy Air Force destroyed an enemy cruiser and sank a destroyer near Attu Island, setting another on fire. We suffered no damage. (2) Since the 12th, the Imperial Navy submarine force has continued its attack operations against enemy ships in the Aleutian area. As of now, it has heavily damaged one enemy battleship and one cruiser, and has injured two other ships of unidentified types.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The announcement by the Imperial General Headquarters on the 24th pointed out that Japanese naval air squadrons and submarine forces had recently achieved great combat results near Attu Island, destroying one enemy cruiser, sinking one destroyer, destroying another, and heavily damaging one enemy battleship, one cruiser, and two unidentified enemy warships. According to military experts here, the U.S. military's attempt to recapture Attu Island, occupied by Japanese forces, and use it as a base for counter-offensive operations against Japan, led to a landing on the island on May 12. Now, it has been more than ten days. The Japanese naval forces quickly dispatched to the northern seas, overcoming the harsh climate in that area, and continued to implement meticulously planned operations to destroy the enemy's powerful naval forces. At the same time, the U.S. landing forces have been intercepted by the Japanese defense forces on Attu Island. In addition, the area around the island is full of landmines, so the enemy has not been able to complete its intended landing. Since the 12th, Japanese submarine forces have continued to attack enemy ships with torpedoes and laid mines on the sea. As of the 24th, they have destroyed one enemy cruiser and lightly damaged two enemy warships of unidentified types. Due to heavy fog in that area, it is difficult to confirm the detailed results. Therefore, the Imperial General Headquarters' announcement that one enemy battleship and one cruiser were destroyed is expected to mean that they have probably sunk. In addition, on the 23rd, Japanese naval air squadrons responded to the land forces and launched a long-range attack, braving the harsh weather of the northern seas and the enemy's intense anti-aircraft fire, bombing enemy ships. They destroyed one enemy cruiser, sank one destroyer, and destroyed another. These enemy ships had all been protecting the enemy's landing on Attu Island and had attempted to use it as a base for attacking northern Japan. Therefore, it is expected that the enemy has suffered heavy losses of personnel, weapons, ammunition, fuel, and food due to this blow. The Japanese Navy's pre-emptive strike before the enemy launched its counter-offensive and the achievement of this great combat result is of great significance.

### Japanese Air Force Attacked Chittagong, Destroying 34 Enemy Aircraft

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 11:30 AM on the 24th: On the 22nd, the Imperial Army Air Force launched a surprise attack on the Chittagong airfield, destroying almost all of the enemy aircraft concentrated there. The results are as follows: (1) 19 enemy aircraft were shot down in aerial combat. (2) 15 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. We lost one aircraft.

Rangoon, 24th (Central News Agency) – On the 21st and 22nd, the Japanese Army Air Force launched surprise attacks on the British Air Force bases in Cox's Bazar and Chittagong in the Bay of Bengal, shooting down and destroying 38 enemy aircraft. The details are as follows: (1) On the 21st, a fighter squadron braved harsh weather and raided the Cox's Bazar airfield, engaging with a dozen enemy aircraft, shooting down two of them, and also shooting down one Blenheim-type aircraft. On the way back, they encountered nine enemy aircraft, shooting down one of them. One Japanese aircraft was self-detonated. (2) On the 22nd, a joint formation of fighter-bombers launched a surprise attack on the Chittagong airfield, hitting two large aircraft and two medium aircraft on the ground, and destroying one large aircraft, three medium aircraft, and eight small aircraft on the ground. At the same time, when a Japanese bomber squadron used dense clouds to advance to the airspace above the Chittagong airfield, the enemy aircraft in the airspace above the airfield yesterday numbered more than 30, but they did not discover the Japanese aircraft attack. When the Japanese bomber squadron completed its mission and wanted to return to its base, it was discovered by the enemy aircraft, which attempted to pursue, but was blocked by dense clouds, becoming an easy target for the Japanese fighter squadron. The Japanese aircraft shot down 19 enemy aircraft. One Japanese aircraft was self-detonated.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – On the 22nd, the Japanese Army Air Force in Burma, at 9:40 AM, launched a joint formation of fighters and bombers to surprise attack Chittagong airfield, an important enemy military base in eastern India, bombarding enemy aircraft on the ground, shooting down and destroying 34 enemy aircraft. Almost all enemy aircraft were destroyed. That day marked the first anniversary of the heroic death of Lieutenant General Kato Tateo in the Bay of Bengal. The Japanese Army Air Force cooperated with the land forces in Arakan, achieving brilliant aerial combat results. According to the Imperial General Headquarters' announcement on the 14th, the Arakan operation concluded with the Japanese army occupying the enemy's important stronghold of Maungdaw, and the enemy's attempt to recapture Burma had completely failed. The enemy abandoned 6,414 bodies, and 574 prisoners were taken. The aerial combat results in this operation were particularly impressive, with a total of 552 enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed. Recently, the Japanese Army Air Force has repeatedly attacked Chittagong airfield in response to the Japanese land forces, destroying all the enemy aircraft that were gathered there, and crushing the counter-offensive attempt of the British Indian Air Force. Furthermore, in order to reverse the disastrous defeat in the Arakan operation, the enemy planned to regroup and had concentrated a large number of aircraft in Chittagong, but they were completely destroyed in this attack.

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Melbourne, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced that its air force had raided Port Moresby on the night of the 23rd.

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Melbourne, Japanese bombers raided Exmouth Gulf on the west coast of Australia on the 20th and 21st. This is the southernmost point that Japanese aircraft have ever reached.

### In Commemoration of Admiral Yamamoto's Spirit: Japan Launches National Movement; The Imperial Rule Assistance Association Has Sent Telegrams Everywhere Urging the People to Respond

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The spirit of the late Admiral Yamamoto has been transferred to Tokyo on the 23rd. The Japanese people deeply express their condolences, while further strengthening their determination to destroy England and the United States, vowing to continue Admiral Yamamoto's spirit and strive for the final victory of the war. The heightened mood has reached its climax, and groups are planning to commemorate the undying spirit of Admiral Yamamoto. The Political Council of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has decided to launch a major national movement in order to promote the people to inherit the spirit of the admiral, work hard, enhance wartime will, and increase war power. On the 22nd, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association convened a meeting of the heads of its affiliated organizations at its headquarters to discuss concrete plans. As a result of the discussions, it was decided to send telegrams to various places to clarify the purpose of the movement and call on the national people to respond in unison. From today onward, it instructed branches across the country and affiliated organizations to launch the movement based on this spirit. The main points of the telegram are as follows: "The late Admiral Yamamoto led the army at the beginning of the war to defeat the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Hawaii, and then defeated the British Far East Fleet in the Malay Sea. In the year and a half that followed, he repeatedly led the army and commanded the entire army, displaying his loyalty, courage, and resolute strategy. Now, he has unfortunately died for his country in the South China Sea. When we think of the admiral's loyal and heroic spirit, we are even more determined to destroy the bitter enemy. Now, Commander-in-Chief Koga has succeeded Admiral Yamamoto in leading the army. The morale of the front-line soldiers is greatly boosted, and the Japanese Combined Fleet will unleash its power to control the ocean. We are willing to emulate Admiral Yamamoto and comfort his spirit. We are determined to be loyal, abide by our duties, regard our positions as battlefields, and serve the country with our lives. We will use the total strength of 100 million people to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, and move towards the path of annihilating England and the United States and completing the Greater East Asia War, in order to comfort the admiral's spirit." On the 22nd, the Political Council also convened a standing general affairs meeting at noon, and then convened an emergency general affairs meeting to discuss measures to promote the fighting spirit of 100 million people with the spirit of the admiral's martyrdom. As a result of the discussions, it was decided to use the loyal and heroic spirit of the late Admiral Yamamoto as the spirit and engage in a national movement to attack England and the United States and enhance fighting spirit. Concrete measures will be decided after consulting the opinions of various departments at the general affairs meeting to be held on the 25th. In addition, the Japan Industrial Patriotic Association also decided to dedicate one day's labor income on the day of Admiral Yamamoto's state funeral to the navy. In addition, the Niigata Prefectural Association, composed of those from Niigata Prefecture, the hometown of Admiral Yamamoto, also held an emergency meeting on the 22nd to discuss commending Admiral Yamamoto's spirit. As a result, they unanimously advocated setting up the "Admiral Yamamoto Scholarship" to cultivate naval volunteers. Therefore, the Japanese people's determination to destroy England and the United States has been strengthened even more due to the admiral's martyrdom.

### Chairman Wang Posthumously Awarded Admiral Yamamoto

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Japanese Combined Fleet, unfortunately died heroically in the South Pacific while commanding operations this time. When the sad news arrived, our government and the public were deeply saddened. Chairman Wang of the National Government believed that Admiral Yamamoto had assisted greatly in our country's naval reconstruction work during his lifetime. His unfortunate death this time is a major loss for East Asia. Yesterday, he specially decided to posthumously award him the Special Class Tongguang Medal to express his respect and condolences.

### Japanese Reporting Squad Leader in Central Hubei Announces: The Course of Occupying Yuyang Pass

Hankou, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to news from the southern Hubei front lines, the Japanese reporting squad leader here stated on the 24th, explaining the process and significance of the Japanese army's occupation of Yuyang Pass, roughly saying that Yuyang Pass was the foremost defense line for the Chongqing army defending Chongqing, and after a fierce attack by the Japanese army's rapid troops, it fell into the hands of the Japanese army on the evening of the 22nd. The Japanese army troops have been advancing continuously towards the precipitous Bashan mountain range for several days since fiercely attacking the Chongqing 10th Army Group west of Gongan. Their fighting spirit is truly admirable. Because the battlefield there is a mountainous area about 2,000 meters above sea level, the Japanese army had to traverse cliffs hundreds of meters high to attack. In order to prevent the Japanese army from advancing, the Chongqing army had destroyed the only bridge forward. Therefore, the Japanese troops braved the Chongqing army's gunfire to open roads, or waded through rapids two meters deep, building bridges, overcoming all difficulties, and advancing forward, finally occupying Yuyang Pass, a natural stronghold where the Chongqing 87th and 94th armies and six divisions tenaciously resisted. It is reported that Yuyang Pass is located southwest of Yichang and is the supply base for the Chongqing 10th Army Group and the first strategic pass of the Chongqing 6th War Area. Therefore, it is a strategically extremely important stronghold. Now that it has been captured by the Japanese army, the magnitude of the blow suffered by the Chongqing side can be easily imagined.

### North China Japanese Expeditionary Army Announces Battle Results for Last Month

Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese North China Expeditionary Army Headquarters announced at 15:00 on the 24th the comprehensive battle results for April as follows: Number of engagements 1,598 (including 549 with the Chongqing army and 1,049 with the Communist army).

Destroyed 848 Chongqing and Communist military facilities (including 307 Chongqing army facilities and 541 Communist army facilities). 15,252 corpses left behind by the Chongqing and Communist forces (including 10,352 from the Chongqing army and 4,900 from the Communist army). 15,737 captured (including 12,052 from the Chongqing army and 3,685 from the Communist army). The main spoils of the Japanese army included 4 mountain guns, 52 mortars, 31 light machine guns, 329 heavy machine guns, 12,587 rifles, 69 automatic rifles, 1,289 handguns, and a large amount of other ammunition and clothing. According to another telegram, if the above announcement includes the results of the first half of the Taihang operation this spring, which began on the night of April 20 in the Taihang Mountains, the number of corpses left behind and captured from Chongqing and Communist forces totals 31,000. In addition, a total of 848 Chongqing and Communist military facilities were destroyed, of which 541 were on the Communist side, which is sufficient to prove that the focus of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army's operations is on suppressing the Communist army, and this battle is truly noteworthy.

### Propaganda and Naval Departments Celebrate Japanese Navy Memorial Day

### National Army Assists Japanese Army in Surrounding and Attacking Yu Xuezhong's Troops

Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from the central Shandong front lines, since the 11th of this month, various Japanese army units in Shandong Province, in cooperation with the National Government troops in Shandong, have begun operations in the mountains of central Shandong to surround and attack the remnant troops of Yu Xuezhong's Chongqing forces. Up to the 24th, they have engaged the Chongqing army two or three times. The Chongqing army left behind 3,700 corpses and 3,400 were captured. The Japanese army seized 2 flat-trajectory guns, 3 heavy machine guns, 1 light mortar, 12 heavy grenade launchers, 79 light machine guns, 7 automatic rifles, 1,772 rifles, and a large amount of other military supplies.

### Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Annual Meeting Concludes, Chu Minyi and Others Return to Beijing

Suzhou, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Jiangsu Provincial Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association held its second annual meeting and members' congress on the 23rd. Director-General of the General Association, Minister Chu Minyi, Executive Director Dean Jiang Kanghu, Director Commissioner Pu Tong, and others all came to Suzhou to attend and provide guidance. Now, the association's annual meeting and members' congress have successfully concluded on the 23rd. Director Chu, Executive Director Jiang, Director Pu, and others took a car to return to Beijing at around 5 pm on the 24th. Governor Li and the heads of various departments and bureaus of the provincial government, as well as Director Yuan of the association, directors, supervisors, and various people's organizations, all went to the station to see them off.

### Japanese Planes Attack Hengyang

Macau, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a Chongqing telegram, the Japanese Army Air Force launched two large-scale air raids on Hengyang on the 21st, dropping heavy bombs to bomb Chongqing military facilities, causing great damage. On the 22nd, they also launched a surprise attack on Jian'ou Airport in Fujian Province, bombing Chongqing military facilities, causing three fires to break out. All Japanese planes returned safely, it is said.

### Anti-Communist Commander Conference in Progress, Pang Bingxun Gives Speech

Kaifeng, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to reports, General Pang Bingxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Provisional 24th Army Group, delivered a speech at the Peace Anti-Communist Commander Conference on the 23rd, entitled "The Chinese Communist Party," strongly arguing that suppressing the Communists is saving the country. The attending generals were deeply moved after listening. The gist of his speech was roughly as follows: To save the country, we must have peace. To seek peace, we must first suppress the Communists. To suppress the Communists, we must have sufficient military force. Now, with the cooperation of our friendly nation Japan, we are closely united and determined to annihilate the common enemy of Greater East Asia, the Communist Party. From any perspective, the Communist Party is definitely not suitable for Chinese social organization. The ultimate goal of the Communist Party is one-party dictatorship and the tyranny of the producing class. The Chinese Communists plunder the people's food, strip merchants of their profits, and implement a reign of terror. We are now determined to exert all our strength to confront them. With the cooperation of Japan, we can often defeat their military force.

### The Sino-Russian War: Records from This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago - Re-copied from Old Newspapers (4)

Japanese Generals Who Can Write Poetry (Published in this newspaper, No. 1131, on the 4th day of the 9th lunar month of the 30th year of Guangxu, Wednesday, October 12, 1904 in the Western calendar)

A certain Japanese newspaper in Tokyo said: General Hasegawa, whose courtesy name is Rikkodo, when the campaign against Russia began, was ordered to go to Korea and then fight in various parts of Manchuria. His great achievements and outstanding exploits are well known, but it is not known that his literary skills are unmatched by others. He once showed a friend three quatrains he had written recently on a fan. One was titled "Garrison Troops Listening to the Xiao in Fenghuangcheng," and the poem said: "The lake city is full of dark willow barracks, and wild geese fly high over Fenghuangcheng. There is also romantic music in the camp. Who is playing the jade flute with the feelings of ten thousand miles?" The second was titled "Reviewing Troops on the Expedition in Guangling," and the poem said: "The people are brave warriors and the horses are dragons. The orders are strict and the tea fire is respectful in the military camp. After the troop review is over, I return to camp in the evening, and my dreams revolve around the first peak of Wushan." The third was titled "Entering Yizhou," and the poem said: "Ten autumns have passed since the battle in Liaodong, and I am holding the banner of expedition to enter Yizhou again. How can the horses of the barbarians be allowed to drink the clear water of the Yalu River at the corner of Changbai Mountain?" Compared with the poems of the Tang people about the trumpets and flutes playing when leaving and entering the frontier, the momentum is profound and majestic, truly not inferior. How can only those scholars who are good at elegant songs and throwing arrows be considered to show the elegant demeanor of a Confucian general!

### Eastern European Front Remains Silent, Germany and the Soviet Union Prepare for Summer Decisive Battle, Soviet Army Fiercely Attacks Kuban Bridgehead Without Success, Pressure on German Army in Central Donets Also Relaxes

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German Führer Headquarters announced at noon on the 24th that there were only local battles on the Eastern Front.

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front are now actively preparing for a summer offensive, but military experts believe that due to the climate and other natural conditions on the Eastern Front, the time to launch a large-scale operation may be slightly later than last year, but some also believe that the summer operation may start unexpectedly early. According to news from the German front lines, the Soviet army is currently concentrating a large number of infantry units and powerful tank units on the Moscow-south and Kursk front lines. The Soviet army failed to capture the Kuban bridgehead during the winter counter-offensive operation, and now before the German army begins its summer offensive, it has launched a fierce attack on the area again, but the result was ultimately unsuccessful. The Soviet army also seems to be desperately launching a fierce attack on the German army in the Orel area. In short, this year's summer offensive is the decisive period of this world war. Not only can it affect the overall war situation this year, but the war camp of the anti-Axis alliance will also inevitably suffer a major impact, so it is particularly noteworthy.

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – News from Berlin said: The Eastern Front continues to be silent, and local Soviet attacks have been repelled by the German army. In the past 24 hours, the German Air Force has been extremely active, shooting down a total of 53 Soviet aircraft in the Eastern Front airspace. In the Crimea region, German fighter-bombers attacked Soviet railways, especially the Volzhsk and Kursk railway stations, which were heavily bombed, with many freight cars catching fire after being hit. Moscow Radio acknowledged that 10 Soviet fighters were shot down by the German side yesterday. It is reported that a group of German planes bravely broke through the encirclement of Soviet fighters and flew to the Kursk railway center, dropping bombs on various targets in the city. Ten Soviet planes were shot down in the ensuing battle.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Officials here said that the silence of the fighting on the Eastern Front is a "breathing" period before the decisive battle. The entire front was very silent on Saturday, but now there are local reconnaissance and attack units active to break the silence. Heavy rain in the central region prevents large-scale operations, but the German Air Force is very active, bombing Soviet troops engaged in deployment in the Volzhsk and Kursk regions. The Soviet army, which was carrying out operations in the southern battlefield and central region, was scattered by German bombers, and the Soviet army's pressure on the German positions on the hills near Lisichansk in the central Donets region has gradually eased. Military circles believe that if the Soviet army attacks, the combat zone seems to be the Crimea, Temryuk, or Novorossiysk.

### British Planes Attack Western Germany, Losing a Total of 38 Aircraft, Germany Also Bombs British Ports and Shipyards

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German Führer Headquarters announced this afternoon's war report on the Western Front: (1) The anti-Axis air force raided Dortmund in the Ruhr area on the night of the 23rd, dropping a large number of bombs and incendiary bombs, causing considerable damage to residents. (2) A German rapid fighter-bomber squadron launched a surprise attack on various ports in southern England, such as Plymouth and Hastings, during the day. (3) The German Air Force launched another large-scale air raid on the shipyards in Chatham, England, on the night of the 22nd. The city and port facilities were hit and caught fire.

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from London, the British Air Force Department announced on the 24th that when British planes raided western Germany on the evening of the 23rd, Britain lost 38 bombers. It also said that German planes bombed cities on the northeast coast of Britain on the evening of the 23rd, causing considerable damage in various places.

### One Japanese Hospital Ship Attacked Again by Enemy Planes

Yangon, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – At 10:30 am on the 22nd, a Japanese hospital ship was sailing near the mouth of the Yangon River when it was suddenly attacked by seven enemy planes. Three of them machine-gunned the ship and then flew south. The details of the damage are still unclear. The enemy army has carried out such brutal acts against Japanese hospital ships ten times since the beginning of this year, attacking a total of eight ships. The Japanese soldiers and officers are all extremely indignant about this.

### Commander of Yokosuka Naval District, Admiral Toyoda Soemu, Takes Office

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from Yokosuka, the newly appointed Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District, Admiral Toyoda Soemu, arrived in Yokosuka at 10 am on the 24th to take office.

### Stalin Hosts Lavish Banquet for Davies

Ankara, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to last night's radio news, Stalin hosted a banquet for Roosevelt's envoy Davies. Those present included Ambassador to the United States Litvinov, Foreign Minister Molotov, and Marshal Voroshilov. In addition, many members of the British and American diplomatic and military missions were also present.

### One US Destroyer Named After Black Man

Madrid, 23rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to the German News Agency, a telegram from Washington said that a US destroyer was named "Harmon" in memory of Harmon, a black man who died in the Battle of Guadalcanal. This is an unprecedented event in the history of the US Navy.

### International Briefs

Ankara, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – It was revealed today that Maltais, the head of the British Purchasing Commission in Turkey, has been dismissed on charges of fraud. It is said that he purchased construction timber and railway sleepers for the British army in Palestine and Syria, secretly making an agreement with Turkish timber merchants, and embezzled 150,000 Turkish pounds in profits.

Amsterdam, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to the German News Agency, news from London said that the Governor-General of India has appointed Sir Giles, the former Minister to Afghanistan, as his political advisor, succeeding the vacancy of Sir Craik.

Hong Kong, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Five people from the Chinese, Manchukuo, and Thai embassies in Japan flew to Saigon by plane yesterday.

### Air Supremacy and Naval Warfare (3)

– Sato Kiichiro, translated from "Kaizo" May issue

4

The Battle of Stiletto in the Mediterranean in July of the same year was also an example of a triumphant song of seizing sea power from the air. On the 7th of the same month, the British fleet that departed from Alexandria Port was attacked by Italian bomber squads heading for coastal airfields and was bombed ten times throughout the 8th. On the other hand, the British fleet that departed from Gibraltar Port was repeatedly bombed for a day on the 9th by Italian bomber squadrons taking off from Sicily, and the cruiser "Poot" and the aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" were damaged and hurriedly sailed back to Gibraltar Port, revealing an ugly sight. Next, from the 10th to the 13th, the Alexandria fleet was bombed 40 times by Italian aircraft from Libya and the Dodecanese Islands, suffering heavy damage.

However, in the Battle of Cape Matapan in November of the same year, the roles were reversed, and the Italian Navy was at an extremely disadvantageous position against the British Air Force. The Italian fleet, which attempted to conduct operations on the island of Corfu, gathered in Cape Matapan Bay on the 11th of the same month. The British fleet noticed this and secretly lined up the main force of the fleet at the entrance of Cape Matapan Bay on the same night, attacking with the entire fleet and aircraft two hours before the Italian fleet exited. A total of about 100 bombers and fighter planes participated in the attack. The damage to the Italian fleet was announced as the battleship "Gaul" sunk, two battleships of the "Littorio" class, and two cruisers damaged.

In addition, in the Mediterranean, there were the Battle of Genoa in February of the same year and the Battle of Cape Matapan in March. All left inglorious battle records for the Italian Navy.

When discussing the convenience of air supremacy, it is necessary to mention the attack of aircraft on transport convoys protected by warships. Transport ships now also have considerable armed equipment. According to a certain foreign newspaper, the air defense firepower table for merchant ships is as follows (assuming five warships protect 15 merchant ships):

Total Armaments – Per Merchant Ship (Number of Shots Per Minute)

Anti-Aircraft Guns – Anti-Aircraft Machine Guns – Anti-Aircraft Guns – Anti-Aircraft Machine Guns

Transport Ship – 15-30 – 15-30 – 300-600 – 4500-9000

Escorting Warship – 10-15 – 20-40 – 200-300 – 6000-12000

Total – 25-75 – 35-70 – 500-900 – 10500-21000

However, transport ships have always been a disorganized rabble gathered together in an emergency, with light drafts and loads. Therefore, as shown in the table above, although there are armaments, it is very difficult to effectively and appropriately concentrate all firepower on enemy aircraft. From the aircraft's perspective, for example, the German Air Force's initial tactic was to use Messerschmitt -. class heavy machines to attack the guard, reducing combat power, and covering the bomber's attack on the transport ship. The first bomb in a transport ship scatters in all directions, and if it is bombed again, it will suffer a fatal blow. This is a very common situation. Attacking escorted merchant ships is the easiest operation for aircraft, but if the location is near an enemy air base, in other words, within the enemy's air supremacy zone, it is also difficult to approach, which is natural.

As the previous examples show, when a naval battle is decisive, it is necessary to have the advantage of air power, and gaining air supremacy is a prerequisite. Especially for battles within the operating radius of land-based bases, it is most desirable, but the danger of entering the enemy's air supremacy zone without air power is also very clear, as evidenced by the British Navy's failure in the first Norwegian operation.

Regarding the activities of the Japanese air force in the Greater East Asia War, there is no need to say more. How do aircraft dominate the naval warfare situation? This is deeply imprinted in the reader's mind by the publication of the Japanese General Headquarters' reports on the sea battles of Hawaii, the Strait of Malacca, and the recent South Pacific.

The presence or absence of air supremacy determines the naval warfare situation. This is at least a truth in the nature of modern warfare. (End) Translated by Xiao

### Navy Soul (1) - Turret Crewman

– Nakamura Kenichi

It was not midnight, nor was it dawn, but the sky was slightly brighter than the sea. It was difficult to tell whether it was a sunny day or a cloudy day. The long light before dawn was still quite early before the general wake-up time, but the turret crewman, already wearing white work clothes and a hat, quietly approached the turret without making a sound, pushed open the heavy door, and disappeared inside. Not long after, he emerged from the gun's elevation angle and began to walk down again. Suddenly, all the turrets had already begun intense spontaneous exercises before the wake-up call. He discovered a soldier who had offered the traditional headscarf in front of the warship's deity the night before, but was single-mindedly praying under the dim light. This black steel floating city on the water, possessing all modern equipment, seemed to be only carrying these main guns. Every sail of a fishing boat could not escape his sight. They were actively practicing targeting such things. Turret and turret were competing desperately. First-line ships and second-line ships, squadrons and squadrons, fleets and fleets, were all competing desperately. And in this intense training, the shells that were particularly imbued with sound and color would surely hit British and American warships. Other than Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday mornings, noon, and evenings, when others were still dreaming, he still had some free time (Tao: Translated from Asahi Shimbun).

### Concern for North China Disaster Victims, All Sectors Respond to Disaster Relief, Wuxi Native Place Association Starts Fundraising, Mr. Chen Bohang Charity Sells Collected Calligraphy Twice

Since the authorities advocated for the relief of the North China disaster, individuals and organizations have responded enthusiastically. Given the urgency of the situation, there are concerns that it may be too late. Although donations received by this newspaper on behalf of the victims are very enthusiastic, the amount is still insufficient. At this time of seasonal food shortage, the North China disaster victims are crying out for food and need to be dealt with promptly to save them from their immediate crisis. The gentry and merchants of Shanghai have always been public-spirited and helpful, and the authorities have placed special expectations on them. Please donate generously so that the effort can be completed.

### Charity Sale of Kaihuang Lanting, Minimum Price 50,000 Yuan

This newspaper received a letter yesterday from the owner of Shimo Building, which said: "This unprecedented disaster in North China has caused the victims to suffer terribly, as reported in various newspapers. The people of Southeast China, based on the principle of mutual assistance, should do their best. In addition to the charity sale of the Kaicheng Stone Classics, I will now sell the domestic solitary copy of the Kaihuang Lanting, a treasure passed down in my family. The Lanting rubbings are known all over the world as the Dingwu version. I don't know that the Dingwu version belongs to the Ou Lin version. There are only two versions of the inscription on stone with Wang Xizhi's calligraphy, the 13th and 18th years of Kaihuang. Unfortunately, the original stone has been lost for a long time, and the rubbings are as rare as stars. All the fakes seen outside are fakes. My version has inscriptions and seals by famous people such as Du Yuanjing, Yao Gongshou, Cha Mouhe, Xiang Zijing, An Yizhou, Wang Liangchang, Da Jiangshang, Wang Menglou, Lu Shaojing, Yang Longshi, Wu Pingzhai, Zhu Guwei, Hui Nongran, Yu Shaosong, and others, with extremely precise evaluations and a clear lineage of transmission. It is by no means a reprint and has long been recognized by the art world. Many Chinese and foreign epigraphers have asked to buy it at high prices over the years, but I have refused to part with it because it is a treasure that is engraved in my heart. Now, for disaster relief, I plan to make it public to enthusiasts at a minimum price of 50,000 yuan. In addition to recovering two-fifths of the original cost, which is 20,000 yuan, the remainder will be used as disaster relief funds. It would be greatly welcomed if a Chinese person buys it; I would also be grateful for the friendship of foreign friends if they buy it at the stated price. Furthermore, what is the fixed price for a rare treasure? Even asking for a million would not be extravagant. Buyers today can easily obtain the finest goods at the lowest value and also save the most disaster victims. The merits are unparalleled and it is truly a great opportunity for those who have resources. Who is not as eager to do good as I am? I know that there will be those who will not be limited by the fixed price and will rise up to compete for it. Chen Bohang, owner of Shimo Building."

According to reports, Mr. Chen Bohang of Huaiyin, the owner of Shimo Building, is erudite and fond of antiquities. In the past, he edited a special publication on epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting in Hangzhou, and was well-known in the art world for a time. The genuine copy of Kaihuang Lanting collected by him is a rare treasure and is not easily shown to others. This time, he generously sells it for charity and disaster relief. Those who are willing to do good should not miss the opportunity.

### Wuxi Compatriots Are Extremely Concerned

Regarding the disaster in North China, the Wuxi Shanghai Native Place Association is extremely concerned and convened a meeting of directors and supervisors on the 22nd of this month to decide to promptly issue donation books and receipts, and conduct fundraising separately as much as possible. Industrialist Mr. Wang Yuqing and calligrapher Mr. Qian Mingshan, and others have given sincere initiations and support. Their fundraising appeal said, "The provinces of North China have suffered from floods for years, and last year's locusts and droughts have caused severe disasters, as detailed in the newspapers. It is even more credible from the words of those who come from the disaster areas. It is said that the disaster area is as wide as nineteen counties, and the number of disaster victims is as high as tens of millions. Tree bark and grass roots have been dug up completely, and even snatching babies to eat to continue their lives and dividing corpses to fill their hunger. The cruelty of the situation is difficult to describe. I hope that the benevolent gentlemen of our county will expand their concern for their compatriots and act on the hearts of the hungry and drowning. At this time of seasonal food shortage, we will make a transition for them to ferry across so that the disaster victims who are gasping for breath can reach the other shore together." At the meeting, the authorities also received a letter from Mr. Qian Mingshan, which said, "The people of your county are public-spirited and helpful, and are always at the forefront of the counties in Jiangnan. This time, for the relief of North China, all factory owners and iron industrialists will surely agree. With this wind moving on the sea and moving the world, the disaster in Central China may have a turning point. Although I am not talented, if I have free time, I will prepare some joint fans and ask you to sell them on my behalf, to do my part."

### Aiding Recovery Through Skill Sharing

This newspaper received a letter yesterday from Mr. Zhong Wenjun, stating, "According to fellow villagers who have fled famine to Shanghai, there has been a severe drought for ten months, with no grass or vegetation growing. Starving people are everywhere, dying one after another, a truly unbearable sight. I am originally from Yongnian County, Hebei Province, and have been a merchant in Shanghai for many years. I inherited the authentic teachings of Tai Chi Chuan from my maternal grandfather, Yang Chengfu. Now, I am willing to sacrifice my time and energy to teach it personally, without accepting any compensation, whether it is early or late. Firstly, it is to raise funds for the disaster in my hometown, and secondly, it is to fulfill my long-held ambition to promote physical education. If members of the community wish to learn this art, they can register through this newspaper to raise funds for relief efforts. The contact address is No. 14, Lane 237, Guangdong Road, telephone number 17914."

### Ambassador Gu Completes Official Business, Flies Back to Post

Mr. Gu Zhengzhi, the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, arrived in Shanghai on the 21st. After conferring with various parties on important matters and exchanging greetings with military, civilian, and other circles upon assuming his post, he has now completed his official business. Ambassador Gu, along with his entourage including Minister Horiuchi, Counselor Ota, Secretary Shimizu, and Secretary Terashima, boarded a plane yesterday morning at 8:30 to fly to Beijing to return to his post.

### Hot Water Guild Demands Resumption of Selling Affordable Coal

The city's 400+ hot water shops are currently facing operational difficulties due to their inability to purchase affordable coal. They have all requested assistance from the industry guild. The guild, considering the facts presented by its members, has found them to be true. In order to seek welfare for the industry, in addition to petitioning the Municipal Council's Guild Section to order coal merchants to supply and sell "affordable coal for hot water," they have now written to Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, urging them to resume the sale of affordable coal within a specified period to alleviate the urgent crisis. The guild pointed out that if the industry were to cease operations, it would cause various difficulties: (1) the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people in the city who depend on it would be abruptly cut off; (2) citizens would be unable to purchase hot water, causing inconvenience, and the general population would inevitably drink raw water to quench their thirst, leading to various dangerous illnesses; (3) citizens would burn water themselves, keeping their coal stoves burning day and night, easily causing accidents; (4) the working class, due to work constraints, would have no time to boil water, and even if they did, they would carelessly drink unclean raw water, which is a matter of hygiene. Furthermore, the industry, in order to maintain the livelihoods of ordinary people, has not increased the price of hot water. Currently, each ladle is still sold for one jiao in Central Reserve Bank notes, and the capacity of the ladle has also been increased to 1000 cc. Moreover, the industry is mostly operated on a small scale, and if this situation continues, they will be forced to close down. Therefore, members of the industry unanimously hope that the authorities and those who manage coal will resume the sale of "affordable coal for hot water" within a specified period, so that not only will citizens be able to conveniently purchase hot water nearby, but the industry will also be able to barely maintain its original state.

### Strengthening Southern Transportation Capacity, Adjusting Large Ships to Join the Voyage, Inland River Shipping Company Holds General Meeting Today

According to news from the shipping industry, in order to adjust its shipping structure and enhance transportation capacity, the China Shipping Company, in addition to adding wooden boats to its fleet, recently plans to enhance its southern shipping capacity by adding large ships suitable for ocean navigation that are currently sailing elsewhere. The vacancies on other routes will be filled with wooden steamships and small steamers.

Operating Conditions of Inland River Shipping

The Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company authorities, in order to discuss future business strategies and report on last year's operating conditions, are scheduled to hold a general meeting today at the Japanese Club. According to the company's announcement, last year's business revenue was approximately 11,127,000 yuan, a slight increase compared to the previous year. However, due to increased expenditures last year, dividends for last year were suspended. In terms of revenue, 4,445,000 passengers were transported (1,660,000 in the first half of the year, totaling 1,240,000 yuan; 2,485,000 in the second half of the year, totaling 2,670,000 yuan). Freight totaled 4,155,000 yuan, with a total tonnage of 1,402,000 tons of cargo transported, generating 7,820,000 yuan in revenue (782,000 tons in the first half of the year, totaling 3,980,000 yuan; 630,000 tons in the second half of the year, totaling 3,840,000 yuan).

### Rumor That Deping Steamer Will Directly Serve Shanghai-Ningbo Route

Since the Shanghai-Ningbo route resumed service last year, travel between the two cities has been quite convenient for residents. However, although there are currently four steamers, Xin Ning Shao, Changshan, Hualin, and Wansheng, operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, due to the large number of passengers traveling back and forth, every trip is still fully booked. As a result, purchasing tickets has become inconvenient. According to a reliable source from the Datong News Agency, the Deping steamer, which previously operated on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, may soon be approved by the relevant authorities to resume direct service. At the same time, the price of tickets will also be maintained at a fixed rate by the authorities, and any violations will be punished.

### Pang Bingxun's Surrender, Comfort Movement Initiated by Seamen's Party Branch, City Party Branch Sends Special Telegram of Condolences

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) General Pang Bingxun, commander of the 24th Group Army and deputy commander of the Ji-Cha War Zone, surrendered with his troops on the 6th of this month to participate in the peace movement. The Shanghai Special City Party Branch, recognizing General Pang as a famous general of the Northwest, who resolutely surrendered in accordance with the National Government's order to cease fire and demobilize, setting an example for soldiers, sent a telegram of condolence to express their respect. The original text is as follows: "To General Pang Bingxun of Xinxiang, As General Commander, you defended Ji-Cha. Now, recognizing the shifting of people's hearts and the trend of public opinion, you bravely broke free from Chongqing's constraints and surrendered with your troops in accordance with the National Government's national policy, participating in the peace movement. In an instant, you turned swords into plowshares and transformed a defensive area into a land of prosperity. News reports your sincere statement on a cold day, vowing to firmly adhere to your beliefs under Chairman Wang's leadership, wholeheartedly revitalize China, and strive to defend East Asia. We read it again and again with increasing admiration. As the saying goes, 'Exhaust your strength and follow it with loyalty.' Is this not what the General is doing? We look up to the clouds and mountains with endless longing. We send this telegram of condolence and respectfully request your perusal. From Ling Xianwen, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party Shanghai Special City and all party members."

Condolence Measures

In order to comfort General Pang's army and show respect, the Seamen's Special Party Branch of this city has launched a comfort movement, with the Director of the Party Branch convening its members to actively prepare for the comfort of General Pang's army. In addition to sending a telegram of respect, they have also appointed a special person to organize a comfort delegation to General Pang's army. At the same time, they have launched a campaign to solicit comfort funds and collect various practical items, so that they can be gathered and transferred to General Pang's troops. The Party Branch has already solicited donations from relevant seamen's organizations and shipping companies.

### Third Phase of Household Sugar Sales Temporarily Suspended This Month

According to information gathered by a Datong News Agency reporter, the third phase of household sugar sales in the city, originally scheduled for the 11th of this month, was postponed to this week due to delays in the distribution procedures. Now, due to pending consultations on the procedures, it is said that there is no hope of selling this phase of household sugar until at least the end of the month.

### Tram Monthly Season Ticket Prices to Increase Starting Next Month

The Shanghai Tram Company, for all trams and trolleybuses operating in the Public Concession, has set an increase in fares starting tomorrow (the 26th), as previously reported in this newspaper. According to information gathered by a Datong News Agency reporter, starting next month, the prices of tram monthly season tickets will also be adjusted. Adult first-class tickets will be 90 yuan per month (previously 66 yuan), third-class tickets will be 45 yuan (previously 33 yuan), and children's tickets (valid for both first-class and third-class carriages) will also be 45 yuan (previously 25 yuan).

### Manufacturing Soap, Candles, and Grease, No Restrictions on Transportation, Free Transportation Permitted to Shanghai Area

In this city, in addition to the grease produced locally and the existing inventory, all industrial factories feel that the raw materials are insufficient and must be procured from within the jurisdiction of the Qingxiang Committee Shanghai Branch. According to the General Control Association, merchants are free to transport goods in and out of all areas within this city, including various regions, without the need to apply for permits. Therefore, the person in charge of the Shanghai Industrial Grease Industry Association petitioned the Municipal Economic Bureau, requesting them to separately request the Qingxiang Committee Shanghai Branch and the Municipal Police Bureau to order their subordinates to allow members of the Association who have procured goods within the Qingxiang area and have a certificate issued by the Association to pass freely, in order to meet the needs of soap and candle manufacturing factories. It is now learned that the Municipal Economic Bureau has issued a letter to the police, ordering them to allow free transportation without restrictions for industrial grease transported from within the area to the Shanghai area, as it is not included in the specific materials listed in Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Regulations on the Restriction of Wartime Material Movement, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Regulations.

### Madam Feng Muwen's Funeral, Funeral Gifts Converted into University Loan Funds

Madam Wen, the mother of Mr. Feng Bingnan, declined condolences and all funeral gifts. Mr. Feng's friends, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, and others, believed that customary exchanges were unavoidable, so they had a plan to convert the cash into social welfare projects. At the time, they published a notice and collected a certain amount, which, along with Mr. Feng Bingnan's donation of thanks, was used to donate to various charitable organizations, with the remainder used to establish a university loan fund, and organized a "Madam Feng Muwen University Loan Fund Committee" to be responsible for safekeeping. Now, on the 30th of this month, which is the date of Madam's funeral, Wen Lanting and others are launching another initiative, following the previous method, to convert it into cash to replenish the university loan fund, in order to fulfill Madam's will.

The "Japanese Naval Anniversary Exhibition," jointly organized by the Shanghai News Association and the Fine Arts Patriotic Association to commemorate the 38th Japanese Naval Festival Week, opened yesterday at the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road. From morning to evening, there were no less than 10,000 visitors. This shows the general public's awareness of the Japanese Navy in this city. The details are recorded below:

Various Photos Displayed at the Venue

The venue is located at the painting hall on the fourth floor of Daxin, which is spacious, so there are a large number of items on display. At the entrance is a Japanese naval flag and a photo of the Japanese navy. The first photo on display is of Marshal Togo, who led the Japanese navy to defeat the powerful Russian fleet 38 years ago. There is also a portrait of Commander Yamamoto of the Combined Fleet, who commanded the overall operations in the South Pacific last month and died for his country. Next to it is a recent photo of Commander Koga, Yamamoto's successor. In the center of the painting hall is a large painted map of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Other photos include naval battle scenes from Hawaii, Malaya, the Indian Ocean, Surabaya, New Guinea, the Coral Sea, and the Solomon Islands. The spirit of the Japanese navy's heroic combat is evident on paper. Other photos depict the Marine Corps, the Air Corps, military schools, life on warships, the majesty of warships, the navy of the new China, and the Shanghai Ocean Youth Team, describing the situation of combat, introducing the content of training, showing the daily life and operations of naval personnel, and emphasizing the completeness of the equipment of the modern Japanese navy. There are also more than 100 works by Japanese schoolchildren, painted in color, depicting the lives of soldiers, which is enough to show the Japanese students' understanding of the navy. In addition, there are many patterns such as "Color of Seawater," "Ocean Depth," "Seawater Composition," and "Coral Reef."

Ship Models Are Realistic

In addition to photos, there are also more than ten evolutionary diagrams of ancient and modern warships, from wooden warships 4,000 years ago to modern warships. The evolution is clear at a glance. There are also various modern ship types, including sand boats, cargo ships, oil tankers, fishing boats, merchant ships, mail ships, and shallow-water boats, gathered together, creating a grand spectacle. Various warship patterns are also on display. Among the exhibits, the three-dimensional models of various ships and warships are carefully appreciated by the audience. They are realistic. The rest are ship models made by Japanese schoolchildren. The sizes vary, with ordinary ships being the most common and warships being the second most common. The larger ones are one or two inches, and the smaller ones are five or six feet. Many people are watching. Those who have never seen the true appearance of warships can learn a thing or two from this. In addition, the special issue of the News Association celebrating the Japanese Navy Anniversary Day is distributed at the venue. In addition to describing the achievements of the Japanese Navy and its traditional spirit, it also provides a general description of the work of the Association.

Today's Visit to the Izumo Flagship

In addition to the exhibition hosted by the News Association and the Fine Arts Patriotic Association, there are the following that opened the day before yesterday to commemorate Navy Day: (1) The commemorative exhibition at the Greater East Asia Cultural Reporting Center at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road, displaying models of various warships and aircraft, war photos, statistical charts, and colorful comics. (2) The China Film United Company displayed various naval photos in the Grand Light and Dahua theaters. (3) The International Theater and the Shanghai Theater in Hongkou have naval military photo exhibitions hosted by the Allied Press, Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Yomiuri Shimbun, and the Continental News. In addition, the News Association and the Japanese Naval Reporting Department have reached an agreement to invite reporters from various newspapers to visit the Izumo flagship at 3 pm today. They will gather at 2:40 pm on the third floor of the Fleet Reporting Department on the Bund and depart together. The Izumo warship made special contributions during the Russo-Japanese War and is now the residence of the fleet commander.

Economic Commentary

### Lessons from the North China Famine

The ancients said, "After a great war, there will inevitably be a great epidemic." Fortunately, due to the advancement of modern medicine and thorough epidemic prevention, this saying is not true. The ancients also said, "After a great war, there will inevitably be a great famine." Given the prolonged war and the stalemate, this saying may unfortunately prove to be true. The recent famine in various provinces of North China, calling for the transport of grain from Central and Southern China for relief, is just one example of the unfortunate truth of the ancient saying. We trace the cause and, for the sake of humanity, sincerely call for the early arrival of a comprehensive, glorious peace in the country.

Other reasons for the current famine in North China are said to be (1) scarce rainfall, (2) hoarding of grain by the rich, (3) lack of external grain, (4) promotion of cotton fields, and (5) extensive cultivation of other unprofitable crops. The fundamental solution to scarce rainfall seems to be to plant forests extensively and dig more wells; the thorough solution to cracking down on the rich hoarding grain seems to be to check warehouses and search homes, but the latter is extremely disruptive and has many drawbacks; the proper solution to the lack of external grain is to exchange North China's mineral resources for Central China's agricultural products, and first to facilitate transportation and lift restrictions; as for the promotion of cotton fields, it is also aimed at solving the problem of clothing, so it is not entirely blameworthy. If it can be further developed to exchange North China's cotton for Central China's rice, that would be even better. As for the extensive cultivation of other unprofitable crops, we hope that the people of North China can learn from the pain and not seek short-term gains and forget long-term harms, and quickly change to planting profitable crops—grains and food—to avoid the recurrence of famine.

"The people regard food as their heaven." It was so in ancient times, it is so now, and when is it not so? On the day the famine demon strikes, people suddenly realize the suitability of the heavy agricultural policy. While we are talking about increasing production, please do not abandon the fundamentals and pursue the trivial!

### Economic Bureau Continues to Register Eight Major Commodities from June 1st to 30th

The Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau began the general registration of major items such as cotton, matches, soap, and candles on April 5th, and extended the deadline to the 10th of this month. The registration has been largely completed by the deadline. Now, the Ministry of Industry has issued a list of major commodities, which includes (1) wool fabrics and wool products, (2) cocoons, (3) silk and silk products, (4) industrial grease, (5) tobacco leaves, (6) glass (including raw materials and products), (7) electrical appliances (including raw materials and products), and (8) leather (including raw materials and products). Since these eight items were not included in the previous general registration, it has been decided to continue the registration of the above eight major commodities from June 1st to June 30th. It is hoped that those who store major items will comply with the regulations.

### The Commercial Control Association and the Ministries of Industry and Food Control Materials

After the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, the control of materials within the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai has been greatly relaxed compared to the past. However, in addition to the controlled materials stipulated by the Materials Control Review Committee of the Association, there are also controlled materials stipulated by the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Food. The following is a list of the 37 controlled materials stipulated by the Commercial Control Association, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Food:

### The Materials Control Review Committee Holds Its Third Meeting

The Materials Control Review Committee has held two committee meetings in Nanjing and Shanghai. Tomorrow at 3 pm, the third committee meeting will be held at the International Club. All members of the committee will go to Nanjing to attend.

### The Wheat and Flour Professional Committee Will Send Personnel to Purchase Wheat

After the National Commercial Control Association's Wheat and Flour Professional Committee was formally established on the 20th of this month, its internal organizational structure has been completely determined. It is divided into eight departments and twenty-one sections, responsible for the purchase of wheat, the distribution and sale of flour bran, the adjustment of prices, the inspection of quality, the increase and improvement of production, and other matters. It will also establish branches in nine major wheat and flour production and sales areas, including Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Taizhou, Nanjing, Wuhu, and Bengbu, in order to strengthen purchasing and manufacturing work. It is reported that the committee will send personnel from the wheat section and the review section to the wheat production areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces this week to investigate the production status, the flour production of Chinese and Japanese factories, the quantity of wheat raw materials needed, and the amount of flour produced, in order to provide a basis for the purchase of wheat and the distribution to the industry. At the same time, the wheat section and the flour bran section will prepare to carry out the first step of wheat purchase work based on the results of the investigation, in order to allocate it to flour mills to produce flour to meet the needs of the people.

### Bank of Communications Plans to Establish Agricultural Warehouses

The Agricultural Economics Department of the Bank of Communications has decided on a new agricultural loan plan and has already begun implementing this business. This plan will have a significant impact on all parties. According to the bank's Economic Department, a certain agricultural implement manufacturer intends to apply for a loan of 10 million yuan, and a certain agricultural farm intends to apply for a loan of 200,000 yuan. The strengthening and addition of cooperative societies and agricultural warehouses are currently under study. The issue of cooperative societies has already been reported in the press. Regarding the establishment of agricultural warehouses, which are closely related to cooperative societies, there are many difficulties due to materials and funds. Although there is a desire to repair temples or civilian houses in various towns and turn them into small and medium-sized warehouses, this is not an easy task. As a result, Bank of Communications Chairman Tang Shoumin and the authorities of the Ministry of Food must negotiate and proceed. The bank's agricultural product guarantees and the current food purchase policy of the Ministry of Food must not conflict. Therefore, the Ministry of Food's entrustment of the Bank of Communications to handle part of the food purchase matters is quite problematic. Regarding the agricultural loan issue, according to the bank's Agricultural Economics Department:

As far as we know, the organization of the loan syndicate has not yet been finalized. It is also possible that Mr. Tang has already conducted concrete negotiations with other powerful banks. Our department is currently rushing to formulate our bank's agricultural loan business policy. Regarding the issue of agricultural warehouses, there have been significant changes in all aspects, such as the price of agricultural products in warehouses and interest rates, before and after the incident. Moreover, the Ministry of Food has issued food warehouse bonds to purchase rice. Therefore, the opening of agricultural warehouses must be done with the full understanding of the Ministry of Food. The above is a general principle. In short, the warehouse issue has not yet been finalized. The agricultural loan business can only be soundly promoted after our department's plan is fully in place. (Yun Peng: Translated from the May 24th "Continental News")

### Silver and Money Industry Forms a Subcommittee to Review Accepted Discounted Bills

Various banks and businesses in the silver and money industry have established a bill acceptance and discount implementation plan through the Banking Association to promote commercial acceptance bills. This has been submitted to the Bankers' Association for review. A subcommittee has been formed for detailed review. It is said that the Silver and Money Association has already sent letters to various businesses to conduct research.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese agricultural stocks initially stabilized and strengthened. However, the price of gold has plummeted, and the money market is becoming increasingly tight, leading to a rapid return to a dismal and sluggish decline. In the rush to sell for cash, various stocks were particularly weak at noon. However, there were exceptions, such as China Weaving, Maorong, Jingfu Socks Factory, and Tongyi Trust Company. Among the old stocks, China Underwear suddenly became the target of new and old investors. The market was active, and prices also moved upward, probably due to the firm rise in shirts and other goods. Wing On Company and China National Goods were in continuous ups and downs. Sincere Company stood alone at the pass. China Silk Factory, Wing On Textiles, and other small-denomination textile stocks such as Guoguang Printing and Dyeing were not inquired about, and prices stepped lower in the selling pressure. Among the new pharmaceutical companies, Sino-French Pharmacy and New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory saw buyers after small price declines, and stabilized at noon, with slight short covering. Zhabei Water and Electricity, China Merchants Electric, and Nanyang Tobacco Company, as well as stocks such as Great China Match Company, remained unchanged from last Saturday. In the cultural industry, China and World Book Company remained flat. Commercial Press lacked buyers and declined sharply. Jiu'an Industrial stabilized. China United Film and Xinyi Real Estate prices were weak and no one could match China Clock Factory, which had no buyers and a huge drop.

### Economic Bureau Approves the Formation of the Secondhand Goods Trade Association

Since the city's Secondhand Goods Trade Association was approved by the Municipal Economic Bureau, Guo Yanting has actively begun preparations and investigations. In the autumn of material scarcity after the incident, the secondhand goods industry has been particularly prosperous because it suits the purchasing power of the common people. However, the industry has always lacked consistent business methods, leading unscrupulous individuals to often use the name of secondhand goods to conspire to exploit the interests of the common people, which is criticized by society. To effectively rectify the industry, the association will issue various regulations to the industry for unified compliance as soon as the formal establishment is completed.

Readers' Forum

### On the Cotton Cloth Problem (Continued)

— Li Zhihua

(4) According to the regulations in Article 3, since the fate of all registered goods has been decided by the association, future transactions will definitely not exceed the price limit. Under the principle of not exceeding the price limit, warehouse receipts should also be allowed to be freely traded, so as to smooth the finances between manufacturers and wholesalers. However, the maximum amount of inventory that each cotton cloth merchant can hold must be specified to avoid suspicion of hoarding. According to the above measures, the black market transactions of manufacturers and wholesalers can be reduced. However, whether the retail price of retail stores can avoid the black market depends on the amount of allocation. If the amount of cotton cloth inventory statistically calculated by the authorities is sufficient to meet the needs of the year, then the amount of allocation will naturally not be too small, and the black market will not occur. Conversely, there is only one method of distributing cloth according to the population. Otherwise, the result will be just like the past squeezing of oil, squeezing of sugar, and even the recent squeezing of cigarettes, which will not bring any real benefit to the people and will only cause more disputes.

In short, in this wartime, it is inevitable that prices will rise due to the difficulty of tightening currency. However, if the authorities carefully consider the overall plan, it is not difficult to achieve better results. (End)

Popular Life: The Petty Employee of the Salaried Class, Use One

In today's world of soaring prices, the wealthy are certainly unaffected, but ordinary people are all complaining. Especially us petty employees of the salaried class, besides burying ourselves in work all day, even shedding blood and sweat, we also have to endure the lessons of our superiors. And what we eat every day is only coarse food and light meals, which we sometimes cannot swallow. What we get every month is only the price of eighty or ninety yuan. Ask the reader, where can this money be used to support the old and the young in the family? It is even difficult to maintain personal expenses. It almost makes our lives breathless. For example, the cost of haircuts and baths in a month is about 20 yuan. A pair of cotton socks also costs seventeen or eighteen yuan. In addition, the cost of cigarettes is at least thirty or forty yuan. Leaving aside other things, just taking the above items, it already amounts to seventy or eighty yuan, so how much money is left over! If you want to buy a pair of shoes, even the most economical tire-soled shoes, you have to save for four or five months. Making clothes is even out of the question. Although we often hear that we are going to get a raise, we feel as happy as if we have been injected with a stimulant, but in the end it cannot become a reality. It is really what is called: "Only hear the sound of the elevator, but do not see anyone coming down." This makes us greatly disappointed. Sometimes, if a colleague happens to be sick, or if there is an urgent need at home, we have to discuss borrowing some money from the authorities, and the procedures are really extremely troublesome. First, you have to fill out an application form, stating the reasons, seeking proper guarantees, and then you have to get the approval of the superiors before you can get what you want. Sometimes you may even be rejected, which is also uncertain. On the other hand, what about their lives? Besides the social engagements in transactions, they spend their days in the world of red lanterns and green wine, living a life of drunkenness and death. Although they do not have cars to travel in and out, at least they use rickshaws. In winter, they turn on water heaters and electric furnaces at home, and in summer, they turn on electric fans. What they eat every day is either delicacies from the mountains or seafood. When they need money, they just need a check to ask the cashier to pay. If you use the two sentences "Work hard without earning money, hate money without working hard" here, it is more appropriate. In short, in today's society, the general salaried class feels the hardship of maintaining a livelihood. In the long run, it is enough to affect the efforts of their own work and the security of the local area. Now I have written some simple things to make an urgent appeal to people in the society and local authorities, hoping to give us powerful assistance!

Special Edition for Mr. Shen Xinqing's Eightieth Birthday

### Mr. Shen Xinqing's Eightieth Birthday

— Respectfully written by Jiang Weiqiao of Wujin

Since ancient times, virtuous and wise men have had firm and steadfast aspirations within them. Externally, they have had few desires. They have preserved their original nature, like uncarved jade. They are accustomed to hard work, like a door hinge that is not infested with worms. Such people can often reach the age of eighty or ninety and their minds do not decline. Is Mr. Shen Xinqing of Wuxian not a virtuous and wise man? Mr. Shen was young and honest. His learning was based on using the classics to serve the world. He was especially good at exegesis. His calligraphy entered Wang's style from Yan and Liu. His poetry approached Li and Du. At the age of fifteen, he supplemented the doctoral student member. He raised in the township in the Jiawu year. After the Wuxu year, the domestic pioneers realized that my country was weak. Foreign troubles occurred frequently. There was no way to survive without reform and development of education. Although Mr. Shen was successful in the township siege, he had no intention of becoming an official. He devoted himself to education. When Qing Yan issued an edict to study, he proposed to change the Longmen Academy, where he had been studying in the past, into a normal school. He was appointed as the first supervisor. The students were polite and lectured on the classics. Within a few years, the results were remarkable. The provinces heard the news and imitated him, for fear of being left behind. When the national system changed in the Xinhai year, Mr. Shen believed that the people should do their duty to rejuvenate the Republic of China. He then entered the Jiangsu Governor's Office and was in charge of civil affairs. He carefully selected the shepherds and cleaned up the officialdom. After the outbreak of the war, all the schools in the province stopped. Mr. Shen worked hard to recover and reorganize them. The public and private schools in the province and county heard the sound of string music again. After the reorganization of the Governor's Office, Mr. Shen retired and presided over the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association. At that time, educational theories in Eastern and Western countries were changing rapidly. He selected the ones that conformed to my country's national conditions. He gathered members to study them. If the research was successful, he would offer it to the authorities, hoping to implement it in practice. He opened a lecture to publicize it to the academic community. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Shen and his comrades advocated vocational education. Later, it became the Chinese Vocational Education Society. Mr. Shen painstakingly lectured everywhere. He encouraged young people to respect their careers and enjoy group work. He made it the purpose of education to enable the unemployed to have a job and the employed to enjoy their work. The sound of vocational education spread throughout the country. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, he and several friends created the Jiazi Society. He collected modern historical materials and widely reported in chapters and magazines. All the court regulations, criminal laws, rites and music, water conservancy, farmland, and social customs were divided into parts and added with pruning. The toothpicks were ten thousand axes, like a net in the outline. It was expanded into a humanities library. Mr. Ye Hongying saw it and felt it was good. He generously donated funds. It was renamed the Hongying Library. Mr. Shen has been in charge of the library for nearly 20 years. He goes to the library every day, even in wind and rain. Although his hearing and gait have weakened slightly recently, his spirit is still vibrant. He still supports the public with a cane. Many people who love Mr. Shen advise him to rest, but Mr. Shen firmly ignores it. Mr. Shen's heart for loving the country and saving the world is getting stronger as he gets older. Recently, he felt sorry for the world and the people, and re-established the Rongwu Lecture Sutra Friendship Society. He intended to reconcile the various religions and promote the Great Harmony. He praised Confucianism and hoped to practice it. How great is his wish. Today, Mr. Shen is eighty years old. June 1st is the day of the award. His friends know that Mr. Shen never celebrates his birthday and that his words and deeds are worthy of being recorded. He entrusted me to write the preface. I think that Mr. Shen can achieve great age and his mind does not decline. One word of diligence is enough to describe it. The Book of Changes says that the sky moves vigorously. A gentleman strives for self-improvement. The legend says that people live in diligence. Diligence is not poor. This is what it means. It is written at the end of the article so that future generations will know what to emulate.

### What I Know About Mr. Shen Xinqing

— Pan Yangyao

Mr. Xinqing's actions in his life are often encouraged by the two words "not sloppy." When he was in charge of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association, when processing official documents, even if there was a mistake in one word, he had to correct it before it was over, and he tried his best to prevent the clerks from being sloppy. He always said that once the pen and ink were sloppy, he would know that the person was rough and playful in doing things, and there was nothing to be taken! Therefore, those who have worked in Mr. Shen's office must be careful and meticulous, and their movements must be in accordance with the law, that is, they know that they have benefited from Guang Sheng's example and have been well trained.

Mr. Shen usually devotes himself to lecturing, especially the two books of the University Book of Changes, and he has a unique understanding of their meaning. "The sky is healthy, and a gentleman strives for self-improvement." Mr. Shen often urges his students to deeply appreciate this sentence, and he especially admires Confucius' spirit of "knowing that it is impossible and doing it," which is the most worthy of being an example. Mr. Shen once thought of the sentence "A gentleman is self-satisfied without anyone," which shows that Chuan Da is generous and happy. His cultivation skills are all derived from this taste, which is the sign of Mr. Shen's longevity.

Mr. Shen's learning is guided by simplicity and usefulness. Therefore, in the sixth year of the Republic of China, he and the educational leaders in the north and south of the Yangtze River created and led vocational education, established a society to promote it, and lectured back and forth. They must use "professionalism" and "enjoyment" as encouragement to "enable the unemployed to have a job and the employed to enjoy their work," which is also the goal of Mr. Shen's lifelong education. At that time, the company's Ding Company Zheng was decided by Mr. Shen; Mr. Shen Gu Wei Ren Zhi Mr. said: "From now on, it will be the era of the omnipotence of both hands, can you use both hands as a sign?" His worship of practical learning can be seen in his deep intentions. Mr. Shen has been in charge of various agencies, strict between taking and giving, holding the purpose of open accounting, the most strict in the accounts, even the slightest amount, he is not willing to be sloppy, the so-called not taking a penny, not giving a penny to others, Mr. Shen has it.

Mr. Shen encouraged his students with meticulous care. Seeing that young people have a good point, he must praise it without decline, and induce them to strive forward. There are not a few young people who have worked hard to improve themselves because of encouragement. However, he hates evil as an enemy throughout his life, and does not hide it at all. Seeing that people's words and deeds are absurd, he must rebuke them face to face, and he is not willing to follow anything, so there are inevitably afterwords at that time; but after a long time, the person wakes up and turns to gratitude, thinking that Mr. Shen is indeed worthy of being a friend and a strict teacher!

Mr. Shen's morality and articles have been praised by the world, and his calligraphy is especially vigorous and magnificent, and people are eager to treasure it. However, he is not willing to follow people's requests casually, does not write on inferior paper, does not write on folding fans, and does not write on those who despise him. It is recorded that an old friend asked him to write a fan for more than ten years, and finally did not get Mr. Shen's permission. This kind of strong and resolute spirit can also see Mr. Shen's perseverance.

Since the beginning of the Republic of China, after resigning from the post of the Su Civil Affairs Department, Mr. Shen has vowed to serve the society and has no intention of politics. During the Li Huangpi era, he admired Mr. Shen's name and appointed him as the director of the Xiang Education Department. Mr. Shen firmly declined the offer. In the resignation, he wished to make contributions as a commoner in the wild, and his temperament was indifferent, which can be seen here.

Mr. Shen's observations on the current situation and everything are full of optimism. Looking at the world and thinking about the future, he is never pessimistic. His discussions and poems all contain the spirit of actively moving forward. I still remember that when the Family Day Renewal Society held a meeting in the past, I accompanied my father to the meeting. I talked with Mr. Shen for a long time. Mr. Shen Gu Wei said to me: "Your father has a broad mind and has the atmosphere of spring everywhere, which is gratifying." My father, the eldest son, passed away unfortunately due to a rock disease two years ago. Every time I think of this, I am saddened.

Mr. Shen's poetry is deeply rooted and directly pursues the charm of the Tang Dynasty. For more than 20 years, every time I meet Mr. Shen, I must show his recent works to me, or hand-copy a piece of paper and give it to me, so there are many treasures in the old box, which is even more precious. When I traveled south in the past, I must get a handwritten letter from Mr. Shen every month, and he must give me a new poem in the letter, which is very sincere. You Qiao Ma Xiangbo Mr. lived in Tushan Bay, Mr. Shen initiated the Qianling Collection, and whenever Xiang Lao's birthday, he would go to his residence to make a literary and wine party, famous people gathered, Mr. Shen improvised a poem, and there were many who agreed. In a certain year, on the occasion of the 100th birthday of Xiang Lao, Mr. Shen mailed a letter to Yue, wrote a hundred-rhyme poem to wish him, beautiful and neat. Now that Xiang Lao has returned to the mountains, most of the predecessors who participated in the meeting at that time have also dissipated, and when I think back to that time, I am overwhelmed. However, the Qianling Collection was printed into a book by my teacher Lu Guiliang, in order to keep the Hongxue.

### Shou翁's Calligraphy

### Xin Lao has been my friend for more than 560 years. On the occasion of his 80th birthday, I will write a long song and pray for the improvement of the political situation.

— Lu Guiliang

I am worried about the difficulties of the times when I am worried about the desolation. I cannot save the suffering of the world. I am happy that I am worth the strange disaster that broke the ground. In the near future, I can climb the spring platform of He Xihao together. Shen Lao was born after Hong Yang. The family of literature has a good foundation. The thorn courtyard's great works are brilliant in the south. The bull's ears of the literary world hold the right. In the Jiawu year, he went to the public car to express his grief. He generously presented a letter of obedience. Jia Sheng's exclamation was boiling, and he was exempted from reporting. He sighed in the grass in the hospital. Our China first created the Republic of China. The Asian countries are proud of it. The abolition of the old and the new is a matter of all kinds. You participate in it and praise it diligently. Hong Tao's dream of being an emperor was lost for a hundred days. The crowd blindly encouraged the progress of the table to compete for the mention. You and your comrades resisted the fly electricity. The middle stream protects the whale. He diligently lectured in the sound of national crisis. People say that this old man is really strong. I am used to deducing poetry. Ba Cai is the first hero in poetry. (When you were young, your body was short, your skin was white and bright, and Zhu Jun Zihao, a classmate of the Longmen Academy, called you Qi Xiaobai. Now, most people under middle age do not know it.) Hei Qiao Xiang Gong's injustice is not white. (After you were seventy years old, your hair was not white. One day, during the banquet, you suspected that I said that you had the injustice of not being white. The whole seat burst into laughter.) The joke is not skin-deep, and the laughter is high. I have known them for fifty or sixty years. I pour out my writing when I am in high spirits. I will give you a word of opening nine. I will sing nine as a wish. What's more, the world's fortune is difficult to turn around. At the banquet, I will promote you. The frowns are suddenly stretched out, and we will share the Ning. Worry and happiness are originally related to the world.

### Celebrating the Eightieth Birthday of My Father-in-law, Mr. Shen Xinqing

— Jia Fengzhen

I have followed you for forty years. Every time I miss the past, I am very happy.

You are a bear and a tiger in your dreams. I am ashamed of being a chicken and a dog fairy.

Kuang Ding's fame is due to sparseness. (Zhang Zengzhen should not take the ministerial examination or become an official.)

Cao Can's career relies on salary transmission. (Zhen Longmen follows the old rules.)

His spirit is soaring to the sky. It is also a predestined relationship to bow your head when you see it.

The years are changing in the shade of the trees. It is like a fly attached to a foal.

The government opened up to participate in the new China. (In the new creation of the Republic of China, Li Tong was the Director of Civil Affairs of Jiangsu. Zhen once served as the Secretary of the Shanghai Resident of Su.)

The teaching of righteousness was accompanied by the ancient Beijing. (In the Xinhai year of the Emperor Xuantong, Zhen followed Zhang to Yanjing to attend the meeting of the Central Education Association of the Ministry of Education.)

The Dragon and Tiger Wind and Cloud sneered at the persuasion of progress. Asia and Europe resisted the alliance. (Resisting Hongxian did not join the Alliance, which Zhen strongly advocated, and Zhang praised and approved it.)

I don't think about following the trend, but I think about saving the country. I have won the name of the leader of the school. (The name of the school leader is listed with Zhang and Zhen. According to the English school leader, that is, an educator, Zhen is really not qualified.)

The quality is the same as that of Pu Liu Wang Qiu Ling. Fortunately, the eyes are always blue.

Admire the strange texts when you are young. Washing the beautiful sentences is also a good age.

Feiran educated three thousand sons. Indeed, the spirit is two hundred bottles. (Zhang's treasured objects)

The five religions have the same origin and respect Confucius alone. The old man stars in the Taiwan and Lai groups.

The white-haired knows each other and is still sincere. Confucius and Yan are happy to be in poverty.

Xie Lan has a good fortune to spare. Zhang is planting trees in Jiang Yun and cherishes the old people.

The time is more than three immortals and Buddhas. The books are the relatives of ten thousand volumes of saints and sages.

I often hear the five songs of Jiu Ru. I look forward to seeing the rare treasures when the time comes.

### What I Know About Mr. Shen Xinqing

— Bai Jiao

One morning in the early summer of the 18th year of the Republic of China, I met Mr. Shen Xinqing for the first time at the Humanities Library in Xiaotaoyuan Lane through the introduction of Huang Ren Lao. "Serious and strong" was his first impression of me.

The Humanities Library was transformed and expanded from the Jiazi Society, and was initiated by Mr. Shen and his friends, as was the Jiazi Society, and it is the predecessor of the current Hongying Library. Mr. Shen is punctual in his work every day, and there is no backlog of work, 20 years as one day.

Mr. Shen's spirit of doing things lies in "not being sloppy" and "calmness". Mr. Pan Yangyao recorded the parallel events of the former Mr. and encouraged himself and others with the two words "not sloppy". He said that "When he was in charge of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association in the past, when dealing with official documents, even if there was a mistake in one word, he had to correct it before it was over, and he tried his best to prevent the clerks from being sloppy, and he always said that once the pen and ink were sloppy, he would know that the person was rough and playful in doing things." That's right, Mr. Shen wrote a note casually, and he wrote it home with every stroke, and he was never sloppy.

In the second year of the Republic of China, when Mr. Shen was the Secretary of Civil Affairs, the Nanjing Governor's Office was besieged by Huang Xing. At that time, the general staff members lost their minds when they heard the police, but Mr. Shen still routinely looked at 200 official affairs! That kind of calmness shows Mr. Shen's seriousness, strength and unsluggishness.

Mr. Shen is not willing to let go of time casually. He engages in writing after his official business. He either does not release his hand from the book or his pen does not stop waving. On the road, Mr. Shen sat in the car, holding the book with both hands, and Wang Fu looked just like a "Wen Chang". He attaches importance to practice and believes in Confucius' spirit of knowing that it is impossible to do it. He said in the chapter of Zhongyong Road is not far from people: "Words and deeds are often said to be the same." Beginners should start from this. He also said that the most important point of Zhongyong and University is the word "sincerity". The most important thing in establishing sincerity is the word "self-discipline". He also said that the university "He is the servant of the villain who does good for the country" should be read as a sentence. The villain who does good should be read as five words in a row. Doing good is like doing good. This is especially unprecedented. Because Guang Sheng is proficient in elementary school, he has this discovery and gets this clear and precise Huo interpretation. His academic thoughts are all derived from Confucianism, but they are different from the so-called "Taoism". He is very funny. He loves young people to talk about all kinds of issues, and he always encourages and guides the younger generation, and he is tireless in teaching people. He never admits that he is old. After the age of seventy, he still does not have a white hair on his head. He took Lao Tzu's words "Like an infant who has not yet grown up" and carved a "square seal", and also called himself Ruo Ying.

Mr. Shen's learning is deep in the exegesis and textual research of the Book of Changes. He has written two monographs, History of Yi Learning and Current Interpretation of Place Names in Spring and Autumn. Of course, these two monographs are remarkable. I remember that my friend Mr. Gu Qiaoruo wanted to publish the latter one for Mr. Shen, but he repeatedly asked Mr. Shen. Mr. Shen said: "I am afraid that there are still some inappropriate things. I have to revise it and dare not publish it immediately." From this, we can see Mr. Shen's serious attitude towards writing. Mr. Shen's poetic interest is especially good after the age of sixty, and he writes more poems. When a poem is completed, he always comes to me, "Think about it, please change it." The humble attitude of the old generation is really unattainable.

Mr. Shen's calligraphy started with Liu, and later he learned Wang. But in everyone's opinion, his regular script turns out to be like Lu Gong's breath. Mr. Shen's method of practicing calligraphy is to turn the big into the small and the small into the big. In terms of compiling couplets, there are stone classics, Preface to the Orchid Pavilion, Tao, Du, Li Changji, poems of various schools, and Song Ci, etc., totaling hundreds of pairs.

Mr. Shen does not drink alcohol or smoke. His hobbies are porcelain and calligraphy and painting. It is said that Mr. Shen's first virtue, Mr. Xiangzhi, had a rich collection of ancient porcelain, calligraphy and famous paintings, but they were all robbed by the vanguard of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Now Mr. Shen has a collection of 200 exquisite porcelain bottles, so he named his studio 200 bottles. There are also many calligraphy and paintings. In this regard, there are also two kinds of writings, Porcelain Record and Calligraphy and Painting Record.

Mr. Shen usually pays attention to health preservation. He does 15 minutes of gymnastics every day. From the age of 50 to more than 70, he has not interrupted for more than 20 years. He is very cautious about the weather and the warmth. Every day when he goes to the Hongying Library, we often see him in and out of the car, always carrying a white bag with him. He always wants to look at the thermometer as the standard for him to change clothes.

Mr. Shen's actions are not sloppy, his writing is respectful, and he pays attention to health preservation, so he has become his "longevity phase".

Mr. Shen succeeded Mr. Yuan Guanlan as the head of the Hongying Library. Hongying has been one of the top libraries in Shanghai, with a collection of more than 150,000 volumes, 320,000 to 30,000 pieces of various case references, and more than 1.8 million pieces of historical materials. The average number of monthly readers is 800 to 900 people. However, in terms of funding, in recent years, due to the change of the monetary system, it has been quite exhausted, so Mr. Shen hopes to increase funding every day. June 1st this year is his 80th birthday, but Mr. Shen absolutely does not advocate celebrating his birthday in his life; the elites from all walks of life in the city, because Mr. Shen's morality and articles are admired by the world, and on this occasion of great celebration, there must be a memorial, so they launched a public view, taking Mr. Shen's ambition as his ambition, moving the guests to the wine, and taking the library as a fund to fill the library, to live a long life and leave a long-lasting memorial. This is how Mr. Shen got his consent, so Mr. Shen is eighty and is celebrating for the first time!
