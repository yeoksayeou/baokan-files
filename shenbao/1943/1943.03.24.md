### Improving and Elevating National Culture

This newspaper, in its daily discussions of the path to nation-building through participation in the war, has sincerely offered advice from the perspectives of politics, diplomacy, and economics, with the enrichment of the people and the strengthening of the nation as the central tenets, hoping to attract the attention of the people and the adoption of the authorities. However, to achieve national prosperity and strength, we must also improve and elevate the cultural lives of the general populace.

Our nation's culture was developed earliest, with brilliant civilization and verifiable history. However, since the Han and Tang dynasties, it has gradually stagnated. The main reason for this is that the literati either indulge in empty talk, focus solely on literary research, or are obsessed with the subtle mysteries of human nature and principle. Moreover, they are either stubbornly clinging to a narrow view, completely isolated from real society, or clinging to outdated customs and engaging in endless disputes between sects and factions, knowing only people, not objects, and even less about things. As for the general trends of the world, the national economy, and the hardships of the people, few care to study them. Furthermore, the general population is excluded from the "the people may be made to follow it, they may not be made to understand it" cultural confinement. Consequently, the extremes of corruption prevail, people are empty and superficial, and the nation is weak and the people are poor. Since the advocacy of the new education, superficial scholars have often scorned ancient culture, indulging in European and American trends without knowing how to seek truth from facts. As a result, the high volume of education only teaches people how to seek employment and make a living. Moreover, due to the habit of hypocrisy and superficiality for thousands of years, what is valued are factions and qualifications, and what is sought is social interaction and perfunctory action. As for the scientific spirit of modern culture, they only pick up scraps, flaunting the superficial appearance, and in reality, those who truly engage in practical research are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Therefore, some people say, "The new education has been running for decades, and the result is a complete failure." However, relying solely on the old Chinese national spirit, or so-called "inherent morality," to gain a foothold in the future new world is absolutely impossible. Therefore, we loudly proclaim the revitalization of culture and further propose the idea of "improving and elevating national culture."

In order to improve and elevate national culture, we advocate that future education (certainly not limited to school education) should, on the one hand, fully maintain the historical national personality cultivation and moral character, in order to promote and enhance the Eastern Asian spirit of righteousness, or the so-called Eastern national cultural. On the other hand, we must earnestly promote science education, starting from the root, correcting the piecemeal methods of the past. Starting from children's education, we should strive to instill scientific thinking, so that young people not only aspire to be good people, but also know how to do good deeds; not only aspire to be good citizens, but also know how to practice it. From our research on Chinese history, we dare to assert that, with the genius of the Chinese people, many scientists and entrepreneurs will inevitably emerge to build a new country and jointly defend Greater East Asia with friendly nations. Secondly, since the Song Dynasty, due to successive troubles and the lack of capable people in the court, not only did culture stagnate, but also the physical strength of the people gradually declined. The court had a mind for temporary peace, and the people lacked lofty ambitions. If we want to establish ourselves in the new era and become one of the defenders of East Asia, we should cultivate a large number of healthy, hard-working, brave, and enterprising young people as early as possible, sweep away the mood of pessimism and despair, as well as the habits of decadence and lethargy, and revive the great aspirations of our Chinese nation, so as to be worthy of being children of Greater East Asia in the new era. After Germany's defeat in World War I, primary schools across the country unanimously promoted physical education to correct the unhealthy physique of students. The Japanese people have been subjected to strict militaristic education since childhood, and over the decades, the health of the people has developed daily, and their stature has also gradually become taller. Today, one is invincible in Europe, and the other soars in East Asia, which is by no means accidental. If our people continue to face this increasingly tense world of life competition with weak bodies and depressed spirits, not only will we be ashamed to speak of participating in the war, but also our future prospects will be fraught with unimaginable dangers. We sincerely hope that our national economy can gradually improve in the future, the people's lives can be guaranteed, and that in addition to national education, cultivating personality, and promoting science, we will also work hard on maternal education and other aspects of research, in order to improve the physical fitness of the people and cultivate the spirit and physique of "shouldering the responsibility of morality with iron shoulders."

Improving and elevating national culture is the most powerful guarantee for participating in the war today and building the nation in the future, and it is also the basic task of enriching the people and strengthening the nation. We sincerely hope that the people of the country will work together to achieve it. And most importantly, it must be universal, so that the majority of the people can benefit from cultural education, and not be limited to the children of a few special classes.

### Rapidly Deteriorating German-Soviet War Situation

The new operation of the German army centered on Kharkov is succeeding step by step. Since the tragedy of Stalingrad, the Red Army has successively abandoned Rostov, retreated from Voroshilovgrad, Kharkov, Kursk and other important strongholds, and followed behind the German army with the slogan "Give the enemy a bigger blow," gradually advancing westward. But now it seems that this is just a coincidence. Because the retreat of the German army was due to strategic requirements. The German army, which once abandoned the Donbas industrial area between Rostov and Kharkov, suddenly launched a fierce counterattack in this area. The goal was first to recapture Kharkov. The Red Army's solid defense positions were successively broken through by the German army, causing great damage everywhere. At the end of February, the military strongholds of Lozovaya, Kramatorskaya, and Krasnoarmeysk were already occupied by the German army, and finally broke into the city of Kharkov, occupying its city center on the 12th.

The Red Army's intention on the southern front was originally to recapture from the German army the most important industrial area of the Soviet Union from Donbas to Kharkov, drive the German forces west of the Dnieper River, and occupy the base for launching a counterattack. If the German army in this area were indeed driven west of the river, then the German bases from Crimea to the Caucasus would also be in danger. Therefore, it would be very difficult to wait until spring to launch a counterattack. However, the Red Army's plan did not come to fruition. The battle on the upper reaches of the Donets River from Kharkov to Izyum is still continuing, and the progress of the war cannot be easily predicted. According to foreign dispatches, the total strength of the German army in this area is 25 divisions, of which 12 divisions are elite troops newly arrived from the Western Front. Compared with the Red Army, which has been exhausted by repeated fierce battles and relentless pursuit since last year, the German army obviously has more vigorous combat power.

As for the German army on the northern and central fronts, it has already abandoned Kutetsk and Vyazma west of Moscow. If the German army's goal is to capture Moscow, the old nest of the Bolsheviks, then securing this line may be necessary, but the German army is not anxious about this. The German army has already stated that the goal of this year's operation is to destroy the Red Army's combat power. Therefore, the retreat in this area can also be regarded as being based on the requirements of the overall operation. The winter in Eastern Europe has not yet passed, and from the point of view of the climate, the German army is still plagued by unfavorable conditions. Even so, the German army's counterattack has already achieved considerable results. On the southern front, the German army occupies a completely active position, and there are no signs of unease in the defense of Crimea. In the lower reaches of the Kuban River in the North Caucasus, it is fighting heroically with friendly forces to resist the Red Army's fierce counterattack. From the perspective of the Soviet army, this is a powerful reality that brightens the future.

The prudent and solid preparations recently expressed by the German high command cannot but be noted. The German army has always adopted quantitative war methods, but now it is transforming into ensuring both quality and quantity at the same time, in order to crush the Red Army's massive numbers. The three countries along the Baltic Sea and the occupied territories in the Balkans are also engaged in strengthening reserve forces, expanding production capacity, and resolutely implementing large-scale human mobilization, but the people are not allowed to be optimistic about the future of the war. Minister of Propaganda Goebbels once instructed the people, "It is wiser to give the enemy too high an evaluation of their combat power than to give them too low an evaluation." From this, we can see the true determination. How this determination is reflected on the front line will be seen in the future. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Daily News on March 15)

### Japan-Germany-Italy Mixed Commission Holds Meeting in Tokyo to Discuss Joint Operations and Other Issues, and the Three Countries Have Completely Reached a Consensus

Tokyo, March 23 (Central News Agency) The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 10 p.m. on the 22nd that the Mixed Commission established under the Japan-Germany-Italy Tripartite Pact has held meetings from time to time in the past. This time, it was decided to hold a meeting with a new lineup at the official residence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo on the 22nd. Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani, Italian Ambassador Indelli, Soviet Ambassador Stahmer, general members such as officials from various relevant departments of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and military members such as military attachés from the Japanese Army and Navy, Germany and Italy, put forward agreements on various important issues concerning the cooperation of Japan, Germany and Italy against the common enemy. The views of the three countries have completely converged.

Tokyo, March 23 (Central News Agency) The Japan-Germany-Italy Mixed Expert Committee held a meeting here yesterday. Relevant officials from each country fully exchanged views on various issues concerning the cooperation of Japan, Germany and Italy in building a new world order in which all nations get what they deserve, especially on various important issues concerning the cooperation of the three countries against the common enemies Britain and the United States. The meeting was filled with a friendly and sincere atmosphere of cooperation among the three countries from beginning to end. The views of the three countries have completely converged and great results have been achieved. The Japan-Germany-Italy Mixed Expert Committee was established in accordance with the Tripartite Pact signed by Japan, Germany and Italy in September of the 15th year of Showa (1940 in the Republican calendar). Since then, the committee has held meetings from time to time in Tokyo, Berlin or Rome, making great contributions to promoting cooperation among the three countries. However, this meeting was still held on the occasion of the arrival of the new German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, and in order to adapt to the current situation, so as to promote the close cooperative relationship among the three countries. Although Britain, the United States and other countries have held meetings many times, they have ultimately failed due to the ambiguity and inconsistency of their war aims or conflicts of interest, resulting in no effect from the meetings. However, the common war aims of Japan, Germany and Italy are extremely clear, grasping the common goal of building a new world order that guarantees permanent world peace and justice, and in order to achieve this goal, the three countries have always been in complete agreement on mutual cooperation, and have achieved brilliant war results and are steadily moving towards the realization of their common goal.

Tokyo, March 23 (Haitong News Agency) The Japan-Germany-Italy Committee held a meeting here yesterday in accordance with the provisions of the Tripartite Pact.

Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki, Army Minister Tojo, and Navy Minister Shimada represented Japan, German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer represented Germany, and Italian Ambassador to Japan Indelli represented Italy. The naval, army, and air force attachés of Germany and Italy also attended the meeting. The procedures discussed included the construction of a new world order and the issue of joint operations.

### Japanese Newspaper Comments on the Recovery of the Legation Quarter in Beijing

Tokyo, March 23 (Central News Agency) Today, the newspapers here all published articles discussing the significance of our country's recovery of the Legation Quarter in Beijing. The Asahi Shimbun commented that the implementation of the provisions for China's recovery of the Legation Quarter in Beijing was signed yesterday in Nanjing. The passion of the friendly Chinese people to strive for the liberation of their motherland will surely be further enhanced by the signing of the provisions. Moreover, the measure was appropriately decided at the time of the visit of the head of Bhamo, Myanmar, to our country, so it has special significance and is sufficient to prove our country's sincerity in fulfilling its promises as soon as possible. This has a profound and far-reaching psychological impact on the people of Myanmar, who are about to gain independence this year. Today, the spirit of cooperation between China and Japan is fully displayed in mutual trust. We firmly believe that our country's return of the Legation Quarter in Beijing will not only have a good impact on friendly China and Myanmar, but will also have a great impact on the aggregation of the total strength of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. The Mainichi Shimbun commented that Japan's return of concessions and abolition of extraterritorial rights in China has enabled China to realize the integrity of sovereignty that it has sought for many years. Japan's purpose in the Sino-Japanese Incident is only to make China abandon its resistance to Japan and conspire with Japan to coexist and prosper, and to seek China's stability and prosperity. Therefore, Japan adopted the general principle of not demanding compensation or ceding land, and placed the policy of handling the Sino-Japanese Incident on the construction of a new East Asian order and the inseparable relationship between the two countries. The Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty was concluded based on this general policy. After the National Government participated in the war, our country, based on the treaty, signed the detailed provisions for returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights with China, and has been gradually putting them into practice. All of this is a manifestation of Japan's great moral spirit. The United Kingdom, the United States, and Chongqing are indeed deeply shocked by this, and the slanderers of Japan have made their war aims even more meaningless. Moreover, it is not easy for Japan to take this measure, and there are also great sacrifices. However, it has now overcome all difficulties and is assisting friendly China in its development, which can be said to be a manifestation of Japan's great spirit towards the entire Greater East Asia. We firmly believe that the National Government will be guaranteed by Japan's spirit of "doing what it says" and will increase its courage. Its great movement for peace and prosperity in Asia will also be more strongly advanced as a result. At the same time, it will also use its total strength to defeat the nameless division of Yu Jiang.

Prime Minister Tojo Hosts a Banquet for Ba Maw

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo hosted a banquet for the head of Burma, Ba Maw, and his delegation at the Prime Minister's official residence at 6:00 PM today. On the host's side, Prime Minister Tojo, various cabinet ministers, and cabinet advisors such as Yuki, Fujiwara, and Yamashita, as well as over ninety people including Kido, Suzuki, Vice Chairman of the Privy Council, and Matsudaira, attended. Prime Minister Tojo first delivered a welcome speech, followed by a thank-you speech by the head of Burma, Ba Maw, who expressed his determination to strive to build a new Burma. The banquet concluded at approximately 8:00 PM.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Speaking at a banquet in honor of Ba Maw tonight, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo said, in essence: "I have long expressed my respect for your courageous struggles against the shackles of British rule for many years. On December 8th of the year before last, Japan resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, and the Japanese army advanced with irresistible force, liberating Burma from British bondage and opening the path to the construction of a new Burma. During this time, I have deeply believed that the domination of the world by Britain and the United States will inevitably collapse, and that Japan's determination to build a new order is unwavering. I hereby reiterate my respect for your courage and insight. As we gather here tonight to converse with guests who have come from afar, the soldiers of the Japanese army continue to wage fierce battles to defeat Britain and the United States in the land, sea, and air across thousands of miles. This is sufficient proof that Japan is not only striving to carry out military operations, but has also begun to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Although Britain and the United States have repeatedly made false propaganda, in fact, under the protection of the valiant Japanese army, the Greater East Asia region, whether in terms of people, goods, or ideas, has begun to exchange freely and safely, so as to gradually complete the great task of building the Greater East Asia region. I am deeply convinced that during your current travels, you have gained a thorough understanding of this situation. Every time I think of the Burmese people standing on the front line of bombing raids as pioneers in building the Co-Prosperity Sphere and as defenders of Greater East Asia, without timidity and with even greater determination, united under wise leadership to build a new Burma, my courage is redoubled. At present, Japan's cooperation with its allied nations is becoming increasingly close, and the East and West are echoing each other, continuing to fight bravely towards the construction of a new world. Japan's determination to overcome any difficulties and thoroughly eliminate the root causes of disturbance to world peace is as solid as iron. I firmly believe that our war against Britain and the United States, based on justice, will undoubtedly be victorious. You are the wise leaders of the new Burma, and I deeply hope that you will understand Japan's unwavering determination and firmly believe in striving to build a better Asia and a better world, so as to fulfill the lofty responsibility for humanity."

### Fierce Fighting Underway on Both Tunisian Borders; Axis Forces Defend Mareth Line

German Supreme Headquarters, 23rd (Haitong Agency) - This afternoon's German military report stated that fierce fighting continues in southern and central Tunisia. Our forces have counterattacked, and enemy forces have been repelled in several locations. German aircraft are assisting Axis forces elsewhere to firmly defend their positions and engage the enemy.

Stockholm, 23rd (Haitong Agency) - "The Swedish Daily News' London correspondent reports that it is rumored here that British operations on the Mareth Line last weekend were quite successful. The American Third Division bypassed the Axis forces' positions from the rear. British military commanders hope that there will be a decisive battle in Tunisia this week. As for whether General Rommel is prepared to defend this line, or whether he took advantage of the favorable weather conditions last week to withdraw the majority of his troops, it is impossible for outsiders to speculate. Perhaps the actions of the German forces will be known in a day or two."

Bern, 23rd (Central News Agency) - General Montgomery has begun to use the full strength of his army and air force to attack the Axis forces' defenses along the Mareth Line, ending the period of preparation and probing in the Tunisian theater and beginning a frontal assault. News from Berlin also states that the battle is a major one, and that there is fierce fighting along the eastern and western borders of Tunisia. All frontal attacks by British forces on the Mareth Line have been repelled by German and Italian forces. German forces are adopting a defensive posture in the south and central regions, while maintaining the initiative in the north, launching another attack on Sunday. Cairo admits that Axis forces have occupied the Nifsa train station, approximately two miles northwest of Gafsa. British forces have retreated, and fighting is ongoing. The British Eighth Army's attack is being carried out along the six-mile front between the Mediterranean Sea and the main coastal highway from Medenine to Mareth village. At the same time, the American Fifth Army is repeatedly attacking eastward towards Maknassy and El Guettar, hoping to join forces with the British desert troops east of Jebel Er Remili. Between the coast and the Matmata Mountains, infantry of the British Eighth Army, assisted by powerful tank units, are attacking Axis positions. Further inland to the west, light British units are attempting to outflank the Axis outposts of the Matmata Mountains from the southwest, which are currently hindering the British advance. There is fierce fighting in several areas of the front. According to German sources, light British units attempting to attack the flank of the Axis line from El Hamma have been repelled. In several areas, Axis forces are firmly defending their positions, while in other areas they have been ordered not to engage the Allied forces and to retreat to more advantageous positions in the rear.

Second Stage of War Now Fully Underway

Berlin, 23rd (Haitong Agency) - The current fighting in Tunisia is extremely fierce. The Allied general offensive did not begin on the 21st; it was launched a week ago. At that time, British infantry had already advanced on the coastal section of the Mareth Line but failed to achieve their objectives. Montgomery then reorganized his troops. This offensive was not launched solely by the British Eighth Army; the American Fifth Army also coordinated its attack. At this time, on the 17th of this month, General Patton's troops also moved towards Gafsa, seemingly with the intention of drawing General Rommel into an attack. However, General Rommel did not fall for this ploy, and the first stage of the battle ended. The Allied forces then launched an offensive along the entire line, commencing the second stage of the battle on the 21st. The British Eighth Army launched a full-scale attack on the Mareth Line, fiercely assaulting the German-Italian joint forces' positions in the coastal area and between the Matmata Mountains. The mobile units of the British Eighth Army also attacked the flank of the Matmata Mountains. At the same time, General Patton also ordered the American Fifth Army to coordinate in the operation, advancing towards Maknassy and Gabes. The British First Army in northern Tunisia is still taking a defensive posture, but there is no doubt that it will also take action.

Bern, 22nd (Havas Agency) - In southern Tunisia, repeated attacks by the British Eighth Army on the Mareth Line have been repelled by German forces. General Rommel's forces are holding this line firmly. The North African Allied Forces Headquarters announced today that British forces launched an offensive along the Metouia to Mareth line, preceded by heavy bombing of the Mareth Line's defenses. However, the British side admits that the Eighth Army's offensive has encountered determined resistance from the enemy. The situation in the southern sector is not yet fully clear, but it is reported that the weather has been clear in recent days, the ground is dry, and armored vehicles can pass without hindrance. According to Berlin news, Axis forces have repelled the British forces. A communique issued from Rome states that Allied forces have launched fierce offensives in southern and central Tunisia, and fierce fighting is underway. According to both Allied and Axis sources, the American Fifth Army, north of the Mareth Line, launched an offensive simultaneously with the British Eighth Army, advancing towards Maknassy, apparently seeking to establish contact with the British forces east of Tébessa. According to Allied front-line news, American forces are attempting to advance along three routes: the first from the recently occupied Allied city of El Guettar, advancing southeast along the Gabes highway; the second along a small road; and the third attempting to advance towards the Mediterranean Sea. After occupying the Senad Station, American forces are currently advancing along the Senad River, advancing north along the highway to Maknassy. British and American air forces are concentrating their attacks on the Mareth Line. German and Italian aircraft are quite active on the front lines, bombing the ports of Bône and Bizerte, as well as shipping outside the port of Algiers. Italian aircraft sank a 10,000-ton merchant ship.

### German Offensive on Eastern Front Shifts to Kursk Region; Soviet Forces Continue to Pressure Central Sector, Attempt to Take Smolensk

German Supreme Headquarters, 23rd (Haitong Agency) - This afternoon's German military report stated that German forces west of Kursk, regardless of the difficult terrain, are vigorously counterattacking and making progress. Soviet forces are putting up stubborn resistance, but have been unable to stop the German advance. South of Lake Ladoga, Soviet forces again attempted to attack yesterday, leading to fierce fighting, but were ultimately defeated. Elsewhere on the Eastern Front, there are only localized battles. In January of this year, Soviet forces launched a major offensive from both the north and south simultaneously in the Orel region, attempting to cut off the connection between German forces in the region. However, due to the effective and unyielding response of the German forces, they were unsuccessful. As a result of eight weeks of intense fighting, 10,593 Soviet soldiers were captured, and over 15,000 enemy soldiers were killed. In addition, 1,061 tanks, 485 artillery pieces, and many other types of military equipment were lost.

Berlin, 23rd (Haitong Agency) - The west bank of the Donets River, from Chuguev to east of Belgorod, has been secured by German forces. The German offensive has now shifted to the Kursk region in order to coordinate with the fighting in the north. The roads in the war zone are becoming increasingly muddy, and Soviet resistance has also increased. However, the German advances southwest and northwest of Kursk have been quite successful. There is currently fierce fighting in the Sychevka region, and the enemy is gradually showing signs of being unable to withstand the pressure. The city itself is still in German hands. The Soviet command is transferring reinforcements to Kursk from the Mius Front and the central Donets, but they are being bombed by the German Air Force en route, resulting in the loss of a large number of vehicles. The Soviet offensive on the southern section of the Orel line has ceased, likely due to fear of encirclement. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, Soviet forces are continuing to put pressure on the German defenses west and southwest of Vyazma, but have not achieved any significant results. Fighting in the Ilmen Lake region over the weekend was limited to localized operations. A large-scale offensive launched by enemy forces in the Leningrad region was also unsuccessful.

### German Planes Attack Britain

Stockholm, 23rd (Haitong Agency) - London announced today that German planes attacked the northeast coast of Britain last night, causing considerable damage on the ground.

Berlin, 23rd (Haitong Agency) - Responsible sources announced that no British planes flew into German territory last night. German planes attacked a port on the east coast of Britain last night, resulting in three planes not returning to base.

Berlin, 23rd (Haitong Agency) - Authoritative sources report that British and American planes attacked the northwest coast of Germany yesterday afternoon. German planes took to the air to respond, shooting down four bombers. Bombs dropped from high altitude, destroying many residential houses, and causing casualties among residents.

Japanese Public Opinion

### Prime Minister Tojo's Visit to Nanjing

Part One

General Tojo, Prime Minister and concurrently Minister of the Army, visited Nanjing on the 13th to personally confer with the leaders of the National Government, including Chairman Wang Jingwei, and to inspect the local stationed agencies. He returned to Japan on the 15th. The Prime Minister's overseas visit during wartime is not only a noteworthy special case, but also, considering the current state of Japanese-Chinese relations, his visit to China carries extremely great significance. We have high expectations for its results.

Since China's participation in the war, Japanese-Chinese relations have been intertwined in life and death. A genuine unity has been formed through the resolute shared intention to complete the Greater East Asia War. One of the cornerstones of Japan's new policy toward China is to restore China's autonomy and independence. Progress in this regard relies on the unchanging fundamental spirit since the Konoe Statement. The return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritoriality, the transfer of enemy property to the National Government for management, and other new measures are being implemented based on this fundamental spirit. The Chinese government also understands Japan's sincerity and is cooperating to defeat Britain and the United States.

Upon Prime Minister Tojo's return to Fukuoka on the 15th, Japan further declared that, to adapt to the future development of Japanese-Chinese relations, it is determined to re-examine existing agreements in accordance with the aforementioned principles. Japan's policy toward China is based on the East Asian consciousness common to both peoples, establishing a bond of comradeship. After the Prime Minister's visit to China, there is no doubt that the Chinese people, from top to bottom, will have a more thorough understanding of this. At the same time, with the firm establishment of the integrated Japanese-Chinese relationship being clarified to both domestic and foreign audiences, the Chongqing regime's justification for resistance will increasingly lose its foundation. (Translated from the editorial of the Western Asahi Shimbun on March 16th)

Part Two

Prime Minister Tojo, amidst his busy wartime state affairs, departed from Tokyo on the 12th, visited Nanjing, the capital of the National Government, and returned to Japan via Shanghai on the 15th. As announced by the Information Bureau, the Prime Minister's visit to China was to reciprocate Chairman Wang's visit to Japan at the end of last year, to express respect for the National Government's participation in the war, and to communicate opinions with the National Government leaders who are now standing on the common front of the Greater East Asia War.

However, I believe that this visit by the Prime Minister has even greater significance. First, although there have been previous instances of a Prime Minister visiting foreign territories, such as Prime Minister Ito's visits to Taiwan and Xiamen, and Prime Minister Saionji's trip to Manchuria, there has never been an instance of a Prime Minister visiting the capital of an allied nation standing on the same battle line, engaging in cordial and sincere talks with its head and other leaders under the gamble of the country's fortune in a decisive battle. From this, the firm intention of Japan in the Greater East Asia War can be conveyed to its ally China, and at the same time, it can greatly inspire the morale of the allied nation who took up arms, which is very effective.

Second, the Sino-Japanese relationship since the Konoe Statement has been completed in one fell swoop by the Prime Minister's visit to China, marking a milestone in determining the future Sino-Japanese relationship. According to historical facts, although there have been various opinions regarding Japan's policy toward China since the Meiji era, its consistent direction has remained firmly in place. One aspect of this is that Japan's policy and actions toward China have always been based on Japan's defense, which is clearly different from the aggressive policies and actions of Britain, the United States, and other European countries that have come to this distant East Asia. One of the characteristics of Japan's current policy toward China, which is distinctly different from other European and American countries, is that there is no attempt to seize Chinese territory and monopolize its economic interests, in other words, to carve up China and turn it into a semi-colony or dependency. On the contrary, Japan hopes that China will not be reduced to a permanently sleeping lion subjected to the scolding of European and American powers, but will instead become a powerful nation that refuses to be manipulated by Europe and America, and will join hands with Japan to protect Asia. The Konoe Statement, although issued during the Sino-Japanese Incident, also reflects this historical spirit of Japan's China policy, which respects China's independence. The subsequent Japan-China Basic Treaty is also the same. After China's participation in the war, Japan's return of concessions and abolition of extraterritoriality, the so-called transformation of its policy toward China, although a temporary measure during the chaos of war, is not a transformation in essence, but also in line with Japan's consistent historical direction. Since the Konoe Statement, Japan's respect for China's freedom and independence has been materialized through Japan's statements and actions, triggered by China's participation in the war, entering a landmark stage. In the future, it will only rely on Japan's guidance to await China's self-strengthening and self-reliance. Therefore, Prime Minister Tojo's visit to Nanjing at this time in his capacity as Prime Minister must be said to be of great significance.

Third, in his address to the Japanese military officers and civilians in Shanghai, Prime Minister Tojo mentioned the transformation of national policy, which had a great impact on the people on the front lines, and it is not known whether it may have put them in a difficult position. The government, out of sympathy, also appealed for unified cooperation. However, this visit to China hopes that the Japanese residents in such a major period of transformation will respect themselves and overcome the unavoidable frictions in the face of national policy, which also has a considerable effect. (Translated from the editorial of the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun on March 17th)

Part Three

Prime Minister Tojo visited Nanjing on the 13th and returned to Japan on the 15th. During the Prime Minister's stay, the "Detailed Agreement on the Return of Japanese Concessions in China" was signed.

Prime Minister Tojo, amidst his busy political affairs, personally visited Nanjing this time as a return visit to Chairman Wang's visit to Tokyo at the end of last year. At the same time, he expressed respect for the National Government's participation in the war and held frank and candid talks with the leaders of the National Government on strategies for jointly completing the war, and took the opportunity to inspect various dispatched agencies. The Prime Minister's stay in Nanjing and Shanghai was extremely short. His purpose of meeting with Chairman Wang and other leaders of the National Government, and talking with local military officers and civilians was fully accomplished.

On the 14th, while the Prime Minister was in Nanjing, the detailed agreement and supplementary understandings on the return of concessions, signed by Japanese and Chinese committee members, stipulated that all Japanese concessions in China would be formally returned to China on March 30th; the roads, bridges, and other structures within each concession would be transferred to China without compensation; and the National Government would recognize and respect the real estate and other rights and interests held by the Japanese government and its citizens within the concession areas. After the signing of this agreement, all Japanese concessions in China will be returned to China on March 30th, the anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. It has been more than forty years since concessions were established in China. It is the bridge for the development of Japanese people on the mainland, and the foundation for the activities of Japanese residents in China, which will soon disappear, and thinking about it cannot help but arouse infinite emotion. The return of these concessions is the first step in Japan's new policy toward China, and China's independence and sovereignty will be complete as a result, and Japanese-Chinese relations will become closer. Moreover, this move will allow local Japanese residents in China to enter a broad stage of activity from a narrow stage of activity, so it can be called a development dissolution. Japanese residents in China, considering the overall situation, cannot but welcome and celebrate together.

Although this is said, from the perspective of the local Japanese residents, the concessions are a paradise for settlement and also a second hometown. Therefore, there is considerable reason and sympathy for the statement that they may feel somewhat uneasy after the return of the concessions. The government authorities also feel the same way about this as we do. On his way back to Tokyo from Nanjing, Prime Minister Tojo also said in Fukuoka: "Especially for the Japanese residents in China, thinking about the many complex difficulties they will encounter due to the implementation of the new policy, a sense of sympathy arises spontaneously." He also said that detailed consideration will be given to future follow-up arrangements. The National Government authorities have also stated: "After the takeover, we will strive for excellence in operation and management, especially cherish the expatriate residents of your country, and protect their welfare." Therefore, we earnestly hope that the Japanese residents in China will fully trust the governments of Japan and China, overcome all difficulties, and cooperate in the implementation of the government's new policy toward China.

Prime Minister Tojo's visit to Nanjing and the decision on the details of the return of concessions are, needless to say, of extraordinary significance for the closer Japanese-Chinese relations and the joint completion of the war. However, the Japanese people should not have excessive expectations, thinking that these effects will be implemented immediately. As mentioned in the Prime Minister's speech, Chairman Wang Jingwei and other leaders of the National Government, as well as the general Chinese people, sincerely resonate with Japan's sincerity and hold the determination to live and die together. However, there are still many people in China who are confused by their dependence on Britain and the United States. In this regard, the Japanese side should resolutely eliminate all difficulties, thoroughly implement this new policy, to awaken the illusions of these people, and strive to strengthen the National Government. On the side of the National Government, they should sincerely understand Japan's sincerity, repay kindness with kindness, truly cherish the Japanese residents in China, and at the same time, in order to adapt to Japan's new policy, implement new facilities in various departments and grasp the hearts of the people under their rule. (Translated from the editorial of the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun on March 16th)

Return of Japanese Concessions

Regarding the return of Japanese concessions in China, based on established policy, the Japanese and Chinese governments have held several consultations since January, and the detailed agreement and supplementary matters were signed in Nanjing on the 14th, scheduled to be implemented on the 30th of this month.

This issue is a further confirmation of the Japan-China agreement signed when the Chinese government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9th of this year, adding new momentum to the Japan-China cooperation path based on the consistent Konoe Statement and the Japan-China Basic Treaty. The Japanese concessions stipulated to be returned in this agreement include Tianjin, Hankou, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shashi, Chongqing, Xiamen, and Fuzhou, which were entrusted to Japan based on the Treaty of Shimonoseki after the Sino-Japanese War and its additional agreements, and have a history of nearly half a century. The Sino-Japanese War could have brought about a significant rapprochement between the two major powers of East Asia, but unfortunately, it led to the European and American countries' contempt for the Qing Dynasty, promoting their aggression against China, which is an undeniable fact. As a result, the plan of European and American countries to colonize China was once completely successful. After the end of the First World War, the Anglo-Japanese Alliance expired, and they immediately instigated the alienation of Japan and China, and issued empty checks for the abolition of unequal treaties with China at the Washington Conference.

The Washington Treaty was not only a harsh constraint specifically aimed at Japan, but also, on the surface, the few points that seemed to be for China's sake had no real sincerity to make them happen. Regarding the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions, only after Japan took the lead in implementing them more than twenty years later did they make the same statement. However, this is also obviously a diplomatic means to contain Japan. The delivery of Japanese concessions that Japan is about to implement is completely different in meaning, proving that the two countries' life and death together is not just empty talk. The means of the British and American sides are still consistently deceitful, while Japan is a sincere disclosure. It is hoped that the Chinese officials and people will fully understand the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and the common stance taken by Japan and China on this path.

The concessions of various countries in China have been returned by Germany and the Soviet Union for a long time. Britain, the United States, and other enemy countries also announced their return in January of this year, following Japan. The friendly nations of Italy and France, in order to express their friendly attitude towards Japan and China, also followed suit one after another. The national face of the Republic of China can be proud because of the resolute decision of the Japanese side, which is truly cause for celebration.

However, the abolition of extraterritoriality must be premised on China having the substance of a rule-of-law country, and the return of concessions must also naturally respect the rights and interests of Japanese people in China, the safety of transactions, and ensure the freedom of residence and transfer. It is earnestly hoped that the Chinese government and people will further enhance their awareness and self-restraint as a unified nation. (Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun on March 16th)

### 500 Tons of Cooking Oil, in the Process of Payment and Delivery; Rickshaw Pullers Given Extra Rice; Household Rice for the Seventh Period Sold in Western Shanghai Starting Today

Since the implementation of the per capita distribution of cooking oil in this city by the Public Works Department, the distribution of cooking oil has not yet been realized because the Public Works Department and the Japanese Embassy Office have not been able to prepare adequately for various procedures. According to Mr. Yang Heqing of the Shanghai Cooking Oil Wholesale Processing Office, he told a Datong News Agency reporter that in view of the urgent need for cooking oil by the citizens, the office has decided to sell cooking oil according to the previous method before the per capita distribution of cooking oil. Currently, 500 tons of cooking oil have been issued by the military distribution authorities, and the payment procedures have been completed. Half of the oil has been loaded and unloaded in Shanghai, and is currently being processed for delivery. It is expected that the distribution will begin around the end of the month. At that time, the office will also announce the method of selling this cooking oil.

Foreigners Awaiting Oil Certificates

The sugar purchase certificates for foreigners in this port were issued by the rice purchase certificate issuing offices in various districts during the past week, along with the bread certificates for April and May. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the food administration authorities have already printed the oil purchase certificates for foreigners, but they will not be issued in the near future. According to a per capita oil distribution for foreigners, because there is no sense of urgent need, its implementation period must wait at least until the method of Chinese people purchasing oil with oil purchase certificates is implemented once before it will begin.

Grain Department Pays Attention to Cooking Oil Supply

The supply of cooking oil in this city has been interrupted for more than a month, causing the black market price of cooking oil to rise even further. The Grain Department believes that cooking oil is also one of the main daily food items for the people, and is of great importance to the entire food supply. Therefore, it has specially prepared a survey form. In addition to investigating the production and sales of rapeseed, the raw material for oil production, it has recently investigated the factories and workshops that manufacture cooking oil in various places, ordering the local grain administration bureaus to report in detail for review and approval.

Rickshaw Pullers Receive Extra Rice

The Rickshaw Pullers' Guild in this port was previously allocated extra rice by the Public Works Department Rice and Grain Office, six liters per person per month, with the selling price the same as household rice. It is heard that the second phase of the distribution application form has been issued, and the rickshaw owners are currently collecting it from the guild. The purchase period is set to begin on April 1st.

Household Rice in Western Shanghai: 2.4 Liters

The seventh period of household rice distribution in the Western Shanghai district, totaling 5,650 bags, has been processed for delivery by the first industry allocation association of the district public distribution office. It is scheduled to begin selling at 9:00 a.m. today (the 24th) in the first and second wards by 55 rice shops simultaneously. According to the regulations of the Municipal Grain Administration Bureau, each person can purchase 2.5 liters of rice with a ticket. However, according to a Datong News Agency reporter, the 5,650 bags of rice allocated this time have an average quantity of less than 1.25 shi (石) per bag due to broken bags and small bags. Therefore, at that time, each person can purchase 2.4 liters of whole rice with a ticket at the designated rice shop. The price is 6.05 yuan in legal tender.

False Household Registration, Fraudulent Collection of Rations

The Municipal Food Administration Bureau believes that the accuracy of household registration in each district is of great importance to the thoroughness of the per capita grain distribution in the city. In order to promote the fairness and completeness of grain distribution, it has repeatedly sent personnel to the Nanshi area to conduct spot checks on household registration in the district to prevent abuses. Since its implementation, it has been found that 30 households have falsely reported household registration and fraudulently collected rations, and there is solid evidence. After learning about this, the bureau will severely punish and deal with them separately in order to rectify grain administration and deter others from following suit.

Category A Sugar Merchants Should Fill Out Reports

The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office has separately reviewed and decided on the Category A retail sugar stores. In accordance with the instructions of the Public Works Department, the Category A retail sugar stores are required to fill out a report form after collecting 100 sugar purchase certificates and submit it to the Public Works Department for review with the sugar purchase certificates attached to the report form. The report forms have been printed and are available for purchase from the office at 80 cents per sheet. Each Category A retail sugar store should purchase report forms according to the amount of sugar they sell and complete the reporting procedures.

### Issuance of Municipal Residence Certificates, Deadline Approaching, No Extension Will Be Granted After the Deadline

Regarding the issuance period of municipal residence certificates, after the police headquarters extended the deadline to the end of this month and the various districts extended the deadline to the end of June this year, no further extension will be granted at that time. However, it has been found that those who apply for and receive certificates in the urban areas these days are extremely crowded. The Yimiao police station, with the deadline approaching, specially dispatched police officers to inform every household in its jurisdiction yesterday. Citizens who have not yet applied for and received residence certificates should not wait and see any longer. They must know that once the deadline is over, the issuance will be stopped and no extension will be granted. At the same time, it also ordered the personnel of various household registration offices to speed up the filling and issuance without delay.

### Aquatic Products Administration, etc., Transferred to Jurisdiction, Grain Department Sends Personnel to Take Over

In order to implement the wartime system, the National Government ordered the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to transfer the Agricultural Improvement Zones, the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute, the Aquatic Products Administration, and the Sino-Japanese joint venture Central China Aquatic Products Company, etc., under its jurisdiction to the Grain Department for unified command and to benefit the meritorious order. It is heard that the Grain Department has recently sent personnel to take over and consulted the Shanghai Municipal Government for verification.

Commentary

### Strengthening the Purchasing Power of Central Reserve Bonds

How to strengthen the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bonds has become a common demand of the people in Central China. Only after the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bonds is enhanced can general prices be low and stable, the lives of the masses be stable, the order of the rear can be maintained, the production of materials can be increased, and final victory can be assured.

There are various opinions on the specific strategies to strengthen the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bonds, but one basic principle cannot be ignored, that is, the psychological belief of the public in Central Reserve Bonds must be stabilized and consolidated. Recently, Mayor Chen said at the inaugural meeting of the National Commercial Control Association: "Now that free trade has been changed to a controlled economy, the psychology of the people also needs to be corrected. The rise in prices is due to the psychology of looking high, hoping to control others and indulge oneself, but how can one control others if one indulges oneself? The economic level is high for all or low for all, and there is no reason for this to be high and that to be low, or this to be low and that to be high. Therefore, the people must get rid of the past psychology of looking high." This can be said to be a brilliant statement.

Recently, the Central Reserve Bank established a council of advisors, whose duties are to advise on the improvement of bank operations and on economic and financial policy matters. If the council can further check the issuance of the Central Reserve Bank on a monthly basis and announce it to the world, then the public's doubts about currency inflation can be eliminated, and the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bonds can be greatly strengthened in the future, and prices can be lowered steadily.

Therefore, all merchants have received notifications from their associations to follow the regulations and register in order to facilitate the movement of goods.

### Mongolia-Central China Trade Conference to Be Held in Shanghai Starting on the 25th

Zhangjiakou Electric: The Mongolia-Central China Trade Conference is scheduled to be held in Shanghai for three days starting on the 25th of this month to review the Mongolia-Central China trade plan for the 32nd year of the Republic of China. The Mongolia side will be attended by Chief Niyama of the Finance Section of the Embassy, Chief Nakano of the Trade Section, and Chief Kataoka of the Finance Section. The delegation is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 20th.

Regarding the Mongolia-Central China trade plan for the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the Mongolia side's original proposal will be discussed and decided within the day. However, the main purpose of the original proposal is to supply Central China with raw materials such as Datong coal, medicines, and medicinal materials, while Central China transports in daily necessities such as flour, cotton cloth and processed products, woolen fabrics, tea, tobacco leather, soap, foreign candles, and sugar, as well as groceries. In the past, Mongolia often had to pay a considerable amount of money for trade between the two, so in the 32nd year, it is hoped that exports can be expanded, and the above-mentioned materials that depend on Central China can be smoothly imported, so as to correct the one-way trade as much as possible. (Translated by Ding from the Mainichi Shimbun on March 18)

Any brokerage found to be in violation of the laws and regulations will be subject to fines and suspension of operations, depending on the severity of the offense.

### Recovery of the Beijing Legation Quarter Will Strengthen China's Economic Construction

Beijing, March 22 (Domei News Agency) — Economic circles of both China and Japan here believe that the return of the Beijing Legation Quarter to the Nanjing government will further strengthen China's economic construction. Before the war, British economic institutions within the Beijing Legation Quarter included Asiatic Petroleum Company, Mentougou Coal Mine Company, Beijing Electric Light Company, HSBC, and Mercantile Bank. American economic institutions included Citibank and American Transportation Company. However, these were all swept away after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Economic experts indicate that the return of the Beijing Legation Quarter can serve as a base for China's economic reconstruction. While the administrative power of the Legation Quarter Administrative Commission will soon be transferred to the National Government, the authority over taxation and all economic matters will continue to be handled by the Administrative Commission. Nevertheless, the issue of extraterritoriality has now been resolved.

This course will include cooking, sewing, and handicrafts. Ueno believes that girls will be interested in these subjects, and the addition of this course in municipal schools will help young women with their future life skills.

Establishing a Kindergarten Exclusively for Girls

Ueno also revealed that the Municipal Council will establish a kindergarten exclusively for girls to prepare them for school life so they will not encounter difficulties when they enter formal elementary school in the future. The school hours for the municipal foreign girls' school are from 8:30 AM to 1:30 PM, while the boys' school hours are from 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM. The former is located at 425 Haig Road, and the latter at 544 Seymour Road.

Male and Female Teachers Already Hired

### Shanghai Youth Brigade of the Youth Corps Held Pre-Inspection Yesterday

To commemorate the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, the Chinese Youth Corps held a general inspection in Nanjing. Representative teams from all provinces and cities across the country participated in the inspection. The Shanghai Special Municipality New National Movement Promotion Committee Branch specially selected two youth brigade teams to go to Nanjing. Yesterday, Mayor Chen, who also serves as the chairman, personally attended the event to deliver instructions and present flags. The ceremony was simple and solemn. The details are as follows:

Venue Arrangement

The venue for the inspection and flag-presentation ceremony of the Shanghai Special Municipality Youth Brigade of the Chinese Youth Corps was the central square of Zhaofeng Park. The review stand was set up on the park's marble platform, with a high-hanging portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the center and two national flags on either side. In addition to Mayor Chen, who also serves as the chairman, Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue of the Municipal Government, Director Ye Xuesong, Director Lin Jiongan, Director Ling Xianwen of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Secretary-General Zhou Huarong of the Municipal Education Association were also present. Military police assisted Boy Scouts in maintaining order throughout the venue.

Inspection and Flag Presentation

The ceremony began punctually. The youth brigade, led by Jiang Yinseng, entered the venue in formation. The entire team of sixty members wore military uniforms. They marched along the route while the Boy Scout band played military music. The inspection and flag-presentation ceremony began amidst the melodious sounds of military music. Mayor Chen, who also serves as the chairman, presided over the ceremony. After everyone sang the national anthem and performed the rituals, Mayor Chen presented the flag of the youth brigade to the team leader, Jiang Yinseng, who respectfully accepted it. The center of the flag featured a white sun in a blue sky over a field of red, the national flag, which was solemn and beautiful. Subsequently, an inspection was conducted. Mayor Chen, who also serves as the chairman, led everyone in inspecting the team for one round. The inspected youth brigade then performed a march-past and national exercises, walking around the venue for one round. All members of the observing youth corps saluted. Finally, the mayor delivered a speech filled with sincere encouragement. After singing the song of the Shanghai Youth Brigade of the Chinese Youth Corps, the event concluded with the recitation of the National Call.

Mayor's Speech

Mayor Chen's speech briefly stated: "Everyone, your performance here today is in preparation to participate in the national youth corps general inspection in Nanjing. Seeing your spirited demeanor, I am sincerely delighted and pleased. Now, I will try to explain the significance of this inspection. (1) Previously, there was no organization of the youth corps, or if there were similar organizations, they were quite rudimentary and lacked training. Only the Boy Scout organization was relatively complete. However, the Boy Scout organization was tied to schools and had nothing to do with society. Therefore, after the launch of the New National Movement, we began to promote work at the lower levels of society, striving to strengthen the Boy Scout organization for youth and actively train youth organizations, hoping to integrate the youth organizations into one, which is the reason for the New National Movement's organization of the youth corps. (2) The restoration of China cannot be achieved through empty talk. Countries around the world have had examples of declining and then being restored. Although our country faces difficult and complex situations with many problems, adversity builds a nation. As long as we use a new spirit to correct our shortcomings, strengthen our basic youth organizations, and actively implement the New Movement, unifying form and spirit, and take on the responsibility of restoring China, China will naturally be restored. Today, I personally witnessed your spirited demeanor and orderly formation, which is sufficient to represent our city in the capital. I am especially conveying this simple meaning to you. In the future, the heavy responsibility of the revival of China rests on your shoulders. I hope you will encourage each other and work hard for the country."

### Japanese Banks See Increase in Central Reserve Bank Note Deposits

Japanese banks have recently seen an increase in Central Reserve Bank note deposits compared to the past. Japanese banks offer lower interest rates than Chinese banks, yet their deposits have still increased, partly because some Chinese people must deposit money in Japanese banks due to investing in Japanese commercial enterprises. Currently, military scrip still dominates deposits in Japanese banks, but the banks hope that the deposits of Central Reserve Bank notes can gradually increase in the future to strengthen the relationship between Chinese and Japanese banks.

Japanese-owned China Support and Development Corporation Accepts Real Estate Mortgages for Loans

The Japanese-owned "China Support and Development Corporation" has also officially announced that it will accept real estate deeds as collateral for loans.

### Local Tea Merchants Send Representatives to Hangzhou to Order New Tea

Since the outbreak of war, the transport of inland tea to Shanghai has become difficult, leading to a gradual increase in local tea prices. Now that winter is passing and spring is coming, with Qingming Festival approaching, new tea will soon be available in Hangzhou. Local tea merchants have learned that the Hangzhou tea market is currently thriving due to favorable rainfall since the beginning of spring, and the harvest is expected to be abundant, with prices temporarily expected not to be high. Furthermore, the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association has made it easier to transport inland goods to Shanghai. Therefore, some tea companies have sent representatives to Hangzhou to negotiate and place orders. It is expected that new tea will be available in Shanghai in a few weeks.

### Authorities Instruct Self-Defense Corps on Actions to Take During Emergencies: Keep Alarm Keys Safe

The Public Concession's various district baojia authorities recently issued a notice to members of the Self-Defense Corps, explaining the measures to take in the event of an emergency and how to use the alarm equipment. When on duty, if Self-Defense Corps members encounter an emergency, they must immediately insert the alarm switch key they received when taking over the post into the keyhole of the switch box at the post and turn it to the left. The boundary bell in the entire district and the electric bells within the boundary will immediately sound. At the same time, the indicator lights in the military police team will also light up, and the alarm will sound. After opening the switch, Self-Defense Corps members must immediately remove the key and perform guard duties. Self-Defense Corps members must pay attention to the following points at all times: (1) Off-duty Self-Defense Corps members must hand over the electric bell key they are holding to the Self-Defense Corps member taking over the post. (2) The bell key should be hung on the Self-Defense Corps member's cross-body strap. (3) Self-Defense Corps members should stay close to the electric bell key box while on duty. (4) Self-Defense Corps members who lose the electric bell key will be severely punished. Furthermore, the Chengdu District Baojia Authority has ordered its subordinate bao to select large buildings, such as schools and factories, to establish air-raid shelters. When an air-raid alarm is issued, Self-Defense Corps members should immediately guide pedestrians into the shelters.

### Self-Control

— Hong Ying

Self-control is the power of our life, which is also the rudder of our life.

Pushkin said: "If you can overcome yourself, you can be more free than you dreamed of." Often people cannot thoroughly understand the meaning of "freedom" and have a distorted concept, so they live licentiously and behave improperly, which is very dangerous. Of course, "freedom" is the most precious thing for human beings, but it is not easy to achieve true "freedom." You must make a firm effort to train yourself to restrain yourself everywhere, and as you gradually progress, you will naturally reach the ideal state.

Self-control has a great effect on life. It can restrain one's selfish desires, evil thoughts, dreams, greed... With strong self-control, whether in life, thought, or behavior, you will not deviate from the right track and tend to extravagance and licentiousness. It can enable people to do things rationally and constantly urge themselves with conscience; it enables people to have firm faith and strong will to reject the provocation and temptation of demons.

Tagore also said: "A person's right to be his own master is the greatest of human rights." A person should govern himself and spur himself on; such as living a disciplined life, having pure thoughts, and examining his behavior, which cannot be neglected at all. It is the smartest way to always take the ideal character as a model for your life and compare yourself to it. If a person can fully exert self-control, he can be his own master, so isn't he already achieving true "freedom"?

### Review of "A Line of Sky"

— You Qing

This is a tragedy about the collapse of a large family and the "miracle" aimed at the chaotic reality.

The script begins by describing the disharmony within the family: the open and secret struggles between sisters-in-law, the jealousy between brothers-in-law, and the estrangement between father and son, making the entire family live in a state of crying, laughing, shouting, and uneasy silence. In addition, the persecution of the younger generation sharply portrays that the large family can no longer exist. Here, you can also see the wagging tails of utilitarians, who "the strong eat the weak" and regard people as stepping stones to climb up desperately. Once they climb up, they knock people down with a punch of "one general succeeds and ten thousand bones are withered" to retaliate for society's mistreatment of him.

This play is Mr. Shen Jie's "debut" into the theater world. He has worked very hard and it is not easy in terms of the unique consciousness of the entire theme. (There have been many artistic works describing large families in the past, such as Ba Jin's "Torrent Trilogy" and Cao Yu's "Peking Man"). However, the theme of this play is rarely understood because of the different situations people are in now. (Large families!) On the other hand, the playwright did not develop the script based on reality and necessity, but only stopped at the original position (such as the love between Mu Lian and Zemin only wrote about "Rudin" and lacked the realism of "On the Eve") and did not give the audience as much guidance as possible. Furthermore, it is not enough to grasp the center of the theme, so that the audience cannot clearly understand it.

The failure of this performance is that it is a "grand tragedy" without a tragic atmosphere, which is the director's biggest shortcoming. In scenes where it is possible to vent sadness, such as when Zemin hides in Wangjiao and sees Mu Lian and Tang Xinhua holding hands and coming out: Zemin's expression hardly shows the situation of a person who has lost love. After the laughter, there is no sour aftertaste (the limitations of the script are not without reason), and the audience's emotions cannot be grasped at all. On the other hand, the actors (still on stage, but the actors who were not the main performers) almost had no expression and stood there stiffly, especially in the first and second acts.

In terms of actors, the desert's Liang Mu Lian was successful in her typical portrayal, showing innocence, liveliness, and gentleness, but her Mandarin was not correct. Shen Hao's Chen Zhu was extremely sharp-tongued and stubborn, and Li Feng's Wu Pu'an both performed very well. Gao Yang's Jia Mei was generally not bad, but her lines were too light. Pan Yi's Zemin was not experienced enough, and his speech had a nasal tone. The other actors were all competent. In terms of effects, the sound of the carriage and the church bell were quite effective. The prompts were too loud.

In addition, in the plot of the screenplay: Mu Lian and Huimin's reluctance to part was not urged by Cui, but was scattered by the sudden arrival of Yang Xinhua, which is a good move to get rid of clichés. Liang Shutang, as a medical doctor, does not become a doctor but becomes a "Western medicine king" who hoards medicine, which is serious and practical, but not clear enough.

Finally, apart from the failure of the director's skills, generally speaking, the consciousness of the script is sensitive and practical enough, so it is still worth watching.

### Root

— Xin Bo

"Three months ago, others didn't know, but I knew that when the soldiers came and fled to your place, no one dared to keep them, fearing that it would attract the attention of rampaging soldiers or bandits. But you gave up your house for them to live in. Everyone knew that they were carrying a lot of wealth, and everyone was thinking about it. But you not only didn't touch a hair on their heads, but also did your best to protect them. When they left, they only gave you twenty yuan. Now you are in trouble and selling your fields to them, but they are so treacherous! To be honest, they shouldn't be buying your fields. They should be helping you completely through your difficulties!..."

The more Ah Wu spoke, the more excited he became, forgetting his own position.

"Ah Wu, thank you for your kindness. But what can we poor people fight for?..."

At the gate, Genming thanked Ah Wu again and again.

"It's not too late yet, you go home. I'm afraid I won't be able to sleep yet!" Ah Wu stood at the door, holding up the lantern high, watching Genming off. He saw Genming walking with his arms tightly wrapped around his chest. His trembling back gradually disappeared into the darkness. Looking south from the top of Xiaolingshan, you can see a main line hanging down to the foot of the mountain, dividing into many branches, some thick, some thin, some dense, and some loose, passing through wheat fields, villages, and connecting to Chongwen Town. It is a line made by people, just like the line made by ants when they move. The line is being dragged from above, like a mesh of a large net being dragged ashore: but this line is infinitely long and cannot be dragged to the end, unlike a net rope that is dragged to the end, and the net attached to it will appear. In a word, many people are constantly running up the mountain.

These people, of course, are villagers, men, women, old, and young, all wearing their best clothes, walking happily. Although there are dark clouds in the sky and no sunlight, the ground is a bit muddy because of the rain the night before, but they don't mind. They only know that today is the annual festival, the March 15th, "March 15th, go to Lingshan," which is their slogan, their determination, breaking through all difficulties and destroying all obstacles.

### A Corner of Society

— Wang Zhang

(1) Two Positions

The tram station platform is crowded with people waiting for the tram:

The tram comes dinging along. The carriage is also full of passengers. Three get off, seven get on:

The eighth person: "Excuse me, friends, can you squeeze a bit? I'm really in a hurry--"

One foot has just stepped onto the pedal, while the other is still suspended in a T-shape: so--two arms spread out, gripping the handles by the door, and the head turns around:

"Dead man, why don't you see there are too many people to get on?"

The ninth person: "……？？？"

(2) "Let me, let me!"

Three people come out of a wine and food shop, all scrambling to pay.

A fumbles around his body anxiously, like scratching scabies: "Let me! Let me! This time it should be my treat. We'll talk about the next time." After a long time.

B uses his left hand to stop A, and holds the money with his right hand, waving it above his head: "What a joke, it's not like we only met today. Let me! Let me!"

Again, after a long time.

C takes out his wallet, and slowly and meticulously counts the banknotes, muttering: "Five yuan, ten yuan, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty..."

The waiter, impatient, rudely spreads out his palm towards C.

C glances at A and B, and then helplessly pays the bill. The corners of his mouth are turned up in a smile, like crying.

So A and B seem to say, with utmost regret, in unison: "Old X, why be so polite? Thank you very much. Next time, it's definitely my treat. No grabbing!" They both point at their own noses with their index fingers.

A stops his restlessness, and the button he unfastened while fumbling in his pocket; B puts down his arm raised high, and solemnly puts the crumpled bills back into his waist.

All three people are smiling, two are knowing smiles, and one is an awkward bitter smile.

### Clinics Provide Medical Treatment and Medicine: Fulfil the Obligation of Human Mutual Assistance

(1) Recently, drug prices have soared, and patients find it difficult to afford them, while the number of organizations that have always provided medical treatment and medicine is decreasing. The Chinese Medicine Clinic at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Marlborough Road, No. 2, Shanghai, is now run by Dr. Chen Cunren. To serve the poor in society, it has specially added the provision of medical treatment and medicine. Dr. Chen Zhichao has been hired to be responsible for the work, and the generous benefactor of Xin'anzhai is responsible for the medical expenses. It is stipulated that medical consultations will be held from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM every day, and all medical and medicine costs will be waived, in order to fulfill the obligation of human mutual assistance.

(2) The China Pharmacy was founded by Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Mr. Xie Baosheng, and Mr. Wang Boyuan, with the aim of serving society. In order to promote free smallpox vaccination, they have specially entrusted 26 dozen smallpox vaccines, totaling 624 doses, to be forwarded by this office to various charitable organizations for use. This office will do so accordingly and express its gratitude.

### Contributions of the Children's Library

— Yong Yu

The Shanghai Children's Library has been established for twenty months, with over 60,000 children readers. It lends out 54,610 books each month and currently holds 20,038 volumes, all of which are beneficial children's reading materials. In addition to providing free reading at the library for children, it especially offers group borrowing. It daily sets up several circulation stations, equipped with two traveling vehicles that carry books daily and rotate to various roads for exhibitions, so that children in remote areas and wandering children all have the opportunity to read nearby. Currently, the library is raising funds and hopes that enlightened parents throughout the city will provide more assistance to expand the scope of the children's library throughout the city, and also hopes to urge children to borrow books.

Lost and Found: Yesterday at the corner of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, a string of keys, a small knife, and a chain were found. The owner can come to this service center to claim them. Tang Junhou.
