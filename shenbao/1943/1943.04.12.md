### Appeal for Relief of the Henan Drought Disaster

The tragedy of disasters has never been so severe as this year. Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang – almost every province is experiencing some form of disaster. Whether it's flooding or vast droughts stretching for miles, Henan's drought is the most severe among these provinces.

"Last year, the drought demon wreaked havoc, leading to no harvest in the summer and autumn. The people mostly survived on wild vegetables, grass roots, and fruits, appearing emaciated and haggard – a pitiful sight. Since the beginning of spring, the situation has worsened. Starving people grind dried grass into powder and mix it with elm bark flour to barely stay alive. Corpses of the starved litter the roads – a common sight that breaks the heart of those who see it and brings tears to those who hear about it." (See today's newspaper for the "Donation Appeal for the Henan Province Drought Relief"). Further, a dispatch from Macau printed in today's newspaper, poignantly states: "...Henan counties are mostly impoverished areas. This year, they are experiencing an unprecedented drought. The trite phrases used to describe disasters like 'red land stretching for miles' and 'the mournful cry of wild geese everywhere' are insufficient to depict the severity of the disaster in Henan. The scorching drought and overwhelming locusts have withered the wheat crop and ruined the autumn harvest. People have no food to eat; they chew on grass roots, strip tree bark, and swallow mud and sand. Those who starve to death quickly turn into skeletons – a scene more tragic than the ancient saying 'netting sparrows and digging for mice.' The number of deaths is incalculable, and those who still have breath struggle to flee, running to northern Hubei and escaping to Shaanxi. Northern Hubei and Sichuan are also experiencing drought, and grain prices in Shaanxi are rising accordingly. Any compatriot with compassion will not remain indifferent to this scene of refugees. Moreover, as we approach the transition from spring to summer, epidemics will arise along with the drought and famine. The scope of the disaster will likely extend far beyond Henan alone. Therefore, we must echo the voices of those who initiated the Henan drought relief effort and urge all sectors of society to donate generously.

Henan was originally the center of ancient Chinese culture and politics. The areas of Bian and Luo were the early cradle of the Chinese nation. However, in recent decades, natural disasters and human-caused calamities have repeatedly afflicted the region, causing the landscape to lose its color, and the common people to perish in ditches and ravines. In the 22nd year, the Yellow River breached its banks at Fenglou; in the 23rd year, dikes successively broke at Guantai and Mengzhuang; in the 24th year, the Yellow, Yi, and Luo rivers simultaneously caused harm; and in the 25th year, the drought demon wreaked havoc. After the 26th year, there were reports of the Yellow River changing its course, leaving behind destroyed homes wherever it passed. As stated in the drought relief donation appeal: "The people are trapped in dire straits, living in constant suffering, and even middle-class families are mostly destitute. The plight of the poor can only be imagined." This still may not fully capture the extent of their suffering. Coupled with the current severe drought, "people are not made of wood or stone; how can they stand idly by?" Therefore, whether from the perspective of the nation's future or the duties of its citizens, we, the fortunate compatriots who are outside the circle of natural disasters, have a responsibility to immediately contribute our efforts and money to provide relief for the drought in Henan. Therefore, we dare to appeal to all fellow citizens: today, the greatest and most practical act of kindness is to enthusiastically support the Henan drought relief effort.

From a careful study of the disaster situation in Henan, we can see that the most important and urgent needs at present are the distribution of grain, the accommodation of refugees, the promotion of epidemic prevention in the disaster areas and surrounding regions, and the supply of large quantities of medicine. We sincerely hope that those in charge of relief efforts will pay close attention to these aspects and work hard on them, and we further hope that the relevant authorities will provide them with many conveniences. We also know that today, part of Henan, which is under severe disaster, is still under the control of the Chongqing government, and the unfortunate war is still ongoing. However, we must recognize that natural disasters have no bias or preferences. Not only should we provide relief to those affected by the drought who are our fellow compatriots, but we should also have the compassion and morality of "feeling hungry when others are hungry and feeling drowned when others are drowning" towards our enemies, and provide them with relief as well. Especially in peaceful areas, in addition to urgent relief, we should also engage in fundamental solutions, such as repairing river channels and water conservancy, resettling refugees, distributing seeds and farming tools, and promoting spring plowing, to reduce the extent of the disaster and prevent post-disaster catastrophes. This is, of course, what we expect from the joint efforts of the government and our Japanese friends.

### Mission to Japan Successfully Completed: Special Envoy Chen Bids Farewell to the Palace Yesterday, Expressing Gratitude for the Warm Welcome and Emphasizing the Increasingly Close Sino-Japanese Relations

Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) - Special Envoy Chen Gongbo of China's delegation to Japan, since his arrival, has been busy with engagements. Today, he successfully completed his mission. At 9:07 AM on the 11th, he went to the Imperial Palace to bid farewell, departing at 9:13 AM. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, he and Xu Liang, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, held a tea party at the Imperial Hotel, inviting friends from various circles in Japan, Germany, Italy, Manchuria, and other countries to express gratitude for the warm hospitality received over the past few days. Attendees included Aoki from the Greater East Asia Ministry of Japan, Foreign Minister Tani, Naval Minister Shimada, Chief of Staff Sugiyama, the ambassadors of Germany, Italy, Manchuria, Thailand, and other Axis powers, as well as numerous Japanese military officers and civilians. The gathering concluded happily after 4:00 PM.

Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) - Special Envoy Chen, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, upon completing his mission and preparing to depart, issued a statement today, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome extended by various circles in Japan during his visit. He also emphasized that Sino-Japanese relations would become increasingly close in the future. He stated, in essence, that since his arrival in Japan by order, he has been treated with great honor by His Majesty the Emperor, Prime Minister Tojo, and other ministers. The Japanese people have also extended a warm welcome, which not only makes him feel infinitely honored and grateful but also reflects the gratitude of the people throughout China. Since the beginning of our participation in the war, we have declared that we will not only share the joys and sorrows with Japan but also live and die together, in order to fulfill the historical mission of the Greater East Asia War and the liberation of the Greater East Asian peoples. Japan has also taken steps to abolish extraterritorial rights and return concessions to China, treating China not only as a friend but as a blood brother. The two countries are bound together not only by shared interests but also by a moral spirit that transcends interests. This spirit is now being realized in Japan's new policy toward China and is also manifested in the transformation of our country's general sentiments. Now, from top to bottom, we are united in our determination to contribute our utmost efforts in politics, economy, and culture to secure the victory of the Greater East Asia War and to accomplish the great undertaking of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. What I have seen during my visit to Japan is that the Japanese government and people are united in their determination and attitude, which deeply moves me. Everyone expresses the highest moral and most sincere attitude toward our country, taking the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia as their responsibility. This spirit encourages China to strive for self-improvement and increases our infinite trust in Japan. During this visit to Japan, I not only expressed our gratitude to Japan, but I also feel infinitely inspired and honored to stand at this new and epoch-making stage of Sino-Japanese relations as a special envoy of our country. From now on, China and Japan will forever be brothers, supporting each other. This is not only for the happiness of the Chinese and Japanese people but also for the happiness of the world.

### Commander of the Kwantung Army, Umezu, Hosted a Banquet for Special Envoy Zhou Yesterday, and the Manchurian Foreign Minister Hosted a Dinner Party: Zhou Delivered a Speech Expressing His Determination

Xinjing, November 11th (Central News Agency) - Commander Umezu of the Kwantung Army hosted a banquet at his official residence today at noon for Special Envoy Zhou Fohai of the National Government to Manchuria. In his speech, he stated in essence that the Republic of China was founded on morality. To realize the ideal of peaceful nation-building, it has resolutely risen. Thanks to the struggles and efforts of Chairman Wang and the heads of the government, the foundations of the nation are becoming increasingly solid. Since the joint declaration issued by China, Japan, and Manchuria on November 30th of the year before last, and the declaration of war against Britain and the United States on January 9th of this year, and most recently, the return of exclusive concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights by Japan, the country is prospering day by day. Furthermore, Chairman Wang of the National Government visited Manchuria last autumn, Prime Minister Tojo recently visited Nanjing in return, the visit to Japan by Chief Ba Maw and his party, Prime Minister Tojo's visit to Manchuria, and the visit to Japan by Special Envoy Chen of the National Government, etc., are all manifestations of the unity and harmony of the various ethnic groups of East Asia. Now, Special Envoy Zhou's visit to Manchuria further deepens the warmth of mutual unity among China, Japan, and Manchuria. I deeply admire Ambassador Zhou's visit. Special Envoy Zhou also attended the luncheon hosted by Commander Umezu of the Kwantung Army and Plenipotentiary Ambassador and delivered a speech, expressing the determination of the New China to resolutely cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. He stated, in essence, that this year is a new page in Chinese history. Since the Opium War, China has been under the oppression of Britain and the United States for more than a century. It was not until the friendly nation of Japan declared war on Britain and the United States the year before last that their power began to be driven out, and China regained its light. On January 9th of this year, our country also followed the friendly nation of Japan and resolutely declared war on the long-standing enemies of Britain and the United States, thus washing away a century of humiliation. This is truly a glorious and great achievement in Chinese history. At this moment, Japan, based on pure moral and friendly relations, voluntarily returned the concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights, enabling China to restore its freedom and equality. Even the revolutionary aspirations of our national father, Sun Yat-sen, have been realized thanks to the assistance of the friendly nation of Japan. We are sincerely grateful and cannot express it fully in words. This year is truly a memorable and meaningful year for China. To win the final victory in the Greater East Asia War, it depends on how we struggle in the future. China will share this war and is determined to cooperate with the friendly nation of Japan with full enthusiasm, turning powerlessness into power. In the future, I hope that our China and Manchuria will unite as one and cooperate with Japan to win the victory in this war. This is what I earnestly hope and believe.

Xinjing, November 11th (Central News Agency) - Special Envoy Zhou Fohai of China's delegation to Manchuria, after attending a welcome tea party hosted by President Kan of the Central Bank of Manchuria at 2:15 PM on the 11th, attended a welcome dinner party hosted by Foreign Minister Li at the Yamato Hotel at 6:00 PM. Many members of the diplomatic corps stationed in Xinjing also attended. At the dinner, Special Envoy Zhou emphasized that the Chinese people were willing to endure the suffering and burdens they should bear in order to complete the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the New East Asia as soon as possible. He stated, in essence, that he was deeply impressed by Minister Li's remarks about the many difficulties in realizing the ideal of Greater East Asia, and that the union of East Asian countries and nations must be based on morality. The construction of a new Greater East Asia is indeed a difficult undertaking, so we must be aware of the hardships ahead. I believe that with our determination, effort, and endurance, and by seeking life from death, we will surely achieve something. This is also true for Manchuria. During this visit to your country, I have gained a lot of insights from witnessing your country's various constructions and efforts. I am convinced that with the temporary endurance and greatest efforts of China, Japan, and Manchuria, any national crisis can be overcome, and the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the completion of the construction of the New East Asia will also be achieved in the near future. The spirit of morality is the consistent spirit of the East Asian nations since ancient times. Using morality as the basis of unity is a permanent union, and using morality as the basis of peace is a permanent peace. After the victory of the Greater East Asia War, may each East Asian country, and even each country in the world, find its place, which is also the Chinese ideal of "the world belongs to everyone" and the Japanese ideal of "eight corners of the world under one roof" - the ideal will surely be achieved. And the achievement of this ideal depends on the unity of China, Japan, and Manchuria based on morality, and the common efforts of meeting each other with sincerity.

### War Results of Japanese Troops in Henan

Kaifeng, November 11th (Central News Agency) - In March, a certain unit of the Japanese army in Henan engaged in 234 battles with the Communist army of Chongqing, with the latter having a force of 6,038 men, leaving behind 1,053 bodies, and 390 captured. The Japanese army seized 598 rifles, 9,045 rounds of ammunition, 17 light machine guns, 387 hand grenades, one mortar, ten pistols, and other military supplies.

### Surrender of Chongqing Troops in Southern Hubei

Hankou, November 11th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing troops in the triangular area of southern Hubei were completely disintegrated due to the fierce attack of the Japanese army. The remnants are surrendering one after another. In the Shashi area, from mid-March to early April, 464 Chongqing military officers and others surrendered, bringing with them light machine guns, rifles, and a large amount of ammunition.

### American Aircraft Attack Guangzhou Bay

Guangzhou, November 10th (Central News Agency) - At 10:30 AM on the 9th, eight Kansas (P4) type American aircraft attacked Guangzhou Bay. After dropping incendiary bombs in Xiying, they violently strafed residential areas in the city with machine guns, causing many Vietnamese people to be killed and wounded. Chinese homes also suffered considerable damage. The city's defensive artillery immediately launched a fierce counterattack, with one aircraft being hit and emitting black smoke as it limped toward the direction of Chishan. The other enemy aircraft also fled in a panic toward the northeast. It seems that the American aircraft's attack was intended to disturb the people's minds, but in reality, it did no harm to the Japanese. The deaths and injuries of some Annamese people and the damage to Chinese homes only exposed their inhumane behavior.

### Conflicts Occur Frequently between American and Chongqing Air Force Officers

Guangzhou, November 11th (Central News Agency) - Due to differences in treatment and the arrogant attitude of American soldiers, the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing Air Force have repeatedly turned against each other and engaged in infighting. According to a certain Chinese who recently escaped from Kunming to a peaceful area, on March 24th, an incident occurred in Chuxiong, 150 kilometers west of Kunming, in which a certain Chongqing military officer ambushed an American officer. The reason was that on that day at the Chuxiong airfield, an American officer, wanting to telegraph his beloved's birthday greetings, demanded that the Chongqing radio station urgently send the message. At that time, the radio station was sending an important telegram, so they refused. As a result, the Chongqing officer had an argument with the American officer. Unexpectedly, the American officer was unreasonable and started to beat someone, causing him to be shot in the right wrist by the Chongqing officer. The military and civilians of Chongqing were outraged by the repeated acts of tyranny by American soldiers.

The chairman of the committee is Pacification Commissioner Chen, who also appoints special commissioners to supervise the military reclamation matters.

### Mushanokoji and Tanikawa Release Impressions of Their Visit to China: The Future of the New China is Infinitely Bright, and the Ideal of Sino-Japanese Culture Becoming One

Beijing, November 8th (Central News Agency) - Mushanokoji Saneatsu and Tanikawa Tetsuzo, representatives of the Japanese cultural delegation, arrived here on the 8th after attending the celebrations in Nanjing for the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital and attending the second national congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association. The two released their impressions of their visit. The details are as follows:

(Mushanokoji) In essence, he said, "This is my first visit to China, but seeing the bright situation in Beijing and Shanghai, I deeply feel that the future of the New China is full of infinite light. I have also heard that the Chinese people are grateful and delighted about the National Government's participation in the war and the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations, such as Japan's return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. I am also very pleased. At this Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Congress, I heard a representative from Guangzhou say that Japan dominates life with its thinking, but Chinese culture originates from life, that is, the focus of culture is on life. This is not only its characteristic but also its advantage. If one day it transcends this point, it will be controlled by life, but it should not fall into the Anglo-American ideology of taking a well-fed and well-clothed life as the essence of culture. This is also true in China. Since ancient times, it has not been ashamed of poverty, always despising material things and emphasizing the spirit. I believe that the cause of the Greater East Asia War, from a cultural perspective, is that East Asia, which has been oppressed by the West for a hundred years, is now awakened. Japan was the first to feel the need to revive Asian culture, and in seeking to abolish the Western culture that oppressed Eastern culture, we unconsciously recognized that the British and Americans, who constantly attempt to exploit and oppress East Asia, are our enemies. Furthermore, because there is no way to make them aware of this through righteousness, we ultimately resorted to force to drive them out. Although Eastern and Western cultures differ in nature, Eastern culture is actually higher than Western culture in terms of its level. For example, in the field of art, Chinese ancient calligraphy and the works of Liangzhu and Muqi are not inferior to Western works. In Japan, the spirit of works by Sotatsu, Mitsuhiro, and Ike Taiga is incomparable to any other country in the world. Chinese culture is extremely beautiful and is the vanguard of East Asia, and the one that makes Westerners recognize the value of Eastern culture as early as possible. As for driving out Anglo-American thought, Japan can be said to be the pioneer of East Asia. China should emulate Japan in this respect and accept Japan's guidance. However, I believe that there are also merits in Western culture itself, so we should let it withdraw from Asia so that Asians can create culture on their own in Asia, and then respect each other and advance together. This is the great way to world peace. China should know that Japan is the pioneer of East Asia and respect Japan. Japan should recognize that Chinese culture has noble and beautiful qualities and learn from each other's strengths. This is the most important thing at present. I have met young Chinese writers in Beijing and Shanghai. They are energetic and full of enthusiasm for building a new Chinese literature. It is a pity that I did not have time to talk with them at length. I have heard that a new cultural movement is also being launched in Beijing under the leadership of Mr. Zhou Zuoren. I strongly agree with this."

(Tanikawa) In essence, he said, "The fundamental issue of strengthening Sino-Japanese cultural ties is that the two major ethnic groups in East Asia should be completely united based on Eastern moral culture. This is the foundation for the future prosperity of Sino-Japanese culture. Because we have already known and recognized the ideal of Sino-Japanese culture becoming one, we should realize it as soon as possible. And at this conference, the foundation for the establishment of a moral alliance has been completed. We should not only recognize that we are waging war, but we should also have a thorough understanding of why this war occurred and why it had to occur. Therefore, this is not only a change in East Asian history, nor is it just an evolution of modern world history, but it is necessary to understand hundreds or even thousands of years of world history in order to clarify the cause and effect. To this day, the Chinese people have a real understanding of the significance of the New China's resolute uprising to participate in the war, striving to open up the great historical road of liberating the East Asian nations and establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In order to dedicate ourselves to establishing an East Asian moral culture, China, with its four thousand years of history, should have the determination to coexist and die together with Japan. In order to promote the cooperation and prosperity of the two countries' cultures, I firmly believe that only by pointing out each other's mistakes can we restore their original features. On this point, the young writers I met in Nanjing also deeply recognized and shared the same feeling. Frankly speaking, I firmly believe that only when the Chinese and Japanese people embrace mutual love and hold each other accountable can they quickly realize the cultural ideal of Sino-Japanese unity."

### Zhou Zuoren Pays Respects at Zhang Taiyan's Tomb in Suzhou Yesterday

Suzhou, November 11th (Central News Agency) - After arriving in Suzhou, National Government Committee Member Zhou Zuoren personally went to the tomb of Master of Chinese Studies Zhang Taiyan at 10:00 AM on the 10th to pay his respects and express his condolences.

At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, he gave a lecture at the Provincial Educational Institute entitled "The Application of Knowledge". At about 4:00 PM, he toured the Lion Grove Garden, Tiger Hill, and other scenic spots. In the evening, the Suzhou branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association hosted a banquet for Zhou and others, inviting Chinese and Japanese dignitaries to accompany them. It is reported that Zhou and his party are scheduled to leave Suzhou and return to Beijing on the morning of the 12th. Zhou also released the following thoughts on his visit to Suzhou: "I was appointed as a committee member by the National Government. This time, I came to Beijing to report my duties, visit Chairman Wang, and give a lecture at Central University. Later, I learned that Mr. Taiyan was buried in his residence after his death, so I temporarily decided to visit Suzhou to pay my respects at his tomb and visit the site of the former Chinese Studies Society. I will only stay in Suzhou for one day and must return to Beijing. I have visited Lingyan Mountain and Xuanmiao Temple. From what I have seen in Muduo and the city, the people live well and are very gratifying. As for the scenery of Jiangnan, I grew up in eastern Zhejiang and am familiar with it. Since I have lived in the north for a long time, I have missed it for a long time. It is even more gratifying to see it again today."

### Macau Correspondence: Severe Drought in Henan Province

— Jin Yan

Recently, in Guilin City, although prices are high, the market is prosperous, and department stores compete to display beautiful goods. Although people are busy with their respective tasks, various venues still accommodate large groups of leisurely individuals. Even though coal is as expensive as gold, some people still burn roaring room heaters; even though cloth is as rare as treasures, people still add warm clothing. Considering the starving and freezing refugees in various provinces, who are either starving as families or perishing altogether, millions of people are struggling on the brink of death.

Thinking of the refugees, one cannot help but feel alarmed and worried. This year's most devastating calamity is the natural disaster in Henan. The counties of Henan have always been impoverished areas, and this year they have suffered an unprecedented drought. The cliché phrases used to describe disasters, such as "thousands of miles of barren land" and "mournful cries filling the wilderness," are no longer sufficient to describe the severity of the Henan disaster. The scorching drought and the sky-covering locusts have withered the wheat crops and destroyed the autumn harvest. People have no food to eat, so they chew on grass roots, peel tree bark, and swallow mud and sand. Those who have starved to death have turned into white bones. The tragic scene surpasses the ancient saying "catching sparrows and digging for rats." The population death toll is incalculable, and those who still have a breath of life struggle to flee the famine, heading towards northern Hubei and escaping to Shaanxi. However, northern Hubei is also experiencing drought, and grain prices in Shaanxi are rising accordingly. This year, people in the rear areas are paying close attention to the Northwest. Upon reaching Xi'an, one can already feel the severity of the problem of Henan people migrating inward. On the Tongguan Road, there is a constant stream of refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, all fleeing the famine in search of food. As the severe winter arrives, the central plains are covered in frost and snow, and the northwest winds are biting. How will those millions of refugees continue their lives with only thin clothing and empty stomachs? For the present, the following measures should be taken quickly for the Henan disaster: (1) Waive grain taxes and military supplies, and do not demand grain from the starving people. (2) Provide emergency relief, with the goal of saving lives and reducing the suffering of the refugees from freezing and starvation as much as possible. Currently, Henan Province has received soaking rain, which is a major turning point. Officials should quickly provide wheat seeds so that the fields can be sown. There is a prevailing advocacy for resettlement to relieve the Henan disaster. In fact, settling in place is better than resettlement, because resettlement requires transportation, agricultural tools, and lodging, which are very costly, while settling in place only requires providing food and seeds.

"Many provinces have suffered from water and drought disasters this year. For example, Guangxi has both floods and droughts, which are also worthy of attention, but special attention is paid to the disaster situation in Henan Province because the disaster is relatively large.

At this time of severe winter, everyone cares about the refugees who lack clothing and food. People are not afraid of accidental mistakes or unintentional sins, but the most terrible thing is the obliteration of compassion. Holding grudges and being calculating are all acquired habits, but altruistic compassion is the most precious true feeling of mankind. If those who are well-fed and warmly clothed can shiver for their compatriots who are trapped in freezing and starvation and warm their hearts, the conscience of many people will be saved."

### Powerful Japanese Military in the Pacific Causes Deep Unease in Australia

Argentine Capital, 10th (Central News Agency) - Following the renewed large-scale operations by the Japanese naval air force in the Southwest Pacific, Australia has expressed deep unease and stressed the need to strengthen the defense of the Southwest Pacific. Three or four days ago, the Australian government and frontline commanders of the US military strongly called for the Allied High Command in Washington to increase its strength, stating that the existing forces in the Southwest Pacific were insufficient to prevent a Japanese invasion. Australian Naval Minister Makin, in a speech in Adelaide, stated that Japanese forces have been actively constructing bases on islands north of Australia, while Army Minister Ford also stated that the Japanese are actively constructing new bases and increasing their forces. Therefore, the Allies must prepare for even greater sacrifices in the future, as the strength of the Japanese military in the Southwest Pacific is undeniable.

Argentine Capital, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese naval air force recently launched large-scale air raids on Oro Bay on the island of New Guinea and fiercely attacked Tulagi Harbor on Florida Island, achieving glorious results and causing a great shock to the US government and public. On the 8th, the United Press acknowledged that the situation on the Pacific front had become serious again, stating that the state of normalcy on the Pacific front had come to an end. Based on the activities of the Japanese and US forces in recent days, it is known that a large-scale battle is about to unfold. The Japanese military has adopted bold offensive operations in recent days and strengthened the defense lines of its vast newly occupied territories to prevent US military operations. The Japanese naval air force's bombing of Allied ships in New Guinea and US ships in Oro Bay is a manifestation of the Japanese military's defensive offensive. US Secretary of the Army Stimson stated during a meeting with reporters on the 8th that the strength of the Japanese air force on the Asian mainland front and the Southwest Pacific front has increased significantly, and that the US military has also increased its air force strength in that area and will continue to strengthen it in the future. It is believed that Stimson's remarks are based on the results of the Washington military conference. It is believed that the Washington military conference seems to have agreed to strengthen the Allied forces in the Pacific and East Asian fronts as much as possible, within the scope of the Casablanca meeting. In addition, US Army Chief of Staff, Major General Somervell, and Air Force Commander, Major General Kenney, and four others who participated in the conference returned to the Southwest Pacific Allied Command on the 7th to report the results of the conference to MacArthur and held meetings for several consecutive days. It is said that frontline commanders of the US military have high expectations for Stimson's remarks. According to a report from the Reuters correspondent at the New Guinea forward base on the 9th, the Allied Command welcomes US Secretary of the Army Stimson's statement on strengthening the air force in the South Pacific. It is believed that the Allied Command believes that the United States currently has at least 10,000 military aircraft awaiting orders, and it would be easy to transfer a portion of them to the Southwest Pacific, so it has repeatedly requested the US government to strengthen the air force in various aspects.

### Japanese Air Force Combined Formation Bombs British Ships on the Naf River, Attacks Allied Airfield in Chittagong, British Press Admits Defeat on Indo-Burma Border

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from New Delhi states that according to the Allied Command in India, on the 9th, a combined formation of Japanese fighter-bombers bombed British ships on the Naf River in southeastern Bengal and heavily bombed British positions in southeastern Bengal. The British military also attempted to rescue troops surrounded by the Japanese military in the Rakhine region of the Maungdaw Peninsula. However, according to the Allied Command, British fighter planes lost two aircraft in the fighting in that area.

Istanbul, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Allied India Expeditionary Force Command announced on the 10th that the Japanese air force again attacked the Allied airfield south of Chittagong on the morning of the 9th.

Rangoon, 11th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army launched a large-scale encirclement operation against the British Indian army on the Indian border, news of victories has been frequently reported. The entire people of Burma are deeply excited and know even more about the strength of the Japanese army and trust them even more. On the 10th, the Japanese General Headquarters announced that elite Japanese troops had annihilated the British Indian 6th Brigade in the Bay of Bengal and captured its brigade commander. A local English-language newspaper issued an extra edition last night to publish the news and posted it on the bustling streets of the city. At that time, almost all the Burmese people who watched were ecstatic.

Stockholm, 11th (Central News Agency) - Following the success of the Japanese army's operations on the Mayu Peninsula, the Allied forces in that area have suffered a disastrous defeat. Britain's bold claims of recapturing Burma have completely become illusions. According to a dispatch from London, The Times published the war situation on the Indo-Burma border for the first time on the 9th and frankly admitted the British army's retreat, stating that the British army's withdrawal from the Mayu River position was unavoidable. At present, it only occupies the positions north of Donbaik and east of Rathedaung. The pressure from the Japanese army is gradually increasing. The British army may continue to retreat before the arrival of the monsoon season, so there is no hope of recapturing Buthidaung.

### German Forces in Southern Tunisia Arrive in the Sfax Mountain Area, Fierce Fighting in Progress Between the Central Route of Pichon and Kairouan, Northern Military Center Still at Djebel Cheddada

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the North African front, British and American forces in northern Tunisia, with the support of French rebels, launched fierce attacks on Axis positions on the 9th in three areas surrounding Pichon, Bou Arada, El Babs Road, and Medjez el Bab. However, all of them were separately defeated by the Axis forces. The southern Pichon area was surrounded by Axis forces and lost 15 tanks. According to various sources, Tunisia has recently entered a decisive stage of the war. According to a report in The Times of London on the 10th, the first strategic phase of the Allied forces has ended and they have now entered a decisive stage.

Bern, 11th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters correspondent in North Africa reported today that General Rommel is currently moving his main forces northward towards a new defense line to complete his effective delaying tactic. The correspondent believes that General Rommel is moving towards the mountainous area, with his troops starting from Enfidaville, northwest of Sousse, westward through the Kairouan area to the rear of the Axis forces near Bir Khiria, providing considerable cover, deploying artillery along the way, and preventing the attacks of the Eighth Army.

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - Officials announced last night that Marshal Rommel's forces in southern Tunisia had avoided Allied attacks, while the Axis forces in the Medjez el Bab and Pichon areas slightly to the north were holding their ground. On Friday, they repelled enemy forces that had attacked repeatedly. The British and Americans are constantly reinforcing with new troops and engaging in fierce battles in the mountainous areas of central and northern Tunisia. The fighting near Medjez el Bab and Pichon was particularly intense on Friday. On the road starting from Medjez el Bab, the British army lost 33 tanks, 11 cannons, and 6 reconnaissance vehicles within 24 hours. As a result, the attacking British infantry had collapsed in front of the German lines. In the fighting in the Pichon area, the British and American forces also suffered heavy losses, especially in the area near the Fondouk Pass. Thirty-two Allied tanks were destroyed. Most of Marshal Rommel's forces in the southern area have retreated further north, and have now generally reached the hilly areas of Sfax. During this operation, the Axis forces fought hard with the advancing Allied forces at several locations. The German and Italian forces, with fewer troops, retreated only after completing their mission. Rommel's actions clearly aimed to withdraw his forces northward to strengthen the Axis defense line in the mountainous area of Tunisia. The British army's repeated attempts to disrupt Rommel's movements or to break through were unsuccessful. The German and Italian air forces are also constantly assisting in the ground fighting. The Axis air force is dedicated to attacking the British and American rear transportation lines approaching the front lines and the Allied artillery positions. The Axis air force's cooperation with the German and Italian armies in central and northern Tunisia has been particularly effective, preventing the full deployment of the Allied attacking forces. A military reporter from the Havas News Agency reviewed the general long-term symmetry of Tunisia last night. The Allies had previously expected to launch a major attack with extremely elite forces from the Pichon area towards Kairouan. This has now been realized since Friday. This battle has left a mark on the Tunisian war, as the British and American hope to advance towards Sousse on the Mediterranean coast would pose a serious threat of encirclement to the Axis forces fighting the British Eighth Army in the south. The danger of this threat should not be ignored. Therefore, it has been confirmed that General Patton has shifted the center of gravity of his American Fifth Army to the left flank, which is currently attacking Kairouan. Elite British troops have also joined the American forces in the battle. The French rebel forces in the Ousseltia area slightly to the north have also joined the attack. The far superior Allied forces have passed through Pichon and broken through the Axis lines in several places, but this breakthrough has been contained. The Allied forces continue to increase pressure, especially near Fondouk. The Axis command is currently striving to prevent the Allied forces from breaking through to Sousse. On Friday night, the mobile forces under General Montgomery had crossed the line from Maktar to Mahares. Yesterday morning, the vanguard of British tanks approached the port of Sfax. The constant replenishment of Allied reserves is worthy of attention. General Montgomery has replaced the first batch of attacking troops that broke through the lines four days ago with all fresh troops. The Axis forces have been fighting continuously for many weeks and in difficult conditions, especially with the enemy's air superiority continuing to increase. The entire British First Army has now joined the fighting in northern Tunisia. The center of this war is still in the area of Djebel Cheddada and Medjez el Bab, and the mountainous area north of the road. The German mountain warfare troops stationed in that area have contained the British First Army's eastward advance. The mountain range in the area extends westward, posing a major obstacle to the left flank of General Anderson's forces fighting in the coastal area. Therefore, the British commander is attempting to clear it first. The British army has not yet achieved a decisive victory, and the war is continuing.

### Litvinov Arrives in Cuba, Dissatisfied with British and American Warfare

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - Soviet Ambassador to the United States and Envoy to Cuba Litvinov recently arrived in Havana. He expressed dissatisfaction with the British and American war efforts and warned against underestimating the Axis's support. Regarding post-war issues, he said that the most important thing is to have a proper perspective and not allow these issues to overshadow the main purpose of the war. At the same time, after Cuba resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the Cuban president immediately granted the Cuban Communist Party legal status.

### Wife of the Iron Lung Man to Give Birth Again in August

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Miami, Florida, the wife of iron lung patient Snyder announced yesterday that she will give birth again in August. The iron lung man suffered from paralysis in 1936 and has since lived in an iron lung. He returned to the United States from the Far East in 1937 and lived in Chicago. He married in 1939 and had a daughter in September 1940.

### Franco to Tour, Spanish Foreign Minister Meets Italian Ambassador

Spanish Capital, 11th (Central News Agency) - Spanish Head of State General Franco will begin a tour of northwestern Spain on Tuesday.

### Allied Forces in the Near East Launch Counter-Offensive Activities on the European Continent, Rumor Wilson Will Visit Ankara to Exert Coercive Diplomacy on Turkey

Istanbul, 11th (Central News Agency) - Recently, there have been widespread rumors that the Allied forces are attempting to use the Balkans as a foothold for a counter-offensive against Europe, and have therefore been continuously gathering forces in Syria, Palestine, and various islands in the eastern Mediterranean, and intensifying training for landing operations. According to news from Cairo, Wilson, who was transferred from the commander of the Iranian and Iraqi forces to the commander of the British Middle East Forces, has repeatedly held military conferences with Holmes, the commander of the British Ninth Army in Syria, since taking office. Recently, he also met with the British Ambassador to Turkey, Knatchbull-Hugessen, in Jerusalem to hold important discussions on the Turkish issue. Afterward, Wilson and Holmes flew to Cyprus and held an important strategic meeting in Nicosia with British Chief of Staff Brooke and others. All of this can be seen as the Allied forces actively preparing for a counter-offensive against Europe in both military and political terms. The British army on Cyprus seems to be intensely training paratroopers. At the same time, diplomatic work with Turkey is also scheduled to be carried out by Wilson in person during a visit to Ankara. It is not difficult to imagine that Britain is also exerting its coercive diplomacy on Turkey.

### Papen's Transfer Rumor Denied by Germany

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - The rumor that German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen will be transferred to Spain was denied by the German Foreign Ministry yesterday, stating that this rumor occurs every so often and is just as foolish as the rumors of German peace feelers.

### US Military Casualties Since the Start of the War Exceed 70,000

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the US Department of the Army announced yesterday the total losses of the US Navy and Army from the start of the war to April 9, 1943, as follows: Army: 4,612 dead, 8,894 wounded, 6,097 missing, 9,644 captured, totaling 51,247. 943 of the wounded were able to return to the front. Navy: 7,065 dead, 4,660 wounded, 12,973 missing, totaling 24,698.

### Rumor Germany and Italy to Decide on Bombing New York

Rome, 11th (Central News Agency) - In an article in today's Rome Forum, a man named Mormoni stated that the latest German Heinkel bomber can easily fly from its base in France to bomb New York, and predicted that Hitler and Mussolini will soon decide on the time and steps for bombing New York. He said that it is easy for the new bomber to take off from its base in western France and fly to New York. The aircraft is equipped with a 1,000-horsepower engine and can reach New York in 20 hours. Only 40 tons of fuel is needed for the round trip, and German submarines in the Atlantic can provide detailed information about the weather at any time and provide great assistance. This long-distance bombing will deal a great blow to the morale of the American people, and the consequences will certainly be serious.

### Australian Foreign Minister Arrives in Washington

Argentine Capital, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt arrived here on the morning of the 10th and will stay in Washington for three or four weeks to discuss Pacific issues with US authorities. It is rumored that he will also visit London.

### Preparations for Air Defense Drills

The Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters announced on the 9th that air defense drills would be conducted for four days starting from the 12th. Here is a general observation of the preparations for civilian air defense on the Chinese side, under their guidance and supervision, for the majority of Shanghai's four million citizens.

Cooperation System for Air Defense

When the fourth air defense drill is implemented, the unanimous cooperation of Chinese, Japanese, and people of all countries is one of the most important matters. For example, if the local training in the Hongkou area, the concession area, or the western Shanghai area is very excellent, but the results in other areas are not good, then satisfactory civilian air defense for greater Shanghai is still difficult to achieve. Civil defense groups, the Public Works Department, and the municipal government have mutually exchanged liaison officers to the air defense guidance departments in various areas as one of their countermeasures, so that their steps are consistent, in order to obtain better results in the overall training. In view of the special situation in Shanghai where Chinese and foreign people live together, in the fourth air defense drill, it is essential that Chinese and foreign people, especially the Chinese and Japanese people, realize and promote cooperation in air defense.

Air Defense Movement in the Baojia System

The main body of the Japanese side's civilian air defense movement is the newly reorganized self-defense corps. Similarly, the main body of the Chinese side's civilian air defense is, of course, the Baojia self-defense corps. Since the first air defense drill was implemented, the Public Works Department has newly established a traffic air defense section, and has established Baojia sections in each Public Works Department police station. These sections provide guidance for Baojia self-defense activities in peacetime, and guidance for air defense activities during air raids. The number of personnel organized in the Baojia self-defense corps now reaches 178,345. These Baojia self-defense corps members cooperate with the concession air defense guidance authorities and participate in air defense drills. The self-defense corps has also organized a youth division, with 1,436 progressive young people selected through rigorous testing and inspection to receive special training.

This Baojia youth division is of course not directly organized for air defense. Great expectations are held for the active role of this Baojia youth division in peacetime and in emergencies. The division has already formed a temporary air defense team, a fire fighting team, a traffic control team, and a patrol team, and is currently planning to implement special training in air defense and anti-poisoning. Starting at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th, a youth division training conference will be held at the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse under the order of air defense training. In addition, a 500-member Baojia air defense corps specially organized in each district receives guidance and training from the Public Works Department fire brigade, the Baojia guidance department, and the traffic air defense section, and is a powerful organization together with the youth division.

During air defense drills, the concession area also attaches great importance to the formation of Baojia family air defense groups and makes continuous efforts, but it has not yet reached the level of the Japanese side in the Hongkou area and is still in an unfinished stage. Therefore, establishing family air defense groups will be an important task after the fourth drill. But what is most desired is that the cooperation between neighbors in the Baojia system in peacetime should be realized first, so that Baojia air defense can cooperate with each other in the event of an emergency. If the concession area fails to ensure more advanced Baojia cooperation that is more closely related to daily life than the current situation, it will be difficult to expect genuine air defense cooperation.

Training Adapted to Each District

The Public Works Department should adapt to the special geographical and other circumstances under the jurisdiction of each police station, and respect the unique environment of each district. The police station chief should not guide air defense drills apart from the actual life of the people under his jurisdiction.

Among the seven areas, the area with the best results in the past three drills is the Old Zhabei District. This is because this area has many shops, and the various air defense equipment fees are automatically raised by each Baojia, so it has achieved this result. The area in the office district under the jurisdiction of the Central Station is less successful. For example, in the Jing'an Temple Road area, most of the residents are intellectuals, and some who have studied in Japan guide air defense, so it is similar to the Japanese side's civilian air defense. In this way, each district has its own special conditions, and the Public Works Department should use great care to promote its advantages and remove its disadvantages.

The Active Role of the Fire Brigade

As a result of the three air defense drills, both the Japanese and Chinese sides have paid attention to organizing or have already successfully organized family air defense groups, and there are great expectations for the role of family air defense groups in fire prevention and fire extinguishing activities. However, once an accident occurs, family air defense groups alone are obviously not enough to extinguish the fire, so the Public Works Department fire brigade should play an active role.

In order to prepare for cooperation with the civilians during air raids, the Public Works Department fire brigade, in close cooperation with the traffic air defense section, the Baojia guidance department, etc., guides the Baojia self-defense corps in each district under its jurisdiction in their own and the public's fire extinguishing activities. In this drill, great expectations are placed on the activities of the fire brigade.

Strengthening Air Defense Propaganda

In the Public Works Department traffic section, a traffic propaganda team composed of Chinese people goes to factories, roads, and tea houses from time to time to conduct left-hand traffic and other traffic propaganda. This traffic propaganda team will be further expanded into a traffic air defense propaganda team to cultivate the concession residents' attention to civilian air defense.

More than half of the concession residents do not understand written propaganda, so direct oral propaganda is the most effective weapon. Therefore, the establishment of the traffic air defense team must rely on the Baojia system. According to the concession air defense guide, it is very dangerous to implement the same air defense propaganda on the concession residents as it is implemented on the Japanese in a mechanical way. For example, "An air raid is imminent now." This kind of propaganda can of course arouse the fighting spirit of the Japanese, but the impact on the Chinese people after the war will be linked to various rumors, creating a public mentality that "Because we are at war, there are air raids, so being at war is..." In implementing air defense work, it is necessary to put a lot of effort into research on propaganda.

Like this kind of painstaking effort in Sino-Japanese air defense cooperation, Japanese members of the self-defense corps in the Hongkou area have already experienced it, so they are not keen on ensuring superficial joint activities between Chinese and Japanese people. At the same time, they are also considering strengthening the psychological bond within the Chinese and Japanese people, and are taking the lead in practical activities to demonstrate with the determination to "let us set an example first."

Air Defense Drills Are Here Again

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, after repeated training, the time has come to give full play to the power of civilian air defense, to cooperate with the military authorities in air defense, and to fully fulfill our important tasks. Air defense drills will be held for four days starting from April 12. The period of this air defense drill is shorter than the previous one. If it were longer, the shortcomings in the early stage could be overcome in the later stage. But this drill is only four days, and the individual air defense drill is only the first two days. Therefore, before the start of the drill, we should first complete the technical and mental preparation, and try this drill with a particularly tense mood.

### Air Defense Exercise Starts Today; Baojia Mobilized Day and Night; Special Attention Paid to Lookout Duties; Rescue and Fire Extinguishing Equipment to Be Overhauled

Air defense drills will be held again in this city's area for four days starting today (the 12th). The methods have been promulgated separately by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters and the municipal government and the two concession authorities. Citizens must abide by the rules. The Baojia authorities have also ordered their subordinates to prepare for various air defense exercises. In the Public Concession, various preparations to be made are issued by each police station, and the self-defense corps air defense guidelines are roughly the same, including: (1) All air defense equipment, such as water tanks, yellow sand, cotton wool, straw mats, etc., must be fully prepared. (2) The following must be reorganized and reorganized: (A) lookout posts, (B) patrol teams, (C) traffic teams, (D) rescue teams, (E) fire brigades. Those Baojia who had incomplete organizations last winter should be supplemented as much as possible this time. (3) Designate rescue stations, shelters, and lookout post locations, and clearly mark them in front of the doors for identification. (4) Each Baojia should have at least three lookout posts, but if it is a department store such as Wing On Company, one is sufficient. (5) After the alert alarm is issued, the list of personnel in charge of the lookout should be sent to the police station through the Baojia in each district for record. (6) After the alert alarm is issued, those in charge of the lookout post duty should immediately go to the post to provide lookout service and must not leave their posts until the alert alarm is lifted. Each Bao should send the lookout location and the list of lookout personnel to the police station through the Baojia in each district for record. (7) After the alert alarm is issued, each Lianbao must send two liaison officers to the police station (daytime) and the Baojia room (night) for liaison. (8) During the air defense exercise period, self-defense corps members must be on duty day and night. (9) During the air defense exercise period, the Baojia personnel of each Lianbao office should be on duty and work day and night, and each Lianbao should be properly assigned (the police station Baojia Association will also work day and night). (10) Each Lianbao should send ten youth corps members to assist in the service, and the head of each Lianbao should consider the situation and assign and direct the work. (11) Each Lianbao will have day and night offices during the air defense exercise period, and the location and telephone number must be sent to the office. All measures must be followed by each Bao, and the fire control team, air defense security team, surveillance station (i.e. lookout team), air defense fire brigade, air defense liaison team, propaganda team, and health rescue team must be strictly overhauled and fully mobilized from today to take various measures. As for the French Concession, each Lianbao chief is responsible for convening the entire self-defense corps, fire brigade, rescue, etc., to implement air defense work from today, and the methods are the same as the column period.

Emergency Notice from the Municipal Police Bureau The Air Defense Guidance Department of the Municipal Police Headquarters has now issued an emergency notice ordering all police sub-bureaus in their respective districts to supervise and implement air defense training in two phases in accordance with the regulations of the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters of friendly countries. The first phase is to implement individual air defense training based on guidance, and the second phase is to implement general air defense training.

Rescue The locations, equipment conditions, and numbers of all rescue stations and shelters set up within the city limits shall be reported by each police sub-bureau in advance. During the exercise period, each police sub-bureau must organize patrol teams and rescue teams. The number of people should be determined by each sub-bureau based on the complexity of the affairs.

Self-Defense The Nanshi Self-Defense Corps will also start air defense exercises and training on civilian air defense knowledge from today. Under the supervision of the concurrent commander Wang Delin, all sub-teams will be mobilized. The self-defense corps will be divided into patrol teams and will patrol the entire area after the alarm is activated, and will notify the Baojia chiefs. Starting yesterday, they will check the lighting control equipment door-to-door in advance. If Japanese residents in the district do not comply with the authorities' regulations to cover the lights during the exercise period, the sub-team leaders in charge will record the time, location, and door number in accordance with the instructions of Sugiyama, the captain of the Nanshi Military Police, and report to the friendly country for correction.

Fire Extinguishing Recently, a type of fire extinguishing bomb has been approved by the Commissioner of Police of the Public Works Department and can be purchased by citizens in each district. In order to understand its effectiveness, the Xinzhapu Baojia Committee once summoned all Baojia personnel in the district to Zhangyuan to participate in the fire extinguishing bomb exercise. Yesterday, the Xinzhapu Baojia District Committee distributed the fire extinguishing bombs to each Bao, with 30 to 40 pieces per Bao, and ordered them to be sold to each Jia and household. The price is 50 yuan per piece, but it is a voluntary purchase and not mandatory. The proceeds must be handed over to the District Committee for collection and transfer.

### Conversation with Air Defense Authorities

The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters has issued a notice announcing that civilian air defense training will be held continuously for four days starting today (the 12th). Based on past experience, the air defense headquarters authorities made a special statement yesterday, hoping that all sectors will pay attention to the following matters and further strengthen sincere cooperation. (1) In view of the specificity of Shanghai, in order to achieve perfect civilian air defense, the cooperation and cooperation of all nations is extremely important, which goes without saying. It is hoped that each self-defense corps will make mutual efforts to practice the unity of all national minds, and never hinder the spirit of concerted cooperation due to temporary narrow emotions, and violate the original meaning of civilian air defense. (2) Regarding the composition of the self-defense corps air defense personnel and the activities of the family mass team, it is hoped that the self-defense corps will cooperate fully with various government offices and companies. Employees of government offices and various companies should be air defense personnel at their places of service, which goes without saying, but they must also provide guidance on air defense matters to the self-defense corps or family air defense teams. In addition to spiritual cooperation, government offices and various companies should, when necessary, dispatch personnel who are temporarily not hindering the current tasks to serve as air defense personnel of the self-defense corps or family air defense instructors to cooperate jointly in order to fully develop the effectiveness of activities. At the same time, it is hoped that the self-defense corps and family air defense groups will also make proper arrangements for their composition and training as soon as possible in order to achieve the goal of being able to fully operate without relying on these service personnel.

### Authorities Rectify Fire Administration; In View of Recent Fires, Dangerous Goods Will Be Prohibited; Unreasonable Housing Situations Will Also Be Banned; Newest Firefighting Equipment Has Arrived

Since the beginning of this year, Jing Shuiqing, the president of the Shanghai Fire Brigade, has strived to innovate the firefighting equipment of the fire administration and has also advised residents to improve their fire prevention equipment as much as possible.

A Large Batch of Firefighting Equipment Arrives According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the Shanghai Fire Administration recently transported a large batch of firefighting equipment from other places. It is found that this firefighting equipment, including automatic steel ladders and water jet cages, are all newly manufactured and are very effective in firefighting. At 7:30 yesterday morning, the Fire Administration personnel tested them near the Park Hotel on Park Road, and the results were very satisfactory.

Normal Equipment Is Considered Insufficient At the same time, it is also heard that the Fire Brigade authorities expressed great regret for the fire that occurred on Guizhou Road, which resulted in more than 30 casualties. Although the firefighters made every effort to put out the fire at that time, they were ultimately unable to put it out immediately. The Fire Administration authorities believe that the lesson of this time is entirely due to the lack of thorough fire prevention equipment for the people at ordinary times. It also said that there were too many residents in the building, so many people did not hear the news and escape when the fire broke out.

Prohibit the Storage of Dangerous Goods In view of this, in addition to making every effort to innovate fire administration affairs, the authorities will pay close attention to residents' fire prevention equipment in the future and will conduct a large-scale investigation of the storage of dangerous goods, and ban the situation where there are few houses and many people, and other unreasonable housing situations.

### Municipal Grain Bureau Allots Special Rice at 375 Yuan Per Bag

The Municipal Grain Bureau has been ordered to be reorganized this time in order to adapt to the wartime food system, and the internal personnel have also been adjusted separately, resulting in the delay of the special allocation of community food rice last month. According to the Central News Agency reporter, the Grain Bureau has allocated this rice according to the determined quantity. Yesterday, it sent separate letters to each community to quickly pay the money and issue the rice. The previous price was 315 yuan per bag, plus a hemp bag guarantee of 50 yuan each. After the household rice price changed, the price of this rice was also re-regulated by the bureau to 375 yuan per bag, plus the hemp bag guarantee.

### Population Entry and Exit in the French Concession; Householders Must Not Conceal; If Jia Chief Obtains Information and Reports, Lianbao Chief Shall Be Fully Responsible

According to a reporter's investigation with the French authorities, citizens entering and exiting the concession must immediately apply for a travel permit and report to the police station. If the householder conceals or delays the report, he shall be severely punished. If the Jia chief has obtained information and reports it to the Lianbao office, the Lianbao chief shall be fully responsible for the responsibility.

### Coal Jin to Be Rationed Again

The coal jin of spot goods required daily by each coal retailer has been allocated by the Dazhong Lian Coal Company in accordance with the regulations. It is now learned that the Dazhong Lian Coal Company will schedule the distribution of the ninth batch of coal jin again, designating three types: (1) Yangquan lumps, (2) Liuquan lumps, and (3) Dashan lumps. As for the selling price per ton, the total allocation of tons, and the amount that each household should receive, they are still being negotiated separately and will be officially decided within the day. The reporter also learned from another source that the source of raw materials (coal fines) used to make coal balls is still continuously on the way, mostly from production areas such as Korea. The production of spot goods in each factory is the same as in the past, and the manufacturing cost has not increased, so the relevant authorities will earnestly implement the standard price limit for coal balls, which is 25 yuan per dan (100kg) in Central Reserve Notes.

### Large-Scale Clearing Operation Launched; Pickpockets Arrested and Deported; Large Number of Thieves Released from Huade Road Prison; Main Reason for Recent Rampant Pickpocketing

In order to decide to drive pickpockets out of the Public Concession, the Police Department launched a pickpocket clearing operation yesterday. Colorful slogans were posted in various public places, and a large number of plainclothes detectives were dispatched to investigate pickpocketing activities in the concession.

Determine to Let Residents Understand Prevention According to the Police Department Director, after this pickpocket clearing operation, all pickpockets will be arrested. The scope of this operation by the police is much wider than the last one, not just posting slogans on the walls, but also determining that all Shanghai residents can understand effective methods of pickpocketing prevention.

Tram Company Cooperates Jointly

It is pointed out that for some people who want to try their pickpocketing skills, the authorities are holding this clearing operation to warn them of their vile psychology. It is also learned that the Shanghai Tram Company and other groups and agencies have been notified by the police to cooperate jointly in strictly preventing the activities of petty thieves.

Sudden Increase in Theft Cases Main Reason

Regarding the sudden increase in pickpocketing cases, the Police Department Director explained that the main reason is that a large number of thieves were recently released from Huade Road Prison. Because these people have served their sentences, they have no way to make a living after being released, so they engage in this kind of activity. Although, the losses suffered by those who encounter pickpocketing are usually only between ten yuan and one hundred yuan, and at most no more than five hundred yuan.

### Short Commentary: Air Defense Drills are Our Own Business

Starting today, the city will hold four consecutive days of air defense drills. The authorities have already promulgated regulations and announced that citizens must strictly abide by them.

"Air defense drills," this is already the fourth time. Everyone has a further understanding of the technical and mental preparations for air defense. Therefore, the results of this drill should show progress compared to the previous ones.

Our Shanghai is an important city in a wartime country. In the sense of war, it is very likely to suffer enemy air raids. There is no need to avoid talking about this, nor is it alarmist. However, the fact that there have been no air raids to this day is fortunate. In order to cope with real air raids, continuous drills are needed. If everyone has air defense knowledge and the ability to remain calm in the event of an emergency, the damage and loss during air raids can be reduced.

Do not think that the drills are "fake" and therefore not care or follow the rules. Without the experience of mock drills, there is no skill to cope with real air raids.

Most importantly, "air defense" should be regarded as something that concerns every citizen personally, rather than something extra that military and political authorities force us to do. We must understand this point and participate in air defense drills with the mentality of "doing something for ourselves," accepting all the rules that should be followed.

### Economic Sector

The Japanese government, for the second time funding the development of the Southern Gold Treasury, recently issued 50 million yuan of 3.5% public bonds. The Japanese government's investment in the Jin Kang (Gold Treasury) has reached 60 million yuan.

### Commentary: Thorough Investigation of Speculation Targets

The National Government's clear order to severely investigate hoarding can be said to be a major event in the economic sector, and even a sensational event, because the focus of this investigation is the economic sector itself - "major officials of financial institutions engaged in speculative trading."

We often hear people say that a certain place hoards daily necessities with a total value exceeding tens of thousands of yuan in currency, that a certain place hoards edible oil sufficient for the entire population of Shanghai for several years, and that a certain place hoards soap sufficient for the entire population of Shanghai for several years. The basis of these rumors, of course, cannot be confirmed, but whether they can be brought to light depends entirely on whether the personnel in charge of the investigation prioritize law over personal relationships.

Speaking of the targets of this investigation into hoarding, we know that financial institutions are the main body, but to do it strictly and effectively, attention should be paid to the targets within this target. Assuming it is a bank, its warehouses and factories must be investigated, and its cargo yards must be investigated. Insurance companies must investigate their warehouse policyholders. Key employees must investigate the warehouses with which they have dealings, and even the residences of themselves and their relatives and friends. These are all targets within the target.

Only such an investigation method can be considered thorough, and the results of such a thorough investigation would be: (1) Those who have already hoarded will find it difficult to escape the law, (2) Those who are hoarding will collapse at the mere sight of trouble, (3) Those who are preparing to hoard will lose their color in fear, and the overall result will be the eradication of hoarding and the stabilization of commodity prices.

### Municipal Economic Bureau Thoroughly Stabilizes Prices, Strictly Investigates Speculation and Manipulation

Central News Agency, Shanghai: In view of the ever-increasing commodity prices in the city, which seem to have no end, although this is caused by general businesses privately raising prices and creating black markets, the biggest reason is actually hoarding. These hoarders, whether they are merchants or private individuals, speculate and manipulate, monopolize the market, and fuel prices, harming businesses and people, which is extremely hateful. It is heard that the Municipal Economic Bureau regards suppressing and stabilizing prices as an important task at present. To solve the problem at its root, it is necessary to crack down on hoarders. It has already sent personnel to conduct strict investigations. Once they are discovered, they will be punished in accordance with central laws and regulations. At the same time, it will reward citizens who know the facts and report them. If the reports are verified, rewards will be given according to regulations. The bureau believes that this case is a fundamental strategy for suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods, and hopes that all citizens of the city will provide as much assistance as possible.

### Ministry of Food Promotes Wartime Food Control and Distribution

Since its establishment, the Ministry has made many plans for food administration. A Central News Agency reporter visited Vice Minister Zhou the other day to inquire about wartime food issues, production controls, distribution, and consumption. Vice Minister Zhou provided very detailed answers.

### Cracking Down on Speculation and Hoarding, Banks Cautiously Handling Collateral Loans, Loan Transactions Must Be Reported to Authorities

In order to thoroughly crack down on speculation and hoarding, the government has dispatched Chen Zhishuo, Vice Minister of Finance, and others to thoroughly investigate loans from various banks and businesses. At the same time, in order to prevent the use of commodities as collateral for financing, all banks and money houses are seriously implementing the new loan methods agreed upon by the United Association of Banks and Money Houses. The collateral of borrowers is limited to those that do not violate current laws and regulations and do not promote hoarding and speculation. The selection of collateral, valuation discounts, and other factors are particularly carefully considered. The term is negotiated by both parties depending on the nature of the collateral, but must not exceed three months. It is also limited to members of trade associations, factories, companies, and businesses. All banks and businesses must report the following items to the trade association for submission to the competent authorities for record when providing collateral for goods: (1) The name of the borrower's company or business and the name of its representative; (2) The amount of the loan; (3) The term of the loan; (4) The name and quantity of the collateral; (5) The location of the collateral storage; (6) The registration number of the borrower's company or business, or proof of membership in the relevant trade association. In addition, the United Reserve Committee of Banks and the United Reserve Treasury of Money Houses have tightened the lending of funds to member banks and businesses. Applicants must explain the legitimate purpose before acceptance is approved. The term of lending must not exceed ten days. For those providing collateral with assets, each bank or business is limited to 25% of the total amount approved by the association.

### Exchange Between Mengjiang and Central China Adopts Special Yuan

Zhangjiakou, 11th (Central News Agency): The exchange settlement between Mengjiang and Central China used to be based on military notes. Now, because Central China and South China have stopped issuing military notes, it has been changed to two types of settlement methods: Central Reserve Notes and Special Yuan. However, for convenience, the Mengjiang side is adopting the same special settlement method as Manchuria. After consultations with the Central China side, both parties have recently reached an understanding. Therefore, from now on, the trade and non-trade receipts and payments between Mengjiang and Central China will all be settled in Special Yuan.

### Shanghai Financial, Industrial, and Market Conditions Last Week Gradually Declined, Credit Tightened, and Overnight Lending Rates Rose

Central News Agency, Shanghai: Shanghai's financial, industrial, and market conditions last week gradually declined under the strict implementation of controls by the authorities. Some daily necessities saw price increases. The reason for this is nothing more than the manipulation of speculators and hoarders. However, after the government ordered personnel to come to Shanghai to investigate speculative trading and hoarding merchants on Wednesday, illegal merchants panicked and sought to unload their goods. Moreover, banks and money houses refused to provide collateral loans, credit tightened, and the market showed a situation of oversupply. Prices became increasingly soft. Interbank lending rates rose to two cents. It is heard that black markets in various industries completely stopped in the second half of the week, and the official prices of various goods remained stable.

### Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Remit Funds to Their Home Country, Limited to 50 Vietnamese Dong Per Person

Other staff members have also been determined, and various preparations have been completed. Business began on the morning of the 10th inside the Central Reserve Bank.

Hangzhou: Paper goods are produced in Fuyang, with yellow and white types. The quality of each material varies, so the selling price is also different. Sales are quite extensive, especially during the spring when merchants come to Hangzhou to purchase, so the market situation has been particularly brisk recently.

The United Association of Cotton Products Industries in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has been actively preparing since the Ministry of Industry designated 50 initiators, including Man Luxian.

### Reactions to the Thorough Investigation of Speculation and Hoarding

Chen Zhishuo, Vice Minister of Finance, Yuan Yuguai, Vice Minister of Industry, and others who were entrusted by the National Government to come to Shanghai with the important task of thoroughly investigating speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, immediately began their investigation work after arriving in Shanghai. They have completed the investigation of bank account books and began inspecting insurance companies on the 10th. It is expected that inspections of business companies will begin around the 11th. As of now, the preliminary investigation results and the reactions of the financial and industrial circles in the concession are roughly as follows:

(1) Results of Inspection of Financial Institutions and Their Reactions

The results of the inspection of the clearing house on the 4th and the inspection of financial institutions on the 9th revealed that some banks had paid huge checks for hoarding materials. It is reported that some large banks related to important political figures are included. How the National Government will deal with this has become the focus of public attention. If the relationship banks that occupy an important position in politics issue checks for the purpose of purchasing materials and ignore them by political pretext, and only a few ordinary Chinese merchant banks are punished, then it is expected that considerable waves will be caused in the Shanghai financial community. What the financial community hopes and advocates now is that instead of cleaning up the private economic sector, it is better to clean up the large financial institutions with government power as their background.

(2) Impact on Commodity Prices

Since the order from the chairman to thoroughly investigate speculation and hoarding was issued, the trend of soaring commodity prices has been corrected, and the upward trend has stopped for a while. It is generally believed that this is due to the financial institutions stopping or reducing the issuance of checks for the purpose of hoarding goods. The current high commodity prices are not solely caused by currency inflation. The fundamental reason lies in the purchase and hoarding by a part of the force. At the same time, most people believe that if this thorough investigation only cleans up the local private economy and ends there, then commodity prices will rebound. In terms of price policy, it is hoped that there will be a fundamental solution.

(3) Handling of Business Companies, etc.

How to thoroughly investigate and deal with the business companies that are dominated by Shanghai financial giants and have close relations with important figures in the National Government is what the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles are most concerned about. At a time when production is sluggish, the emerging financial cliques in Shanghai have successively established enterprise groups and various business companies, forming separate units of financial institutions. In order to defend themselves, their combination with political figures cannot necessarily be determined to be improper, but when they combine with political forces and become speculative activity groups that hinder the stability of people's livelihoods, they must not be ignored in the policy of restoring Shanghai's economy. The authorities have successively established financial inspection agencies and insurance administrations to supervise financial institutions and insurance companies, but the business companies between finance and enterprise are still allowed to be established like bamboo shoots after a rain. If it is said that all should be restricted, it is also inappropriate in terms of the current situation of the concession's financial industry. Therefore, everyone hopes that unsound business companies should be dealt with decisively.

(4) Comprehensive Reaction

As a result, this incident has given the general public in the concession an unexpected and profound reaction. People believe that if this thorough investigation is half-hearted and ends hastily, then the economic policy of the National Government, which has worked so hard to establish the National Commercial Control General Association and wants to embark on the path of national capital's autonomous mobilization, will encounter obstacles, and it is feared that in the worst-case scenario, it will also promote political and economic confrontation between the government and the people. Therefore, at this moment, the National Government should take the "spirit of self-condemnation" shown by Chairman Wang to carry out a major political purge. This is what the economic circles in the concession earnestly pray for. (Yun Peng: Translated from the April 11th Dalu Xinbao)

### Translated Commentary: The Key to Cracking Down on Speculation

After the National Government's order to investigate speculation was announced, the investigation of banks, insurance companies, business companies, etc. began. Although this move has been delayed, it should still be encouraged and welcomed. The National Government has stated that anyone who engages in hoarding and speculation, poisons society, and disrupts the market, regardless of whether they are officials or civilians, will be severely punished, and they have quickly begun to implement this. Everyone is willing to applaud the National Government's strict and impartial attitude.

There is an unknown amount of speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, and it is impossible to quickly resolve it all at once. However, whether these purchases and hoarding are directly carried out by banks, insurance companies, business companies, etc., or are carried out by private individuals through banks, insurance companies, business companies, etc. is a very clear fact. However, it is a well-known fact that these speculators have strong political backgrounds and openly disregard the public orders of the Public Works Department and others. How easy is it to crack down on speculation without the direct intervention of the National Government? Fortunately, the National Government announced an order to investigate and punish and immediately began the investigation. Judging from the current situation of speculative activities in Shanghai, this is a very appropriate measure.

The key to cracking down on speculation is to impartially punish anyone who engages in large-scale speculation, hoards important materials, poisons society, and disrupts the market, regardless of whether they are officials or civilians. If some are punished and others escape, speculation cannot be completely eradicated. The people responsible for the thorough investigation are all experienced and knowledgeable people, and they are also people with high reputations. However, they have considerable relationships with the Shanghai financial community. Once they act impartially and without favoritism, they will inevitably be resented and scolded. Therefore, they must first have a spirit of self-condemnation, break through personal relationships, and think deeply, so that no one who commits crimes escapes the law. Similarly, speculative elements should not be allowed to enjoy impunity and become rich, while others are imprisoned and subjected to sanctions alone. They should be treated impartially and in accordance with the law.

At the same time, there is another point that should be considered, that is, the investigation must be thorough. Looking back at the results of previous crackdowns on speculation, most of them were half-hearted and ended without results. At the beginning, the momentum was fierce, but in the end, nothing was gained. If this thorough investigation of speculation repeats the same mistake, it must be understood that its negative repercussions will be extremely serious. It is better not to crack down on speculation than to fail to achieve its effect and instead induce large-scale speculation, leading to an irreparable end. Just like commodity prices, merchants adjust their prices according to the noise about cracking down on speculation. If the noise is tight, the price is low, and if the noise is loose, the price rises. The actual situation of the crackdown gives speculators opportunities and psychology, and there is a risk of causing commodity prices to rebound. Those in charge of the thorough investigation should consider this point.

Because of the vigorous crackdown on speculation, it is expected that some gaps will inevitably arise between the Shanghai financial community, especially national capital, and the National Government. However, this is an unavoidable transitional phenomenon and must be forgiven in order to alleviate the suffering of the people. However, it should be noted that the crackdown and investigation must be fair and strict, so that national capital is in awe of the fairness of the crackdown. It is worth mentioning the dignity of the law. The crackdown should be implemented fairly, strictly, thoroughly, and with emphasis on the law rather than personal relationships. This is what we deeply hope for from the National Government. (Yun Peng: Translated from the April 11th Dalu Xinbao)

### The Child's Spring

— Zu Ren

The silk reeling machine roared, like a monster crouching on the ground. A ten-horsepower motor dragged its gears, and it performed its task with a clattering roar.

A Yuan was responsible for managing it. At this time, he was grabbing handfuls of waste silk with his small hands and carefully feeding them into the monster's mouth. He watched the waste silk slowly swallowed, swallowed, and finally completely swallowed up. He then put down the second handful, the third, the fourth... Handfuls, this monster was like it would never be satisfied.

He had been mingling with this monster for several years, so the surprise and curiosity he felt when he first saw it gradually faded with the long years. His good feelings for it gradually decreased. He felt it was too selfish and did not consider his fatigue at all, just greedily opening its mouth all day long, requiring him to feed its never-filling stomach for twelve hours a day, without stopping for a moment. He gradually felt ordinary, tired, and disappointed with his work.

He sometimes simply hated it, because he felt that since he had been close to it, his plump face had gradually become thin, and his blood-red complexion had gradually become pale. What made him most uncomfortable was the wool shavings flying all over the room. Although he wore a mask, he would still inhale them into his nostrils, which were itchy and uncomfortable. His jet-black hair had also turned gray. His clothes never had a clean day.

Especially the ruthless factory regulations had exploited him and deprived him of his inherent innocence and liveliness. Although he was still a child, he had completely lost the activity that a child should have.

In the dim light, he looked out through the window hole with his no longer flexible eyes. Outside, it was an enticing spring season. Kites of various colors were flying in the blue sky. In the sunshine, there must be many lucky children jumping!

The kites were high! Far away! They took away A Yuan's fixed gaze.

The warm wind in March revealed the news of spring and also awakened A Yuan's heart, which had lost the breath of childhood. He said softly, "It's spring!"

Yes! It's spring! But here, spring has long been lost. The dim light, the turbid air, combined with the dull breath of the silk reeling machine, did not have a trace of the vitality of spring, nor any of the joy of spring. It was always so sad.

Spring is for children, but A Yuan does not have spring.

### Remembering Children's Day

— Yuan Ying

Occasionally, one or two cotton-like white clouds drift across the pale blue sky. In the afternoon, the sun shines lazily.

Sometimes a gentle breeze blows, and no one can tell where it comes from or where it goes, only that there is a soft, fluffy feeling on their faces, like a piece of velvet brushing past.

The pond by the railway wrinkles lazily.

Then one smells a fragrance of wildflowers drifting from the other side of the railway, with a hint of fishiness.

The weather is neither cold nor hot; it is a very pleasant spring.

Xiao Hong spent a long time searching for Jin Di by the fence at the entrance of the park. She was gazing intently through the fence, as if watching a peep show!

"Jin Di! Mom wants you to come back! You'll be going across the bridge with Dad later!"

"Sister! Come and look!" Jin Di didn't hear Xiao Hong.

"What's so interesting!" Xiao Hong pouted like an adult.

On a lawn inside the fence, twenty or thirty children were gathered in a large circle. Two female teachers stood in the middle, gesticulating and lecturing, but Xiao Hong couldn't hear what they were saying. She only saw them clapping their hands, singing, laughing and holding hands, walking around in a circle... The two children didn't speak, silently watching, watching.

"Sister!" Jin Di couldn't help but speak first, "If only we could go in and play one day!"

Ignoring her sister, she suddenly remembered her mother's words, "Let's go! Let's go back! You have to go to Zhoujiaqiao to sell rice with Dad!"

Jin Di still didn't hear. She turned around and watched a large group of people getting off a military vehicle. A girl about eleven or twelve years old, about the same age as Xiao Hong, wearing a red dress and holding her one-year-old brother in a green woolen sweater, was walking towards them.

"It would be so nice if Mao Tou wasn't thrown away!" Looking at the receding figure, Xiao Hong thought of the baby brother who was just born yesterday and was taken away by her father: "Next time we can also take him to the park, sit on the grass, sing, play,..."

"Really! Dad is so strange!" Jin Di also became sad: "It's such a shame to throw away such a good little Mao Tou, really!"

"Dad said it's strange that he was born at the wrong time. Who told him to be born into our family?... He said, in these times..."

"Xiao Hong!... Jin Di!..." Gen Di ran over from behind: "I, I've been looking for you for a long time! Your mother is calling you back!... There are so many people in the park today!... Do you know why?..."

"What's going on?" Xiao Hong and Jin Di widened their eyes at the same time.

"I asked Old Man Yang at the park entrance. He said today is some kind of Children's Day, and all the elementary school students in Shanghai have come to the park for a meeting!"

"Children's Day?" Jin Di asked, not understanding, "What Children's Day?"

"Never mind that! Let's go back! Mom will scold us again in a bit!" Xiao Hong was the first to run.

Jin Di bumped into an adult by accident.

"Little devil! Little rascal! May someone die in your house!"

She ran into her own roadside shack in one breath. Her father had already returned and was packing peanuts for a customer. Her mother was sitting on the bed sewing a small "safety jacket" for Jin Di.

"Little devil! Where did you die!" Her mother, who had just given birth, didn't even have the strength to scold people: "Those who are called don't come, and those who are calling aren't here!"

"Mom!" Jin Di hurriedly told her mother what she had seen. "Mom! There are so many people in the park today! Today is some kind of... Children's Day, and all the students in Shanghai are lining up to come, and there are so many..."

"None of your business!" Her mother seemed unwilling to listen: "They have money, of course they can celebrate any holiday! You! You don't have that luck!... Quickly take off your cotton coat and put this on! Go buy rice with your dad!"

"Mom!" Jin Di unbuttoned her cotton coat. "Can I go to the park one day too?... With my sister, Gen Di, Hua Zi,..."

"Get lost!" Her father, who had been waiting impatiently beside her, said: "You're dreaming! Do we belong in those places?... I'm telling you, you have a bad fate; you have to help the adults with work! Like Xiao Hong, she knows how to do business. Gen Di is only one year older than you, and he's already selling rice with his dad. You, at eight or nine years old, still only know how to run around all day long!"

"I can also pack peanuts!..." Jin Di pouted and walked onto the road with her father.

"Are there a lot of people at the park entrance? Xiao Hong!" Her mother suddenly asked.

"A lot!" Xiao Hong replied excitedly: "Many, many times more than usual!"

"Bring the basket! Take some peanuts and beans to sell!"

"Business will definitely be good!" Xiao Hong couldn't wait for her mother to tell her this; "But, there's no one at home, I'll go call Gen Di..."

"No need! You go! I'll get up!" Her mother propped herself up from the bed.

Seeing that her mother's eyes were swollen again, Xiao Hong guessed that her mother must have cried again. Really! Even Xiao Hong wanted to cry. Yesterday morning, the adorable baby brother was born, but Dad and Mom whispered for a while and then he took him away. After a while, Dad came back empty-handed, and Mom cried and cried - she must have cried again just now!

It would be so nice if she could also carry her brother on her back like Gen Di, and go around to the east and west, and have people say, "Look! Their little Mao Tou is so chubby!"... (To be continued in the next issue)

### Undutiful Children

— Fang Qiong

Uncle Hu Zi was truly angry today; he didn't even eat dinner, standing at the back door staring straight at the sky. He didn't care about the noisy clamor in this small street alley; he only looked at the thin clouds racing across the horizon, silently shaking his head, looking defeated as if he was recalling something. He stood there like that, standing and standing, until the night quietly emerged from the east like a gray wolf, leaving the elongated shadows of dusk in the human realm like footprints, before he finally returned to the room.

He couldn't bear to stay in the room; here it was empty and silent, making it seem even more damp and dim, emitting waves of moldy odor; he paced around the room, unable to sit still, and finally he gently knocked on my door and pushed it open, coming in.

"Uncle, come in and sit down! Have you had dinner?"

I knew he had been feeling down recently, especially today when he got angry with his children at lunchtime. So I happily welcomed him.

He nodded slightly to me and sat down heavily on the large wooden stool opposite me. He stared straight at the books I had spread out on the table in front of me; he seemed a little regretful that he had bothered me. I understood what he meant, and I said obediently:

"After dinner, you should take a walk and relax. It's great that you came!"

"You're good, you're really diligent! You're always reading and writing at home..."

"If there's nothing else to do, I can only read books, it's stifling!"

"With a girl like you, parents should be very blessed! You're smart, talented, and will have a bright future!"

"You flatter me, Uncle Hu Zi. Your Xiù Qín, Mǐn Shēng, and little Hú Táo..."

"Don't mention them anymore. Those aren't children; they're just a bunch of debt collectors."

As he spoke, his expression was filled with endless resentment, and his long whiskers fluttered beneath his nose with each breath. I understood his state of mind, but I ended up saying the wrong thing. At this moment, I felt at a loss as to how to comfort him.

Uncle Hu Zi's family consisted of two daughters and one son. Before the war, they lived in a peaceful hometown, but after fleeing to Shanghai that year, they barely managed to survive. Gradually, the family of four's life became unable to withstand the endless cycle of rising prices, and they began to fall apart.

"Our family is the richest and most famous clan in XX, our status is almost worthy of being recorded in history books, tracing back nearly thirty years. You now..."

Uncle Hu Zi had scolded his children with these words more than once or twice, but his eldest daughter, Xiù Qín, shrugged her shoulders and replied to him:

"Who cares about that? We don't have any money to use right now!"

So she put on some powder and lipstick, dressed flamboyantly, and went out.

His son, Mǐn Shēng, didn't look like his father, nor did he look like his sister. He didn't talk much at home, but when he did, he would spout a whole string of grand principles. When he heard his father's scolding, he smiled at him:

"Dad, this isn't a glorious process. All of this should be buried in the past years forever, forever forgotten."

The father didn't understand what his son was babbling about and looked at him in confusion. But he only felt that his son wasn't his own either, and was just as disobedient, never home all day.

Little Hú Táo was a fifteen-year-old girl, innocent and lively. She could listen to her sister's words and dress up, or she could be influenced by her brother's group of friends to choose a different path in life from her sister. So little Hú Táo was either with her sister or out and about with her brother.

The three children were all running wild like hares in March, never to be seen.

In less than half a month, Uncle Hu Zi officially heard these words:

"Xiù Qín is working as a dance hostess at the XX dance hall!"

The news made his heart clench in his chest as if it was being squeezed by a pair of pliers, leaving him breathless. Today, as lunchtime was approaching, Uncle Hu Zi warned his children:

"You're not allowed to go out from now on! I want you to sit at home, none of you are allowed to leave!"

"What are we supposed to do at home?" Xiù Qín was fiery, and her words were full of anger from the moment they left her mouth.

"I don't want you to do anything. Read some books at home, haven't you studied before?"

"Oh, you want to be refined now! Where are the books you threw away? I don't have that kind of luck. If there's nothing to eat, are we supposed to gnaw on books?"

"Are you going to become a dance hostess to survive?"

"If it can help me survive, isn't that good enough?"

"Shameless, shameless..."

"If hunger is coiling around your neck like a giant snake, are you going to pretend to care about books and family status..."

Father and daughter argued more and more fiercely without holding back. Mǐn Shēng, however, took out the food and ate by himself. In Sun Tzu's Art of War, speed is paramount, and he planned to sneak out the door during the commotion. But suddenly, a voice rang out towards his corner:

"Mǐn Shēng, don't run off as soon as you're done eating; you're never at home, where do you go all day?"

Mǐn Shēng glanced at his father, but didn't respond. It wasn't that he was timid, but rather that he skillfully avoided those sharp words.

After this argument, Xiù Qín simply didn't eat her meal. She washed her face, put on makeup, dressed up for a while, and ran out. Mǐn Shēng took little Hú Táo and quietly slipped out the back door as well. Uncle Hu Zi watched their backs, panting. His breathing came hoarsely from his chest, like wind passing through a blacksmith's bellows. No matter how angry he was, he couldn't keep this group of stubborn, undutiful children from leaving.

He never understood that his children, like old snakes, were shedding their skin in the midst of suffering and distress, shedding that old, wrinkled, colorless outer layer. But they were each moving forward along their own paths in life—this was what each of them had silently decided and what shone clearly in the gloomy light of their hungry eyes, regardless of whether they were choosing a smooth road or a dirty trap!

### Father's Hair Has Turned White — One of the Undecided Drafts

— Shǐ Tíng

Father's hair has turned gray,
Like withered grass on the wilderness
Eroded by deep autumn;
It can no longer cover his balding head,
His gray hair is too sparse!

Under the dim yellow light
They shimmer with a dull glow,
I silently count his years—
He is only forty-three years old!

He forces himself to write,
Struggling to pry open
Those tightly stuck eyelids,
I see in his eyes
Filled with blood!

Casting a pleading light towards me,
This pleading gaze!
Awakens endless memories;—
I still remember:

Father's hair has turned white,
The hair of his soul has also
Turned gray!

But, with what shall I
Receive that pleading light,
The solace of his soul?

I feel my spirit sinking!

The son is no stronger than the father,
Am I to still hold out the pleading light,
Like Father,
Head bowed,

He writes, writes, writes…
Barely supporting his strength;
Through the silence of the deep night,
I often hear his bitter cough
And heavy sigh,
I understand this cough, this sigh
How intimate it is!

Father caresses his son, long ill in bed,
In the deep night of that Little West Lake;
I still remember:
His mourning voice:
'Father's life is over,
All buried in the muddy river of life!
My hope
Is all entrusted to you!'

Yes,
Cast towards the next generation?!

### In the Back Alley

— Zhé Yōng

Sunlight never descends on this corner,
Mottled plaster walls display ancient scars,
Morning, evening, foul water and filth,
This abandoned group,
Another corner beyond the foreign concession.

The candy seller once extended sympathy—
To past vicissitudes;
Now, gentlemen disdain to glance,
The city noises outside have long drowned out the alley's groans,
The gears of the era rhythm out a double symphony—elimination, rebirth.

Lingering smoke fills the corner—fleeting, like life,
Past, present, future.
Intermittent memories only increase the sorrow,
This meteoric life, south, east, west, north,
Gray, dim emotions contrast with this gray, dim appearance.
