### A Discussion on Two Types of Pro-Japanese Factions

Yesterday, Mr. Tosuke Yoshida specially wrote a commentary for this newspaper titled "Two Types of Pro-Japanese Factions." He praised the first type of pro-Japanese faction, those who "sacrifice honor, which is more important than life, to seek a way out for the survival of the nation," whom he considers to be true Chinese patriots. He criticized the second type of pro-Japanese faction, those who "never had any honor to sacrifice from the beginning and are willing to do anything for money," who are the "traitors" bitterly hated by the general Chinese population. Mr. Yoshida's commentary is intended for Chinese readers, and from it, we can see the sincere opinions of a Japanese person who truly stands on a position of equality and friendship. We firmly believe that there are many Japanese friends who share Mr. Yoshida's love for both Japan and China, and who share his sentiments of admiring the first type of pro-Japanese faction and hating the second type. Standing on the position of promoting Chinese friendship, we find it necessary to further elaborate on this topic.

The prevalence of the term "pro-Japanese faction" has been around for decades. Whether the Japanese side truly understands it has always been a question. Often, due to policy needs at a certain time or a temporary gut feeling that a certain group is beneficial to Japan, they are labeled as a pro-Japanese faction and trusted, or efforts are made to elevate their status in various aspects of China without questioning their background or their true intentions. This seems to be the most common situation in the history of Sino-Japanese relations in the last two or three decades. The stories of Yuan Shikai, Zhang Zuolin, and others in the past, who were considered pro-Japanese factions, only served to increase misunderstandings between the two peoples and create unfortunate events for both sides. Amid these painful memories, we believe that there should be many people in the current Japanese authorities with the same understanding as Mr. Yoshida. In reality, there should only be one type of pro-Japanese, and that is the kind of person who truly loves China, understands Japan, and hopes to use Sino-Japanese cooperation to repel the common enemies of both countries. Because the motives of those who do not even love their own country are highly suspect, and it is foreseeable that they will not benefit Japan. Or even if they have the noble motives of loving their own country and being pro-Japanese, but in reality, they have no understanding of Japan, as Mr. Yoshida said, they only "know a little Japanese" and "cater to the preferences of the Japanese," then the result will certainly not be beneficial to Japan. Therefore, a true pro-Japanese person should be a true patriotic person, whose words, actions, wisdom, and consideration should protect their own country while also considering Japan, and who has the grand vision like Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who takes the overall interests of all Asians into account, and has the determination to struggle firmly regardless of their own personal fame and gain. Otherwise, all those who harbor temporary utilitarian psychology and only superficially embellish themselves will not have good results. Confucius said, "Observe what a man is aiming at, scrutinize his motives, take note of what brings him enjoyment. How then can he conceal what he really is, how then can he conceal what he really is!" This is what we hope Japanese people will be wary of regarding the so-called pro-Japanese factions.

On the Chinese side, there are certainly many of the first type of pro-Japanese faction that Mr. Yoshida praised. This is not only something to be congratulated on from Japan's perspective, but also something very gratifying from China's perspective. However, in reality, there are still many of the so-called second type of pro-Japanese faction, those who harbor personal gain and transform themselves into pro-Japanese factions, not only in the early stages of the incident but also at present. The appearance or words of such people are not worth paying attention to. What is important is what Zhuangzi said: "Listen to his words and observe his actions." Under calm observation, one can discover the truth. Precisely because their behavior is selfish and self-serving, their pro-Japanism is actually taking advantage of Japanese power, and they will not have any understanding or determination to share weal and woe with Japan. At the same time, they will not sincerely do their best for the country and the people domestically. On the contrary, they will take advantage of Japanese power to exploit their compatriots. Because they can do anything for their own selfish interests, they will certainly have no belief in the ultimate victory of Sino-Japanese unity, forming the defeatists we have criticized before. Therefore, their actions have tangibly and intangibly created unfavorable factors for East Asia and Sino-Japanese relations. Such people are "liars" in the eyes of the Japanese, so-called "traitors" in the eyes of the Chinese people, and criminals of East Asia from the perspective of the future of the world. In the decisive process of the Greater East Asia War and in the construction process of Greater East Asia, we should do our best to expose and eliminate such elements, especially by using propaganda and enlightenment movements to encourage people to expose them and urge these elements to become self-aware.

In the process of opposing the second type of pseudo-pro-Japanese faction, we will also be able to eliminate the misconceptions among the people caused by the blindly anti-Japanese faction. Based on their incorrect estimates and judgments of Japan, they regard the Japanese as the only enemy of the Chinese nation and conceal the real enemies. They also lump all those who advocate uniting with Japan to jointly strive for the independence and liberation of East Asian nations under the name of pro-Japanese faction, creating the slogan "pro-Japanese is a traitor" that has penetrated into the minds of the people. This has increased the misunderstanding between the Chinese and Japanese peoples and hindered the joint struggle of the two major nations. Today, we strictly distinguish between the false pro-Japanese faction and the true pro-Japanese faction, not only out of the great righteousness of the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sages, but also for the eternal future of Sino-Japanese cooperation during and after the war. We must eliminate the second type of false pro-Japanese faction, and we must allow the true pro-Japanese faction who deeply loves their own country, Japan, and East Asia as a whole to eliminate the shadows left in the minds of the people by the blindly anti-Japanese faction with all the facts. Only in this way can we more effectively and more quickly strengthen the National Government internally, consolidate Sino-Japanese unity externally, and complete the great cause of East Asian national liberation.

### Important Correction

In yesterday's commentary, "Two Types of Pro-Japanese Factions," in the fifth line, the sentence "is indeed very dangerous" was mistakenly printed as "is indeed not dangerous." Readers, please take note.

### Stalin's Feigned Injury Strategy

The Executive Committee of the Communist International submitted a proposal to communist parties of all countries on May 22 to end the organization. Thus, an international organization once seen as a monstrous flood by countries around the world will cease to exist. In the first half of the twentieth century, this seems to be a noteworthy event.

Currently, under the rationale of the "new needs of the world situation," Moscow has issued the termination of the Communist International and relieved communist parties of all countries of their responsibilities and obligations to the International. The significance of this is tantamount to eliminating the leadership and connections of communist parties in various countries, and at least on the surface, it is a blow to communist activities in various countries. However, the practical significance today is that authorities in various countries have always considered the Communist International to be a tool of the Soviet Communist Party and government, and a base camp for the Reddening of the world, so it has become a fundamental factor in all conflicts between the Soviet Union and other countries. Especially since the outbreak of the Second World War, and especially since the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, the reason why the so-called anti-Axis countries have been contradictory, conflicting, and mutually restraining each other in recent years is mainly due to the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the root of the conflict between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is precisely the existence of the Communist International in Moscowâ€”the base camp for the Reddening of the world. Since the war began, Britain and the United States have never stopped anti-Soviet movements. Even the British Labor Party recently declared that merging with the communists would be tantamount to cutting off their future, which is nothing more than that. In reality, the thing that countries in Europe and other places fear most about the Soviet Union is the existence of this organization.

During the so-called two-ocean strategy conference conducted by Roosevelt and Churchill, in the period when the so-called "Second Front" was reaching a fever pitch, Moscow's sudden announcement of the end of the Communist International, in any case, must be said to be an astonishing concession by the Soviet Union to the British and American authorities. Why is the Soviet authorities willing to make such concessions? Although the underlying reasons are not clear, the most direct reasons and intentions are very obvious. First, the Soviet Union is currently facing the greatest concern, which is the peace movement in Europe. Once Britain and the United States make peace with the Axis powers, the blow to the Soviet Union will be fatal, and at that time, the so-called Communist International will naturally have no room for existence. Second, the excuse for Britain and the United States not to open a "Second Front" is that it would create an opportunity for the Soviet Union to Redden Europe. However, if the Soviet Union does not get the help of the "Second Front," it obviously cannot hold the winning hand. When we look at these two points, perhaps readers can understand why Stalin came up with this feigned injury strategy. Because after this feigned injury strategy is implemented, first, the peace movement in Europe loses its basis; second, Britain and the United States have no second reason to stay behind the scenes of the war. Therefore, what Britain and the United States will perform in Europe can be anticipated.

Of course, the end of the Communist International organization may also cause other side effects. First, will some neutral countries, especially Turkey, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, etc., whose reason for neutrality is opposition to the Soviet Union's "world revolution" plan, hesitate again? Second, many small countries in Europe, such as Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Balkan countries, the anti-Axis countries will inevitably take the opportunity to instigate, and their movements are also extremely noteworthy. As for the Axis countries, there is no denying that one of the motives for carrying out this war is to oppose the world Reddening plan. On the surface, the target of this war seems to have disappeared. In the eyes of people with shallow opinions, perhaps this is a great spiritual victory for the Axis countries. However, according to the German instructions, this move by the Soviet Union is obviously "deliberately mystifying." "Roosevelt can only maintain his policy of getting close to Stalin by this, and allow the Soviet Union to develop freely towards Europe." Therefore, in essence, it cannot be assumed that the end of the Communist International is the cancellation of the world Reddening plan. On the contrary, it can also be said to be a new development of Reddening activities, as the German foreign spokesman pointed out: "Stalin dissolved the Third International, but at the same time, he has established the Fourth International. Stalin once said that he wouldåŠƒPoland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, etc., into its sphere of influence. Today, this move has further consolidated the ambition of this policy, that is, to establish Soviet regimes with different forms in these countries separately." This point should be the most valuable warning for the people of the Axis countries.

Stalin's feigned injury strategy has laid the foundation for the Stalin-Roosevelt-Churchill tripartite meeting, and at the same time, it has pushed the world war to a more serious stage. Its future evolution is worthy of our attention and vigilance.

### The Russo-Japanese War - Records from This Newspaper 38 Years Ago - Re-copied from Old Newspapers (6)

Discussing with Guests the Japanese Purchase of the Kasuga and Nisshin Warships (From This Newspaper No. 1113, Guangxu 30th Year, Second Month, Twelfth Day, Western Calendar March 28, 1904, Monday)

A guest asked the writer: "The Japanese purchased the 'Kasuga' and 'Nisshin' warships from Argentina to prepare for a fierce battle with Russia in the vast sea. Now that the war has just begun, the two ships have already arrived with their wheels spinning. It seems that they can be incorporated into the fleet and rushed to the front. Why haven't we heard of any actions? Could it be that the two ships are worn out and fragile, not enough to resist the powerful Russia? Or are they afraid of suffering a setback and wasting a lot of money? What is the situation? Please explain it to me." The writer said: "These two ships, how could you easily suspect that they are worn out and fragile, not enough to be used? Examining Argentina, Xu Jiyu's Yinghuan ZhilÃ¼e calls it La Plata, also called Plata-e-ona (La Plata is the name of a major river). Xu Jiyu mistakenly used it to name the country. The country is located in the southern border of the Americas, with an area of 1,125,800 square miles, formed by the union of many small countries. It used to be a corner of Peru. In the Western calendar 1810, which is the 15th year of Jiaqing in China, the people all wanted to rise up and form their own country. It was not until the Western calendar 1822, which is the 4th year of Daoguang in China, that they were able to revolt and become independent from Peru. During the Tongzhi period, it fought with Brazil and Paraguay and lost. Since then, it has persevered in governing and all neglected matters have been revived. The national power has gradually increased. The government and education are modeled after the United States. The population is over 2,942,000. Annual revenue is about 9,070,000 pounds, and expenditure is only 9,040,000 pounds. Telegraph lines extend for 15,000 miles, and railways stretch for 3,300 miles. Although the territory is very small, its effects of wealth and power have gradually become apparent in the Americas. These two ships were sold to the Japanese. They were newly manufactured in British factories and cost as much as 1,500,000 pounds in British gold. The artillery, machinery, and equipment are all new. It is said that if you compare them with the largest and newest warships in Britain, no one can judge the price difference. Although Russia is called the lion of the continent, it will also retreat in the face of these ships. How can there be any worries about being worn out and fragile? Moreover, when the two armies meet, the loser is certainly in an irreparable state, and the winner is not necessarily unscathed. Since Japan has been at war with Russia at sea, many Russian ships have been damaged. The other day, a friend from Xiyou came out of Nagasaki and saw three battleships nearby that were damaged. All of these damaged ships, which one was not purchased with a lot of money? Since there is no reluctance to spend money, why are they alone reluctant to use the Kasuga and Nisshin ships and hide them deeply, not using them to perform maritime feats, letting 1,500,000 gold pounds be no different from treasures in a box? I know that the Japanese would never be so foolish." The guest said: "I have heard that according to international practice, once two countries start a war, neutral countries are not allowed to provide them with military equipment or warships. Does Russia accuse Argentina of this, so the Japanese cannot use them to fight?" The writer said: "That's not the case either. This time, the fighting in Incheon and Lushun took place on February 7th and 8th in the Western calendar. The Japanese court declared war on the 11th. If the Russians wanted to detain the two ships, they should have clearly informed the British when the Japanese court declared war. But they were slow to act and allowed the two ships to safely arrive in Japan on the 16th and be handed over to the Japanese. By this time, the British had no involvement at all, and everything should be up to the Japanese. How could the Japanese court be willing to obey the words of a powerful enemy and not include the two ships in the fleet? Then why haven't we seen them go to battle?" The writer said: "In my opinion, the two ships have just arrived in Yokosuka port. The artillery has not yet been fully deployed, the soldiers have not yet been properly assigned, and the boilers and rudders have not been tested properly. Therefore, they are cautiously delaying and are not willing to use them lightly to charge into battle. Although I am surprised why there is not a single word mentioned in the various daily newspapers. I think there must be some secret considerations, aiming for a victory in one battle, destroying the enemy's flames and boosting the national prestige. At this time, they are still hibernating in the military port. Once they advance straight ahead with the waves, people will be surprised like a flying general descending from the sky. The art of war says: 'Defend like a virgin, attack like a fleeing rabbit.' Is that what the Kasuga and Nisshin ships are about? You and I should be patient and wait quietly." The guest said: "Your words are not without insight." Then he bowed to the writer and left.

### Return of the Kulangsu International Settlement - France, Spain, Sweden and Denmark All Express Agreement - Administrative Rights of the Settlement Can Be Fully Recovered - Joint CommuniquÃ© Issued Yesterday by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Publicity

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Publicity issued a joint communiquÃ© at 2:00 PM on May 25th as follows: The return of the administrative rights of the Kulangsu International Settlement, which was first advocated by our friendly nation of Japan, a portion relating to Japan having been received by our nation on March 30th of this year, the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital. As a result of subsequent negotiations with related nations, such as France, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark, agreement has been reached with them. The recovery of the administrative rights of this settlement can therefore be fully implemented.

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Publicity issued a joint communiquÃ© on May 25th stating that regarding the administrative rights of the Kulangsu International Settlement, France, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, and other countries have all agreed, and the return can be implemented. What is worthy of our attention is that even Sweden, which has always been conservative and neutral, has expressed its deep agreement to this. From this, it can be seen that the normal diplomatic relations between China and Sweden are being restored. After the return of the National Government to the capital, the number of countries that have recognized our government and restored diplomatic relations has reached as many as fourteen. The position of our government in the international community has clearly become increasingly elevated.

Foreign Minister Chu Issues Statement

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the recovery of the administrative rights of the Kulangsu International Settlement, as a result of negotiations between our government and related countries such as France, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark, agreement has been reached, and full implementation is imminent. Minister Chu issued the following statement on this matter: Kulangsu, after the opening of commercial ports, was due to the intentional aggression of Britain and the United States, resulting in the establishment of an international settlement, which has lasted for more than forty years. It echoes the Shanghai International Settlement from afar, becoming a stronghold of British and American aggression in southern China, greatly hindering our nation's autonomous development. Our nation has long wanted to recover it, but due to the complexity of the relationships, there has been no way to start. Therefore, although the British concession in Xiamen has been recovered, the Kulangsu International Settlement has maintained its old state until today. After our nation entered the war this year, our friendly nation of Japan, in the spirit of righteousness, immediately signed an agreement with our nation to return the settlements and abolish extraterritorial rights. Regarding the exclusive Japanese settlements, all of them were returned on March 30th of this year. Regarding the administrative rights of the Kulangsu International Settlement, a portion related to Japan was also received by our nation on the anniversary of the return to the capital, along with the Japanese settlements in various places. As for other related countries, such as France, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark, as a result of negotiations, they also recognized the situation in East Asia and understood our nation's determination to recover it, and have expressed their agreement one after another. Therefore, the administrative rights of this settlement can be fully implemented and recovered. The return of the Kulangsu International Settlement has progressed smoothly thanks to the lead taken by our friendly nation Japan, and has achieved reasonable implementation. Our nation expresses heartfelt gratitude for this kind of enthusiastic assistance from the Japanese government and the goodwill assistance of other related countries. Our nation has international settlements in Kulangsu and Shanghai. Although the land regulations and administrative rules are slightly different, they are both strongholds of aggression by the powers, especially Britain and the United States, in China. In order to achieve autonomous development and actively complete the construction of a new order in East Asia, our nation cannot allow this kind of special state to continue to exist. Now, because the related countries have a deep understanding of the new situation in East Asia, they have recognized our nation's recovery one after another, so that the historical stronghold of British and American aggression in East Asia, that is, the settlement, can finally be completely received by our nation, which has profound significance. After this recovery, the rights and interests of friendly countries in that area will naturally be respected, their merchants will be carefully protected, and their well-being will be improved.

### Commander-in-Chief Hata Returns to Nanjing After Inspecting the Central China Front Lines - Issues Statement

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Military Dispatch in China Press Office announced on May 25th: Commander-in-Chief Hata, after inspecting the central China front lines, returned to Nanjing on the 24th. The Commander-in-Chief issued a statement regarding the progress of this inspection, the gist of which is as follows: I went to the central China front lines to inspect the combat situation of the Japanese army. I witnessed the strong fighting spirit of the unit commanders and soldiers, and I was extremely gratified. In this operation, four divisions of the Chongqing army were first annihilated on the shores of Dongting Lake, and five divisions of the Chongqing army were crushed in the area west of Gongan, achieving great results. This was all due to the brave fighting of the soldiers. The operational area is mostly a zone of large rivers, lakes, swamps, and mountains. Therefore, the Japanese army soldiers were able to overcome all topographical difficulties, which truly demonstrated the success of their usual training and was sufficient proof of the high morale of the Japanese army. Regarding the cooperation of the operational air squadron, it fully exerted the effect of land-air coordination, which greatly contributed to the results of the battle. I am also deeply grateful for the close cooperation of the navy. In this operation, the troops on the side of the National Government were able to assist in the operation in many ways, which is also worthy of celebration. The Japanese forces in North China have reaped remarkable achievements in the Taihang Mountain operation this spring. In Central China, this summer offensive operation has inflicted a heavy blow on the Chongqing army. In short, the fighting spirit of the Chongqing army is extremely low. This is evidenced by the repeated great results of the Japanese army and the surge in the number of Chongqing prisoners. I deeply feel that the combat strength of the Chongqing army has significantly decreased compared to when I took office three years ago. Recently, Pang Bingxun led his troops to surrender, and the people are deeply able to understand the sincerity of the Japanese army, and they assist the Japanese army in all aspects. Such facts can all be said to indicate that the anti-Japanese situation in Chongqing is trending towards collapse. The heavy blows inflicted on the Chongqing army by the Japanese army in North China and Central China are certain to further shake the Chongqing anti-Japanese camp. I recently inspected the rural pacification work in Zhenjiang and the Jiangbei area, and saw that great results have been achieved. Recently, the rural pacification work mechanism has been reformed with great effort. In view of the experience of the past two years, I believe that this is a very appropriate measure. However, it goes without saying that the Japanese army will continue to actively cooperate in operations and security in the future.

### Successful Opening of the Yangtze River Waterway: Japanese Flagship Arrives at Shashi, Ensuring River Transport and Traffic

Shashi, 25th (Central News Agency) â€“ The Japanese Navy Yangtze River Unit's operation to open the Yichang waterway concluded on the 24th, and the Japanese Navy flagship sailed into this area on the 25th. A staff member of the Japanese Central China Fleet, speaking on the flagship, described the operation, stating that it was aimed at breaking through the Chongqing side's river defenses to clear mines and other underwater obstacles from the approximately 180-li stretch of the Yangtze River mainstream leading to Shashi, and to open the waterway. This operation not only secured river transport and traffic for the Japanese military but also inflicted a heavy blow on the first stage of the offensive against Chongqing's interior. The work of clearing mines laid by the Chongqing forces was extremely difficult, but all Japanese soldiers exerted their utmost efforts, wading through the turbid currents, secretly searching, and clearing them, determined not to leave a single one behind. This required utmost caution. Despite the Chongqing forces' stubborn counterattacks, the Japanese soldiers overcame all difficulties, endured all sacrifices, and worked diligently, their efforts truly deserving of gratitude. Previously, the Chongqing forces, deeply fearing a Japanese offensive from the river, laid a large number of mines and obstacles in key areas upstream of Chenglingji and stationed troops to guard the riverbanks and maintain strict surveillance. They also loaded hundreds of mines onto civilian ships stationed at various locations along the riverbank, ready to lay them at any time. However, recently, as Japanese army units launched operations in Mianyang and on the south bank of the Yangtze River, the Chongqing forces in the Xiangbei triangle area and the area along the south bank of the Yangtze River had been cleared, and a large number of unlaid mines were captured by the Japanese military. At the same time, the Japanese Navy, in coordination with the army's operations, overcame all difficulties and opened the waterway to Shashi in one fell swoop, making it easier to carry out waterway work between Shashi and Yichang and enabling it to be opened quickly when necessary. All of this demonstrates that the Japanese military's offensive will continue until the Chongqing forces' base is completely destroyed. Therefore, the Chongqing side, confident in its defensive capabilities, is deeply anxious about this. Since the Chinese National Government announced its entry into the war, Chongqing's reliance on the British and American position has become even more dangerous. Therefore, it has engaged in extensive propaganda, claiming that Japan's military strength in the South Pacific, India, and Burma has been depleted and that Japan's fighting power has been greatly reduced, and making boastful claims that the anti-Axis alliance will surely achieve final victory, all of which is nothing more than wishful thinking. Japan has ample resources both at the front and in the rear. The Japanese military has achieved brilliant victories in various theaters of war in Greater East Asia, and the construction work in the occupied territories is proceeding smoothly, with war preparations fully underway, which even the enemy must acknowledge. In particular, the activities of the Japanese military in China have become more intense, and the wavering of the Chongqing forces' morale is difficult to conceal. Therefore, the opening of the Yangtze River waterway by the Japanese military is like a dagger pointing directly at the heart of the Chongqing forces. Moreover, the opening of the Yangtze River waterway to Shashi will further facilitate the flow of materials in Hunan and Hubei provinces, which will contribute greatly to China's revival and the people's livelihood. A large number of civilian ships have already begun to transport materials, and the general public, under the protection of the Japanese military, is able to live and work in peace. In short, the significance of this operation is extremely important, and it is sufficient to consolidate the foothold for the future offensive against Chongqing. This is also of great importance in Japan's handling of the Chongqing issue.

Shashi, 25th (Central News Agency) â€“ The Japanese Yangtze River Fleet has advanced upstream and arrived at Shashi during this operation. The supreme commander of the Japanese Navy Yangtze River Unit, aboard a certain flagship, landed at the Shashi naval pier at 10:00 a.m. on the 25th to meet with the commander of the army unit and express gratitude for the army's cooperation in this operation. The army side also praised the navy unit's achievements. They conversed for about an hour before returning to the ship.

Mianyang Falls

Hankou, 25th (Central News Agency) â€“ The Hunan military front-line authorities announced that the Japanese military had occupied Mianyang, the base of the Chongqing 86th Army, at noon on the 24th (30 kilometers south of Yichang).

In addition to ensuring its safety, the following results were achieved: 186 mines and 146 landmines were disposed of, 13 machine guns and 975 rifles were captured, and 135 rounds of various ammunition were seized. The Japanese side suffered only one small boat sunk, three soldiers killed, and nine soldiers wounded.

Wang Kemin and Zhang Zhongzhi, Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Political Affairs Commission, representing Chairman Zhu Shen, attended the ceremony.

Resolution passed.

### Guangzhou Bay Uses Central Reserve Bank Notes

Guangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency) â€“ After the Japanese military entered Guangzhou Bay, silver coins and enemy currency denominated in old legal tender continued to circulate in the market. The Japanese military authorities, in view of this, decided to replace military scrip with Central Reserve Bank notes in the area, in order to assist the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes, based on the spirit of joint defense between Japan and Vietnam. This matter was announced on the 25th for public awareness. These Central Reserve Bank notes have become the only basic currency in the Central China and South China peace areas, with their credit increasing daily and their circulation area expanding daily. Since April 1st of this year, after the issuance of new military scrip was suspended, the status of Central Reserve Bank notes has become even more consolidated, and they have been widely circulated in various places. Therefore, the action of replacing military scrip with them in the area has taken place.

### North China Emergency Relief Association Established in Beijing Yesterday

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) â€“ The North China Emergency Relief Association held its inaugural meeting at 4:00 p.m. on the 24th of this month at the Middle School Students' Association of Returned Students from Japan in Xiangpu Camp, Beijing. More than 100 leaders of fellow villagers from various provinces in North China, including Li Shengwu, Zhou Xuechang, Bao Wenji, and Liu Yangshan, as well as heads of institutions such as Ding Mocun, Xi Zewen, Shao Xilian, and Jiang Wenbao, attended the meeting. First, Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare delivered a speech, followed by Mayor Zhou's report on the disaster situation in North China. Subsequently, Minister Li, Counselor Liu, and others successively expressed their opinions. Then, proposals were discussed and passed, including methods for raising food and the selection of candidates for the presidium, advisory group, and standing directors.

### Results of the Shandong Garrison

Jinan, 25th (Central News Agency) â€“ Since the Shandong Provincial Garrison began to suppress the Chongqing Communist troops remaining in Shandong Province, it has dealt them a thorough blow.

### US Supreme Commander of Cebu Island, Hachisaka, Has Surrendered; Understanding the Meaning of Prime Minister Tojo's Visit to the Philippines; Willing to Actively Cooperate in Building a New Philippine Island

Cebu, 25th (Central News Agency) â€“ The security in the Visayas region has improved due to the Japanese military's active suppression and pacification efforts. Lieutenant Colonel Hachisaka, "Supreme Commander of the Southern Region" of the US remnants, surrendered to a certain unit of the local Japanese military engaged in suppression on the 10th, along with his son and nephew, Second Lieutenant Bayernan Farfa, radio technician Second Lieutenant Rosario, and nine other officers. After the outbreak of the war, the lieutenant colonel engaged in resistance due to being misled by enemy counter-propaganda. Since September of last year, the Japanese military has used the southwestern part of Cebu Island as a center, contacted various islands in the Visayas region via Radio C station, and continued to stir up trouble. Now, due to the Japanese military's thorough sweep, the radio station has been completely taken over, and their guerrilla tactics have been broken. Moreover, after the lieutenant colonel surrendered to the Japanese military, he was well treated. The Japanese military is currently treating his gunshot wounds. Out of gratitude, the lieutenant colonel has realized the futility of resistance and decided to work hard to build a new Philippine Island after he recovers from his injuries, in order to repay the Japanese military's kindness.

Cebu, 25th (Central News Agency) â€“ Enemy Cebu Island Supreme Commander Lieutenant Colonel Hachisaka surrendered to the Japanese military on the 10th of this month and is currently receiving kind treatment at a certain army hospital. He expressed his deep gratitude. The following is Lieutenant Colonel Hachisaka's written oath to build a new Philippine Island: "My heart is filled with infinite gratitude. I am now able to preserve my life, share food and lodging with my eldest son, Joiru, and receive the kind care of the Japanese military, which was far beyond my initial expectations. I was extremely grateful to hear that Prime Minister Tojo himself inspected the Philippines. At a time when Japan is actively cooperating in building a new Philippine Island with such enthusiasm, Filipinos, misled by American counter-propaganda, have betrayed their motherland. Looking back on everything in the past, I am deeply ashamed. What we most hope for has been confirmed by Prime Minister Tojo. Although we blindly continued to resist in the past, we now understand the meaning of Prime Minister Tojo's visit to the Philippines. At present, we must make the general public aware of Japan's true intentions. I have the responsibility to alleviate the people's suffering. To achieve this mission, I am determined to stand up and build a new Philippine Island under Japanese guidance."

### German Troops Enter Sardinia, Build Strong Defenses; Italian Prince Announces New Infantry Weapons Prepared

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) â€“ The Berlin Evening News reported that German troops have entered Sardinia and that the island has strong defenses.

Stanbul, 25th (Central News Agency) â€“ Stefani News Agency: Beagru Newspaper commented on the recent destruction of British and American ships in the Mediterranean by Italian torpedo planes, stating that this activity has proven that the loss of Tunisia does not hinder Italy's control of the Mediterranean. Therefore, British and American propaganda has been denied by the facts. The base of these attacks is Sicily and Sardinia, so the loss of Tunisia cannot change this situation. The newspaper also commented on the recent heavy losses suffered by the anti-Axis air force, saying that these losses are not worth the results obtained compared to the attacks on Italian cities.

Rome, 25th (Central News Agency) â€“ Haisendong News Agency Special Correspondent: Yesterday was Italian Infantry Day, and the Italian Prince issued a statement saying that new infantry weapons and new types of aircraft have been prepared.

### Director of the Valley of the River News Department Delivers Speech in Yokohama

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) â€“ According to Yokohama telephone, Major General Tanioki, Director of the Army Press Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, delivered a speech at the Yokohama Public Hall at 7:00 p.m. on the 25th, entitled "The United States and Britain Are Not To Be Feared But Not To Be Despised Either." The following is a summary of the main points: The United States is the backbone of the enemy camp, and Britain and Chongqing rely on the United States to continue their extremely bleak operations. The United States once promoted that productivity, manpower, and time are the three elements of victory. I now intend to review these three points to explain the reason why "the United States and Britain are not to be feared but not to be despised either" and why the Axis powers can surely achieve final victory. It is well known that the United States possesses the world's resources and the most excellent production facilities. Therefore, it is also a fact that the United States boasts its military production capacity with astronomical figures. However, its actual production is only 60% of the quantity it boasts, due to the shortage of certain materials and the lack of smooth distribution and transportation. Taking the shortage of rubber as an example, 90% of the rubber in the United States has always been supplied by the occupied territories of our country in Greater East Asia. The current rubber reserves in the United States are about 400,000 tons. The amount obtained from Central and South America and Africa is at most only tens of thousands of tons, and the domestically remanufactured rubber is about 200,000 tons. The annual demand in Britain is about 800,000 tons. Therefore, the existing rubber can only be used for one or two years. Therefore, the United States is currently working hard with the goal of producing 400,000 tons of synthetic rubber annually, but its work has not progressed as desired. Mineral resources such as iron, tin, manganese, aluminum, sharp, mercury, and mica are also in short supply. In addition, I would like to add that the United States is finding it particularly difficult to obtain quinine. The area near Bandung, Java, is famous for producing quinine, accounting for 98% of the world's production. Since the area was occupied by our army, the United States and Britain have been unable to obtain quinine, resulting in rampant malaria in the country, which cannot be prevented, and has developed into a serious problem. Currently, many soldiers in the American expeditionary forces in Solomon and New Guinea are also suffering from malaria, and many have died from lack of medicine. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the United States has been working hard to expand military production, increasing it by about three times compared to before the war. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the number of workers, but it is doubtful whether skilled workers can quickly increase three or four times. Moreover, the military supplies produced, in addition to being used by hundreds of troops in various places, must also be supplied to Britain according to the Lend-Lease Act. Moreover, the United States and the Soviet Union want to complete their so-called "arsenal of democracy" mission. Therefore, the weapons they produce are not entirely used to deal with Japan, and only a small number of them are used to deal with Japan. Moreover, if the United States wants to completely use it to deal with Japan, it must be safely and reliably transported to the Greater East Asia theater and distributed to the front-line troops, and it must be used tactically. The spatial, temporal, and tactical relationship is what Japan wants to use. The British and American soldiers, lacking training, are driven to engage in a war with no daily goals, and they often boast of battles that satisfy their curiosity, adventurousness, and heroism. This is extremely bad. Therefore, the annihilation of countless American soldiers by our army is also a deserved retribution. Secondly, regarding manpower, last year, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall and Chairman McNutt of the Manpower Mobilization Committee said that the U.S. Army is about 9 million people. According to the current total population of the United States of 140 million people, if men and women each account for half, then 9 million people account for exactly 1% of the total number of American men. The number of 9 million people is also not small in the United States. Moreover, behind each soldier, there are related military workers and farmers. According to the U.S. statistics during the First World War, the ratio was one to ten. According to this ratio, if you want to support 9 million troops, then the general labor force is 90 million people, which happens to be the entire working-age population of the United States. Therefore, even if the rear production is completely rationalized and mechanized, it is not an easy task. (To be continued)

### Navy Soul (2): Sea Eagle

â€” Yoshio Shimizu

Although we don't easily talk about the lofty Navy soul, I would like to respectfully ask a very respectable Sea Eagle. "It's not a question of the superiority of the aircraft, but of the difference in spirit. The state of mind when rushing into the dazzling barrage of bullets, putting life and death out of the question, seems that anyone, as long as they are used to this situation, can do it." I looked at the large bandages on his hands and feet and comforted him for his injuries, and wished him martial prowess, but he said: "Alas. I'm really ashamed. I haven't gained martial prowess, nor have I established any achievements. I'm really a useless person."

His purity, bravery, caution, and that courteous attitude always made me naturally and wholeheartedly respect him every time I met him.

Most people only begin to reach a state of detachment at the age of seventy or eighty, but he was already very cultivated at the age of twenty. Thinking of the physical and mental training he underwent before coming to this place made me have to sit up straight and feel a sense of respect. (Taotao: from Daily News)

### The Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Naval Battle (1)

â€” Tominaga Kenwa

(I) Under the Z Flag

The 38th Naval Memorial Day, the second one during the Greater East Asia War, is fast approaching. The Z flag, prominently displayed on the flagship Mikasa, is once again fluttering in the Pacific winds.

The great victory of the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan, along with the decisive victory of the Fengtian Battle on March 10th, together served as the conclusive end to the Russo-Japanese War. It is a wellspring of historical memories for the Japanese people, and its significance is even greater when compared to the current war situation.

The Russo-Japanese War was a fierce counterattack in the final stage of the tide of Western European white people invading the world. It stopped the ambition of Western European white people, caused world history to begin to reverse, and was a victorious record of a just protest against white aggression.

The Russo-Japanese War was also the first victory record in modern history of colored people against white people. For centuries, the Asian peoples, who had been colonized and enslaved through oppression and abuse, reached the dawn of liberation due to the influence of the Russo-Japanese War. It also caused a comprehensive awakening of colored people around the world.

The Russo-Japanese War, at the beginning of the 20th century, marked a major turning point in modern world history.

The Russo-Japanese War fundamentally reformed wars that had always been centered on Europe and the United States, and also comprehensively revised Western European strategic thinking.

The Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan resulted in the complete annihilation of an enemy fleet superior in both quality and quantity, and can be called an unprecedented victory in the history of world naval battles.

Therefore, Japan dared to challenge American capitalist imperialism, which had a history of maritime power, and the seeds of the fated opposition between Japan and the United States were sown in this battle.

(II) The Conflict of World Policies Among the Great Powers

The Russo-Japanese War was in fact the inevitable result of the great powers' Pacific policies after the Sino-Japanese War, so this war cannot be said to be merely a conflict between Japan and Russia.

At that time, Germany and France regarded Russia as a friendly nation, while Britain and the United States supported Japan. The reason these two countries supported Japan was not to make Japan win an absolute victory in order to subdue Russia, but only to assist Japan within the scope that was beneficial to the expansion of their own interests.

Only ten years after the Sino-Japanese War, Japan demonstrated strength in the Russo-Japanese War that exceeded the expectations of the world's great powers and achieved a glorious victory. However, in the great victory of the Fengtian Battle, the problem of war was that 20th-century warfare, which was essentially a thorough war of attrition, would shift to an unsustainable war of attrition.

During this period, the raising of war funds was extremely difficult, national power was about to be exhausted, and the war still had to be continued. Therefore, the all-or-nothing Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan arose in order to determine a victory or defeat. As a result of this battle, the Baltic Fleet was completely destroyed, and the arrogant Russian government completely lost its confidence and hope in controlling the sea in the Pacific.

In this way, the Portsmouth Treaty was held through the mediation of the President of the United States.

(III) The Source of the Next War

Here, what is most noteworthy is that the United States, which had been extremely friendly since its founding and continued to maintain a pro-Japanese attitude during the war, did not support Japan. This was because the United States did not want either Japan or Russia to become too powerful. We do not need to treat Roosevelt as a benefactor, nor do we need to complain about his cunning attitude. That is just common sense in the international community.

The Russo-Japanese War was not merely a matter of the interests of Japan and Russia, but a reflection of the interests of all the great powers that insisted on world policies. The conflict of the great powers over Pacific policies is by no means limited to interests centered on the Pacific. This has been the case in the past, it is the case now, and it will not change in the future.

The Russo-Japanese War ended, and the entry of the United States into China gradually became blatant. As a result, the future of the emerging Japan, the victor of the Russo-Japanese War, was filled with thorns. From the history of the Russo-Japanese War, it was already seen that the Pacific issue of the Russo-Japanese War would be a problem between the victor and the mediator of the war.

Historical facts clearly tell us that Roosevelt appeared to propose a Russo-Japanese peace out of humanitarianism, but in reality, it was to open up the way for the United States to enter China.

On the Pacific issue, the future of the relationship between Japan and the United States is determined by the victory of the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan. At the end of that year, the Japanese people had already recognized which direction the preparation for the next war should take, and at the same time, the United States had also clearly recognized the relationship between the two countries.

The Open Door Policy is essentially a weapon for invading East Asia, and its ambition is specifically aimed at Japan. Is this something that people should deeply consider? (Sho: Translated from "Modern" No. 5)

### All Flour Mills Preparing to Operate Fully; Flour and Wheat Special Committee Purchases Wheat for Centralized Distribution to Mills as Raw Material

The Flour and Wheat Special Committee of the National General Association for Commercial Control, in view of the fact that wheat is beginning to appear on the market in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, has, for the sake of unified purchase and centralized distribution, borrowed huge sums of money from Chinese and Japanese banks, such as China, Jiaotong, Shanghai, Jin Cheng, Zhong Fu, etc., as well as Japanese merchants Zhengjin, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, etc., to purchase wheat.

### Self-Defense Corps Substitute Duty Must Apply to Jia Head; No Hiring Allowed Without Bao Head Approval

It has been investigated that the hiring of substitutes for duty by the Self-Defense Corps has long been prohibited by the Baojia authorities. However, recently there are still some citizens who knowingly violate this rule. The Baojia authorities yesterday specially posted notices again in various Baojia districts, reiterating the previous order. Anyone who wants to hire someone to substitute for duty must apply to the Jia head in advance, provide legitimate reasons, and the person requested must be a Self-Defense Corps member of the same Baojia and qualified age as the applicant, and the applicant must not give any monetary reward to the substitute. The Jia head must submit the application to the Bao head for approval and provide appropriate proof, so as not to violate the law. If anyone privately hires someone with money to substitute for duty, once found out, both the hirer and the hired will be subject to the punishment of having their citizen certificates revoked.

### Municipal Schools Adjust School Names, Cancel "Special Zone" Label

Since the Municipal Education Bureau took over the Municipal Special Zone Normal School and the Municipal Special Zone He'an and Feihong primary schools, as well as the Municipal Special Zone various People's Schools, which were organized by the former Education Committee, in order to standardize the names of municipal schools, the words "Special Zone" in the names of the schools are no longer applicable and are all uniformly cancelled. The names of all relevant schools in the city have been adjusted, and the original Shanghai South District Normal School has been changed to the Municipal First Normal School, and the Special Zone Normal School has been changed to the Municipal Second Normal School. In addition, the original municipal First People's School to Eighth People's School in the old urban area are merged with the Special Zone First People's School to Twentieth People's School and changed to the Municipal Ninth People's School to the Municipal Twenty-eighth People's School in order to connect them and avoid confusion, and this method has been reported to the Municipal Government for record.

### Residents Purchasing Household Rations Do Not Need Epidemic Prevention Certificate

Regarding the rumor that it is necessary to have an epidemic prevention certificate to purchase household rations, the Datong News Agency reporter recently learned from inquiries in the two concessions and the western districts of Shanghai that this is not true. It is said that the authorities are indeed working hard to carry out epidemic prevention injections and encourage residents to implement them, but so far, it has not been stipulated that an epidemic prevention certificate is required when purchasing rations. In fact, residents of each household often send one person as a representative to purchase rations. If it is necessary to submit an epidemic prevention certificate for inspection, the procedures will be inconvenient, and in fact, it is not enough to prove whether the presented epidemic prevention certificate is indeed owned by the ration purchaser.

### Scientific Crime-Solving Charts to be Applied in Police Stations

The Public Works Department Police Department, in order to make it easier to investigate and solve all crimes, will apply a new type of scientific chart format, specializing in detailed facial drawings, including face, eyes, ears, nose, lips, eyebrows, forehead, hair, etc. These charts were completed only yesterday and will be distributed to police stations for application starting next week.

### Rice and Grain Joint Venture Has Been Organized; Free Trade is Pure Nonsense

Recently, the saying that various rice shops will freely sell rice after the cancellation of household rice has been raging. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Rice and Grain Distribution Office, the above rumor is not true. Moreover, since the implementation of household rice, the results have been excellent. Starting from today, the seventh phase of household rice will be handled. Each rice shop will pay the Public Works Department to receive a purchase order, which will be announced soon. In addition, the Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Venture, which is being prepared by Lu Wenshao, has been organized and is located at 606 Pudong Building. It is now starting to collect membership fees. It is said that the collection of membership fees is based on capital. Those with capital of 20,000 yuan or more pay 200 yuan, those with 50,000 yuan pay 400 yuan, and those with more than 50,000 yuan pay 600 yuan. There are more than 3,000 rice shops in the two concessions.

### The City's Press Corps Visited the Izumo Warship Yesterday

Tomorrow (the 27th) is the Japanese Navy Memorial Day.

At 2:40 PM, the entire group gathered in the conference room on the third floor of the Fleet Reporting Department on the Bund. More than 100 people, including responsible persons, editors, and reporters from the Central News Agency and various newspapers, attended. First, Lieutenant Shiotani explained the history of the Izumo warship and the visiting procedure, and set off to visit at 3:00 PM.

Captain Murayama Gave a Welcome Speech

Arriving on the ship, everyone suddenly felt refreshed. The captain of the ship, Colonel Murayama, delivered a speech, roughly saying: "I am very happy to welcome you to visit this ship. You rarely have the opportunity to visit warships. Today, please take a detailed look at it. There will also be a demonstration of the use of artillery and a performance of various Japanese martial arts. Now, please start your visit."

Visit Artillery Practice and Equipment

The press corps was divided into three classes, led by officers of the ship. First, they visited the artillery practice. For a time, the sound of bugles and orders shook their eardrums. There are a total of ten cannons on the ship, including two main cannons in the front and rear, and three auxiliary cannons on the left and right. Each cannon is controlled by electricity and is quite sophisticated. The reporters followed the leaders in turn and visited the spiritual instruction sign, shrine, captain's room, dining hall, kitchen, medical room, sick room, living room, small workshop, etc. They had a clear view of the Japanese navy's hard living and rigorous training.

Daily Life and Martial Arts Performance

Daily life consists of worshiping at the shrine at 6:00 AM, scrubbing the deck, having breakfast, resting for an hour, sweeping the inside of the ship at 8:15 AM, training from 9:45 AM to 11:45 AM, gymnastics at 1:00 PM, training from 1:15 PM to 3:30 PM, Japanese martial arts for one hour at 3:45 PM, tidying up the inside of the ship at 8:15 PM, and the deputy captain inspects at 8:45 PM, after which the whole body goes to sleep. The reporter group then went to the land barracks to watch the performance of Japanese martial arts, including wrestling, bayonet fighting, etc., with shouts of killing, vivid and colorful, and the performance was realistic. They saw the energetic, full-bodied and strong-bodied Japanese naval soldiers. After the visit, they returned to the ship for rest and refreshments.

Press Representative Gives a Thank You Speech

Finally, Xu Liqiu, the acting president of Zhonghua Daily, represented the whole group and gave a thank you speech, saying: "Today, I am deeply honored to be invited to visit the Izumo warship of the Japanese invincible navy. I have witnessed the ship's comprehensive equipment, sophisticated weapons, serious training, and the hard work and endurance of the officers and soldiers. I am even more impressed in my heart. From the Russo-Japanese War to the current Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy has been able to annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop and achieve victory, which is by no means accidental. I still remember that during the Russo-Japanese War, when Japan defeated Imperial Russia, the Father of the Nation was in Europe and personally saw the shock of the European countries when they heard the news of Japan's victory. At that time, Britain and Japan were allies. When they heard that the allied countries had won, they should have felt excited. However, at that time, London only shook their heads and frowned. Today, the Greater East Asia War has broken out, and we have embarked on the broad road of practicing the great work of revitalizing East Asia. Since the war, the friendly navy has exerted its invincible power and has achieved unprecedented victories known to the world. We, standing in the position of journalists, must work hard and responsibly to awaken the people to take the friendly navy as a model and work hard to complete the war. We are able to see the prestige of the Japanese Navy two days before the Japanese Navy Memorial Day, and we are honored to be invited. On behalf of the colleagues in the press, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Captain Murayama, Lieutenant Shiotani, and all the officers of the Izumo warship." After the speech, the reporter group said goodbye and went ashore to return.

### Elementary School Student's Parent Rude; Teacher Dies of Anger

According to a letter from Sacred Heart Elementary School at 393 Pingliang Road, the school hired female teacher Su Yizhi as the homeroom teacher this semester. She was very popular with the children on weekdays. On the 19th of this month, during a calligraphy lesson, more than ten students in the whole class were punished by the teacher (Su Yizhi) for not being attentive. However, one student, Liu Zhijun, whose father's name is Liu Runsheng, was dissatisfied with the punishment and reported it to his mother after returning home. Unexpectedly, his mother, Mrs. Liu, ran to the school, without asking the facts, scolded the teacher, and slapped her twice in the face. Miss Su was a weak woman, so she had to swallow her anger and dare not argue with her. Mrs. Liu took an inch and went to the school to make trouble and scold her again a few days ago. Teacher Su was repeatedly humiliated while performing her teaching duties and was extremely angry. The next morning, she died of anger. Now, Su's family has reported to the Yulin Road police station. The police station sent the deceased to the mortuary for examination and arrested and questioned the student's mother, Mrs. Liu. Miss Su has no parents and is a lonely woman.

### Robbery of Anhe Wheel Case; One Bandit Boat Intercepted

On the 18th of this month, the Anhe Wheel, which sailed from Xingang to Shanghai, was forced to stop by more than 30 bandits carrying weapons near Wuxu Port at 11:30 AM. Passengers were robbed and part of the cargo was unloaded into a small boat prepared by the bandits. The Japanese shipowner was kidnapped and the bandits planned to flee. The special service squadron of the Huainan Self-Defense Corps stationed in Xinshiqiao heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, engaging in a fierce battle with the bandits. The bandits were defeated and abandoned their ship, fleeing. One bandit was killed on the spot, and one bandit boat was intercepted. The captain of the ship was able to escape danger. The Huainan Corps is now strictly ordering its subordinates to search for the remaining bandits.

### Izumo Cruiser Inspection: A Record of Distinguished Service in the Russo-Japanese Naval Battle

â€” Han Ru

Yesterday (the 25th) at precisely 3:00 PM, a large gathering of colleagues from the Shanghai press unfolded within the conference room of the Japanese Naval AttachÃ©â€™s Office on the Bund. Reporters from major newspapers filled the hall, preparing to depart for an inspection of the Izumo cruiser.

Lieutenant Shiota's Speech

Lieutenant Shiota of the Navy, dressed in a neat summer white uniform, delivered a speech on behalf of the naval authorities to all the reporters. From his words, we learned about the history of the Izumo and its distinguished war record. The Izumo is an old hero of the Japanese Navy. It has served on the front lines over thirty times and was only struck by two twelve-inch shells from the enemy during the Russo-Japanese War, with only three soldiers killed. Otherwise, it remained completely undamaged. To this day, it still bravely maintains the military achievements of thirty-eight years ago, floating on the Huangpu River, with the commander's flag flying high at the masthead in the May breeze, like a guardian of the Yangtze River. During the last European war, it sailed into the Mediterranean, establishing immortal feats. In between, it also visited London, the capital of England, to participate in a regatta, winning a championship certificate.

A Tour Around the Ship

On board the ship, we met the courteous and refined Captain Murayama Kiyoroku, a Navy Captain. He is the forty-ninth captain of the Izumo. The first captain was Navy Captain Inoue Toshio. Captain Murayama warmly welcomed the visitors with an attitude of sincerity and elegance.

Another officer told the visitors about the daily life and routine of the crew: They rise at 6:00 AM, and the captain leads them in a remote worship of the Imperial Palace. After that, they wipe and wash the deck, have breakfast, and clean the interior from 8:15 to 9:30 AM. From 9:45 to 11:30 AM, they receive training. At 11:30 AM, they have lunch. At 1:00 PM, they do exercises and begin afternoon training until 3:30 PM. From 3:45 to 6:00 PM, they train in Kendo, Judo, and other Japanese martial arts. After dinner, they rest. At 8:15 PM, they begin tidying up the interior. At 8:30 PM, the executive officer inspects the entire ship, and with that, the day's routine ends.

The tour group was divided into three groups, and they toured the entire ship separately. The crew directed the soldiers in a demonstration of shell firing, the operation of the main guns, and explained the entire ship's layout in great detail.

At a certain dining table, we saw a group of soldiers eating. The food consisted only of a bowl of white rice, two or three kinds of salted vegetables, and one kind of vegetable, with a bowl of tea soup. It was very simple.

The officers' lounge was decorated elegantly. A radio was broadcasting songs from the shore.

In the training room, a scene of basic Japanese naval training unfolded. Kendo and Sumo were being practiced in groups. The soldiers were earnestly training under the leadership of their officers. It is with this kind of continuous and intense training that the Japanese Navy defeated the old Russian fleet, destroyed the British and American Pacific fleets, and became the guardian of the Eastern Pacific.

The late Admiral Togo's handwritten instructions, "Loyalty, Courtesy, Valor, Integrity," are hung in the cabin. This is the highest goal of Japanese naval spiritual training.

Rome was not built in a day, and the formation of the strong Japanese Navy was not achieved overnight. We hope that the Chinese Navy will catch up as soon as possible to fulfill its responsibility of jointly protecting East Asia with allied nations.

Naval Battle Thirty-Eight Years Ago

The Izumo is a 10,000-ton cruiser that was launched in the 34th year of Meiji (43 years ago, i.e., 1900). In the Russo-Japanese War, it was the flagship of the Second Fleet in the Battle of the Sea of Japan (1904-1905), actively participating at sea. The Battle of the Sea of Japan, from May 27th to 28th, 38th year of Meiji, established the most glorious pyramid of victory in naval warfare history, shattered the ambitions of Tsarist Russia, completed the defense of East Asia, and laid the foundation for today's construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It was a great historical naval battle. In this naval battle, the one who decisively determined the victory or defeat was none other than Admiral Togo, the commander of the Combined Fleet, whose order for "turning towards the enemy" fully demonstrated the essence of the Japanese Bushido spirit of "cutting flesh and severing bones." Admiral Togo's operational decision astonished military experts worldwide.

At dawn on May 27th, the patrol boat Shinano Maru telegraphed the flagship Mikasa, reporting the discovery of the Baltic Fleet. The Combined Fleet then notified the headquarters: "Upon receiving the alert of the enemy fleet's discovery, the Combined Fleet immediately set out, intending to reduce the enemy fleet. The weather is clear today, but the waves are rough. With unwavering faith in victory, we silently departed from the Chinhae Bay base. Learning that the enemy Baltic Fleet was about 10,000 meters south of the port side, we urgently turned the course to the southwest in the opposite direction. The speed of the Japanese fleet was fifteen knots, and the speed of the Baltic Fleet was ten knots. The two fleets gradually approached the battlefield at a rate of 800 meters per minute.

Turning Towards the Enemy

At 2:05 PM, the distance between the Japanese and Russian fleets was reduced to 8,000 meters, approaching the effective firing range of twelve-inch guns. At this time, Admiral Togo (later Marshal), the commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet, was on the bridge of the flagship Mikasa, calmly assessing the opportune moment for battle with his staff. He suddenly raised his right hand and drew a semicircle to the left. Rear Admiral Kato, the chief of staff, smiled slightly and nodded in agreement. This was the unprecedented ninety-degree turn in front of the enemy, the new T-shaped battle tactic. In any naval battle, making a sharp turn in front of the enemy is the most dangerous move for our fleet, providing the enemy with a good target for artillery fire. Therefore, admirals of ancient and modern times have avoided using it. However, Admiral Togo, despite seeing the enemy's large fleet with superior guns in front of him, still resolutely implemented the bold tactic of changing course, further pressing the enemy's first fleet to the east, unleashing a fierce and accurate barrage of gunfire, and winning a great victory that will be forever immortalized in the history of world naval warfare.

Therefore, this well-thought-out tactic is ultimately unimaginable for armchair strategists. Military experts around the world call this operation the Togo Turn and are studying this tactic in depth, which is indeed very worthwhile.

Second Fleet Flagship

In this Battle of the Sea of Japan, which unfolded the fate of East Asia, the warship Izumo, participating as the flagship of the Second Fleet, had Vice Admiral (later Admiral) Kamimura Hikonojo, known for his bravery, as its commander, and Captain (later Vice Admiral) Ichiji Kiharu, known for his strategy, as its captain. During the attack, it was the seventh ship of the Combined Fleet.

When approaching this superior enemy at a close range of about 1,600 meters, in the artillery battle, the Izumo was struck by two twelve-inch shells from the enemy, resulting in three deaths, seven serious injuries, and eleven minor injuries. In such a large-scale artillery battle, having only this amount of sacrifice can be said to be divinely aided. One of the two twelve-inch shells hit the officers' quarters, causing a fire, which was immediately extinguished by the officers and soldiers, and they continued to fight. The other penetrated the starboard side and flew into the coal bunker. Because it did not explode, the damage was still minor. The commander of the Second Fleet, Vice Admiral Kamimura, was directing the fleet on the compass bridge when an enemy ricochet (a shell that bounces up again after falling into the water due to physics) passed over the vice admiral's head, showing the intensity of the artillery battle.

In the Battle of the Sea of Japan, the fighting was so fierce, yet the damage sustained was so minor. As a result, the Japanese people seemed to believe that the Izumo was always protected by the Izumo Shrine and praised it as the "unsinkable ship."

### Sighing at the Sight of a House

â€” Xiao Min

It is embarrassing to say that I was born here, grew up here, and live here, a citizen of the Republic of China, yet I am far inferior to the White Russian refugees who have wandered to Shanghai, and not even comparable to the Jewish refugees who have been expelled to Shanghai. They have no nationality, and they are all exiles who have been driven out. However, when they first came to Shanghai, the British and Americans of the former concession authorities, mindful that these exiles were also fair-haired, blue-eyed, and high-nosed, fearing that it would undermine the dignity of their white race, specially planned and provided them with residences and accommodations. As a result, these exiles, relying on the latent power of the British and Americans, were able to engage in various hoarding and speculation, manipulating the market, and miraculously transformed into arrogant expatriates on the sea. Looking back at us, the genuine owners of this land, there are more than just thousands who cannot even find a place to rest!

More than a year ago, although the two concessions had regulations on housing rentals and established housing dispute mediation committees, it did indeed shock those speculative second landlords and had some small effects. However, as time passed and things became stagnant, the formal disputes did decrease to the point of becoming invisible, but in essence, the means by which the second landlords squeezed and oppressed the third tenants became increasingly varied.

I remember once seeing in the classified ads in the newspaper the repetitive request for "elegant co-tenancy, limited to two married couples, address inquiries to a certain mailbox, will arrange an interview if suitable," etc. So, with a mind to give it a try, I wrote a letter. After a few days, there was a "response," an "arranged interview." So I went to the address. I was received by the second landlord's wife. Upon meeting, she said many things about the reasons and conditions for renting out the room, the main reason being that she felt "lonely" and wanted to find a tenant to "keep her company" and incidentally "supplement" her income. I made two declarations: first, I am a legitimate employee and do not engage in speculation; second, I want to rent for a long term because it is not easy to find a house and move around in this day and age. She replied that it would definitely not be a problem. Fortunately, with all the conditions met, my wife and I were finally welcomed as guests, thinking that we could settle down and live in peace from then on, or at least live for a year or two. However, the trends of the world are changing daily, and the mentality of the second landlord is no exception. After we had lived there for only a few months, the second landlord's wife used the excuse of "taking it back for her own use" and asked us to find another house. She also mentioned how much the key money was for this house, how much the key money was for that house, and how the previous tenant had helped her with some small speculative deals, etc. The unspoken meaning was obvious. Because of the difficulties of the times, we were already spending a lot of effort and energy running around all day for food, clothing, housing, and transportation. How could we have any remaining energy to be at someone else's beck and call? Therefore, in addition to agreeing to automatically increase the rent, we politely declined her offer, relying on the two declarations we had made. When we first came, she was doing her best to express her welcome and enthusiasm, but now she was doing her best to express her hatred and dislike. Recently, she has even become more aggressive, running over every two or three days to pester us incessantly. She had been kind enough to find us a small room nearby, but it could not accommodate our furniture, and the rent was beyond our means. She forced us to move out, thinking that as long as we moved out of her door, she would not care whether we lived or died. Because of her daily urging, we could only repeatedly ask relatives and friends for help, forwarding introductions, and searching for clues in the rental columns of the newspaper every morning. If there was a suitable house, we would go to the address to look for it. Only one or two of them were not available. It took a few months to find a small room for rent, but we had to pay key money, or even a handling fee, of several thousand to as much as one or two million, and we could only live there for a year or two. If we wanted to rent the entire building, a common house in the French Concession, it would cost no less than forty or fifty thousand, and there would be no transfer of ownership, so as to avoid interference from the main landlord. Similar disguised demands, although there are imperial prohibitions, how can they affect the slightest hair of the powerful second landlords? As for the third tenants, if they want to rent a house, they can only grit their teeth and bear the pain to rent it. But how can an employee in a salaried class like me have this idle money to pay key money! Logically, in this extraordinary period, the owner or second landlord should not refuse the tenant by pretexting "taking it back for their own use" or "inconvenience of serving," and the tenant can also refuse to move out. But in the same doorway, seeing each other morning and evening, seeing the unpleasant look on the second landlord's wife's face makes one feel very afraid, and hearing her harsh words every two or three days makes one feel very uncomfortable, wanting to move to a better place as soon as possible. Therefore, in these recent two or three months, every morning on the way to the office and every evening on the way back, seeing those various, tall, short, large, and small houses, I always stop and look up, hesitating for a long time before sighing, thickening my face, humbling myself, and dragging my heavy steps back. When entering the door, I am afraid of meeting the face of the second landlord's wife, so I can only tiptoe up the stairs before I feel relieved. The fact is in front of my eyes. On the one hand, I cannot find a house, and on the other hand, the second landlord's wife is urging me with harsh words, leaving me helpless. My current situation is even far worse than that of the White Russians and Jews!

There is no "absolute" thing in the world.

Life requires "struggle."

Only with a desire to "win" can there be "competition"; only with "competition" can there be "progress."

### Anecdotes of the Japanese Navy (3)

â€” Oshita Uda'er

(4) Submarine No. 6

Compared to airplanes, the history of submarines is longer. Lieutenant Hino's first flight in a Grade Monoplane was in the autumn of the forty-third year of the Meiji era, but in April of the same year, there was already the story of Sakuma Tsugunaga. The submarine No. 6, which is now located at the submarine school, began construction at the Kobe Shipyard in November of the thirty-seventh year of the Meiji era and was completed in April of the thirty-ninth year. Prior to this, the Japanese Navy had several foreign-made submersible boats.

But these were, of course, rudimentary submarines. It was not until the forty-third year of the Meiji era that oxygen welding technology was first used. In that year, Lieutenant Shirase took the Kainan Maru to explore Antarctica. Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojo was promoted to Admiral, Natsume Soseki was awarded a doctorate, and Tanaka Hozumi and Uesugi Shinkichi were simultaneously awarded doctorates. But at that time, although there were submarines, they had not yet participated in actual combat. It was said that French submarines could reach a speed of eight knots per hour. The Japanese newspapers solemnly reported on it, and its performance could be roughly inferred. There is also a very interesting story about this.

During the Russo-Japanese War, in the waters of Port Arthur, the flagship Petropavlovsk, carrying Vice Admiral Makarov, was sunk by a mine, and the vice admiral and all his staff drowned. At that time, the crew on board did not think it was a mine, let alone that the Japanese Navy had submarines, and thought it was a strange object floating on the sea, so they fired at it, resulting in such a result. After this incident, when the Russian Baltic Fleet sailed all the way from Europe to the East, the commander-in-chief, Vice Admiral Rozhestvensky, became nervously pale. The information he received was that Japanese submarines had already participated in actual combat, which caused great concern due to false reports.

In the First European War, the activities of German submarines were extremely meritorious.

As a result, Japan, after much research and sacrifice, buried itself in hard work and made improvements, while also striving to train the crew.

People in the Navy regard the spirit of the late Commander Sakuma as the representative of submarines and their crews. At the same time, submarines are also progressing day by day, with specialized scientists pouring out all their knowledge. Even outsiders often have groundbreaking fantasies.

Submarines discover enemies and attack them.

Using a periscope to glimpse the entire situation, before being discovered by the enemy, they launch torpedoes at it.

This is truly not the work of humans, but the work of gods. In order to make miracles a reality, training must be carried out. How amazing it would be if, without using a periscope, one could accurately understand the enemy ship's situation in hundreds of feet of water! As for its secrecy, it also increases significantly with the increase in diving depth. If a powerful submarine could be built that could dive to a depth of 2,000 meters below the surface, the face of naval warfare would probably turn into a guerrilla war.

### Dispatch (1)

â€” By Navy Reporting Unit Member, Hiroshi Hamamoto

1. Flowers and Roads

Lieutenant Junior Grade Kantaro Eto, assigned to the torpedo boat, finally received the commendation from the commander a few days ago. As a ship with military achievements, Eto excitedly rushed to the front-line base in the South Pacific to see her. However, the important ship had unfortunately sailed and was not in port. He felt very disappointed, but there was nothing else he could do. He had to wait for the return of the boat in the temporary accommodation in the headquarters compound.

The local rainy season had just passed, and it was the most pleasant time of the year with clear skies and sunshine. However, he had suddenly jumped out of the severe winter in the mainland, and here he was encountering the sweltering heat where he was sweating profusely.

A flower bed crossed the wide lawn in the courtyard. Along both sides of the road, various flowers and plants were appropriately placed. There were deep red single-petal flowers, and also pinkish-red eight-petal flowers. Mixed among them were very precious bellflowers, which bloom throughout the year.

Lieutenant Junior Grade Eto happened to meet his middle school classmate, Tadayuki Matsumae, on this flower-lined road.

Eto had just arrived and was wearing a snow-white uniform, while Matsumae was wearing a neat marine uniform with the insignia of a second lieutenant in the reserves, holding a leather-covered military sword, and swaggering along. Whether in his red eyes or on his sunburnt cheeks, he was full of the atmosphere of the battlefield.

"Ah!"

Matsumae couldn't help but shout out due to this chance encounter.

"Are you here too?"

Eto didn't even know that Matsumae was serving in the navy before. Although the two had met unexpectedly, their pleasantries ended there.

Because Eto was a second mate graduate of a higher merchant marine school, he originally had the qualifications of a reserve officer, but Matsumae, because he graduated from the law department of the Imperial University, voluntarily applied to be a naval reserve student, so he was only a reserve second lieutenant. The so-called reserve officers in the navy were those who had received formal officer education at a military academy or engineering school, such as Eto and Matsumae. Reserve officers did not have cherry blossoms on their cap badges and collar badges, but only a compass emblem.

In a corner of the lawn was a pile of shrubs with yellow flowers. Further ahead, you could see red-roofed bungalows. Instead of calling them bungalows, it would be more appropriate to call them barracks, as high as a bed.

Matsumae looked at that side and asked, "Do you still remember Matsugoro Nanjo?"

"I remember, but is he here too?"

He was a fellow townsman and a classmate two grades above him in middle school. He heard that he was a news reporter in Tokyo recently.

"He is stationed here as a member of the reporting unit. He is now a senior veteran in this field and has a good reputation. That is the dormitory of the reporting unit. If you go to see him now, he will definitely be there."

Upon hearing this news, Eto, being new and without any acquaintances, wanted to visit, so he said, "Take me there!"

But Matsumae refused and replied, "The staff are calling me. Go by yourself and give him a surprise!" After taking two or three steps, Matsumae suddenly turned around and asked, "Where is your unit?"

During this time, the rumbling of domestic bombers resounded in the sky. Watching them fly overhead in large formations, as if dazzled by the sky, Matsumae said, "Look, can you still hear the naval march from the mainland?" He embarked on the journey.

"That's strange! When did they come?"

Reporting unit member Matsugoro Nanjo was still sitting on a stool on the veranda in shorts, enjoying the cool, but he asked in a very friendly and amiable manner. He took off the dark scarf wrapped around his head and welcomed him very courteously, saying, "Oh, please sit down! Would you like to take off your upper garment?"

There were three or four other people sitting on the same stool, some were young men wearing only shorts, and some were wearing summer shirts with painful expressions on their faces. Their eyes were all focused on Eto. Because his sleeve badge was dyed with a blue background and a red pattern like the character "report," everyone thought he must be a colleague of Nanjo's in the reporting unit.

It seemed like a meeting was going on, so Lieutenant Junior Grade Eto was a little restrained and said politely, "Maybe I'm disturbing you! If you have time, I'll come again. I live in the dormitory across the street because it's very close." But he didn't seem to want to sit down.

"It's okay, it's okay! Sit down!" The very kind Nanjo grabbed him and said, "This man is about to leave for battle, so everyone is here to bless him. It's perfect, Eto-kun, you also participate in this farewell party! Okay?" After discussing with the others, he introduced his old friend from his hometown to everyone.

"Of course, welcome, please sit down!"

Some even stood up to offer their seats, so Lieutenant Junior Grade Eto sat down with everyone.

The man who was about to leave for battle first presented his business card as a greeting. The business card was printed with "Navy Reporting Unit Member," and in the corner was printed the name of a newspaper different from the one Nanjo served for.

Because his old friend from his hometown was visiting, Nanjo seemed a little embarrassed, so he poured water for everyone back and forth very diligently. While taking out ice-cold beer from the expensive electric refrigerator, which made a motor sound, from a corner of the veranda, he explained with a smile, "This refrigerator is by no means a luxury item. Because it is a necessity for the photography unit, we temporarily borrow public equipment to store beer and canned goods, etc."

Eto asked the departing unit member, "Where are you going?"

The other party, who had a side parting and wore glasses, said, "Going to the Guadalcanal area," and then replied briskly that he was also going to the neighboring area.

Guadalcanal, which had become an island of bloody battle between enemies and allies a long time ago, is still the front line where the death struggle continues.

Eto said admiringly, "The gentlemen of the reporting unit are also working hard!"

While trying to pour beer for Eto, the other party replied softly, "Not at all, not at all, we can't produce any results."

Just then, Nanjo, who had returned to his position, asked Eto, "Speaking of Guadalcanal, but did you meet Matsumae-kun?"

Eto said with great interest, "Matsumae told me where you lived, but what is the relationship between Guadalcanal and Matsumae?"

Nanjo pointed to the fat-headed, big-eared baldy beside him and said, "Oh, there is a big relationship. Matsumae has displayed martial arts-like legends in the forests of Guadalcanal. Ask him! He was there at the time."

"I am very sorry to excuse myself, because the time has already arrived."

The unit member who was about to depart for battle said as he lightly put the fully packed travel bag on his shoulder and left.

3. Killing Towards the Enemy

The remaining reporting unit members, who had seen off their colleague who was heading to the Solomon Islands, spoke loudly and encouraged them with non-auspicious words, and the other party was busy with this kind of reply. Amidst the laughter, the baldy turned back to his original place and said to Lieutenant Junior Grade Eto, "Well, then I will tell you about Lieutenant Matsumae's martial arts legend."

Eto said very happily, "I must ask for instruction." (Tao: Discussed from Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### Doctors' Free Clinics

(1) Dr. Zhang Ju of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics sent a letter yesterday saying: "Now that measles is prevalent, children are often infected. If care and treatment are not proper, it often leads to illness and death. This doctor has specially compiled a new treatise on measles, detailing the methods of care, etc., so that patients can learn common knowledge.

### Longevity Celebration Helps the Distressed

Luo Yingjun wrote in a letter: "Now that my late father is celebrating his 80th birthday, relatives and friends have sent gifts. In addition to returning a portion, there are still 300 yuan in gift money that cannot be returned. At this time of world change, with displacement on the road, I respectfully follow my father's wishes and donate the money to support orphaned children. I believe that my relatives and friends love me, so they will extend their kindness to my children. With such a small contribution, I dare to hope it can become a fur coat. I am somewhat hesitant. How can I celebrate a person's life like celebrating the life of the world?" (Note: The money has been received and will be distributed to Fuyou Orphanage, Youyou Jiaoyang Chu, and Children's Welfare Association, 100 yuan each. Thank you.)

### Improving the Allocation of Resources

At the current stage, the fundamental nature of the phrase "strengthening combat power" lies in maximizing the efficiency of existing total power. Under extremely limited labor and resources, there is naturally no room for further waste. The allocation of various materials and auxiliary materials should avoid being inappropriate and causing many production stoppages. However, most of shipbuilding and industry have this obstacle, which is extremely regrettable. The appropriate allocation of resources should be sought through production planning. To demand sufficient and balanced production, there must be measures that can fully promote planned production, which can be said to be a prerequisite. At the same time, in terms of allocation, the control association can be fully utilized temporarily, which is a relatively simple and effective method of solving this problem.

The mission of the control association itself is to allocate timely and appropriate materials to member companies, and to find ways to improve production efficiency. This is its most important task.

But now, should the purchase and allocation of materials and products be handled by the control association itself? Or should it be handed over to a unified allocation agency? Should the procurement of materials and the distribution of products be considered separately, or should they be included together in economic activities? These issues are worth studying. In short, the current material allocation ratio method of the control association is not perfect. It is hoped that the authorities will actively consider and find ways to improve it.

### No New Approvals from the Ministry of Finance After the Deadline for Financial Industry Registration

Regarding the registration and opening of financial institutions, since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions on August 20th of last year, the deadline was May 15th of this year. All financial institutions such as banks, silver firms, silver companies, and money shops that were approved by the Ministry of Finance for registration and licensing were:

267 in Shanghai and 161 in other places, totaling 428. As for the financial institutions in North China, since the North China Political Affairs Committee promulgated the Rules for the Management of Financial Institutions in December of the 30th year, as of December of last year, there were 85 in the city of Beiping and 230 in the city of Tianjin.

There were a total of 315 in Pingjin. However, the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei are vast and Nanjing is the capital. Shanghai is the financial center. The total number of financial institutions in other places is only over 400, which is not many. Looking back to December 18th of the 31st year, the Ministry of Finance issued a statement restricting the establishment of new financial institutions in Shanghai, stating that except for those specially approved due to special circumstances, no new establishments would be allowed. Therefore, after December 18th of last year, those in Shanghai who newly applied to the Ministry of Finance for registration were generally rejected, and there were no new financial institutions specially approved for establishment. However, those who had applied to the Ministry of Finance for registration before the aforementioned deadline, because their proposed articles of association and all procedures were still lacking, were still under review, and were subsequently approved for registration after being supplemented and corrected according to the approval, resulting in a later opening. In addition, there were some money shops that were originally partnerships and had been operating for many years, but had never applied for registration and licensing. It was not until August of last year that the Ministry of Finance approved the extension of the deadline to reorganize as companies, and they gradually reported the reorganization. However, due to the time required to convene shareholder meetings, change the articles of association, and increase capital, the approval registration has not yet been completed. However, Shanghai newspapers occasionally publish advertisements for various financial institutions that have received ministerial licenses and officially opened on schedule. Outsiders who are not aware of the content are easily misled. In fact, the aforementioned financial institutions were not newly established after being approved by the ministry after the registration deadline.

### Shanghai District Collection Bureau of Income Tax Compiles a Register of Merchants

After the investigation, the bureau will issue an income tax investigation certificate for the merchants to keep for future reference. The items to be filled in for the income tax merchant register are: (1) Compilation number (2) Commercial brand name (3) Address and house number (4) Manager (5) Capital amount (6) Date of establishment (7) Number of employees and salaries, etc.

### Ministry of Industry Determines the Standard Price of Spring Cocoons

The fresh spring cocoons of this year's spring season in the production areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have already entered the market one after another. The purchase standard price of all spring cocoons has been determined by the Ministry of Industry convening a meeting of sericulture stakeholders. The reeling ratio of 380 catties is determined as 1,829 yuan per dan (market scale), 2,253 yuan per dan (Sima scale). The reeling ratio of 402 catties is determined as 1,654 yuan per dan (market scale), 2,038 yuan per dan (Sima scale). The reeling ratio of 450 catties is determined as 1,544 yuan per dan (market scale), 1,902 yuan per dan (Sima scale). It is learned that the newly established China Silk Industry Co., Ltd. in the city has sent personnel to Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Wuxing, and other places in Zhejiang Province to purchase fresh cocoons in accordance with the official price. As for the spring cocoons in various production areas of Jiangsu Province, such as Wuxi, the company also plans to send personnel to purchase them in the near future.

### Food Bureau Promotes Agricultural Production Work and Investigates Farms Banning the Slaughter of Ploughing Cattle

Since taking over the city's two agricultural improvement zones and the agricultural and forestry experimental farm, the Food Bureau has begun to promote various tasks to improve agriculture and increase food production. After investigation, it was found that the farm land was scattered in various places and was occupied by many people after the incident. The Food Bureau has now ordered its subordinates to actively investigate and recover it to facilitate increased production. In addition, due to the high meat prices in the city, ignorant farmers often slaughter ploughing cattle privately in order to seek huge profits, resulting in a sharp decrease in ploughing cattle in the four townships. If this is not prohibited, it will have a huge impact on agricultural production. In view of this, the bureau has issued a notice to the four townships strictly prohibiting slaughter.

### Economic Bureau Continues to Appoint Conveners of Three Trade Associations

### The Relationship Between the Commercial Control Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and its Tasks

The lowest-level organization of the National Commercial Control Association, the new trade association, is scheduled to be established by the end of May. Therefore, preparations are being rushed. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which has been the leader of the Chinese industrial and commercial circles for decades, has completely changed its mission. Its future course of action is attracting much attention. As a result, the relationship between the Commercial Control Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is like a shadow, and it is expected that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will maintain its organization in the position of industrial and commercial social movement. According to a recent survey, there are as many as 350 old trade associations in Shanghai. The important ones have all been reorganized as lower-level organizations of the Commercial Control Association. All associations that are not related to material control are not included in the Commercial Control Association. Here are some examples:

(1) Trade associations outside the Commercial Control Association Most of the trade associations not included in the Commercial Control Association are not related to industry and commerce, or at least a large number are not related to industry. For example, the Bookstore Trade Association, the Stationery Trade Association, the Pawnshop Trade Association, the Tricycle Rental Trade Association, the Rickshaw Trade Association, the Hotel Trade Association, the Physician Trade Association, the Barber Trade Association, etc. Compared with the main commodity trade associations with the nature of lower-level organizations of the Commercial Control Association and newly established, the scope of all the tasks of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in the future can be glimpsed.

(2) The relationship between the Silver and Money Industry Association and the Commercial Control Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce In the past, during the heyday of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the associations under its jurisdiction that had decisive control were, needless to say, the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association. However, the Commercial Control Association is based on major commodity trade associations and is an autonomous control organization. Therefore, the financial-related associations such as the Silver and Money Industry Association will not directly join its organization. However, the chairman of the Commercial Control Association is Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, and the directors are Zhou Zuomin, leader of the financial circles in North China, Wu Zhenxiu of the Bank of China, Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, Ye Fuxiao of the Continental Bank, Xu Guanqun of the China Industrial Bank, Chen Shuilu of the Overseas Chinese Bank, and Pei Yunqing of the Tongrun Money Shop. Judging from the personnel, it is clear that the Commercial Control Association has maintained close relations with the financial circles. It is heard that the Commercial Control Association is considering establishing a financial sector in order to make this relationship more concrete. Therefore, it is generally believed that the Silver and Money Industry Association will transform from the protagonist in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the protagonist in the Commercial Control Association in the future.

(3) Future activities of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Judging from the above, the future situation of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce can be imagined. The task of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the work of an industrial and commercial social group. For example, calling on various trade associations for the North China Relief Movement is not the task of the Commercial Control Association, but can be said to be the task of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. As a result, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will become the center of industrial and commercial social welfare movements.

Regarding the issue of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the views of the industrial and commercial circles in the concession are generally as follows:

The mission of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will inevitably change, but it cannot be considered that the tradition of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been eliminated. The newly organized Commercial Control Association can also be considered a new Municipal Chamber of Commerce in the era of controlled economy. Because the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the mother of the Commercial Control Association, it can be said that there is no small contribution from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in the development of industry and commerce and the promotion of the Chinese revolution since the Republic of China. Looking forward and backward, it is firmly believed that the Commercial Control Association, which is produced under the development of the controlled economy, will be able to complete its great mission.
