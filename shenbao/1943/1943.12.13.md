### Rectifying Railway Transportation

The primary goal of railway transportation is to provide convenience for travelers. We will not hesitate to delve into the details and repeatedly review the matter in writing. Prior to 1937, the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways were known as model railways among all the railways in the country. The passenger transport volume of these railways ranked first among all railways in the country. Every year at the end of the lunar year, when factories in Shanghai shut down and tens or even hundreds of thousands of male and female workers returned to their hometowns for the Lunar New Year holiday, these railways were still able to maintain order, preventing scenes of crowding and chaos inside the stations and on the trains. Passengers felt deeply convenient, and society praised them unanimously. To this day, this impression remains deeply etched in the minds of travelers.

In recent years, the order of railway transportation has been steadily declining. Public opinion has repeatedly called for improvement. Although the Central China Railway authorities have been able to respect both the circumstances and the feelings, and attempted rectification, the situation quickly reverted to its old state after a period of time. The suffering of passengers is naturally undeniable, and even the management of the South Manchuria Railway used to satisfy passengers. It is said that in the past, the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways also referred to and improved upon Japanese management methods in many aspects of management. Now, the key personnel of the Central China Railway Company are all Japanese railway experts. Why can't they apply their half-century of management experience to this important transportation line? This is inevitably a question.

In all fairness, half of the blame for the disorder in railway transportation should be borne by the railway itself, and the other half should be borne by government agencies. According to the Xin Shen Bao, as many as 12,000 individual carriers enter and exit the Shanghai North Station every day. Such a huge number of passengers is of course beyond the capacity of the current station area and the existing transportation means. The reason why there are so many individual carriers is simply because goods cannot circulate smoothly in various places. There is demand but no supply in local areas, and prices are soaring. Therefore, unemployed vagrants, seeing the opportunity for profit, flock to engage in smuggling. If all controlled goods can be distributed on schedule according to the actual needs of the people, and merchants are allowed to freely purchase large quantities of non-controlled goods and are provided with transportation convenience, then the balance of supply and demand in various places will be achieved, prices will fall, individual carriers will naturally disappear, and railway order will be immediately restored. This is of course not something that the railway itself can do. Therefore, we say that government agencies cannot but bear half of the responsibility. The reason lies here.

Furthermore, the railway itself also has various shortcomings. Maintaining order within the station area, providing convenience for passengers, and reducing their loss of time and money are the responsibilities and obligations of the railway company. According to what we have heard, the lines of passengers waiting to buy tickets are mixed with many unemployed vagrants who specialize in scalping tickets on the black market, and some even sell their place in line as soon as they get money. Railway staff and the police maintaining order are nearby, and it is impossible to say that they are completely unaware. The railway authorities should instruct the responsible police officers to conduct secret investigations, strictly enforce crackdowns, and establish strict reward and punishment measures for continuous assessment. Even if the accumulated habits are difficult to completely eliminate for a while, at least they would not dare to be so blatant and rampant as they are now. Benefiting genuine passengers and restoring the railway's reputation would already be a significant achievement.

Another way to reduce congestion in purchasing tickets at the station is for the railway company to increase the number of authorized ticket sales agencies, so that buyers do not gather in one place, making it impossible to maintain order in the station. To prevent unscrupulous individuals from reselling purchased tickets on the black market, it may be stipulated that the ticket must indicate the holder's citizen ID number, and if the ID number does not match the ticket when checking tickets, the ticket can be invalidated and severely punished.

Another unsatisfactory situation inside the station is that passengers who have already purchased tickets are often not allowed to enter the platform. As a result, some people come forward and offer to lead them in through side doors and hidden paths, and passengers naturally have to pay a considerable price. It is reasonable for railway staff to limit the number of passengers on each train to ensure passenger safety and reduce crowding on the train. Why are those who go through side doors and hidden paths not subject to these restrictions? We believe that the fundamental restriction method should be to stipulate the number of tickets sold according to the capacity of each train. Then this current undesirable phenomenon can be eliminated naturally.

Rectifying railway transportation has become a unanimous demand in society today. As a temporary solution, the railway authorities should first strictly manage and gradually improve within their own scope. As a fundamental solution, it still requires the cooperation of the government to allow smooth exchange of goods in various places. Otherwise, individual carriers will only continue to increase, and no matter how hard the railway company tries, it will be impossible to fundamentally solve the problem of passenger congestion and maintain good order inside the station and on the train.

### Strengthening the Status of Axis Powers, Striving for Joint Victory, Celebrating the Anniversary of the Alliance, German and Foreign Broadcasts

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: According to Haitong News Agency, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop delivered a broadcast speech on Saturday to celebrate the second anniversary of the Tripartite Pact, stating: "In the fierce battles on various battlefields of the current stage of the World War, the Axis forces have been able to control the situation. In East Asia, Japan has occupied an absolute advantage. In Europe, the great victories of the Axis forces have extended the war into enemy territory, reaching the periphery of Europe. Looking back at the achievements of the Tripartite Pact over the past two years, it can be seen that the enemy is trying to shake the position occupied by the countries of the Tripartite Pact in Europe and Asia. In this vast battlefield, although there are some fluctuations in certain battlefields, and the enemy may occasionally gain local victories, there is an undeniable fact today, that is, the position occupied by the countries of the Tripartite Pact in Europe and Asia has not been shaken."

Militarily speaking, although the enemy's attack on the west coast of Europe has been propagandized for a long time, the Germans have not yet felt threatened. If the west coast of Europe could be conquered by empty words, then the enemy would have been on the Rhine River long ago. The German General Staff is not moved by the nervous empty words of the Jews, international manipulators, and their supporters. An unprecedented large-scale fortress has been built on the Atlantic coast, and the troops defending this fortress are eager to fight a deadly battle with the enemy. The enemy's terror air raids on Germany are a trick of the anti-Axis powers' "attempted division". The enemy knows that Germany's military industry cannot be destroyed by air raids, so they openly target German civilians as air raid targets. Germany will retaliate against this kind of reckless behavior.

It is extremely difficult for the anti-Axis powers to achieve a decisive victory through continuous meetings. The enemy's offensive of speeches, communiques, and intelligence conferences against the Axis powers is merely a smokescreen to mask their anxiety that they are unable to achieve victory on the battlefield, as if the Axis powers have already been defeated. As far as the actual results of these conferences are concerned, their effectiveness is minimal. The German conferences can be taken as an example, as the discussions are nothing more than trivial matters. The culprits of this war are the three giants who participated in the Tehran Conference. All the enemy's conferences are a testament to the three enemy countries' unbridled imperialism. They have already abandoned the Atlantic Charter and are openly discussing the distribution of the world. This distribution does not take into account the attitudes of other countries. Hundreds of millions of people in Europe and Asia under the unity of the Tripartite Pact know the threats they face today and are working together for justice to win a common victory.

### Tripartite Mutual Telegrams of Congratulations

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: The German Head of State sent a congratulatory telegram to the Japanese Emperor: "On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Japanese-German-Italian military alliance, I wish your country constant victory and even more glorious success in the future.

Tokyo, December 12th, Central News Agency: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo sent separate telegrams to the German Head of State Hitler and the Italian Chairman Mussolini to celebrate the second anniversary of the Tripartite Pact. Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu also sent separate telegrams to the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Mussolini, who is also the Italian Foreign Minister, on the same day. At the same time, the German Head of State Hitler also sent a telegram to Japanese Prime Minister Tojo on the same day.

Rome, December 12th, Central News Agency: According to Haitong News Agency, Mussolini sent telegrams to the German Head of State, the Japanese Emperor, and the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister on the anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact, expressing Italy's determination to continue fighting with its allies.

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: The German Head of State Hitler and the Italian Chairman Mussolini exchanged congratulatory telegrams as follows: "German Head of State to the Italian Chairman: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Tripartite Alliance, I extend my congratulations to Your Excellency. I fully understand Your Excellency's indomitable spirit during the war against our common enemy, and I am confident that the final victory of the three allied countries will ensure the happiness and freedom of our people. Italian Chairman to the German Head of State: The Tripartite Military Alliance was concluded by the three countries to achieve final victory and build a new world order. On this second anniversary of the alliance, I hereby declare to Your Excellency my determination that the Fascist Republic is preparing to drive the enemy out of the front lines and recover its territory."

### Mussolini Explains Determination

Rome, December 12th, Central News Agency: Italian Republican Government Chairman Mussolini, in his capacity as Foreign Minister, delivered a broadcast speech yesterday, explaining his intention to resolutely cooperate with the Allies. The main idea was that in the past few years, Italy had experienced many major events due to the Italian King and his party's betrayal and surrender to the enemy, but these storms had not changed the position of the Fascist government in the slightest. Now, the government is cooperating fully with Japan and Germany in the most effective way, and this cooperation will be proven when the Italian army, which will be reorganized in the near future, reappears on the battlefield. I am confident that the revitalized Italian army will be able to regain its prestige and fight bravely on the battlefield, washing away the stains of betrayal and surrender to the enemy.

### Rommel Inspects European Defenses

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: According to Haitong News Agency, the German military spokesman mentioned yesterday Rommel's inspection of defense projects, saying that Rommel felt satisfied.

The United Kingdom and the United States must provide assistance to Stalin, but the measures taken by the British and American troops in Italy are not a genuine assistance to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the German commander expects that the United Kingdom and the United States will attempt to invade Europe as an attempt to organize a second front. Germany and its allies are prepared.

### Gurkha Soldiers Mutinied, Anti-British Movement in India Intense

Calcutta, December 12th, Central News Agency: Due to the severe food shortage in the Chittagong area of Bengal and the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, the anti-British independence movement among the Indian people is becoming increasingly intensified. Recently, this atmosphere has spread to the Indo-Burmese border. According to Indian soldiers who have surrendered or been captured, the anti-British atmosphere among Indian soldiers is very strong. In addition, according to reliable information obtained locally, it is reported that Gurkha soldiers suddenly mutinied in the British Indian army, and the situation is extremely serious. It turned out that on November 20th, a conflict occurred between British officers and Gurkha soldiers in a British army camp stationed in the front line of Tiddim. As a result, the Eastern Region Command of the British Indian Army ordered the Gurkha troops and mixed troops in that area to be on alert, and at the same time imposed group punishments on these good Gurkha soldiers. In addition, the British military authorities had previously withdrawn anti-British Sikh troops across the board in July, sent pro-British Gurkha troops to the front line, and dispatched British naval personnel to request various measures to restrain Indian soldiers. All of this was a manifestation of the British Indian military authorities' concern about the mutiny of Indian soldiers. However, this time, the Gurkha soldiers, who have always been the most pro-British among Indian soldiers, have clashed with the British army, and it is expected that there may be no more Indian soldiers whom the British military authorities can trust, causing great obstacles to the recapture operation in Burma.

### Overseas Chinese in Shanghai Hold Liberation Ceremony; All Property Also Simultaneously Liberated

Central News Agency reports: Since Italy's Badoglio regime betrayed the Axis on September 9th, the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde" and gunboat "Lepanto," docked in the Huangpu River, were scuttled by their own crews. Italians residing in Shanghai were then treated as quasi-enemies. The Japanese side adopted measures of detention and other actions against enemy nationals. Subsequently, with the establishment of the Italian Social Republic headed by Mussolini, which continued to loyally support the Axis, the Japanese government recognized the Italian Social Republic. Therefore, this time, it was decided to liberate over a thousand Italian residents. Yesterday (the 12th) morning, liberation ceremonies were held at various detention centers. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, all Italians were gathered at the square of the Ewo Cotton Mill on Hart Road to hold a notification ceremony by the relevant authorities regarding the liberation, a swearing-in ceremony for the new nation, and the establishment ceremony of the Shanghai Italian Autonomous Committee. The notification and liberation ceremony commenced punctually at 3:00 PM. First, Japanese Consul General Yano delivered a speech, hoping that the Italians would not violate Japan's intention in liberating the Italians, and also forcefully asserted that the Axis would definitely win the Greater East Asia War. Subsequently, the former commander of the Italian station troops in Shanghai, Paolo Pontani, was selected as the chairman of the Italian Autonomous Committee and addressed the entire Italian community. Finally, the new Italian national anthem was sung in unison, and the ceremony concluded at 4:00 PM. The chairman's address of the Italian Autonomous Committee, the proclamation by the Japanese Army and Navy regarding the liberation of Italian property in Shanghai, and the statements of the local authorities are recorded separately below:

Address by the Chairman of the Italian Autonomous Committee

Since July 27th, when Badoglio forcibly seized power, we here have been filled with disappointment. But today, we Italians in Shanghai have received the great favor of Japan, opening up a new path for us. We can never forget the righteous measures taken by the Japanese authorities, and we deeply believe that our joy today will surely lead to a good historical outcome in the future. All Italians in Shanghai should dedicate our full strength to the revival of our motherland and make it glorious.

Proclamation of Liberation by the Japanese Army and Navy

Regarding the liberation of Italian nationals' property, the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai announced: The proclamation regarding Italian property issued by the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai on September 15, Showa 18 (1943), will be lifted as of December 12, Showa 18 (1943). For all property belonging to Italian nationals, individuals or legal entities, the application of the said proclamation will be lifted from the date of liberation for items not related to military affairs. Those who wish to have their property released should apply for a property liberation certificate from the Italian Property Investigation Office at the corner of Nanjing Road and the Bund between December 20 and December 27, presenting their release advisory letter. Based on the proclamation issued by the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai on September 15, Showa 18 (1943), regarding the confiscation and detention of all weapons, ammunition, cameras, and telescopes belonging to Italian nationals, cameras and telescopes that were detained and belonged to Italian nationals liberated on December 12, Showa 18 (1943), will be returned to their owners. Those who wish to have these detained items returned should bring their detention certificate and inquire at the Foreign Affairs Section of the Gendarmerie Corps on Guangdong Road between December 20 and December 23.

Statement by Relevant Authorities

Regarding the liberation of Italian nationals, the relevant authorities issued a statement saying: After September 9th, Italian nationals were treated as quasi-enemies and subjected to various measures. Subsequently, Italy established a Fascist government, which was recognized by the Japanese government, and its official name was formally changed to the Italian Social Republic. Therefore, this government has now lifted the previous measures against Italians residing in East Asia who are recognized as being loyal to the Fascist government. The liberation of Italians was implemented in Shanghai on December 12th. Regarding the management of all property belonging to Italian nationals, a proclamation was issued by the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai on September 15th prohibiting free disposal. However, this time, in accordance with the Army and Navy proclamation of December 12th, this is also being lifted. For all property belonging to Italian nationals, if it is not related to military affairs, the application of the Army and Navy proclamation of September 15th is lifted. Therefore, transactions with Italian nationals will be free in the future. Furthermore, as the Fascist government has not yet officially appointed officials in Shanghai for the time being, an autonomous committee is being organized to handle Italian affairs.

### Difficulty Obtaining Fuel; Hot Water Shops Temporarily Suspend Operations; Guild Actively Seeks Solutions

Over a thousand hot water shops in the city are currently facing difficulties in obtaining sufficient fuel, leading to widespread temporary closures. The main fuel for hot water shops is coal dust. The guild has repeatedly sought ways to alleviate the difficulties faced by its members: 1. Requesting that the authorities supply fuel at a fair price. 2. Unifying the price of coal slag left over from the power company's burning and assigning the guild to be responsible for handling the distribution procedures. 3. Contacting the Central Reserve Bank to exchange small denomination notes for larger denomination notes to facilitate turnover and benefit the current environment. So far, the members in the 1st, 8th, and southern districts have successively purchased fairly priced coal twice, and the fairly priced coal in the northern district of the Huangpu River has also begun to be sold. However, the supply of coal slag has reportedly been temporarily suspended due to source issues. Because members are unable to obtain sufficient fairly priced coal, and with the supply of coal slag cut off and unable to purchase more from the black market, they have had to temporarily suspend operations. Now, the guild, recognizing that hot water is an essential item for citizens, is strictly enforcing the standard selling price of two jiao per scoop. At the same time, it is dispatching capable personnel to actively seek solutions, hoping to resolve the fuel panic of the industry as soon as possible.

### Du-Huang Wedding; Frugality Aids Education

### Temporary Measures for Residence Permits in the Western District; Implementation and Processing in the Short Term

Since the merger of the 1st and 3rd police stations of this city and the Shanghai-Yin Police Bureau, the baojia (neighborhood watch) districts under the jurisdiction of each police force have also gradually been unified and are all under the jurisdiction of the 1st Police Bureau. The original 4th District Husi Baojia Office has moved to the west of the railway. The Baojia affairs in the area east of the railway are now handled by the West District Baojia Office established by the 1st Police Bureau.

Yesterday's Class A match between Donghua and Portuguese Merchants ended with Donghua winning 5-0, a complete rout for the Portuguese team, which was beyond the expectations of most fans. Donghua led 2-0 in the first half. The ten thousand spectators were jubilant. Donghua controlled the game for the entire ninety minutes, completing Donghua's streak of four wins in four matches. Li Yao, Wang Qian, and Sheng Youyuan played well on both flanks and received much praise. The Portuguese Merchants were completely disorganized yesterday, leading to their defeat. Only Oliveira performed reasonably well.

### Casualties of British and American Soldiers Since the Start of the War

The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 8th of this month: The approximate number of casualties inflicted by the Japanese Army and Navy on the British and American forces in the two years since the start of the Greater East Asia War is as follows:

American forces: 277,000

British forces: 122,000

During the same period, approximately 159,000 Japanese Army and Navy personnel were killed or wounded in combat with British and American forces.

Strengthening the War of Attrition

Two years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Thanks to the divine protection and the courageous officers and soldiers, the total counterattack of the enemy, the United Kingdom and the United States, and the fierce decisive battle covering the entire Greater East Asia region are now unfolding. The damage inflicted on the enemy, the United Kingdom, and the United States by the valiant battles of the Japanese military forces in the past two years can be said to be unprecedented in military history. From the point of view of human consumption, as announced by the General Headquarters, there are as many as 399,000 people. Although the enemy, the United Kingdom, and the United States, have consumed so many people, the war has not yet ended. What the British and American leaders have announced in previous meetings is still arrogant and rude towards Japan, claiming that there is absolutely no compromise except unconditional surrender. However, the war of attrition tactics adopted by the Japanese military have been successful, and the enemy is still trying to inflict human damage on the people. In order to bleed the UK and the US to death, it is necessary to strengthen the war of attrition tactics, so that the enemy pays a fatal human consumption.

Economy

### All Banks in This City Have Been Reorganized; Total of 162 with Capital of Over 200 Million Yuan

The money shops of the Money Industry Guild members used to be mostly partnerships with some sole proprietorships. Their responsibility was extremely important. In order to strengthen the organization of money shops, the Ministry of Finance ordered that all partnership money shops be reorganized into corporations. They have already been re-registered and preliminary business licenses have been issued. The reorganization has been completed, so the existing 162 money shops are all limited liability companies in nature, and their business is conducted entirely in accordance with laws and regulations. According to a reporter from Shanghai News Agency who interviewed banking experts: Year of establishment of each clearing money shop: Guangxu 20 (1894) one, Guangxu 28 (1902) one, Guangxu 33 (1907) one, Republic of China 1 (1912) one, 3 (1914) one, 4 (1915) two, 13 (1924) one, 16 (1927) one, 18 one, 22 one, 23 one, 28 one, 29 four, 30 seventeen, 31 forty-two, 32 eighty-six. Capital of each clearing money shop: 9 with less than 600,000 yuan with 500,000 yuan or more, 4 with less than 700,000 yuan with 600,000 yuan or more, 1 with less than 800,000 yuan with 700,000 yuan or more, 1 with less than 1,000,000 yuan with 900,000 yuan or more, 66 with less than 1,500,000 yuan with 1,000,000 yuan or more, 13 with less than 2,000,000 yuan with 1,500,000 yuan or more, 34 with less than 3,000,000 yuan with 2,000,000 yuan or more, 16 with less than 4,000,000 yuan with 3,000,000 yuan or more, 3 with less than 5,000,000 yuan with 4,000,000 yuan or more, several with less than 6,000,000 yuan with 5,000,000 yuan or more, 2 with 6,000,000 yuan. The current paid-in capital of the above 162 money shops is 268,005,000 yuan.

### Banks and Money Shops Handle Year-End Closing; Loans Must Be Cleared Before the Deadline

With the year-end closing period for the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943) approaching, the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank and Money Industry Guild members' banks and shops have begun preparing for the year-end business settlement. The Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank has ordered the responsible departments to start handling the settlement of interbank deposits and interest, and various banks have scheduled the settlement of accounts with the Central Reserve Bank and commercial departments. All outstanding loans must be cleared before the end of the settlement period, and each bank will extend its office hours internally during the interest settlement period. The year-end closing for money shops is the end of the lunar year, and only an ordinary settlement is made for the national calendar closing period. Currently, all banks and shops are temporarily suspending the acceptance of loan requests before the closing period. Due to the closing relationship, the money market has been quite tight recently. It is reported that the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank Industry Joint Preparatory Committee, in order to maintain financial stability, will try their best to regulate the fund positions for interbank lending to smoothly get through the end of the year. It is said that all banks and money shops have made profits this year.

### Shanghai's Financial Market Remained Calm Last Week

The city's financial, industrial, and commercial situation remained stable last week. Some speculators in the market, in order to seek a resurgence, created and spread rumors to confuse people. It was difficult to see an increase in the black market. Public bonds were abundant, and prices slightly increased. The official listed prices for gold import duties and jewelry remained unchanged. The interbank lending rate started at 1.8 jiao. The prices of various daily necessities were generally flat. The market price of grain did not increase or decrease. Because the Rice Coordination Association has been continuously purchasing and shipping Jinmi rice from the mainland to Shanghai, increasing the amount of rice in Shanghai, the people's hearts are at ease. The prices of matches and tobacco have also not changed. However, the supply of coal briquettes is lacking, and the black market price has risen sharply, with the situation of much demand and little supply. It is reported that the authorities are trying to transport and relieve the situation.

### Unprecedented Failure of the US Navy

A certain famous Arctic military strategist commented on the US military's Pacific counteroffensive in the Capiinte Report on November 27 as follows, attracting widespread attention.

Attempting to Conceal Defeats

Since the Battle of Makin, the US Navy's desire to use certain Pacific islands as operational bases has become increasingly strong. The so-called "Pacific Offensive" of the US Navy has been underway for the past three months, with results that have backfired and resulted in significant sacrifices. The Axis powers have opened new channels to conceal these failures with embellished accounts to benefit the US military. However, the Japanese side has provided impartial reports, accurately compiling and publishing the major losses suffered by the American side, like degrees of accuracy of the weather. The US could not conceal it, and in light of the serious situation, South Fork urgently summoned his operational collaborators for review and discussion.

### A Record of an Inspection of the Southwestern Pacific Front, the Hell of the World

The author, Eddie Rickenbacker, is the manager of Eastern Air Lines, a large-scale American airline. Last autumn, he was ordered by the US Secretary of War, Stimson, to inspect the Southwest Pacific front. Not long after departure, the plane he was on malfunctioned, causing him to drift on the Pacific Ocean for 21 days. After being rescued, he transferred to Australia to inspect US military bases in New Guinea and Guadalcanal. After returning to the US, he released his inspection report, detailing the plight of American soldiers under intense heat, swarms of mosquitoes, and Japanese attacks. He concluded that the United States should increase production and send more military supplies to the front lines. The following is based on an abridged translation of the original article published in the Asahi Shimbun.

Southern Fortress

Comparing the feeling of entrusting one's life to a lifeboat and drifting aimlessly on the sea for twenty-one days with the current ocean flight at a speed of 120 knots, the difference in joy and misery is like heaven and hell. In short, this time we were flying to a clearly defined destination, and our lives had a purpose again. The PBY naval aircraft we were on passed by an island guarded by a Sea Bee unit and arrived at Noumea before dark. After arriving, we immediately went to the local hospital for a medical checkup. The hospital was very large, and the operating room even had air conditioning. The results of the doctor's examination showed that further inspection trips would be possible. I immediately reported this to Secretary of War Stimson. Soon, I received a reply telegram from the Secretary of War. At the same time, Army Air Forces commander Arnold also informed me that a transport plane had been dispatched rapidly from the Pacific coast.

Regarding this Noumea base, due to military secrets, I cannot say much. I can only say that the island is full of all kinds of military vehicles. This "South Sea Paradise" has now been transformed into a "South Sea Fortress."

Desolate Ruins

Arnold scheduled the transport plane from Honolulu to arrive on November 27 (note: of last year). We departed from Noumea for Australia on December 1. Shortly after, we arrived in Brisbane on the east coast of Australia. There, we awaited MacArthur's instructions. Soon after, we arrived at his headquarters in New Guinea... All comfortable arrangements. However, because New Guinea is a war zone, the B-24 we have been using up to now is a non-military transport plane, and there is danger if we fly there. Therefore, MacArthur gave us special instructions, telling us to take a B-17 belonging directly to the commander (a strait between Australia and New Guinea). The transversal flight took a day. I, who had received military education, still have a slight lingering affection for the smell of gunpowder. When flying over this strait, I hoped to encounter one or two Japanese fighter planes, so I could witness the activity of the shooters. It is a pity that this hope did not materialize. We flew to Port Moresby. We immediately visited MacArthur's headquarters. Port Moresby is simply not a place for humans to live. It's just a pit. The wind blowing from the Owen Stanley Range brings... Red dust all over the sky? And the heat is almost unbearable. In addition, there are swarms of terrible mosquitoes. In the past, this place was also called Moresby City. Now, because of the continuous bombing by Japanese bombers, it can no longer be called a "city." What remains is only a desolate abandoned city and the small huts of the natives. Besides that, there is nothing else. In the harbor... are the wrecks of half-sunken cargo ships bombed by enemy planes.

MacArthur's headquarters is also a simple, residence-like cottage. In another small room, there is a cold water shower head installed. MacArthur's quarters are next to the war room. After dinner (and a pleasant chat) for a while. MacArthur and Air Force Commander Kenney devoted themselves to discussing air operations.

Out of personal interest, I tried to talk to MacArthur about the battles of Bataan and Corregidor. However, he only gave a rough outline. These past events must be deeply buried in his heart. What I particularly felt was his unusual concern for air operations in the Southwest Pacific. He was also very enthusiastic about aircraft. In New Guinea, there is no other way to replenish troops, weapons, ammunition, food and other supplies to the front lines except by using aircraft.

Human Hell

It was not until I set foot on the land of New Guinea that I truly recognized the naked reality of air power in the Pacific War. There is no airfield here like the ones imagined back home. When you read about "airplanes in the Southwest Pacific" in reports from the front lines, you must immediately picture this image: In the midst of countless mountains and forests, clear out dense forests and create a makeshift... seat. Create a flat area of 200 to 300 feet in width. Even an experienced civilian pilot with thousands of hours of flight time would feel... hesitant about taking off from such a place. However, the young men in the Air Force whose training courses have just ended know that there is no better airfield than this. In this hell of heat, dust, and pests... In New Guinea, I sincerely think that military...leaders of production and labor circles should also come to this front line, even if only for a day. Of course, this is an impractical thought. It's just something to talk about. However, if it could be realized, production would definitely increase. If these people saw the... members who were under the incomplete shelters made of grass and palm leaves...repairing a B-24 bomber worth $350,000, they would... realize what was going on. If they talked to the pilots, they would not be able to utter boastful words.

Extremely Difficult

On the way back to Australia from New Guinea with Air Force Commander Kenney, Commander Kenney told me about the situation of the repair and maintenance bases that the US military was building hundreds of miles behind the war zone. It is said that if it is completed, then the Pacific Ocean will be considered the largest base country for aircraft alternation. This means that in order to reduce a few minutes of combat, the aircraft have to sweep across hundreds of miles of ocean. From this base, it is also impossible to take a B-24 to Guadalcanal. So, I got back on the "Flying Fortress"... It's the vast ocean again...

Before long, an island appeared on the horizon.

"That's Guadalcanal," the pilot told me.

With one fighter plane accompanying us, the "Flying Fortress" circled over Henderson Airfield, so I could carefully survey the nearby forests. The trees are densely packed, like a sea of green. It was truly something I had never seen before. On... US... warships were patrolling.

Although we only spent a day and a night on this island, although we only cautiously learned a little about the reality of the war, I myself, and even the whole group, was frightened by how different the situation was here. If New Guinea is a pit of hell, then this Guadalcanal is ten times worse than it.

The famous Henderson Airfield, seems not so bad in photos. But in fact, it cannot be called an airfield, it is only a clearing cleared in the forest. The pilots call it "The Field." On both sides of the runway are the wreckage of aircraft shot down in the air or destroyed by Japanese artillery shells and bombs. The runway itself is also uneven due to bombing and shelling. Landing on it is the most difficult thing in the world. (Text excerpted from the Asahi Shimbun, November 31.)

### Incurring New Losses

In order to mitigate the impact of attacks originating from Bougainville Island, the US fleet launched an offensive against the Gilbert Islands on the 19th. However, even in this area, the US fleet suffered new losses. Putting together the aircraft lost during the "Pacific Offensive" they had been clamoring about for the past three months. As the Japanese authorities have declared, the US Navy has lost 20,000 to 35,000 soldiers in the Bougainville and Gilbert areas, as well as 30 heavy cruisers. From whatever perspective, this is one of the largest losses in naval history. When viewed from the perspective of the anti-Axis forces, this loss is even more profound. This defeat in the Pacific coincides with the large-scale offensive of the Red Army.

### The Critical Situation of the Anti-Axis Forces

Moreover, on the Southern Italian front at Cassino, the exhausted British and American forces are also in a predicament, unable to advance even a step. Therefore, at the start of their desired new operation of "advancing towards victory", the anti-Axis forces have encountered the most critical situation in the past two years of war. This cannot be said to be a crisis of... cooperation! (Note: Translated from the December 1st Western Japan Newspaper)

### Employment Record

By Gong Guangzhao

Miss Zhao has reviewed her diploma countless times. But... she took it out again today. After carefully examining the photo of the man wearing glasses, she secretly placed the diploma in front of Mrs. Zhao, pointing to the photo and asking, "Mom, do you know her?"

"Yes, ah!" Mrs. Zhao smiled with satisfaction.

Mrs. Zhao looked at Xiaoru as if she remembered something. "Ahda came today and talked about you. He said, 'My niece has graduated from college. She's about the right age and should choose a young man from a suitable family.'" I think your uncle's words make sense. I wonder what you think?"

"Ru, don't... mother... I won't marry, I'll spend my whole life with... I... I want to find something to do."

"Alright, alright, no more... listen to Ahda's words."

The sun had not yet risen below the horizon, and Miss Zhao was already awake. Pushing open the window, all was still and quiet as water, occasionally two rickshaws passed by noisily.

"Why are you getting up so early?" The young lady found it funny to think about. She wanted to read the morning newspaper. "Zhu Ma, has the newspaper come yet?" she asked in a low voice. "Miss, what do you need?"

"Did you hear about the newspaper?" Miss Zhao was a little angry.

"It's here!" Zhu Ma quickly took the newspaper placed aside, which the newspaper seller had stuffed in the crack in the door, and laboriously delivered it upstairs.

"Miss, you're really early today," Zhu Ma said.

The young lady ignored her. She took the newspaper and carefully looked for job advertisements.

She saw the advertisement for a female clerk and read it word for word: "Our company intends to hire a female secretary, who must have a clean family background, be eloquent, and possess a college degree to be qualified."

This was perfectly suited for... She read it over and over again.

"I must apply," Miss Zhao said to herself.

It was autumn, and... Miss Zhao had specially added a yellow coat to her outfit. She walked along the... street, thinking: "It would be so good if I succeeded. My uncles wouldn't gossip anymore. On Sundays, I could accompany Mom to see a play, go shopping in the park, buy one or two new clothes with my salary, like this..." She looked down at herself as if she were wearing new clothes: "Ah, the matter hasn't succeeded, why am I daydreaming!"

"Boom..." A trolley bus passed by Miss Zhao's side. She had already reached the bustling Weitou. She flipped through the company address she had brought with her, 543 Haimen Road. She followed the address and asked many times before reaching her destination. After explaining her purpose to the guard, she was led to the... manager's office.

The manager was leisurely in an armchair, very free with work: writing letters, answering the phone. "Write down your name. How much do you want for treatment, write it to me." Zhao Miss quickly wrote down her name. "Treatment?" How much? Little, not enough to spend. More, the rice bowl to others to take away, 2 paused on the paper for about three or four minutes, and finally handed in the paper with the nine characters "sustainable personal life as the principle".

Stepping out of the company's door Miss Zhao was again in the crowd.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Miss Zhao was bored reading a novel.

"Miss, express mail!" Wei Ma shouted.

"Express mail!" Miss Zhao threw her book aside and hurried downstairs. The letter was in Mrs. Zhao's hand: "Aju, you... who is this from?"

"Mom! It's Minli Trust Company."

Miss Hu pulled out the letter, which read: "After review, you are qualified. A one-month trial period will begin. We hope you will report for duty within two days."

Miss Zhao's heart was overjoyed. She took Mrs. Zhao's hand and said, "Mom, I have a job."

"A job!" Mrs. Zhao said strangely, "Who introduced you?"

"Myself!"

Miss Zhao told Mrs. Zhao about the application process without concealing anything.

"Ah! I was really kept in the dark," Mrs. Zhao said with a smile.

Happiness filled the entire Zhao family.

Miss Zhao had been working at Minli Trust Company for five days. The work was very easy. She had only sold one... In her free time, she chatted with her colleagues. They talked about dancing, movies... to the maids in the restaurant, talking about everything from all over the world. She always listened silently and never added a word, because she was a layman.

One Saturday afternoon, when it was almost time to get off work, Miss Zhao took her handbag and prepared to... leave. The manager stepped forward and said, "Miss Zhao, there is a banquet tonight. I want you to go with me. Now, you don't need to go back."

"This can't be done, Mom is waiting!" Miss Zhao thought for a moment and said.

"Maybe there are important... conversations that you need to record. However, I won't force you. In short, if you eat here, you have to listen to me. Otherwise, hehe..." the manager said coldly.

Miss Zhao did not answer and lowered her head... She had heard her colleagues say that a female secretary had once been asked by the manager to attend a banquet with him. In fact, it was not a banquet at all, but an invitation to the hotel. On the first day, the female secretary resigned.

"No, absolutely not!" She couldn't understand why he wanted her to say that.

"Okay, then... goodbye!"

The manager pressed the electric bell, and the tea server bowed and stood aside with a smiling face.

"Please ask Mr. Wang to settle Miss Zhao's salary," the manager instructed.

"Yes!" The tea server... left.

Five minutes later, a thin paper bag was handed to Miss Zhao.

Just like that, Miss Zhao was unemployed again.

### The Musician

By Lu Wan

Everything is quiet in the narrow alley; even the innocent cries of the children are gone, they all go out with bamboo baskets at dawn. It was not until the deep night that they crawled home like tired dogs. Naturally, they cannot give me a little childish comfort like the angels imagined in general. Looking up at the outside of the window, everything seems to be a static quiet beyond the floating white... enough to make people come up with desperate thoughts!

Originally growing up in a desolate like a desert, I always hoped to live in a fertile continent. Even hearing some flowing water can nourish my nerves a little. Fate is always naughty, she always arranges loneliness and dryness for me. Several times I bit my fingers hard, and bright red blood oozed out, I wanted to vent the depression in my heart all at once. But in this city, even if I open my throat and cry like a child, no one will ask about it; other than destroying my own body a little more. What else can I do?

Suddenly, a burst of melodious music came in from outside the window. Although it was not very superb, its syllables, hitting my heart rhythmically, were especially cordial and aroused a living resonance in me. Who is it? Which intentional person is caring to caress my wounded heart? I opened the window and looked out. Right across from the fence, sat... a blind man, and the music came from his waving hands. His face was frozen like a fossil, but his snakelike arm was moving quickly. After a while, the music stopped, he... stood up with a smile, warmly hugging the piano, and left. A satisfied smile... his face. I realized that he had received spontaneous comfort. Blind man! Although the world is a little too cruel to you, it does not... you see the colorful scenery, but you do not care. You have your own warm hands. This is something the world will never take away from you. By the way, I have received... comfort, but I will always hold it tight.

But what about me? Not only do I still have hands, and I haven't even...

### West Qing Basketball Carnival Night: China United Displays its Ability, Captures Giants; Tongren Courageously Defeats East China; West Qing's Situation is China's World

The most important thing for the success of any basketball team is teamwork, without any disagreement. This seems self-evident. However, in each league season in Shanghai, we see teams gather famous players to form strong teams. Occasionally, due to their skilled experience, they achieve some success. However, this is definitely not what we hope for. Bringing together people from all sides, it is difficult to perfect teamwork. This time, the Fourth Youth League has the addition of the China United team, organized by Mr. Zhang Yixiang of the China United Pharmaceutical Factory. Its players are all from the China Youth Physical Fitness Room, training together day and night. They know each other well, and their teamwork has reached an extremely tacit level. Their individual skills have also reached a divine level. Their victory is not accidental. Moreover, the entire team is under the command of one person, easily moving towards normality and rarely experiencing abnormal situations. The absolute obedience of the players to the team leader is also a major condition. The wins of South China, the power of China United, and the suppression of the once famous Eastern team by Tongren in the third week of the Fourth Youth League further emphasize the truth of this statement. Therefore, I venture to offer this commonplace observation as the opening remarks of this review, and then comment on the progress of each game:

Defeated by Monanak in the Third Round - In this battle, the Third Round had a good chance of winning, but in reality, their strength was insufficient. Monanak's stamina was quite strong. However, the generals of the Third Round, fighting, had exhausted their energy. It was indeed not easy, especially Chuan Xiangrui, who was most pleasing. They relied entirely on skill, and victory or defeat seemed irrelevant. They met the conditions of using sports to strengthen their physique. What is there to say about defeat? Worthy of praise. The score was thirty-five to twenty-seven, with Monanak triumphant. The black player, Quelie, managed the overall situation alone and did not display any particularly outstanding basketball skills worth mentioning.

Tongren Defeats China United - The key to the victory or defeat of the two teams lies in experience and physique. China United had strong physical strength and won through experience. Their teamwork was not significantly different. However, Tongren had two external generals, Jiang Shuliang and Zhang Banglun, absent. The entire team of family generals, Xuan Tong, Guan Yi, Xuan Hou, Xuan He, and Xuan Yang, fought to the end like brothers, showing no signs of discouragement. Facing a strong enemy, their spirit was commendable. China United did not use its full strength, because it was their first appearance in West Qing. They adopted a rotational tactic to achieve a better distribution of their resources. Therefore, Zhang Yixiang paid special attention to their battle plan, laying the foundation for the battle against the Giants. As a result, China United won with a score of forty to twenty-eight, a successful start.

Ren Yu Defeats Amateur - Although Ren Yu once lost to the Shantou team, they did not lose heart and continued to perform consistently. Amateur is a team striving to improve, but ultimately, they were still inferior. It was unavoidable. Although Yu Ziyue was absent from Ren Yu, the two generals Ma Canxi and Zhuo Guorong led the new players, working together and fighting bravely. Their spirit of hard work was the key to their victory. They defeated Amateur with a score of fifty to twenty-four.

South China Defeats Great China - In addition to the Liu family's three musketeers, South China also had Hu Jingui. This general's floor skills are somewhat similar to the retired Feng Nianhua. I think he has not yet reached the peak of his abilities. I hope Mr. Hu pays attention, and his future prospects will be limitless. Great China had Shen Ji'en as their general, making contributions. All the team members were young and fought desperately. The battle was extremely intense. With a difference in strength, South China won by a score of fifty-two to thirty-two.

Carnival Night

Last Friday (the 10th), West Qing hosted a match between the two giants of Chinese and Western basketball, China United and the Giants. Fans came upon hearing the news, and the hall was packed. No less than several hundred people traveled in vain. The crowd was bustling, and the cheers were electrifying, surpassing any previous event. As a result of the match, China United turned defeat into victory, overwhelming the Giants. This made the fans jump for joy. In the previous match, Tongren defeated the East, which surprised the fans. However, Tongren's good performance could not help but make the fans cheer loudly. It's no wonder that both matches of the night were extremely exciting. The audience and the players were ecstatic. The West Qing gymnasium was filled with a carnival atmosphere, which cannot be described by words. Here is a review of their results:

Tongren Defeats East China

This year's East team has gathered famous generals and is quite powerful. Logically, it should not be difficult for Tongren to defeat them. However, in the end, they suffered a miserable defeat of forty-eight to fifty-one, which was unexpected. The absence of Bao Songyuan, Wang Jinghu, Li Zu, and other generals was certainly a factor. It proves that they had a careless attitude. As the saying goes, "Pride comes before a fall." There is no need to say more. Moreover, Tongren had Zhang Banglun present, adding color and sound. Xuan Tong's shooting was divinely aided. The once famous Eastern team was thus forced to surrender to their younger brothers on the court. The fans had no preconceived notions. Since the match turned out this way, they had to shout at the top of their lungs to cheer for the newcomers. Tongren was not only happy with the victory but also satisfied with the support of the masses.

China United Captures Giants with Unity

I have already mentioned the general situation of China United in the previous paragraph. In this competition, the Giants, with their familiarity with the terrain, are confident of their unique dominance. This match was also a test for China United. They allowed the Giants to be rebellious and do whatever they wanted. The result of the first half was twenty-two to eleven, with the foreign generals leading by a large margin. At the beginning of the second half, the situation remained the same. Everyone said that China United would undoubtedly be defeated. The reporter thought that Chen Xuechai must be replaced at this time, and Zhang Liangxiong should be tried on the field, which might save the situation. Because Xuechai could not guard Funik and his shooting was inaccurate, he could not be relied upon at this time. Zhang Yixiang, with a flash of inspiration, also had this idea. Liangxiong went to the battlefield and shot from afar. He brought them back to life, chasing from twenty-eight to forty-two to thirty-five to forty-two, turning defeat into victory. This victory should be attributed to Zhang Yixiang. The fans were drunk and crazy, clapping and cheering, making it impossible to hear the judge's whistle. The carnival atmosphere contrasted sharply with the Giants' dejected expressions.

Currently, in the Group A competition of the National Sports Conference, China United and South China are the two undefeated teams. Monanak is only in third place. Monanak regards Zhu Feng as a great enemy, which is not worth mentioning. From this point of view, the situation in the Fourth Youth League must be dominated by our Chinese teams. As long as China United and South China are united, the brilliant situation of this year will be dominated by us! I pray for this! (Cong Jie)

### Football League Group A: How Magnificent the East China Team! Five to Zero Victory Over the Portuguese Merchants; Friendship One Police Also Wins

In the Group A of the Football League, last Saturday, Friendship defeated the Jewish team with a score of five to one. Yesterday, the East China team at Yiyuan scored five goals, leaving the Portuguese team battered and bruised. East China is truly magnificent! One Police won yesterday afternoon, and the Third Province team was defeated. East China eliminated another worry. In the first round, there are only two battles left against One Police and Qiaolian. The battle against Qiaolian can be won steadily, and the battle against One Police is also not a problem based on the current situation. East China can rest easy, it is a lovable team. This is not only praised by the reporter's pen but also proven by the fans' support. The team's excellent skills and spirit should lead to this result. Here is a record of the Group A battle last week:

Friendship Tries New Lineup, Jewish Team Crumbles at the Sight of the Wind

Looking at the Friendship team's first attempt at a new lineup, Zheng Yingquan was appointed as the center forward, Qu Yongfu as the left winger, and Gao Baozheng retreated to the midfielder. This was to strengthen the front line and balance the defense. Logically, it made sense. However, after the trial, they were greatly disappointed. Zheng Yingquan maintained his previous style, doing nothing. Yongfu on the left wing was out of place, and Baozheng was even more at a loss. Being out of position, it was difficult to achieve ideal results easily. Therefore, Friendship should still restore their original positions and move forward. There is hope for the future. In this battle, they won two goals in the first half, all from penalty kicks. In the second half, they realized that the new line was insufficient and returned to their original positions, which allowed them to exert their abilities. Gao Baozheng scored a goal, and Li Yichen's clever shot broke the Jewish goal three times. One goal was lost due to negligence. However, since victory was in hand, they were lenient and allowed it to happen. They lost one goal, which did not harm them, and they ended up like this. From this game, we can discuss Friendship's forwards again. They still lack a sense of connection and cannot utilize both differences, which is their inherent weakness. I hope they will strive to improve!

How Magnificent East China! The Portuguese Team is Battered and Bruised

The Portuguese team conquered One Police last week, and their momentum was indeed strong. East China conquered Friendship last week, and their intentions are self-evident. Fans did not travel far but came from all directions. The huge Yi Garden was filled to the brim. Except for the reporter's seat, there was no place to stand. East China did not disappoint the crowd. They scored five goals, slaughtering the Portuguese generals and enjoying the taste of a duck egg. This unexpected harvest made people rejoice and admire their hard work.

Of the five goals, Li Sen scored two, Wen Dai scored one, and Long Hai also scored one. One goal was scored by the Portuguese general Midi, who scored an own goal. However, the number of goals scored deeply increased the unmasked advancement of Li Yao's skills. Li Yao, who is located on the left, had a great advantage. The enemy's defense focused more on the left inner midfielder Sun Lao Jin. Li Yao was able to adapt to the needs and exert his abilities. Moreover, Lao Sun had a wish to promote newcomers, and the way to create opportunities lies here. Right winger Wang Xisheng also made contributions, making several wonderful crosses. His three shots were also strong and beautiful. However, they were all just a bit off and did not go into the goal. With this result, it is impossible to criticize him. East China's front line is strong, relying entirely on the three players in the middle, who are veteran generals, and the two newcomers on both sides, who are capable and willing to learn. The five players are like one body, and it is difficult for the enemy team to blunt their edge. Li Ning's good position in this battle was even more significant. Watching them fight, it seems effortless, and the number of balls he intercepts is countless. Waiting for work at leisure comes from experience. Therefore, in the reporter's mind, his defense is second to none in Shanghai. Li Tiansheng has a lack of reality. The Portuguese merchants' offensive was not weak, but East China's defense was solid, and they failed at the last moment, so they were short of breath. Oliveira's defense of A Dai was commendable, but he suffered from the fact that East China's five forwards were all capable, and he could not take care of everything. The rear guard Lunqiang's glimpse of the front battle was unanimously supported by his fierceness. Lan Yijing was tenacious, and Lunqiang was also a brave man, and it seemed like he saw his kung fu. In this battle, You Liangxixing used softness to overcome strength, but he only showed that he was brave but lacked strategy and did not have the demeanor of a great general. The way to defeat the enemy is to attack the enemy's weaknesses. It is impossible to overcome Lunqiang's barrier with strength. If Xixing knows why, is willing to use his brains, and moves forward from here, I can say that he will be successful in the future.

In the first round of Group A, East China has already had four wins and four victories. The remaining two games are against Qiaolian and One Police. Although Qiaolian has won against the Portuguese merchants in this competition, they were defeated by the Jewish team. Therefore, it is expected that they will capture One Police. The first round will maintain an undefeated record, firmly occupying the top spot, and will not disappoint the expectations of the fans. I hope the East China athletes will work harder, not be proud or complacent, and strive forward. Then success will come naturally, and all the football fans will be happy!

One Police's Strength is Enough; Third Province Suffers a Miserable Defeat

Third Province could have won yesterday's battle but did not win. It was already admirable. Otherwise, if One Police were defeated, East China could rest easy. In the first half, Luo Shoufu of Third Province scored a goal, leading with a score of one to zero. The police generals were discolored. In the second half, Luo scored again, and the police generals were shocked. Third Province was fully prepared for their first victory, but unexpectedly, One Police had sufficient stamina. Qielun Zifu first made a contribution, and Huang Mao Mai Qidang added two more goals, leading 3-2. Third Province suffered a miserable defeat. However, looking at the skills of Third Province, they have made rapid progress, and their future rise can be predicted. (Extraordinary Reporter)

### Seen and Heard on the Court

During the East China Friendship battle, the reporter witnessed a wristwatch and a fountain pen on the ground, trampled to pieces. During the China United Giants battle, he also saw a fan on the upper floor throwing his hat into the air, and its whereabouts were unknown.

There is a Maoxiong team in Group B, which is organized by students from the reporter's neighborhood. They get up early in the morning to practice, and they practice in a corner. It is not easy to make Zhu Jian look inferior!
