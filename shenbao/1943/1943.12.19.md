### Japanese Headquarters Announced New Britain Island Battle Situation Yesterday: Ambushing Landing Enemy Troops Achieved Significant Results

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4 PM on the 18th: Since December 15th, our garrison troops have been ambushing a portion of enemy troops that landed near Cape Gloucester on New Britain Island and are currently engaged in battle. On December 15th, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force discovered an enemy transport fleet entering the waters off Cape Gloucester. An immediate ambush and fierce bombing resulted in the following achievements: (A) First Bombing: On the morning of December 15th, one enemy large transport ship and three small transport ships, as well as over thirty landing craft, were sunk. One large cruiser was destroyed (or possibly sunk), and one small transport ship (or possibly sunk). All of the aforementioned transport ships and landing craft were fully loaded with a large number of soldiers before landing. In this action, three of our aircraft did not return. (B) Second Bombing: On the morning of December 17th, one small transport ship and one supply ship, as well as four large landing craft and several landing craft, were sunk. Two small transport ships were destroyed (heavily damaged), one supply ship (heavily damaged), and two large landing craft (heavily damaged). Eight enemy aircraft were shot down. In this action, four of our aircraft did not return. Furthermore, on December 16th, our naval air squadron conducted an air raid, inflicting considerable damage on the enemy. However, due to weather conditions, the exact results are unknown. On the morning of December 27th, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force ambushed approximately forty enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul, shooting down a total of eighteen. Two of our aircraft did not return.

Japanese Forces Control Air Supremacy, Holding Advantageous Strategic Position

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The American counteroffensive in the South Pacific has extended to New Britain Island. It is difficult to predict how the battle will develop in the future. However, the following points should be noted: The enemy's counteroffensive in the South Pacific has progressed northward from the Solomon Islands towards Bougainville Island, aiming at Rabaul, a key point in the Japanese southern operations. The enemy's advance to Cape Gloucester is to support the battle situation in eastern New Guinea, forming a strategic line to contain Rabaul from two directions. The role of the air force is extremely important in the current decisive stage. Air combat has assumed the primary mission of battle. Therefore, for operational locations, a large air force must be concentrated at high speed. The enemy's operation at Cape Gloucester must originate from Torokina on Bougainville Island or from bases in eastern New Guinea. Conversely, Japan is in an advantageous strategic position, capable of mobilizing the strong air force of Rabaul. Judging by the distance, not only can large aircraft be dispatched, but they can also be accompanied by a considerable number of fighter planes, thus fully leveraging the attack power of the Japanese naval air force. The enemy has suffered unprecedented sacrifices under Japanese air supremacy. Although enemy troops have been continuously landing on New Britain Island, where Rabaul is located, the island has special conditions, making land operations extremely difficult. As a result, what the enemy occupies is merely an isolated area in the sea.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to military authorities here: The enemy's choice to attack Cape Gloucester this time is a continuation of the operations in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea that the enemy has been conducting since last summer, and should be considered as one with the battles in the Gilbert Islands in the central Pacific. To seriously damage the Japanese Pacific strategy, the enemy landed in Lae and Finschhafen in New Guinea around September of this year, intending to use eastern New Guinea as a base to break through the Japanese strategic line. Subsequently, the enemy conducted the Bougainville Island operation, aiming to build a surrounding bridgehead at Rabaul. Now, they are invading Cape Gloucester on the southwest coast of New Britain Island, attempting to contain Rabaul on one hand and coordinate with the eastern New Guinea operation on the other, securing a base from which they can break through the Japanese southern strategic line in the center. Judging from the enemy's movements in the Pacific, it can be seen that the enemy is attempting to coordinate with the operations in the central Pacific, cutting off the Japanese connection between the Japanese forces and the Japanese mainland. However, the recent enemy landing on a corner of the west coast of the island has come at a great cost. The enemy's disregard for sacrifices in engaging in decisive battles reveals their internal distress. Now that the enemy is attempting to attack New Britain Island, it is expected that they will launch offensives from a corner of New Britain Island, the waters off Bougainville Island, eastern New Guinea, or even the Pacific, regardless of any sacrifices. However, the Japanese side has strengthened its defenses and is prepared to inflict a painful blow.

Weekly Commentary

### Japan's Increased Production Campaign

– Yun Zhong

In the first year of the Greater East Asia War, starting with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, great victories were achieved repeatedly. In the second year, there were some changes, and in addition to continuing to engage in the decisive battle to destroy Britain and America, the construction of Greater East Asia was further promoted, entering the so-called stage of simultaneous war and construction. In the third year of the Greater East Asia War, fighting for the construction and protection of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is therefore of unusually important significance to strengthen the production posture to assist the war in achieving a decisive victory.

Strengthening Military Production

The main task under the slogan of "Certain Victory Production" is naturally to strengthen military production. Particular attention should be paid to the enactment of the Japanese Military Supplies Company Law, which is mainly aimed at eliminating the remnants of individualism and liberalism in business management, eliminating profit-seeking and profit-first principles, and ensuring that the management of all military supplies-related enterprises is completely under the requirements of the state and unified, in order to achieve the goal of enhancing combat power in the shortest possible time to protect the Greater East Asia War.

The greatest task in enhancing heavy-demand production is to increase aircraft production. Efforts are being made in three areas: First, in the political aspect, it is connected with the organization and situation of the country to achieve the so-called "unification of ordering and supply." The Japanese government established the Ministry of Military Supplies on November 1st, attempting to promote innovative plans from this aspect. Second, in the technical aspect, special attention is paid to the research and improvement of aircraft production technology, with the aim of surpassing the enemy in both quality and quantity. Third, in terms of labor management, truly needed personnel are concentrated, and a reasonable allocation is made so that everyone can exert their effectiveness in producing to serve the country.

Promoting Enterprise Consolidation

The speed of Japanese enterprise consolidation has gradually accelerated since the announcement of the "Essentials for Consolidating Enterprises to Enhance Combat Power" on May 1st of this year. According to the "Essentials," there are two goals for enterprise consolidation: First, to quickly convert enterprises that have not been "combatized" into combat power. That is, all enterprises and productivity that are not necessary for carrying out the war are systematically transferred to military supplies and other important sectors, so as to maximize efficiency. Secondly, in order to increase steel production, efforts are made to recover all kinds of necessary "iron," and various labor forces are also working hard to transfer and allocate to military supplies and other "key sectors."

The second goal of Japanese enterprise consolidation is to organize and strengthen the aforementioned key enterprises. That is, in accordance with the needs of the war's progress, efforts are made to refresh the production functions of these sectors in order to maximize productivity. In terms of methods, the main thing is to concentrate industrial production forces - namely labor, materials, power, transportation, capital - in military supplies and other important sectors, in order to utilize them, and to promote the adjustment of enterprises in non-key sectors.

The object of enterprise consolidation is the so-called first type of industrial sector. First, there was the "Essentials for Consolidating the Textile Manufacturing Industry" on July 29th, followed by the promulgation of consolidation essentials for various industries, and the issuance of detailed rules for the implementation of the 41 types of metal recovery orders. Approximately 80 types of enterprises need to be consolidated. At the same time, in order to increase the decisive battle power, the so-called second type of industrial sectors are strengthened to expand and rationalize them. In terms of methods, one is to increase operational efficiency, and the other is to expand the scale of operations, with special attention paid to the development of industrial mobilization.

The true expansion of productivity, in addition to quantitative increases, also requires qualitative improvements, and the establishment of a system in which "gathered production factors" can maximize their effectiveness. Therefore, special emphasis is placed on the consolidation and strengthening of enterprise sectors and the refreshing and improvement of production functions.

Strengthening National Mobilization

In order to achieve a leap in the production of aircraft and other so-called ultra-priority products, the Japanese government has specifically established domestic strengthening policies. In order to realize "certain victory production," particular emphasis is placed on strengthening national mobilization. For example, men are now prohibited from employment in certain specific occupations, and efforts are being made to expand the scope of military conscription and increase the efficiency of conscripted labor.

The expansion of the scope of conscription, in particular, represents the direction of the new enterprise system and even the economic system through the consolidation of military supplies companies. Furthermore, in order to increase the work efficiency, that is, the production efficiency, of the conscripted labor force, more attention is paid to special training and education, and the institutionalization of the livelihood guarantee system is realized. The main training method is naturally to send them to the National Labor Training Center, but with limited accommodation capacity, many are conducted directly within various production factories, so that every conscripted citizen becomes a full-fledged industrial warrior in production and training.

Secondly, in order to ensure the enhancement of productivity, the income of producers is guaranteed to the best of our ability. The main thing is that the "National Conscription Support Association" carries out various supply businesses. Generally speaking, if the remuneration received after conscription is less than the previous income, the necessary subsidies are given after fully considering the previous income, age, number of family members, etc.

In order to enhance the spirit of "100 million citizens rising up in diligent labor" and to ensure that conscripts have no worries and can concentrate on public service, no effort is spared in various support and condolence movements for families and bereaved families. In particular, the "Combat Power Enhancement National Conscription Support Strengthening Movement" from November 26th to 30th was used to boost the spirit of wartime production. At the same time, improvements in project management were implemented to organically coordinate all living forces "people" and inanimate forces "things," improve business management, and maximize the effectiveness of productivity.

In addition to the above-mentioned points, "certain victory production" also focuses on the establishment of a national decisive battle economic system, which can be divided into the following points: First, in order to enhance transportation efficiency, efforts are made to thoroughly rationalize existing equipment. The biggest problem in transportation today is the shortage of ships, that is, efforts are made to increase ship production, and for existing transportation tools and equipment, efforts are made to increase their efficiency, that is, to realize the so-called "unification and efficiency of transportation," and then to realize "the integration of sea and land and the rationalization of sea and land transportation routes," and to stop the navigation of certain dangerous routes and focus on land transportation. The newly established "Ministry of Transport and Communications" is adapting to the new needs of decisive battle transport and promoting the new policy of "certain victory transport."

Second, efforts are made to achieve self-sufficiency in food. Implement rationalized comprehensive distribution in order to adapt to "certain victory production" and jointly achieve the complete victory of the Greater East Asia War. The Minister of Agriculture and Commerce will instruct that in the rice-killing year of Showa 19 (1944), special attention will be paid to the food problem, and "all measures such as consumption regulations and the strengthening of comprehensive distribution will be taken to conserve as much as possible." In the future, we will first strive to increase production, one method is plane increase production, that is, to expand arable land, and the second is three-dimensional increase production, that is, to promote collective management. In addition, efforts are made to regulate and conserve consumption, encourage substitute foods, comprehensive distribution, and promote local foods, etc., in order to achieve self-sufficiency in food.

Third, the spinning and weaving of currency inflation is an absolute condition for maintaining the order of the decisive battle economy, in order to stabilize the people's hearts and ensure the balance between things and money, the regulation of production, distribution, and consumption, and the absorption of purchasing power. The Japanese government has long implemented direct countermeasures such as increasing taxes and encouraging savings, and has also striven to improve financial institutions. This year, it has further established a national capital plan, revised savings laws, and implemented compulsory savings. In the future, the policy of preventing currency inflation will first be the regulation of consumption, that is, ensuring the minimum living standards of the people, in order to maintain the purchasing power of the people and increase savings efficiency.

In addition, in order to strengthen the posture of certain victory production, we must establish a scientific and technological mobilization system. First, the cabinet passed the "Essentials for the Emergency Consolidation of Scientific Research" on August 20th, and the "Comprehensive Plan for Establishing Scientific and Technological Mobilization" on October 1st. "Scientific Research Mobilization Committees" were established in universities and other important research institutions to establish a Japanese scientific and technological research mobilization system. On October 14th, the "Official System of the Research Mobilization Conference" and the "Temporary Wartime Researcher Installation System" were promulgated to expand the funding, research funds, research materials, and specialized talents of the Academic Research Conference. At the same time, the "Research Mobilization Department" was established in the Technology Institute, and the Science Bureau of the Ministry of Education also specially established the "Research Mobilization Section" to comprehensively promote research mobilization and planned science, cooperate with production and construction enterprises, and complete the "certain victory production" posture.

Japan's domestic production enhancement posture is developing in accordance with the needs of the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, and is the most powerful guarantee for the final victory and the successful construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, looking back at our country's production and construction undertakings, what new developments have there been? This is something that the government and the business community must deeply reflect on.

In the afternoon, the meeting continued, with directors from various regions reporting on the business situation, the Secretary-General reporting on instructions, and further discussion of proposals. Chairman Chen delivered the opening remarks.

### Chairman Chen Delivers Opening Remarks

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – At the meeting of directors from various regions of the Cooperative Enterprise Committee of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chen Junci delivered the opening remarks as follows: "The foundation of our country's cooperative enterprise was laid after several years of struggle after the incident, and we have what we have today. At this time of promoting wartime economic policies, it is of particular significance to strengthen cooperatives to launch a cooperative movement, and there is really no better way to revitalize the countryside and stabilize life than through cooperative enterprises. The mission of cooperatives can be summarized in the following five points: To promote the spirit of autonomy, to promote wartime economic policies, to promote the exchange of materials and improve the material distribution system, to regulate rural finance, and to assist in public security and revitalize rural welfare facilities. The focus of cooperative work in the future must first be the spirit of great impartiality, second, personnel must be reorganized, third, there must be a sound organization, and fourth, business must be enriched. It is hoped that everyone will do their best to discuss honestly, so that our country's cooperative business can make an epoch-making advance and do its best to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War."

### Main Points of President Wang's Instructions

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The meeting of directors of local branches of the Chinese Cooperative Society opened this morning. President Wang sent Minister Lin as a representative of the Executive Yuan to give instructions, the main points of which are as follows: Local cooperatives have been established one after another with the assistance and guidance of allied countries, and have been further promoted by people from allied countries and our own country who are enthusiastic about the cooperative business, so that they can form a scale. In July of this year, the allied countries returned this business to our country, so that rural revitalization and public work can be started. I would like to express my respect and gratitude here. Whether from the perspective of enriching [ ] power and completing the war, or from the perspective of improving people's livelihood and revitalizing construction, increasing production is a matter of urgency. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, I have witnessed the people of allied countries saving food and clothing, working hard to increase production, concentrating their efforts to complete the war, and contributing to the country and to the defense of East Asia. Since the National Government participated in the righteous cause, we have the responsibility of participating in the war, and we must also bear the responsibilities that we should fulfill, save food and clothing, work hard to increase production, concentrate our efforts, complete the war, and contribute to the country and to the defense of East Asia. In terms of improving people's livelihood, the people's livelihood is unstable due to high prices, and high prices are due to a lack of materials. Therefore, stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood depends on the promotion of production increase work. The government plans to increase production, the people [ ] to increase production, and all of you are doing your best to cooperate in seeking its development. However, to increase production, we must first protect production, cultivate productivity, and enable producers to do their best. After production, they can also engage in reproduction, protect producers, strengthen productivity, and increase production. The purpose is definitely not to pursue personal profits, but to seek the improvement of people's livelihood and the enrichment of national power, and to enrich the war. This has its great significance, and the cooperative movement has its special effectiveness in this regard. We should also ensure that products have reasonable consumption and reasonable distribution. This is the purpose of establishing cooperatives and the greatest mission of cooperatives. The government is currently planning to promote the production increase movement, and the allied countries will also provide great assistance. It is hoped that you will build on the existing foundation and seek enrichment to assist in the development of production increase work, so that the two major goals of changing people's livelihood and contributing strength to the completion of the war can be implemented simultaneously. We should examine the current situation. In cities, we must eliminate the toxins of Anglo-American thought and the toxins of compradorism. In rural areas, we must eliminate the dross of feudal thought and the pernicious influence of communism. The toxins of thought in cities are not listed here. In terms of rural feudal thought, the ancients said, "Those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others." Today, feudal thought has become a thing of the past. The state and society's evaluation of "labor" is no longer the same as before. We must make every citizen a laborer of the state and the nation, and this is worthy of being called a new citizen. This meaning is even easier to understand under the wartime system. We should deeply understand the impropriety of our unearned gains. Only by laboring can we enjoy its use. Therefore, the new citizen movement not only focuses on the spirit of training in the practice of labor service. It is hoped that you will work hard to promote the spirit of the era of labor and cleanse it. Urban youth, especially rural youth, the dross of past feudal thought, in terms of the pernicious influence of communism, has always used [ ] people to set fires as its means. Since the 16th year of the Republic of China, rural areas have been ruined and society has been uneasy. Until recently, although it has sometimes changed its style, its deceit of farmers, exploitation of farmers, and violent acts of sacrificing farmers have not diminished slightly. The fundamental policy of the cooperative movement is to seek the revitalization of rural areas, the stability of farmers' lives, and upward mobility. I am convinced that you have long been deeply disgusted with the destruction of the people's strength by the communists and are determined to bear the great mission of fundamentally destroying the toxins of communism. To implement the above items, we must first awaken ordinary farmers, especially rural youth, subject them to strict organization, subject them to strict training, enable them to work hard to increase production, enable them to increase production and advance technology, and enable them to engage in a decisive battle with feudal ideas and communist thugs. It is hoped that you will cooperate in the cooperative movement and the youth organization and training work in rural areas. The proposals you have made at this conference have concrete and perfect plans for increasing production, improving rural society, promoting the new citizen movement, and the youth organization and training work in rural areas. I am very impressed. This conference will be able to achieve satisfactory results, which can be predicted. It is hoped that after the conference, we will work together with one heart and one mind to implement it.

### Focus of Eastern Front Warfare Shifts to the Nevell Area; Fierce Battles Continue in Central and Southern Sectors

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: The focus of operations on the Eastern Front in the past 24 hours has shifted to the Navell area. The intensity of the war in this area has greatly increased. Soviet troops have launched attacks from the west and north of the city, and fierce battles are currently underway. German troops are putting up strong resistance. The fighting near Leningrad has gradually intensified. Although Soviet troops broke through German positions in several places on Thursday, they were quickly recaptured by German counterattacks. The fighting in the Lauhisch region on the Arctic Front has also resumed. It is reported that fierce battles have been ongoing for several days in the area between Lipez and Krechev. On Thursday, Soviet troops west of Krechev attacked under the cover of smoke, but were repelled. Soviet troops near Schlopeen once penetrated deeply, but German troops drove them back during a counterattack and restored the original front lines. Soviet troops between Prilebo and Bessa have also launched repeated attacks, but were blocked by German troops. Fierce battles are currently taking place four kilometers north of Kirovograd.

### Roosevelt Schedules Broadcast Address

The President denied meeting with General Franco, but said he had met with a delegation from Dakar, including the governor and naval experts.

### Beijing-Tianjin Youth Launch Anti-Dancing, Anti-Drug, and Anti-Gambling Campaign

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - With the Great East Asia War approaching its decisive stage and the foundation for inevitable victory already laid on the front lines, the question of how the people of our country should endure hardship, practice thrift, and increase production in order to contribute to the Great East Asia War is paramount. However, upon examining the domestic situation, there are still some who are deluded, indulging in sensual pleasures, and wasting away in dance halls, smoking rooms, or gambling dens. This not only contributes to the soaring prices and public unrest, but also affects the morale of the people during wartime. Surveying this dark phenomenon, the youth of the capital city, motivated by a sense of justice, and in order to practice wartime living and embody the spirit of the Youth General Mobilization Movement, voluntarily gathered over a thousand youth from various schools at the Youth Hall on the 17th. They resolved to strictly implement the bans on smoking, dancing, and gambling, and issued declarations, protest petitions, slogans, and other materials. They immediately went to various dance halls and opium dens to persuade and educate, hoping that those who were addicted to sensual pleasures, song, dance, and harmful dens would suddenly awaken.

### The Collapse of the Enemy's General Counteroffensive: A Dialogue Between Colonel Kurihara, Head of the Naval Press Section of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, and Colonel Matsumura, Head of the Army Press Section

Colonel Matsumura:

Yes. For example, the slap in the face from Bougainville, and the announcement of the losses in Hawaii a year later, are completely different from our approach. Another difference between Japan and the United States is that the enemy often uses numbers for propaganda. For example, 125,000 aircraft, iron production this and that, desperately using numbers to demonstrate their strength. However, according to information received from the other side, their figures often contain discrepancies, so there are many points that cannot be believed. In short, the American method is to conceal unfavorable things from the people.

As for their post-war plans, they are secretly based on the premise of victory. As for the actual situation of the war, Japan never publicizes its own military operations, but when they take action, they always boast and shout about counteroffensives one or two days beforehand. For example, in the Gilbert Islands and other battles, Nimitz indicated that he was paying attention to the Central Pacific before launching military operations. Seeing this situation where propaganda precedes the war, one cannot help but feel that they are fighting for the sake of propaganda. American propaganda has reached this extent!

This war is a war between familialism and individualism. The longer the war drags on, the more tragic the situation becomes, and doesn't the familialistic country demonstrate its strength? The people of Japan must be clearly aware of this strength of Japan – the strength of the people and the strength of the family system.

Colonel Kurihara:

I think that today, with enterprise consolidation progressing steadily, aircraft are certainly important, but the production of other things is also not being relaxed. Everyone is working hard in their respective positions, and that is the way to victory.

Colonel Matsumura:

It would be terrible if a hundred million people were not deployed for battle early on! Therefore, problems that arise during enterprise consolidation and other processes should be resolved as quickly as possible. If a hundred million people are deployed for battle in their respective positions, not focusing on theory, but on practical matters, and working diligently and conscientiously, then we can unleash our full strength and produce results.

### The Gathering of Total Strength

Colonel Kurihara: How about it? Let's draw a conclusion.

Colonel Matsumura:

This war is a war unlike any other in the history of warfare. Previous wars either took place in Europe, or in China, Manchuria, or North America, all with localized regions as battlefields. But this war spans the vast Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, with the entire world as the battlefield. And on this huge battlefield, the strong countries are divided into two camps, the Axis and the Allies. This is indeed the greatest war in human history. Furthermore, the way the war is being conducted is different from the past. In the past, wars mainly relied on the military and the money to support the war. But this war has gone a step further than the so-called military-industrial mobilization war during the First World War. It can be said to be a war of total reorganization. In order to enable peacetime enterprises to produce aircraft, warships, and artillery, enterprises are consolidated and the entire industry is transformed into a military industry. The national organization itself is also adapted to the war. Total strength is unleashed on this reorganized organization, and the war is carried out, evolving to a stage where there is no clear distinction between the front lines and the rear.

From the perspective of military strength, Napoleon used only 445,000 men when he invaded Moscow. Compared with the situation today, where ten million men are mobilized, the difference is huge. From the perspective of the consumption of military equipment, ammunition, aircraft, submarines, and other weapons, the amount of consumption is also very large.

Recently, the darling of modern war weapons, the aircraft, has become the protagonist of the war. In the seas and islands where Japan is waging war, aircraft are demonstrating their power. As for the German-Soviet front, tanks are also crisscrossing and demonstrating their prowess in such large-scale land battles. Therefore, aircraft and tanks have become the greatest darlings of weapons today. Due to this relationship, the consumption and production of scientific weapons have both increased greatly, so factories have also become a major issue.

After the end of the First World War, aircraft developed, and therefore there were many theories about short-term wars in the future. Kaiser Wilhelm also predicted that the wars after the First World War could be ended within 48 hours due to the development of aircraft. However, contrary to this prediction, the Second World War has a tendency to be prolonged due to the development of aircraft. Without aircraft after the resounding victory at Pearl Harbor, perhaps that battle could have determined the outcome of this war. However, because hundreds of aircraft can be produced every day, no matter how many aircraft are shot down, the war still cannot be resolved quickly today.

In small areas such as Poland and France, blitzkriegs were implemented early on and were all successful. However, when the war zone is wider, due to the power range and supply relations of the air bases, the larger the combat area, the more difficult it is to resolve the war simply. Thus, the war itself has a tendency to become a long-term war. Recently, the phrase "supply war" is often mentioned. This is probably because the battlefield is too far from the home country or base, so more ships, more soldiers, and more aircraft are needed. Because the distance is far, the existing military force tends to weaken when viewed as a whole. On this point, the war also has a tendency to be difficult to end early. Furthermore, because the consumption of materials is very large, so thinking from the opposite side, the loss of territory is not a problem, but the large consumption of materials is the key to the war. The so-called war of attrition is to inflict a great blow on the enemy and make them suffer the horrors of war, so it is not necessary to capture vast lands to achieve the war's purpose. This is the tendency today. In any case, the people must unite and strive to engage in total war. Moreover, changing the organization within can increase strength. If everything is concentrated for the purpose of war, it can become a very advanced thing. Continuing to engage in a war where it is difficult to determine victory or defeat is unavoidable.

I think that in modern warfare, the most important thing is to raise total strength. In its strength, it includes spiritual strength and material strength. This spiritual strength can not only be infinitely developed, but also the person who pilots the aircraft is a person, and the person who manufactures the aircraft is also a person. I think it is most important to maximize this spiritual strength. From this, material strength can also be improved. The foundation for increasing aircraft production is mankind. Relying on the efforts of mankind, as you just said, it is possible to gradually open up a narrow path. In short, it is necessary to improve combat power by waiting for spiritual and material matters to improve. Ranke's theory of great powers says: "A country's prestige abroad is not obtained casually, but is gradually built up by strength, so it is necessary to concentrate various forces." I think the so-called victor is the one who concentrates and unleashes the country's various forces to the highest degree. The longer the war drags on, the more strength increases, and the one who holds the winning ticket can be controlled, so the cultivation of this strength is the most important thing.

Colonel Kurihara:

From the perspective of naval warfare, the world's three major naval powers, Japan, the United States, and Britain, are now divided into two camps, using the world's seven oceans as a large stage, and putting on a full-scale martial arts performance. Therefore, it is a magnificent war unseen in the history of warfare to date. As I said at the beginning, the new phenomenon that has occurred in this naval warfare is that in naval warfare before today, the core of the battleship fleet was other ships, which were called auxiliary troops. For example, the Battle of Jutland in the previous war, the Battle of the Auckland Islands, or other naval battles, all used battleships as the center of the war. But in this war, aircraft exerted their extraordinary power, showing a great power that we could not have imagined. Even the majestic and huge battleships, which have been called the kings of the sea, cannot withstand the torpedoes and bombs of aircraft and sink. This has been confirmed in many subsequent naval and air battles since the naval battles off Hawaii and Malaya. Moreover, the construction of battleships and the like takes a long time, but aircraft can be produced in tens or hundreds of units every day. Therefore, even if many enemy battleships are sunk, the war still cannot be ended.

As you just said, if it were in the past, the United States Pacific Fleet would have been half paralyzed by the attack on Hawaii, and the war could have been declared over. But in this war, aircraft have become the main players on the war stage, and are even more important than battleships, and can be produced in large quantities. As a result, merely sinking battleships still cannot grasp the decisive power of the war. Although the United States has lost many battleships, it still intends to launch a major counteroffensive centered on aircraft, which shows this clearly.

As a result, when air supremacy is seized by relying on the power of aircraft, naval supremacy is also 80-90% in hand. Moreover, the ocean is different from land, there are no air-raid shelters to hide in, and there is nothing to shield against aircraft attacks.

I think that aircraft are no different from long-range artillery, or they can be said to be long-range torpedoes, and the range of the aircraft is its range. When enemy ships enter its range, they can become the target of aircraft attacks. Therefore, today's naval battles are different from the past, and there are often opportunities to launch fierce battles. In other words, they are rich in mobility.

During the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese fleet was in Sasebo and the Russian fleet was in Lushun. The two sides approached for certain strategic purposes. But when did the naval battle occur? It was when the two sides entered the range of the artillery, that is, when they sailed within an extremely close distance of 10,000 meters or 20,000 meters.

Now, as long as enemy ships invade the long "range" of the aircraft, or if it is known that the enemy has a base somewhere, an attack can be launched day and night whenever there is an opportunity. Therefore, in today's war, not to mention land battles, the opportunities for naval battles to occur are also very numerous in the vast ocean. As a result, the so-called large consumption arises, and thus it becomes a war of attrition. The character of needing to fight with the total strength of the entire country is even stronger. Therefore, I hope that the people recognize this point and devote all their efforts to producing aircraft and strengthening combat power.

### 1944: Predictions for the Future

Nations have prophecies, dating back far before the Qin and Han dynasties. The Zhou dynasty was predicted to last for thirty generations and eight hundred years, and throughout the Zhou dynasty, the prophecies proved accurate. Confucius compiled the Book of Documents, and Qin built palaces, knowing that Qin would come after Zhou. In general, the rise and fall of the future are within cycles. National fortune is so, and personal destiny is also so. Although there is no fixed destiny in life's ups and downs, only philosophers can exhaust the principles of how long or short it will last. Today's great scholar, Mr. Zhen Zuobi, has profound philosophy and is trusted both domestically and abroad. He regularly uses his techniques to resolve doubts for people, and his predictions are accurate. Mr. Zhen's program includes a "Yearly Prediction" service, which can predict the future destiny of individuals from all walks of life in 1944 ("Jia Shen"). If you want to know your financial luck and future development next year, please visit Mr. Zhen Zuobi's office at 486 Nanjing Road, Women's Bank Building, telephone 96657.

### Coal Briquette Panic Intensifies Daily; Rationing by Headcount Hopes for Early Implementation

The supply of coal briquettes in this city is becoming increasingly serious. Not only are retail stores lacking goods, but also factories are successively ceasing production, reportedly due to the depletion of raw materials. Although some factories are still operating and shipping goods, it is ultimately insufficient to meet market demand, leading to an increasingly rampant black market trade. There is a unanimous hope that the authorities will take immediate measures to thoroughly improve the coal briquette supply situation and implement a rationing system by headcount as soon as possible to meet urgent needs. Regarding coal for boiled water shops, the Greater China Allied Coal Company in this city has been approved by the authorities to ration 200 tons of Shandong Grade 2 lump coal and 99 tons of Shandong Grade 2 coal powder, totaling 299 tons, to 567 boiled water shops, with each household receiving about half a ton. The distribution is assigned to five companies: Yi Tai Xing, Da Chang, Yi Hao, Jian Hua, and Jun Chang.

Registration of Fuel for Various Industries

The First District Public Office issued a notice yesterday for the registration of large quantities of bituminous and anthracite coal needed by various industrial and commercial enterprises. All industrial and commercial users who need large quantities of anthracite or bituminous coal, excluding coal briquettes, should obtain a special registration application form from Office No. 624, Economic Affairs Department of this office at 109 Jiangxi Road before December 23rd of this year and submit it for registration. This notice does not apply to Japanese residents and users who receive fuel coal distributed by the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy. The authorities' distribution of special fuels for industrial and commercial enterprises this time is aimed at preventing hoarding, cracking down on black market transactions, and ensuring that various industries obtain sufficient fuel on schedule. Therefore, when filling out the application form, all industries must strive to be accurate in order to be reviewed.

### The 9th of Each Month Next Year Designated as Air Defense Day; Training to Be Implemented Under the Leadership of the Authorities

According to information obtained yesterday by a reporter from the Times from the Air Defense Warning Section of the First Police Bureau, in order to improve the air defense efficiency of this city, it has been decided that starting next year, the 9th of each month will be designated as "Air Defense Day". The Civil Air Defense Headquarters will universally implement air defense training, including air defense drills, training lectures, and various practical experiments with items and equipment. During the "Air Defense Day" exercises, air defense warning personnel will participate each time. As for the implementation of various programs, such as models of enemy aircraft and the actions that should be taken during air raid shelters, a list will be made available for the public to consult. On the other hand, the authorities will test the public's air defense potential at any time, and teach them how to use new air defense equipment and methods, and conduct individual or collective experiments on the 9th of each month.

### Deputy Director Su Inspects the Old Zhabei Branch Bureau

Su Chengde, the Deputy Director of the First Police Bureau of Shanghai Special City, personally visited various branch bureaus yesterday starting the day before, starting at 11:00AM, in order to understand police affairs within the district and facilitate smooth progress. Accompanied by Yao Zengmo, the Director of the Bureau's Supervisory Department, he inspected the Old Zhabei Branch Bureau. After inspecting the Chinese and foreign police officers, the Chief of the Branch Bureau, Hong Hanshi, reported on the police situation. He immediately summoned the heads of the General Affairs, Special High, Judicial, Administrative, Traffic, Police Defense, and Baojia sections, and inquired about the affairs of each section. He then proceeded to inspect the various sections and the police dormitories of the detention center, and other locations in the bureau. He was particularly satisfied with the Special High section's ability to list all industries and special occupations in the entire district without any omissions, and the orderly investigative results. He then summoned all the police officers for instructions.

### Regulations on the Movement of Electrical Products and Raw Materials

Regarding whether it is necessary to apply to the authorities of the Commercial Coordination Committee for a permit to move electrical products and their main raw materials, such as steel and hardware, within the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two special cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, the Commercial Coordination Committee has announced that in accordance with the regulations, in addition to applying to this committee for permission to move electrical products and their raw materials, such as steel, copper, and hardware, out of the Shanghai area, there is no need to obtain permission or explanation from this committee for any movement within the territory of the three provinces and two cities or within the Shanghai area.

### The Jianbu Dispatches Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate the Huatai Shipwreck Case

### City Propaganda Department Convenes Fifth Regular Press Conference to Discuss Municipal and Livelihood Issues

Central News Agency Report: The City Propaganda Department convened its fifth regular press conference at 3:00 PM yesterday in the City Hall Auditorium. Over thirty representatives from various newspapers, news agencies, and government organizations attended. The questions raised by the newspaper reporters and the responses from the representatives of various agencies are recorded as follows:

Switching Road Sign Dates

(Ping Bao asks) The replacement of new street nameplates in districts 1 and 8 of this city was originally scheduled to begin at the beginning of this month, but it has been delayed. Has the authorities determined a definite date for the replacement of these new street nameplates? And are there any plans to promote the adoption of the new street names? (Public Works Bureau answers) Regarding the replacement of the new street nameplates, it was originally planned to begin at the beginning of this month. However, due to the metal salvage campaign, the type of material to be used for the street nameplates and the timing of the replacement are still under consideration.

Financial Status of the Two Districts

(New China Daily asks) Since the recovery of the concessions and the unification of municipal administration, has there been any significant progress in the financial and taxation affairs of districts 1 and 8? Has the financial situation improved? (Finance Bureau answers) Since the recovery of the concessions, the municipal administration of this city has been unified. Regarding the question of whether there has been progress in financial and taxation matters, in the eighth district, because the Director of Finance is concurrently the Director of this Bureau, the supervision and command are more flexible, and tax revenue has made significant progress, now increasing to about 18 million. As for the first district, no report has been submitted to the Bureau, so detailed information cannot be provided.

Merger Date of the Two Districts

(New China Daily asks) Regarding the beginning of the recovery of the concessions in this city, Mayor Chen once stated that the merger of districts 1 and 8 could be implemented in early February of the 32nd year [1943], and later stated that it might be advanced to New Year's Day of the 33rd year [1944]. To what extent has this plan progressed as of recently? (Secretariat answers) Regarding the merger of the first and eighth district public offices in this city, it can be implemented around early February of next year [1944]. All merger details are being actively studied.

Improving Rice Rationing

(New China Daily asks) The police authorities in this city have repeatedly stated that they strictly prohibit the sale of rice and grain on the black market, but the household rice ration is insufficient for consumption. Does the authorities have any good way to increase the rationed grain so that citizens do not have to buy black market rice, and the black market will disappear by itself? (Central News Agency asks) Since the abolition of the Rice and Grain Joint Operations and the establishment of the Rice and Grain Control Association, the general public has had high expectations. It is rumored that the household rice ration will be increased soon. However, it has been three months, and not only has the household rice ration not been increased, but it has also been reduced from two sheng [升, about 2 liters] to one sheng [升, about 1 liter], and there have been three postponements. These three rice tickets have been announced by the authorities to be exchanged for cooking oil. How will these remaining three rations of rice be handled? Moreover, a ration of one sheng [升, about 1 liter] of rice and one jin [斤, about 0.5 kg] of flour per person every ten days is definitely not enough, so people have to resort to the black market, but black market rice is prohibited by the authorities. Now that the new Director of the Food Bureau has taken office, will he work with the Rice Control Association to thoroughly solve the problem of people's food? The two questions are deferred because the representative of the Food Bureau is not present.

Citizen Fuel Panic

(Shen Bao, China Daily, New China Daily ask) The fuel problem for citizens is becoming increasingly serious. Coal briquettes are sold at the official price, but coal merchants refuse to sell, claiming they have no stock. The black market price has reached 300 yuan per dan [擔, about 50 kg], and they are only willing to sell by the ton. Citizens of the middle and lower classes who rely on wages for a living will be left without fuel. Does the authorities have a way to alleviate their panic regarding this serious livelihood issue? (Economic Bureau answers) Recently, due to the shortage of coal sources, a panic has occurred in the supply and demand of coal briquettes in this city. This Bureau has consulted with the Economic Bureau of the first district, and rationing can be implemented starting in January. It is currently being actively planned.

Restrictions on Water and Electricity in the Eighth District

(News Daily asks) The Hua Zhong and China Electric Power Companies have announced measures to restrict electricity use, determining the percentage of reduction based on the importance of each industry. The minimum supply of 25 kilowatt-hours per month is still maintained in both Nanjing and Shanghai, which reassures the general public. However, the electricity in the eighth district is supplied by the French Water and Electricity Company, and the details of its restriction measures have not been announced. It is hoped that the company will provide a detailed response to dispel concerns. (Public Utilities Bureau answers) Electricity use in the eighth district was previously restricted. Now, to save even more, the amount of electricity used in the future must not exceed 65% of the highest amount of electricity used in July, August, and September. The penalty measures have been announced previously.

(News Daily asks) Regarding the supply of water, it has also been reported that the eighth district will be restricted and there will be penalties, but no detailed measures have been announced, causing concern among citizens. Moreover, the method of metering water is different from that of electricity. Larger and four-style houses have meters installed for each household, but in general old-style neighborhoods, water has been supplied by the landlord, and there is only one meter for each neighborhood. If there is an excess, the responsibility is unclear. If water is cut off as a penalty, it will affect the drinking water and hygiene of all residents in the neighborhood, which is not a minor matter. Cunning landlords can also take this opportunity to coerce tenants, and there will inevitably be many disputes in the future. The company should give more serious consideration to the penalty of water cut-off and plan a more appropriate and reasonable restriction method. (Public Utilities Bureau answers) Regarding the issue of the eighth district, we are still consulting with the supply agency.

### Division A Football Tournament: Donghua vs. Yi Jing, 10:00 AM Today at Yi Yuan

In the football league, there is an important and exciting Division A match today. At 10:00 AM, the regular winning team Donghua will face the strong team Yi Jing at Yi Yuan. Although Yi Jing lost to the Portuguese Merchants, they are still a strong team, so this match is sure to be highly attractive. The referee is He Chunhui. Donghua's lineup remains the same. Today, with the momentum of four wins in four games, it will not be difficult to capture Yi Jing in one fell swoop. The opponent's reliance on the goal-scoring ability of the yellow-haired Robert Stoff will meet Donghua's northern general Tan Fuzhen, so he will inevitably be unable to cross the line. Once the yellow hair loses its mobility, Donghua can rest easy. Another Division A match, Portuguese Merchants vs. Jews, will be held at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 PM. The other eight matches are all Division B and C matches. The schedule for today is recorded below:

Yi Jing - Donghua, Division A, 10:30 AM, Yi Yuan

Economic Commentary

### The Future of China's Silk Industry

In yesterday's article "Restricting Enterprise Capital Increase," it was mentioned that companies and factories should be cautious about excessive expansion of stocks during price increases and stock issuances. This is because short-sighted entrepreneurs often make a common mistake, which is to only care about current profits and not consider the future of the business, ultimately leading to neglecting the fundamentals and pursuing superficial gains. For example, consider China's silk industry. This is a heavy industry that is of great importance to the clothing needs of the Chinese people. If China wants to improve the silk industry and increase production, it must start from the root in various aspects. How easy is that? Can we simply rely on a few so-called silk industry figures who call themselves silk companies and are concerned about the ups and downs of silk stocks and bonds to extravagantly talk about the future of China's silk industry?

Take Allied Japan as an example. Since the cut-off of Japanese raw silk exports during the Greater East Asia War, it has instead established the foundation for a technological revolution in the Japanese silk industry. Currently, the contribution of the Japanese silk industry to enhancing combat power is: 1) contributing to military production, such as the latest invention of "silk-made leather"; 2) contributing to food production, such as using silkworm pupae to make various edible oils, seasonings, and soy sauce; 3) contributing to domestic resources, such as using silk and artificial fibers to make up for the lack of cotton and wool imports, and having raw silk wool substitute technology. These are all glimmers of hope for the future of the Japanese silk industry.

In the past, the quality of Chinese silk was poor. Foreign countries did not want to use it, and the Chinese themselves did not like to use it. As a result, the materials for Chinese people's clothing were almost entirely dependent on foreign洋布洋紗 [western cloth and yarn], and the magnificent silk fabrics used by wealthy families were also imported from foreign countries, which is heartbreaking to say. Now that this type of import has been cut off, it is a golden opportunity for China to develop its silk industry. It is urgent for the government and the people to jointly promote the technological revolution of the Chinese silk industry. Not only must we improve silkworm and silk spinning methods, but we must also make the Chinese silk industry contribute to other aspects, such as military needs and food. Then, the future of China's silk industry will seem limitless!

### Authorities to Conduct Comprehensive Investigation to Enforce Price Controls

Recently, due to the shortage of coal and electricity restrictions, prices have risen sharply again. According to investigations, a significant number of prices have increased several times over. The authorities are paying close attention to this. This reporter recently learned from relevant sources that the authorities will launch a large-scale enforcement of price controls. Currently, a large number of investigators are being assigned to conduct a comprehensive investigation of various companies and firms throughout the city within the shortest possible time. The main targets of the investigation are: 1) whether prices exceed the limit; 2) whether all displayed goods are priced; 3) whether the goods are placed in a prominent position in the store, and whether there is refusal to sell goods; 4) whether invoices are issued for the sale of goods; 5) whether substandard measuring instruments are used, etc. If necessary, account books may also be inspected. As for industries that genuinely need to adjust prices due to high costs, they must provide sufficient reasons and apply to the authorities. Price changes can only be made after the authorities have investigated and verified the facts. If there is any private price increase, it will be severely punished once discovered.

### Stock Exchange Supervisory Committee Secretly Investigates Stockbrokers

Since the establishment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Supervisory Committee, supervision has been strict in order to achieve a path of safe and sound investment. Recently, due to the large fluctuations in stock prices, the Stock Exchange was again instructed: "The rise and fall of stock market prices are directly and indirectly related to the normal buying and selling of investors and the stability of financial prices. Recently, the stock market prices in the exchange have fluctuated greatly, and there is bound to be unscrupulous merchants engaging in disguised speculation and manipulation to achieve their illegal profit-making purposes, which is worthy of attention. In addition to sending personnel to conduct secret investigations at any time, the exchange should immediately investigate and report the details for verification. If there are any illegal activities, it should also promptly report to this committee and forward it to the government for severe punishment, without indulgence. This order is crucial." It is also heard that the committee has now moved its office to the Central Trust Company Building at 10 Hankou Road, telephone number 18840.

### Silver and Money Industry to Shorten Business Hours

To adapt to the authorities' electricity saving measures, various industries in this city have appropriately reduced their office hours.

### Shandong Association Initiates Reconstruction of the Guild Hall

The Shandong Association on Simen Road was founded in the 29th year of Guangxu [1903] by Shang Lu Hai, Minister of the Foreign Affairs Department, Wu Zhongyi, Customs Minister, Yao Ting, Shanghai County XXX, and Shandong gentlemen. Lu initially served as the Shanghai 道 [Circuit Intendant], then as the head of Customs, and later as the German envoy. During the Boxer Rebellion, he corresponded with Li Hongzhang to secure a peaceful agreement and then revised the commercial treaties with Sheng Xuanhuai, carefully deliberating. Later, he served as the Minister of the Foreign Affairs Department, making great contributions. The Guild Hall was completed in the 32nd year [1906], containing the Dacheng Pavilion, the Zhidao Hall, the Guan Di Temple, and the Tian Hou Palace. The architecture is in palace style, with carved beams and painted pillars, which is extremely magnificent. There is a stage inside, which is convenient for entertainment and also facilitates theatrical performances. The plaques were mostly written by Cao Hongxun, Governor of Shaanxi, and Wang XX Peng, Director of Shandong Education (both were Shandong XXX No. 1 scholars). Wu Peifu also has a plaque. There are many calligraphy works by famous people in the corridors. The stone lions in front of the hall were moved from Shengze, Wujiang. Later, a villa was built in Nanshi and the Qilu Primary School.

The Guild Hall is large in scale and antique in style, and is one of the famous attractions in Shanghai. The Honorary Chairman of the Association, Su Chengde, XX Tiankai, and the Chairman of the Board, Cui Jingsan, etc., initiated the reconstruction of the Guild Hall and invited famous actors from the city to perform charity performances at the Tianchan Stage on the 22nd and 23rd. The Association also scheduled a grand New Year's Day gathering on the Gregorian calendar, with the school holding a progress exhibition and a games fair, welcoming all fellow villagers to participate. After the New Year, it will also cooperate with the Confucius Learning Association to hold regular lectures.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

The mindset of "a true man does not open," since being influenced by those gymnastics, has become even stronger. Climbing the iron bars every day, unknowingly, the horizontal bar, hanging upside down, were also easily mastered. Whatever other students could do, he could do as well. These were all rewards of hard work, the crystallization of ambition. Even in his young heart, he deeply felt the power of confidence and the joy of conquering external things.

(I am also a man who cannot yield to others.)

Thinking this way, his unyielding heart also grew stronger. Thus, Makoto suddenly became interested in iron bars and horizontal bars, and even after school, he would entice Mu Si and Takao to run to the playground.

"Makoto, can you do a wind wheel?"

Takao asked this way.

The wind wheel was also extremely rare among children. However, the physical education teacher would sometimes demonstrate it to the students.

"I can," Makoto blurted out unintentionally.

Having said it, he had to do it. He had previously practiced it secretly, failing half the time and succeeding half the time. He used all the possible reaction force and turned his body violently.

(Finally succeeded!)

Just as he was relieved, he felt vaguely dizzy. Because it was a dangerous move, he only turned once and jumped onto the sandy ground. He thought he had jumped properly, but the bone in his left shoulder clicked.

He didn't feel anything at the time, but on the way home, his left hand became unfree. Moreover, it started to hurt in the evening, and he couldn't sleep at all in the middle of the night.

"Why do such dangerous games?"

His mother, who never even raised an eyebrow at her children's minor illnesses from catching a cold, was now quite stern because this child was in danger of becoming disabled in the future. And she applied a wet towel to Makoto's shoulder all night.

The next morning, she took him to the doctor for a diagnosis, and it was said that the joint was dislocated. When the doctor pointed at it, it would hurt so much that he would jump up, but the doctor ruthlessly applied the medicine and wrapped it tightly with a medicated cloth. Makoto shifted his gaze to the white wall of the doctor's office, gritting his teeth and enduring it. This was not only his usual defiance. (Mom is by my side!) He couldn't bear to worry his mother because of his carelessness and had to show as little pain as possible.

From that day on, Makoto took a week off from school. Fortunately, he recovered well and was no longer in much pain, so he didn't have to tell his mother useless lies.

"I'll get better on my own later."

He deliberately shrugged his shoulders and went to school.

### A Hospital on Luoyang Road: A Visit to Shanghai Nanyang Hospital

Perfected Treatment Equipment

Although the renovated hospital building is not entirely satisfactory in terms of medical standards, it can already be considered first-class compared to the general major hospitals in Shanghai. Look, the general affairs office, the workshop, and even the treatment rooms of various departments, the chemical laboratories, are so rationally distributed in each series of wards. Almost every patient is surrounded by a group of doctors, nurses, and various treatment tools. Almost every patient's breath and pulse are carefully cared for. The first floor, the second floor, and even the third floor, each floor and even each group of wards constitute a treatment and care system, and close connections are maintained between the systems. Just from the allocation and deployment of rooms in the hospital building, it can be seen how scientific, planned, and organized this major hospital is. If I were a patient's relative visiting, seeing such meticulous arrangements, I could put my mind at ease and no longer worry about the patient.

In the three-story building, there are a total of eighty wards and two hundred beds (including fifty beds for accompanying patients). More than 40% of these are beds for the poor. Look at the rooms for the poor. Each room has four to five beds. The pediatric ward for poor children accommodates seven or eight people per room. All are iron beds with clean white bedding, simple, clean, and quiet, without the "cabin" feeling of general third-class wards. From this, one can see how much the hospital cares for poor patients, not out of hypocrisy or charity, but based on the service ethics of universal love and mutual assistance.

In order to adapt to the practical situation of the current society and the psychology of the general middle-class citizens, Nanyang Hospital has also specially designated a part of the rooms in the wards as "second-class" and "first-class" wards. In terms of form and internal arrangement, they are naturally more exquisite. Look, each second-class ward has only one bed, a small table, and some potted plants decorating the window. How quiet it is! Patients can quietly forget the bustling society and all their worries!

The layout of the first-class ward is even more exquisite. It has a bathroom, a radiator in winter, a fan in summer, and a specially equipped bed for the patient's companion. It looks like a special-class cabin on a luxurious cruise ship such as the President or Queen, with warmth and comfort in the quiet and cleanliness.

Let's take a look at the modern medical equipment! First of all, there is the physiotherapy department full of mechanization and technological气息, quietly displaying X-ray fluoroscopy and imaging equipment, X-ray treatment, ultra-short wave, diathermy treatment machine, ultraviolet and sun lamps, etc. Try to turn on the switch, and in the darkness, a surprisingly strong light shines. What a great scientific and mechanical power!
