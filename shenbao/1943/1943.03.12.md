### Planting Trees and Planting People

Every year on Arbor Day, all national agencies and organizations participate in tree-planting activities. From the perspective of the significance of planting trees, it is a proactive and constructive movement, definitely not a trivial pursuit for a few individuals or a gesture to adorn a festive occasion. Therefore, it should be elevated into a mass movement, expanding from tree planting to forest protection and afforestation. We should not only protect the woodlands surrounding the graves of our ancestors but also safeguard the forests and trees everywhere, and plant new forests on a large scale; this is of great significance in increasing national wealth and promoting agriculture and water conservancy. However, tree planting inevitably leads us to think about the more serious issue of planting people, and the issue of forest protection and afforestation leads us to think about protecting and cultivating talent.

Looking at Chinese history, the brilliance of each generation's academic culture is always due to the nation's and society's love and cultivation of talent. The development of Chinese academics reached its peak in the Song and Ming dynasties. Examining the likes of the Cheng brothers and Zhu Xi in the Song Dynasty, and Wang Yangming in the Ming Dynasty, their ability to create a national spirit of scholarship was due to the establishment of the Imperial College by the state. Locally, schools were widely established, providing stipends for teachers and students to cultivate talent. The academies of the Song and Ming dynasties were particularly the centers for cultivating scholarship. During the Song Dynasty, academies such as Bailu and Yuelu were founded by the government, while others were founded by enthusiastic members of society. During the Ming Dynasty, Mr. Wang Yangming personally founded many academies, which flourished as institutions of higher learning. Students entering the academies were not only provided with clothing, food, and stipends but also had their families provided with rice and salaries by the government. However, in contrast, what kind of treatment do contemporary intellectuals receive? Today, those who aspire to study academics not only have their own livelihood problems to solve but also have families of five or six, or even seven or eight, to support. Moreover, studying today is not like in the past when one only needed to focus on one classic or one skill, with three or five boxes of books, to bury oneself under the window and become famous in ten years. Today, one must understand the general trends of the world and pursue specialized knowledge in depth; the difference in difficulty is simply incomparable. Due to the high cost of schooling today and the lack of universal access to education, most young people suffer from the hardship of being unable to attend school. Those who rely on ancestral legacy and the assistance of relatives and friends, even if they do not become typical Anglo-American figures due to Anglo-American teaching methods, will inevitably be worn down by small and large exams, making them feel lost and helpless, only able to sigh at the vastness of academic research. Before the war, there were several research institutes that encouraged research and achieved considerable results. However, since the incident, even if they still exist, due to soaring prices, researchers cannot maintain their livelihoods. Although they have great ambitions for academic research, they cannot help but be forced by life to chase after worldly gains. Looking around, how many places today can be called places for cultivating talent? What are the results? If, on the one hand, trees are planted to provide shade, while on the other hand, there is a sense of a lack of talent, how can this be fortunate for the nation and the people?

Therefore, today, we once again loudly appeal, hoping that the government will pay attention to the great plan of planting people. First, it is to cherish existing talents and cultural relics, and not to easily waste talent. Even those with incorrect thinking or past words and deeds that are not entirely pure, as long as they are promising talents, should be allowed to devote their efforts to academic research and be protected, and not allowed to wither and be abandoned. Secondly, we further hope that the government will expand the movement to cultivate talent. Although the government's financial resources are limited today, it must focus on the education and culture sectors, because the ultimate determining factor in all policies is only the word "talent." Therefore, increasing funding for various education and culture institutions, raising salaries for education and culture personnel, and establishing preferential treatment measures for students at all levels are all urgent matters that cannot be delayed. In addition, influential figures in society should also think about the long-term plans for the nation and actively donate funds to assist education and culture undertakings, pooling their efforts to cultivate talent. We dare to assert that as long as the government loves and nurtures talent and advocates cultivating people first, influential figures in society will surely be able to shoulder heavy responsibilities later. There is no shortage of far-sighted people in both the government and the public. We hope they will not ignore this fundamental task of the great era as stale conventional wisdom.

Commentary

### The Fourth Term President and American Ambitions

According to foreign news reports, the executives of the Democratic National Committee in the United States have decided to recommend Roosevelt as a candidate in the next presidential election battle, on the condition that the war continues until 1944. Roosevelt has not expressed any opinion on this. Of course, he will remain silent until the last moment and wait for public opinion to judge. This is the tactic he used when he was elected for the third time in 1940. Especially this time, in order to alleviate the atmosphere of responsibility for the impeachment failure, this tactic is even more necessary.

Whether Roosevelt can be elected for a fourth term or whether power will be transferred to the opposition Republican Party will depend on the war situation this year, and it is impossible to predict today. However, Republican leaders have also voiced even more aggressive words than the Democrats, so there is no essential difference between the leadership of the two parties, which is noteworthy. At least under the current circumstances, no matter where the power ends up, the US guiding policy will not undergo fundamental changes. Even if there are changes, they would only suggest a strategic retreat.

Navy Secretary Knox had long ago argued that the United States' "two-ocean fleet" was not enough and that it must prepare a "seven-ocean fleet" capable of dominating the world's seven oceans. This ambition to dominate the world is not a ridiculous fantasy of their kind. Although he holds a position in the Democratic cabinet, he was originally a pure Republican. This Republican Party was in power during the heyday of ruthless dollar diplomacy. We should remember the process after Stimson's tough policy failed during the Manchurian Incident, temporarily retreating strategically from East Asian policy.

However, in the seemingly strong but inwardly weak appearance of the United States, we can also see the anxiety of the current leadership. If the war drags on like this, it will be impossible to maintain popular support until the 1944 election. The progression of this year's war and the difficulties of life next winter will become the watershed for whether the American public will erupt their dissatisfaction with their leaders in the election. This year is the year of decisive battle. We should clearly recognize the ambitions of the leaders of the two major American parties, be strictly vigilant, and never fall into wishful thinking.

Statement by Japanese Authorities

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The General Headquarters of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, the Headquarters of the China Area Fleet, and the Japanese Embassy in China jointly issued the following statement on March 11 regarding the control of materials in our country by the Japanese authorities: "After the National Government announced its declaration of war against Britain and the United States at the beginning of this year, China's wartime posture in terms of politics and economics has gradually been established due to the strengthening of the National Government. The restrictions on the movement of materials previously implemented by Japan were taken in response to this special situation. When China adapts to wartime needs and its strong commercial organization for collecting and distributing important materials is completed, Japan will abolish the current restrictions on the movement of materials. Fortunately, in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, influential figures in Shanghai's financial circles are preparing to establish the National Commercial Control Association to implement the collection, distribution, and control of important materials. This is indeed an appropriate measure. It is hoped that it can achieve its intended goals based on self-sufficient control, so as to stabilize people's livelihoods, revive the economy, and ensure the necessary materials for the progress of the war. We sincerely hope that the people of both China and Japan will understand this spirit and provide full assistance. It will take some time to prepare the various control commercial organizations under the National Commercial Control Association. After consultation with the National Government, the temporary regulations for the control of materials transfer in the Japanese-occupied areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River will be eased in accordance with the following guidelines as a temporary measure and will be implemented from March 16: (1) Restrictions on movement near Shanghai will be temporarily maintained until the collection and distribution agencies are prepared. However, the restricted materials will be limited to those that are necessary and unavoidable. On the outbound side, cement, salt, cooking oil, wool, woolen fabrics and their products, rayon, cloth and its products, paper, tobacco, etc., will be removed. On the inbound side, all restrictions will be lifted except for rice (excluding glutinous rice), wheat, wheat flour, beans, and cotton. (2) Restrictions on movement near Shanghai, which were previously implemented jointly by China and Japan, are planned to be abolished in the near future. At that time, the permitting affairs of the Japanese Army and Navy will be abolished, and the newly established National Commercial Control Association will implement them. However, permits already issued by the Japanese Army and Navy will continue to be valid within the specified period. (3) Restrictions on movement within the region will be abolished, except as specifically stipulated. However, the flow of materials to the Chongqing area will be strictly prohibited as before. (4) The Sino-Japanese authorities will separately implement control in accordance with these regulations. The Japanese army will generally not directly implement it, except when it is particularly necessary for military purposes, and in areas close to the Chongqing area and along the coast."

Minister Mei Shi's Statement

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Regarding the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, Minister Mei Shi of the Ministry of Industry made the following statement: "Since our country joined the war, economic issues have been of paramount importance. All the wartime economic policy outlines have been announced, and various specific plans are being designed and gradually implemented. The wartime government's responsibilities are, on the one hand, to ensure military supplies, and on the other hand, to strive to revive the economy, and in particular, to implement reasonable control measures as soon as possible to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. However, reasonable economic control must be consistent between officials and the people, and cooperation between superiors and subordinates, in order to achieve rapid results. The soundness and collectivization of commercial organizations must be promoted as soon as possible. This time, in order to implement the fundamental strategy of wartime economic control, the Ministry has specially formulated the Temporary Regulations for the Control of Wartime Materials Transfer, submitted them to the Supreme National Defense Conference for consideration, and requested the National Government to promulgate them, which will be implemented on March 16, in order to ease the previous control measures and gradually replenish the driving force for economic revival. At the same time, the Temporary Regulations for the National Commercial Control Association were formulated, submitted to the Supreme National Defense Conference for approval, and promulgated on the same day. We have also instructed leaders of industry and commerce in various places to organize the National Commercial Control Association to assist the government in handling materials control matters. The initiators of the association convened an inaugural meeting in Shanghai on March 11, and it will be formally established soon. The friendly armies, navies, and embassies have given full cooperation to the implementation of the materials control measures this time, greatly easing the past control measures, and making every effort to alleviate the suffering of the people, so that the activities of economic power can gradually enter the right track. We should not only be grateful for this goodwill, but also express our respect for this wise decision by the highest authorities of our friendly nation in China. As for the wartime materials transfer control measures, they are a temporary measure. In the future, when the lower-level organizations of the National Commercial Control Association can reach a stage of widespread strengthening, the association will be responsible for the autonomous control of all materials transfer. Therefore, we hope that the people in various places will understand the spirit of the government's policies, actively and automatically strengthen the organization of their own industries, and assist the government in realizing the goals set by the wartime economic policies as soon as possible. This is what we earnestly hope for."

### Memorial of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Death; Chairman Wang's Address

Dr. Sun Yat-sen's dying testament clearly stated that the purpose of the National Revolution was to seek China's freedom and equality, and that the method to achieve this purpose was to awaken the masses and unite with nations in the world that treat us equally to struggle together. The starting point of the struggle was to abolish unequal treaties. After Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, his comrades continued to uphold his legacy, unwavering. Today, our friendly nation Japan first fulfilled its promise to assist China in achieving independence, returning concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality. Friendly nations such as Italy followed. The Treaty of Nanjing was the beginning of unequal treaties, and its poison has spread for more than a century. It has finally been reduced. We are not only grateful that unequal treaties have been abolished, but also grateful that we have united with nations that treat us equally. Today, on the 18th memorial of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, we respectfully inform Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven and vow to sincerely follow his teachings, continue to work hard, lead the masses to advance in unison, and work together with our friendly nation to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, in order to complete China's liberation and realize the co-prosperity of East Asia. Today, we trace Dr. Sun Yat-sen's life and unfinished ambitions, and in addition to our sorrow, we are even more inspired. We can only rouse the spirit of courage, diligence, perseverance, and hard work to shoulder the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia. After we sincerely pray before Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit today, we will also pay our respects before the spirits of the martyrs of the National Revolution and the martyrs of our friendly nation Japan who assisted in the Chinese Revolution. May our spirit forever merge with the spirit of the martyrs and continuously advance towards the bright road indicated by our Dr. Sun Yat-sen, without interruption.

### Japanese Troops Capture Huarong and Other Places; Continuing to Expand Gains; Japanese Air Force Attacks Shashi, Inflicting Heavy Damage on Chongqing Troops; Chongqing Troops in the Dongting Lake Area Surrounded

Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - Since completely occupying Shishou and Ouchi Kou on the morning of the 10th, Japanese troops have seized control of the Wang Jia He waterway on the Yangtze River, leading to Changsha and Changde. Because the Chongqing troops' retreat route was cut off, they had no choice but to retreat eastward towards the Dongshan Mountains. However, another powerful Japanese unit attacked from the east, and with the cooperation of the air force, fiercely attacked the Chongqing troops "149th Division, 445th Regiment," "150th Division, 448th Regiment," and remnants of the "197th Division" and "118th Division" wandering in the Dongshan Mountains, continuing to expand their gains.

Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - In order to assist the ground units advancing from the Shashi area, the Japanese air force, starting on the morning of the 9th, fiercely bombed the Chongqing troops retreating westward. On the morning of the 10th, large formations bombed about 300 remnants of the Chongqing troops near Huang Jia Zui, four kilometers southwest of Mituosi, and flew to the airspace over Miji Tai, sixteen kilometers southwest of Mituosi, bombing about 500 soldiers of the Chongqing 161st Division in the river, inflicting heavy damage.

Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - Since Japanese troops successively captured the strategic points of Shishou, Ouchi Kou, Jiang Bo Du, Huarong, Songmu Qiao and Mo Shan Guan on the 10th, the triangular area between the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake has been completely surrounded by Japanese troops. About four regiments of Chongqing troops are surrounded in this area. Due to constant bombing by Japanese planes and fierce attacks by ground units, they are in extreme distress and in great confusion. Their annihilation is imminent.

Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - After a certain elite Japanese unit occupied the key point of Shishou on the morning of the 10th, another powerful unit was sent to break into Jiang Bo Du, a key waterway at the junction of the Yangtze River and Wang Jia He, about 60 kilometers northwest of Yuezhou and 15 kilometers south of Shishou, and completely occupied it at 8:40 on the 11th. Jiang Bo Du is located at the junction of the Yangtze River and Wang Jia He and is a key point for transportation between Hunan and Hubei. After the Japanese troops quickly occupied the area, they were able to use the waterway to cut off the retreat route of the Chongqing troops fleeing towards Changsha and Changde.

Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - In order to respond to the units that captured the strongholds of Shishou and Ouchi Kou on the 10th, a certain elite Japanese unit also crossed the Yangtze River and advanced southward on the same day, breaking into Huarong, an important stronghold of the Chongqing troops, at 8:30 AM, and completely occupied the area after clearing out the remaining enemies.

Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - Huarong, an important stronghold of the Chongqing troops, was completely occupied by Japanese troops on the morning of the 10th. The Japanese air force also closely cooperated with the ground units from the morning of the same day to fiercely bomb the Chongqing troops fleeing from Huarong, inflicting heavy damage.

Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - A certain Japanese unit attacking from the east continued to launch fierce attacks the night before. Its powerful advance unit first occupied Mo Shan Pu at dawn on the 10th, and then occupied Songmu Qiao at 9:30 AM, continuing to advance rapidly towards a certain direction. Mo Shan Pu and Songmu Qiao are located in the Dongshan Mountains, 40 kilometers northwest of Yuezhou, and the eastern end borders Dongting Lake, which is a key transportation hub. Because they were quickly captured by the Japanese troops this time, the Chongqing troops' retreat route was cut off, and they have fallen into great confusion.

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Allied Press) - Berlin officially announced last night that German troops are implementing a planned strategy to cut off Soviet troops in the Kharkov area. Highways and railways south, southwest, west, and northwest of the city were cut off on Tuesday. Only one road to the northeast of the city remains open. Taking advantage of the Red Army's diversion of troops to reinforce Kharkov, German troops launched a large-scale counter-offensive southwest and northwest of Kursk. Moscow officially acknowledged yesterday that the situation in the south is serious. Reuters' correspondent in Moscow telegraphed last night that the southern Red Army has lost the initiative and that new developments in the war situation have put the Red Army in a difficult position, which is undeniable. Although the Red Army is still launching offensives in the central sector south of Lake Ilmen, it has had to adopt a defensive posture on the 200-mile front from Kharkov to Rostov. The main German forces are now concentrated on a narrow front south of Kharkov, launching fierce counter-offensives. A major battle involving tanks and infantry is underway in this muddy plain. The overall situation in the south will depend on this battle. The German combat force has a total of 100,000 troops, half of whom are new recruits, and many armored vehicles. Although the Red Army intends to defend to the death, the German offensive has not weakened. As for the situation in the central sector, west of Moscow, German troops continue to shorten their defense lines according to plan. The German High Command announced yesterday that German troops have withdrawn from Bely, a city southwest of Rzhev and 75 miles northeast of Smolensk.

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - The German counter-offensive southwest of Kursk is progressing rapidly. After German infantry discovered that Soviet troops had been diverted to reinforce the Kharkov area, they abandoned their defensive posture and launched a fierce counter-offensive. Soviet troops were forced to retreat to the east. German troops captured important positions and heavily damaged the enemy.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 11th (Havas News Agency) - The most noteworthy aspect of yesterday's fighting on the Eastern Front was the steady German advance towards Kharkov, which is now in danger of being surrounded. At the same time, the various German counter-offensives in the Kursk area are also progressing smoothly. After the Red Army recently transferred troops from that area to reinforce Kharkov, its positions were weakened. German troops were able to exploit this vulnerability and break through one of its positions. Although the Red Army claims that the German offensive towards Kharkov has been contained, it admits that German troops are steadily advancing northwest and west of the city. Moscow war reports describe the German pressure in the Kharkov area as "very strong," saying that German troops are fighting with large numbers of tanks and motorized units. Fierce fighting is also taking place west of Siversk. German troops are attempting to cross the Donets River near Kharkov, regardless of the strong Red Army resistance. As for the Orel area, according to German reports, the Red Army has repeatedly launched fierce attacks near the city. Moscow claims that these attacks are being conducted on a broad front. Fighting south of Kharkov has been hampered by the thawing ground, with only localized engagements. In the central sector, Berlin sources say that German troops are continuing their usual strategy of adopting evasive tactics against the enemy. Moscow war reports say that the Red Army has made slight progress east of Vyazma, occupying the Tinov Station on the railway from Vyazma to Kaluga. The Red Army has also made progress west and northwest of Zhizdra. Domanovo, between Zhizdra and Vyazma, is also in Red Army hands. The Red Army acknowledges that the war situation in that area is still fraught with difficulties, as the German side has sent large numbers of tanks and air force reinforcements, while the Red Army is short of both planes and tanks. In addition, the Germans implemented a scorched-earth policy when they withdrew from Vyazma, leaving nothing for the enemy to use, which has also hindered the Red Army's advance. On the northern front, especially south of Lake Ilmen and in the Staraya Russa area, the German side claims that the Red Army has launched scattered attacks. Moscow claims that the Red Army has occupied Novoramoshivo and Staroramoshivo west of Ilmen. Observers generally believe that General Timoshenko's Red Army is repeatedly probing, with its main goal being to break a gap in the German lines near Leningrad and in the central sector. Moscow admits that Timoshenko has encountered very strong resistance.

### Berlin Announces Recent Submarine Successes: 36 Enemy Ships Sunk

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - According to a report released by the Führer's Headquarters, German submarines attacking a convoy from the United States to England recently sank 13 enemy ships, totaling 73,000 tons, all carrying munitions. Another three were destroyed by torpedoes. In total, German submarines have sunk 36 enemy ships in the last 24 hours, totaling approximately 207,000 tons.

Führer's Headquarters, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command announced yesterday that German submarines have sunk another 23 enemy ships in the past few days, totaling 237,000 tons. In addition to the eight enemy ships sunk that were announced on Monday, German submarines have sunk another 15 enemy ships in the Atlantic, totaling 82,000 tons, bringing the total to 23. In addition, another six enemy ships were damaged by torpedoes. As a result, enemy ships sunk in March have reached 231,000 tons. Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command announced that German submarines recently sank 134,000 tons of enemy ships. In addition to the eight convoys that were attacked, the cargo ship "California Star" (8,300 tons) was also sunk. The ship was carrying approximately 9,000,000 pounds of fresh meat and 15,000,000 pounds of butter. German submarines attacked a convoy near the Cape of Good Hope, sinking two-thirds of the ships in the convoy.

Lisbon, 10th (Havas News Agency) - Thirty sailors belonging to merchant ships sunk by Axis submarines in the South Atlantic have landed in Georgetown, British Guiana.

Ship Losses Kept Secret by Britain

Bern, Switzerland, 10th (Havas News Agency) - At a recent meeting of the British House of Commons, Labor MP Mr. Dinnage inquired about the situation of ship losses, saying, "The government does not publish the figures for merchant ship losses, and only says that we have lost 435 warships of various sizes since the start of the war, which is useless. During the last World War, Britain lost a total of 14,000 sailors. Are the loss figures for this war even higher than last time? I don't know if the government is prepared to publish them. I think the current state of British merchant ships must be actively improved, because I think opening a second front is important, but improving shipping is even more beneficial to the Soviet Union, that can be asserted." In response, Hall, a representative of the Naval Department, denied that the Naval Department opposed the construction of high-speed ships, and strongly stated that the British government should continue to keep ship losses secret and not announce them.

### Naval Battle Occurs off the Dutch Coast: One British Ship Sunk

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Haitong News Agency) The British Admiralty announced that one British warship was sunk in a battle with enemy ships off the Dutch coast. Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - The night before, British motor torpedo boats attempted to attack a German convoy near the Dutch coast, but lost five torpedo boats. Three of them were sunk by German warships, and another two caught fire. The sailors abandoned ship and fled. Fourteen rescued Britons were captured.

### Stalemate on the North African Front: Only Reconnaissance Activities

Lisbon, 11th (Allied Press) - A Reuters correspondent with the Allied Forces headquarters in North Africa said that the Tunisian climate is harsh and that land warfare is limited to reconnaissance activities. Berlin sources said the same.

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - Authoritative sources announced that the situation on the North African front was calm on Tuesday. A small number of units of the British Eighth Army approached the Mareth Line but did not dare to advance within range of the Axis artillery. Small units of British tanks were active in northern Tunisia but achieved nothing. Remnants of French troops and light American and British mechanized units were discovered in southwestern Tunisia but showed no signs of attacking.

Bern, Switzerland, 11th (Havas News Agency) - There were no major battles on the Tunisian front yesterday. According to the war reports of Germany and Italy, there is little to report other than the bombing of the port of Algiers, which hit one American merchant ship. In addition, the commander of the separatist French forces issued a war report stating that French troops made slight progress near Metlaoui (located between Tozeur and Gafsa).

### Dissatisfaction Expressed on All Sides with the Strategy Adopted by the British Naval Authorities

Bern, Switzerland, 10th (Havas News Agency) - According to reports from London, Admiral Keyes gave a speech in Cambridge today, strongly criticizing the strategy adopted by the Admiralty in this war. He said, "The establishment of various committees within the Admiralty has diminished the initiative and daring of the British Navy to nothing. In fact, our sailors only need the High Command to be able to disregard danger to achieve great merit, and they will do it well. But now the naval authorities are not adopting this wise policy, and are sitting idly by while the Soviet Union and Japan are engaged in naval warfare, which is a great shame for us. The naval authorities have made countless mistakes since the Norwegian campaign."

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - The London correspondent for the Swiss "Gongxun Bao" recently said that even if the British Home Fleet does not move, it can keep the German fleet stationed in its base and restrain its activities. The British Admiralty believes that since Admiral Dönitz became the commander of the German Navy, he will use combined submarine warships to attack convoys, so it should try to restrain the German warships in the base. The United States believes that the US Navy has suffered heavy losses in the Pacific, so it urgently hopes that Britain can send more fleets to the Pacific. Therefore, it is deeply dissatisfied with the British Home Fleet's inaction. In Britain, however, it is naturally best to preserve its strength, so the so-called restraining German naval activities is nothing more than an excuse.

### The Importance of Today's Ships, by Kanda Tomowo, Vice President of Osaka Shosen

In peacetime, shipping certainly plays an extremely important role in the progress of national strength in terms of economy, industry, culture, and other aspects. This goes without saying; but in wartime, ships are not only absolutely necessary, but also necessarily needed in large quantities, as everyone knows.

Especially during this Greater East Asia War, our country is actually conducting operations in a vast area, and as the occupied areas continue to expand, it will inevitably require an increase in shipping capacity, so no matter how many ships there are, it always feels insufficient.

Therefore, our country's central task is to use all our energy to manufacture ships; however, if we want to manufacture steel ships that are currently sailing, this is the most complex industrial form in various industrial sectors. For example, to build one ship, dozens of materials and more than two thousand kinds of parts are required, and if one of these parts is missing, no matter how hard you try, you will not be able to achieve anything.

Before the war, most of these materials and parts were sought from abroad, but now the source has been cut off. Although we are trying our best to save consumption domestically, various domestic projects are increasing and demand is frequent, and the demand for steel ships is skyrocketing, which is really difficult to cope with.

Although it is very difficult to increase the production of steel ships, we must overcome the shortage of ships and eliminate any difficulties. We are in an era where we must highly develop shipping capacity. Those engaged in shipping urgently demand the manufacture of wooden ships, and are determined to desperately and formally manufacture wooden ships in large quantities to improve and increase shipping capacity.

As far back as the middle of the nineteenth century, only wooden ships were manufactured, but wooden ships such as those known in Japan as "Shuinsen" crossed the oceans. Later, when the iron smelting method was invented, wooden-iron composite ships and iron ships were built, and gradually developed into today's steel ships. From 30 or 40 years ago, the use of wooden ships decreased year by year, and in recent years, except for a few small ships, they have been almost non-existent. However, in wartime, it is natural for wooden ships to appear because steel inevitably cannot meet the demand. Based on this concept, we still have a vague pain in our hearts, wondering why we did not actively build wooden ships at the beginning of the China Incident.

Even today, ordinary people still seem to underestimate the transportation capacity of wooden ships, but this is a big mistake. Although there are differences in the scope of shipping, its transportation capacity is truly not to be underestimated when applied to coastal routes. We are in an era when we urgently need a dramatic increase in ships. Wooden ships replacing steel ships provide very favorable conditions in all aspects.

For example, there is almost no shortage of materials for building wooden ships, and the shortage of labor can also be overcome. In particular, the construction time can be greatly shortened. Combining these points, and if we add a high degree of rationalization, I dare say that mass production is by no means difficult.

This time, the reason why our Osaka Shosen Company is the first to mass-produce these wooden ships is because the uses in various aspects are gradually expanding, and because we never take a business perspective as a premise for this enterprise, nor do we take the company's interests as a premise, but only want to work hard to enrich the wartime shipping, and it is with this strong determination that we started.

Therefore, our company has been engaged in multi-faceted research based on the experience and technology accumulated over many years. First, in order to find a production location, we traveled all over the country, and as a result, we believe that Shichisei Port in Ishikawa Prefecture is the most suitable place, so we decided to mass-produce here.

Although on the surface this place may seem inconvenient, in essence, in terms of topography, materials, labor and other conditions, it can be said to be the most complete compared to other places, and at the end of the shogunate era, it was the naval ship of the Kaga domain, and it was also the birthplace of the shipbuilding industry in Japan.

Later, this shipyard became the predecessor of Kawasaki Shipyard. Due to the changes of the times, our company, which is shouldering the mission of this great war, started mass production of wooden ships with a capital of 5 million yen. From the perspective of our shipbuilding industry, we believe that this has a lot of historical significance.

In addition to the production of wooden ships, the company has also established close horizontal contacts in shipping, and established a wooden ship shipping company with a capital of 10 million yen. Thus, in terms of vertical production and horizontal shipping, organic and rational connections have been established, and with a new attitude, it is actively carrying out its mission in this great war in its own shipping position.

Fortunately, our government has recently begun to work hard to mass-produce wooden ships, and is providing low-interest loans to finance the manufacture of standard wooden ships just like steel ships. In this critical period, our company is the first to start manufacturing wooden ships, which is truly a glorious achievement.

Although the tonnage of the ships and other matters are still under review, the Maritime Affairs Bureau has already announced that the tonnage of standard wooden ships is 250 tons, 150 tons, and 100 tons. Therefore, the company is currently using all its energy to produce the 250-ton wartime standard wooden ships announced by the Maritime Affairs Bureau.

Now the battle lines have expanded to tens of thousands of nautical miles in the vast ocean, so even one steel ship should be used overseas. In this sense, the mission of wooden ship shipping is, of course, even more urgent and important. (Translated from the February issue of "Real World of Industry")

### Song Meiling is About to Leave America and Return Home

Lisbon, 10th (Havas) – According to a dispatch from New York, Chiang Kai-shek's wife, after a brief stay in Washington, has now arrived in New York. After a few days, she will return to Chongqing soon.

Stockholm, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – According to well-informed sources in New York, Madame Chiang Kai-shek originally planned to travel around various departments in the United States for publicity, appealing for aid to Chongqing. This plan must now be abandoned. Madame Chiang's doctor believes that her physical condition cannot withstand such hardship and has advised her to shorten her itinerary.

### Analysis of Germany's Inevitable Victory: Coordination between Front and Rear Ensures No Repetition of WWI Mistakes

Germany is now taking on a general mobilization posture from top to bottom in preparation for the upcoming spring offensive. Recently, a Nazi mouthpiece compared and examined the situation in which Germany found itself during the last World War and this World War from military, economic, and political perspectives. The conclusion was: Although the enemy is using the example of the last World War to propagate that Germany will still win first and lose later this time, the painful experience of Germany winning before and losing the war during the last World War is still fresh in the memory of Germans. Therefore, in this World War, it will never repeat the mistakes of the 1918 failure, and will wholeheartedly move towards the path of victory.

Military Situation

During the last World War, the German army on the Western Front was blocked in its offensive in northern France, occupying only part of France. Part of Belgium was also in enemy hands, and the entire French coast and the English Channel were under enemy control. In Alsace, the enemy even invaded German-occupied territory, while the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway all maintained neutrality.

In contrast, today's German army has secured the entire Atlantic coast from Norway to the Spanish border. The French army, Germany's strongest enemy in the last World War, has now collapsed, and French industry is under German control. Moreover, German submarines have now made great progress in technology and are using the entire Atlantic coast as a base. In the south, the German and Austrian armies fought against Italy during the last World War, but this time Italy is our friend. Without the presence of the French Navy, the Mediterranean coast of France, Italy, Greece, and Portugal is under German-Italian control. Romania participated on the enemy's side during the last World War, but this time it is allied with us, and we are using its oil production. Furthermore, Africa, which was an enemy supply area during the last war, is now where German, Italian, British, and American forces are fighting, tying up their forces.

Moreover, Japan participated on the side of the Allied Powers during the last World War, but this time it has become Germany's ally, achieving brilliant victories, seizing important resources that were completely free for the enemy to use, and using these areas as operational bases to threaten the lifelines of Britain and the United States, tying up almost the entire American fleet, merchant ships, and most of the air force in the Pacific, while cooperating with German submarine warfare on all the seas of the world. In India, Britain must maintain considerable forces to prevent Japanese attacks. And Australian ships and soldiers can no longer cooperate on the European battlefield as they did during the last World War.

Economic Resources

In terms of food, during the last World War, the enemy's blockade caused a panic of shortage. The initial reserves were illegally manipulated by Jews, the implementation of the rationing system was delayed, and the rations gradually decreased. By the winter of the third year of the war, it had fallen into the most tragic situation. However, in this World War, rations are sought to be fair, while ensuring food for the front and rear. In the winter of the third year, special additional rations are being implemented. Due to the acquisition of the fertile agricultural areas of the Soviet Union, the freedom of food has been established.

In this World War, the enemy's raw material transport is much longer and more circuitous than in the last World War, requiring a lot of time and escorting ships for transportation. And it is threatened by German submarines and air force everywhere. Moreover, the enemy's supply bases during the last World War have now become German naval and air force operational bases. In the last World War, the enemy actually used the entire shipping space of the world (shipping space is the general term for the tonnage and number of ships), but now the ships of Japan and Italy are no longer available, and most of the shipping space and canals of various countries occupied by Germany have been seized by Germany, so the enemy almost only has its own shipping space and must meet its needs, which are much greater than last time.

Political Situation

During the last World War, Germany was a country of party politics, lacking unified military and political guidance. The Social Democratic Party, the largest political party, even claimed to be an anti-national party, preparing for a proletarian revolution and even inciting workers' strikes in military supply factories. The Center Party colluded with the enemy, and the Emperor of Austria-Hungary even secretly plotted a separate peace, giving the enemy confidence in their victory. Jews and Freemasons, who were in cahoots with the political parties, danced and jumped around in the economic and other sectors, plotting Germany's defeat. The government was weak and could do nothing about it. After the war, the backpacks of veterans returning to the motherland were covered with anti-war leaflets. This was the state of affairs at the time. In contrast, today's Germany, under the guidance of Führer Hitler, is completely unified in military and political affairs, and is moving towards the path of victory with strong leadership. The enemy has no room to maneuver. (Ding: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, March 5th)

### Roosevelt to Issue Statement Clarifying U.S.-Soviet Relations; Stanley and Molotov Held Talks, Probably Related to Recent Gaffe

Argentina, 11th (Central News Agency) – According to news from Washington received here, it is generally believed that U.S. President Roosevelt will soon issue a statement regarding the gaffe made by U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley, in order to clarify the current state of U.S.-Soviet relations. According to the New York Times, at a time when U.S.-Soviet relations are strained, Stanley may be summoned back for his gaffe.

Stockholm, 11th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Moscow, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the afternoon of the 10th and held important talks. It is said that the meeting may be related to the recent gaffe, and it is rumored that Stanley will meet with Stalin on this issue.

Stockholm, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Washington, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union General Stanley criticized the Soviet government for failing to understand U.S. aid to the Soviet Union, which coincided with the U.S. Congressional debate on increasing aid to the Soviet Union. The attitude of Congress will obviously be affected by Stanley's remarks. Congressional figures believe that the Soviet government is quite concerned that after expressing understanding of aid from the Allied Powers, the Soviet people will develop pro-Allied sentiments. The Soviet government knows that there may be disputes with the Allied Powers after the war, so it does not want to express understanding of the Allied Powers' aid. The Soviet Union also does not want to exchange military intelligence with the Allied Powers and refuses to allow American military observers to visit Soviet defense lines. Stanley's remarks will strengthen the anti-Soviet sentiment in the U.S. Congress.

Lisbon, 10th (Havas) – According to a dispatch from Washington, Under Secretary of State Welles stated that he had telegraphed U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley, requesting that he report the full text of his speech to the press in Moscow to the State Department. American newspapers are still commenting heavily on Stanley's speech, especially the editorial published by the New York Herald Tribune. The article roughly stated, "Stanley has made a statement, but his statement is absurd. After this incident, should the United States adopt a unified foreign policy to replace the current divergent foreign policy? Would it not be better if we could correct our attitude, make our words and actions consistent, and have an experienced and capable diplomat in charge?"

### American Aircraft Bomb French Cities

Vichy, 10th (Havas) – American bomber groups again bombed various French cities yesterday, causing damage to residential areas and casualties among residents. The main targets of the bombing were a town near Nantes and an area near Valenciennes.

Vichy, 10th (Havas) – According to official announcements, American bomber groups bombed Rennes, the capital of Brittany province, on the night of the 8th of this month, causing heavy civilian casualties. It is estimated that 250 people were killed and 400 injured, many of whom were women and children. Residential areas suffered the most damage. Once the cleanup is complete, it is often found that the number of casualties is more than this. Rennes is far from the coast and even further from the German artillery batteries on the coast. There are no military targets in the city. The American aircraft's bombing of undefended cities this time has aroused indignation among the people of France.

### German and British Aircraft Bomb Each Other

Stockholm, 10th (Havas) – It has been learned that British aircraft bombed the German city of Munich and its suburbs last night, destroying several buildings and monuments. Twelve British aircraft were lost. Western Germany was also bombed. British aircraft appeared over Germany again today.

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – Responsible sources stated that German aircraft raided the port of Hull on Tuesday night. The visibility was clear, and many bombs hit their targets, causing numerous large fires on the ground. That night, other German aircraft also bombed several cities at the mouth of the Humber River, the Portland area, and Woolsington. The latter had a gas plant hit and set on fire. All German aircraft returned safely afterward, without any losses.

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – Local officials pointed out that after British aircraft bombed historical buildings in Lübeck and other places, they bombed famous buildings in southern Germany again. Medieval buildings in central Nuremberg were deliberately bombed by British aircraft. British aircraft attacked Munich the night before and did not bomb military targets, but only attacked civilians and art buildings.

### Latvian Warriors Join Anti-Soviet Legion

Riga, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – Latvian warriors who have received the Bear Slayer Medal are now also joining the newly established Latvian Anti-Soviet Legion. The Bear Slayer Medal is Latvia's highest military decoration.

### Japanese Army Establishes Strategic Posture of Inevitable Victory on the Pacific Front

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) – Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although it has only been a year, the Japanese army has established a posture of inevitable victory and invincibility in both military and economic aspects. It is now launching offensives everywhere, from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the Solomon Islands and Australia in the south, and on the borderlines of mainland China, Burma, and India, crushing the enemy's attempts at counterattack. This further proves the strength of the Japanese army. The Japanese army in the South Pacific, under the cover of the defense forces on Guadalcanal Island and the vicinity of Yina, has launched strategic operations on the important front lines in the northern Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and completed the preparation of strategic strongholds in early February to adapt to the new operational posture. Afterwards, the elite aviation units of the Japanese army in that area were extremely active, penetrating deep into the rear of the United States and Australia, and launching fierce attacks. Among them, the raid on the New Hebrides Islands in February is a glimpse of the active situation of the Japanese air force. The great victories won by the Japanese army in the Pacific from February 16th to March 6th show the strength of the Japanese army. However, the enemy still holds the islands of New Caledonia, New Hebrides, Fiji, Samoa, and Hawaii, which are interconnected, as a communication line between the United States and Australia, and at the same time occupies air forces such as Guadalcanal Island, Port Moresby, and Darwin, which are interconnected. The enemy's intention is obviously to attack the Japanese mainland from the north of the United States, and to recapture the islands of Ryukyu and Mingami occupied by the Japanese army. The enemy uses the vicinity of Dutch Harbor as a base to attack the vicinity of Attu and Adak Islands, cutting off Tata Island (250 kilometers from Mingami Island), and attacking the Japanese-occupied islands with several or dozens of aircraft from time to time. At the same time, the enemy completed the 2,800-kilometer Alaska Highway in November last year, using Alaska as a base for attacking Japan, as an artery to the mainland United States. Therefore, the United States uses the northern Aleutian Islands and Alaska as the root base for Japanese counterattacks, and at the same time as a communication line with the Soviet Union, and is actively increasing its strength in that area. However, Ryukyu and Mingami Islands, the advanced stations of the war line, are strongly defended by the brave and well-fighting Japanese army, and the situation is extremely solid. Once spring arrives, the situation on the northern front will be vigorously developed. After the enemy's attempts to counterattack against Japan in the South Pacific and Australia were severely hit, they realized the failure of the anti-Axis operations, and then planned to use the base of the Chongqing army to directly attack the Japanese mainland. The United States continues to increase its air force stationed in Chongqing after the Burma Road was cut off. Although its forward base has been attacked by the elite units of the Japanese army's land and air forces, it still attempts to continue to move. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is currently commanded by Major General Chennault and has about 150 aircraft, which is equal to the remaining air force in Chongqing. Since the Yunnan-Burma Road was cut off, its gasoline and bombs have only been supplied by air transport, and the number is very small. Chongqing has now completely become a dependency of Britain and the United States, because although Chongqing claims to have sworn 3 million troops, and aims to establish a posture of resistance, and is engaged in the development of the Northwest and other work, it will not succeed without American assistance. Therefore, Song Meiling went to the United States to seek assistance. However, this time the National Government's participation in the war and the changes in Japan's policy towards China have given the Chongqing side a great blow. The Japanese army resolutely launched a spring offensive, which gave the Chongqing side a fatal blow. The enemy's attempt to recapture Burma is still the same as in the past, only making a big propaganda. Although Britain, the United States, and Chongqing held a military conference in New Delhi and attempted to invade the western Japanese army's position in Burma, they were immediately annihilated by the Japanese army. This was the first operation they advertised to recapture Burma. After that, although they still tried to move, they were all defeated by the Japanese army. Although the enemy air force in India also repeatedly carried out guerrilla warfare in Burma, it was defeated by the Japanese air force's counterattack. According to He Yingqin, he met with British Indian Army Commander Wavell in eastern India, and Luo Zhuoying, the commander of the Chongqing army in India, went to Guilin to meet with Zhang Fakui to discuss the air supply between India and Kunming, but the Japanese army's deployment in Burma can crush the enemy's attempt at any time. The Japanese air force also raided Calcutta to destroy the enemy's base. Now the Japanese army has established a strategic posture of inevitable victory in that area.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Solomon Islands Again

Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency) – The U.S. Navy Department announced yesterday that Japanese aircraft attacked four U.S. military bases in the Solomon Islands again on Tuesday, and also bombed U.S. military positions on Guadalcanal Island on Sunday night.

### New Japanese Vice Minister of the Army Tominaga's Brief Biography

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) – The new Vice Minister of the Army, Lieutenant General Kyoji Tominaga, is a graduate of the Army University. He went to Switzerland as an attendant to the Geneva Disarmament Conference. After returning to Japan, he served as a staff officer attached to the General Staff Headquarters, Chief of the General Staff Headquarters Section, Staff Officer of the Kwantung Army, and Commander of the 2nd Regiment of the Imperial Guard Infantry. In April of Showa 16 (1941), he was appointed as the Director of the Personnel Bureau of the Ministry of the Army. In March of Showa 17 (1942), he was concurrently appointed as the Director of the Army Merit Investigation Department until today.

### Turkey's Policy Remains Unchanged; Avoid Being Drawn into the War; Hitler Sends Telegram Congratulating Ismet on Re-election; New Cabinet Meeting Discusses Important Matters

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – Führer Hitler sent a telegram to Turkish President Ismet, congratulating him on his re-election as President. German officials believe that Ismet's re-election and the organization of the new Turkish cabinet confirm the Turkish government's decision to continue to adopt a neutral policy and avoid being drawn into the war.

Istanbul, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – Political observers here believe that the organization of the new Turkish cabinet is not surprising. The only surprising thing is that the discussion of the regular procedures took a whole day to achieve results, indicating that there must have been some difficulties in the discussion that needed to be negotiated before an agreement could be reached. Diplomatic circles welcome the establishment of the new cabinet and believe that the Turkish government is determined to maintain a neutral policy. Turkish newspapers all expressed welcome to the new government. Six of the ministers were reshuffled, and the Minister of Commerce and the Minister of Economy became experts. The new Minister of Transportation is General Cebesoy, the former Minister of Construction, which is said to indicate that domestic transportation in Turkey will be related to the military preparation policy, and transportation affairs will become more important.

### Gas Combustion Generates Strong Electric Current; New Invention by German Scientists

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – A famous German scientist has invented a method of using gas to make coal briquettes burn without flames, generating a strong electric current. The gas consumption is low, so it is very suitable for installing such equipment in vehicles to generate electricity using small gas storage containers, allowing vehicles to travel.

### The Time is Not Ripe for Restoration in Spain

### Industrial and Commercial Sectors Autonomously Organize the General Association for Commercial Control; Responsible for the Control of Materials; Changing Restrictions on the Movement of Materials; The Authorities are Comprehensively Planning

In order to uniformly purchase materials nationwide and concentrate distribution, the authorities are planning to establish a National General Association for Commercial Control. The association will be the highest control organ for the purchase and distribution of materials nationwide, encompassing and unifying all existing Chinese and Japanese commercial organizations. Therefore, after its establishment, it will make a great contribution to the revitalization of material exchanges in all aspects. The general association will be located in Shanghai, and the organization of the board of directors will be centered on the municipal chamber of commerce, enlisting powerful figures from the private financial world as members. As for the local branches, they will also use the existing organizations of the chambers of commerce in various places. What should be considered is that the chambers of commerce in various places have many sectarian characteristics. Therefore, before using them, they must be reorganized. Before the reorganization, the Commercial Association Law and the Trade Association Law must be amended by the government. As for the agencies affiliated to the association, such as the Material Control Association and the Commercial Federation, they are also jointly organized by Chinese and Japanese commercial figures, but the core lies in the Chinese side. After the establishment of the National General Association for Commercial Control, it will take the unified purchase and distribution of materials as its main task. The previously promulgated Material Movement Restriction Law is also expected to be abolished with the establishment of the association. This matter is of great importance to promoting material exchanges, establishing countermeasures for industrial raw materials, reducing domestic prices, and correcting the bias of materials. Therefore, all parties are paying close attention. Mr. Masutaro Kimura, consultant to the Central Reserve Bank, also issued a statement on this, meaning that the reorganization of the material purchase and distribution mechanism and the revision or abolition of the material movement restriction will have a good impact on the circulation of materials and the maintenance of the value of reserve coupons.

Promoters' Meeting

Shanghai News from the Central News Agency, yesterday (11th) at 4 pm, the inaugural meeting of the National General Association for Commercial Control was held at the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association on 司非而路. The attendees included leaders from the banking, yarn, department store, chemical industry, tobacco industry, and municipal chambers of commerce: Tang Shoumin, Zhou Zuomin, Wu Zhenxiu, Ye Fuxiao, Pei Yunqing, Huang Jiangquan, Li Ze, Chen Shuili, Guo Shun, Esakami Toru, Do Ryokei, Ro Shigaku, Kyo Kangun, Ri Sohan, Son Shinritsu, Sai Seihaku, Tei Kokyo, En Tozan, Mon Ranko, Rin Kako, and others, totaling twenty people. Also present were Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government, Director Wang of the Economic Bureau, and directors from various bureaus of the Ministry of Industry: Guo Hong, Chen Zhong, Xiang Kou, Sun Zuji, Zhang Jun, etc. Minister Mei Hua Lu, made a special visit to deliver a speech yesterday.

Minister Mei's Speech

Stated briefly, "The Provisional Regulations of the National General Association for Commercial Control were approved by the National Defense Conference this morning (11th) and will be promulgated immediately. This time, in order to adapt to the wartime economic system and implement the control of materials, the government has, after several consultations with the friendly Japanese authorities, entrusted the Chinese industrial and commercial sectors to autonomously organize an agency to handle material control matters. The government is responsible for supervision and guidance. Under the equal treatment and close cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial sectors, the aim is to stabilize people's livelihoods, increase production, and achieve the grand effect of winning the Greater East Asia War. The organizational system of this agency can be divided into three levels: (1) trade associations of various industries in various places, (2) federations of various industries, and (3) the National General Association for Commercial Control. The tasks of purchasing, manufacturing, distributing, and exchanging materials will be borne by this agency, which will handle them separately. I hope that all of you present will immediately open a preparatory meeting, and that officials and merchants will work together to promote it."

Preparatory Meeting

After Minister Mei finished his speech, the first preparatory meeting was immediately held. The promoters publicly elected Wen Lanping as the temporary chairman, and resolved that all promoters would be preparatory committee members, and appointed Tang Shoumin, Wu Zhenxiu, Lin Kanghou, Esakami Toru, and Kyo Kangun as members of the constitution drafting committee, who will begin to convene today and convene the second preparatory meeting tomorrow (13th), formally establish the association on the 15th, and host guests from all walks of life, and begin office work on the 16th.

### Chongming "Purification of the Countryside" Begins on April 15th; Large Coastal Blockade Line

The "Purification of the Countryside" work in Chongming District is scheduled to begin on April 15th. Currently, all aspects of the work are being actively prepared. In order to facilitate the advancement of the work, the Special District Office has expanded the original four administrative districts into ten districts, and the jurisdiction of towns and villages has been reorganized. At the same time, a large blockade line will be built around the coast, which is expected to be completed by the end of March. The issuance of people's residence permits has been stepped up, so those applying for them have been extremely crowded in recent days. In order to thoroughly clarify the significance of the "Purification of the Countryside" to the people, the Chinese and Japanese authorities specially convened representatives from various levels the other day to hold a discussion meeting, listen to the people's opinions and suggestions on the "Purification of the Countryside", and answer the people's questions about the "Purification of the Countryside" at any time.

### Xiedaxiang and Other Stores Were Sealed Up Yesterday; Selling Goods at Excessive Prices

The police authorities of the French Concession strictly manage stores of various industries within the concession, absolutely prohibit black market transactions, and dispatch a large number of secret agents to strictly investigate the circumstances of stores of various industries exceeding the price limits. A large number of stores have been investigated and dealt with. Several stores of various industries, such as Xiedaxiang, have been sealed up after being found to have violated business regulations. The sealing was officially executed yesterday (11th). The seal reads, "This store is ordered to close down by the Police Department for selling goods at excessive prices."

### Local Ordinary Publications: Registration Postponed to Conserve Resources

The Propaganda Department recently stated that since the nature of various publication registrations and distributions in Shanghai are largely the same, and given the current scarcity of resources, it is especially important to conserve resources. Therefore, all registrations will be temporarily postponed. A special notice has been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government requesting that the registration of publications without special characteristics be generally postponed.

### Bicycle Theft Approaching Its End: Thieves Carrying Bicycles Across Borders, Police from Three Areas Cooperating to Apprehend Them

The English-language *Shanghai Times* reported that according to the Assistant Commissioner of Police, cases of bicycle theft have significantly decreased in the past three weeks. This is because nearly half of the bicycles have been registered and stamped.

Police Cooperation

He stated that in these three weeks, fewer than twenty bicycles have been stolen. Previously, under the old licensing system, the average number of bicycle thefts per month was often around twenty-four. He explained that this strict change in the licensing system is due to the cooperation of the police in various municipal districts in the city, determined to eliminate thieves.

Registration Deadline

In order to create a joint network among the municipal districts to apprehend bicycle thieves, the bicycle registration period has been limited to two weeks. After this, bicycle theft will be completely eliminated. Therefore, the Assistant Commissioner hopes that residents will not delay registration to protect their bicycles. As for bicycle thieves who carry stolen bicycles across borders, the police will order officers stationed at border checkpoints and the police outside the borders to cooperate in the pursuit and arrest.

Emphasis on Bicycle Licenses

Not only should the license number match the number on the blue plate on the bicycle, but the number on the application form must also be the same when the case is reviewed. It was also stated that when a bicycle is stolen, the police in the three municipal districts will cooperate to investigate the whereabouts of the bicycle. Currently, the investigation work is easier to implement than before. Finally, in addition to asking residents to take good care of their bicycles, the Assistant Commissioner hopes that bicycle owners will cooperate to reduce bicycle theft to a minimum.

### Spokesperson of the Japanese Information Department Issues Statement

The Information Department of the Japanese Army and Navy held a routine reception for the Chinese press corps in Shanghai yesterday (the 11th) at 3:00 PM. More than a dozen people from various newspapers and the Shanghai Press Association attended the meeting. The spokesperson of the Information Department of the Japanese Army gave a detailed explanation of the difficulties facing the British, American, and Chongqing forces in Burma, stating briefly that in early February of this year, Chiang Kai-shek of Chongqing convened a meeting in Chongqing. On February 11, it was reported that He Yingqin went to New Delhi, India, to hold discussions with British and American commanders. We observe that these

Two Meetings

Often did not result in any concrete measures. The aim of the British, American, and Chongqing forces is nothing more than to open the road to India as a base for launching offensives against Japan. According to the frequent troop movements of the Chongqing army, they are concentrating in Yunnan, intending to advance into India through Burma, and have appointed Chen Cheng of the "Sixth War Zone" as the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force in Burma. However, Chongqing's troop deployments and dreams of launching an offensive are not a planned action with the understanding of the British and Americans. Therefore, Chongqing's attempt to counterattack Burma is, in fact, impossible. First, the Chongqing army is not acclimatized to the environment, and is plagued by miasma. Second, the local

Climate is Harsh

During the rainy season, diseases are rampant. Offensives can only be launched when the climate tends to be normal in mid-October. However, how to sustain and get through this long period is a concern. Now, for the sake of preemptive action, the Japanese army has already begun offensives in Burma. Furthermore, the Long Yun troops in Yunnan are under surveillance after the Chongqing army moved into Yunnan, and can be said to be powerless. In addition, the British army in India is even more afraid of death and unwilling to deplete its strength, only relying on using Indians to carry out sabotage, placing the Indian army on the front line, while the British

Are in the rear. In terms of numbers, the Indian army on the front line has about twelve divisions, and the British army in the rear has about four or five divisions. As for the strength of the British air force in India, although the exact number is unknown, it is speculated that its strength is not worth mentioning. In particular, the remaining American air force has no operational strength. Finally, it was mentioned that since the Japanese army moved into Guangzhou Bay according to the Franco-Japanese Agreement, the Guangxi army nearby has not stirred at all. Based on this observation, it can be determined that Chongqing has no power to launch a counterattack.

### Self-Defense Corps Member Commits Suicide While on Duty

Wang Xiaodi, a local resident of No. 20 Lanxin Lane, Bailuer Road, French Concession, is 23 years old and works as a peddler. At around 7:10 PM last night, Wang, being a member of the Self-Defense Corps, was on duty at the guard post at the intersection of Jialu Road and Aolihe Road. Due to extreme poverty, he suddenly became disillusioned with life and secretly took poison to commit suicide. Before long, the poison took effect and became uncontrollable. He collapsed on the side of the road, on the verge of death. Passersby saw this and urgently called the police. Wang was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that he took too much poison and his life is in danger.

### Central Reserve Bank Finances Continued Savings Operations: Authorities Issue Statement

Central News Agency reports that the Central Savings Society, operated by the Central Trust Bureau, a Chongqing institution, has been under the management of the Japanese military authorities since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, it has been decided that the Central Reserve Bank will fund the establishment of a new Central Savings Society, inheriting all existing deposits and liabilities. Business will begin soon. The Japanese Embassy issued the following statement on the 11th: "The Central Savings Society is a financial institution funded and operated by the Central Trust Bureau, a Chongqing institution. It has been managed by the Japanese military. After investigating the contents, it was found that the society is a grassroots financial institution that absorbs small amounts of funds, and is closely related to the interests of the public. In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, it is deemed necessary to promptly and appropriately handle it. Therefore, its relationship with Chongqing is specifically severed, and the Central Reserve Bank will fund the establishment of a new Central Savings Society, inheriting its assets and liabilities to continue operations. The remaining assets of the old Central Savings Society will be liquidated. The specific methods for the Central Savings Society to inherit the management, liabilities, and operations of the old Central Savings Society will be determined later. The liquidation of the remaining assets of the New Central Savings Association has been entrusted to the Yokohama Specie Bank Shanghai Branch. The National Government has also issued a proclamation regarding the handling of the Central Savings Society."

Appointment of Supervisors

After the Central Savings Society's Articles of Association and the Regulations of the Supervisory Committee of the Society were passed by the 151st meeting of the Executive Yuan, it was reported that the Central Reserve Bank had, in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations of the Supervisory Committee of the Central Savings Society which stipulates that the supervisory committee shall be composed of fifteen members, appointed three persons from among the directors and supervisors of the Central Reserve Bank designated by the President of the Central Reserve Bank. The remaining twelve persons are appointed from among those with experience and reputation in accordance with the regulations that state, "Three persons shall be reappointed every two years." The appointed persons include: Ye Fuxiao, Tang Shoumin, Wu Zhenxiu, Qin Runxiang, Guo Shun, Yuan Ludeng, Zhu Boquan, Pei Yunqing, Li Da, Pei Fuheng, Yang Xinghua, Ren Xishun, and other twelve persons. Also, Liu Ruxiang, Wu Jiyun, and Shao Shijun, three of the directors and supervisors of the bank, were appointed as members of the supervisory committee. Li Da was appointed as the manager of the society, Pei Fuheng, Zhang Xisan, and Zhou Shaojian were appointed as deputy managers, and Deng Yiyuan and Qiu Xiaopei were appointed as assistant managers. Preparations are currently underway and it is expected that the society's business will be prosperous.

Ministry of Finance Proclamation

It is noted that our country traditionally values thrift and emphasizes savings, possessing the virtue of "wealth hidden among the people" and "cultivating the national foundation." However, this has not been properly channeled. In order to adapt to the current financial situation, encourage national savings, utilize idle funds, and develop legitimate enterprises, the Ministry of Finance has, after consultation, taken over the Central Savings Society that existed before the incident. With the approval of the National Government, the Central Reserve Bank has appropriated funds to establish a new Central Savings Society, inheriting its assets and liabilities, and encouraging general public savings. Original depositors of the old Central Savings Society before the incident may continue their rights and interests after completing legal procedures. At the same time, the Central Savings Society will plan to issue economic recovery lottery tickets, special installment savings, and prize-bearing principal-returning savings bonds, so as to encourage the public's interest in savings, make the Central Savings business more developed, utilize idle funds, thus strengthen society, revive the economy, and benefit people's livelihoods in many ways. Apart from the Articles of Association of the Central Savings Society and the Regulations of the Supervisory Committee of the Central Savings Society being submitted to the Executive Yuan for forwarding to the National Government for examination and record and distributed, this proclamation is hereby issued for general knowledge. March 11, 32nd year of the Republic of China, Minister Zhou Fo Hai.

Finance Minister's Speech

Our country has always valued thrift and savings, and its virtues have always been in line with others. Unfortunately, the use of savings has not been flexible, and hoarding often leads to stagnation. In recent years, the situation has deteriorated, and this virtue has gradually declined. The meaning of cultivating the national foundation has not been properly channeled. The Minister has taken this into consideration and has, after consultation, taken over the original Central Savings Society before the incident. With the approval of the government, the Central Reserve Bank has appropriated funds to establish a new Central Savings Society, inheriting its assets and liabilities and opening for business on a scheduled date. The general public has a place to rely on. Depositors of the old Central Savings Society before the incident may continue their rights and interests after completing legal procedures. At the same time, the Central Savings Society will stipulate the issuance of other lottery tickets and actively promote economic recovery lottery tickets, special installment savings bonds, prize-bearing principal-returning savings bonds, etc., which are all under planning. Efforts will be made to encourage the public's interest in savings, and idle funds can also be utilized. Then, a balanced and prosperous life, a healthy society, economic recovery, and the benefit of people's livelihood will be achieved in one fell swoop. It is expected that the public will be fully aware of the government's emphasis on thrift and promotion of savings, based on their patriotism and self-love, to save money for themselves and save for the country, forming a trend and guiding social welfare.

Central Savings Society Articles of Association

Short Commentary

### Organizing a National Chamber of Commerce Control Association

In order to establish a wartime economic system, implement controlled materials, and centralize management, the National Government is planning to establish a National Chamber of Commerce Control Association. The provisional regulations have been passed by the National Defense Conference. On the other hand, because friendly countries are implementing new policies towards [blank space] after the National Government's entry into the war, they are returning the authority to manage controlled materials to the National Government, which is a matter of great satisfaction as it facilitates the establishment of this new institution. The association held its first preparatory meeting yesterday, with organizers including leaders from the financial industry, yarn industry, department store industry, chemical industry, tobacco industry, etc., centered on representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Looking at the list of people, they are all outstanding talents of the time. The association is scheduled to draft rules and regulations today, and will specifically decide everything in the second preparatory meeting tomorrow. The people are hoping for the emergence of a powerful institution that can stabilize people's livelihoods, just like waiting for clouds in a great drought. It is particularly gratifying that the authorities can concentrate outstanding talents from the private sector for the personnel of this institution, and completely consider the future of the enterprise. At the beginning of its establishment, I would like to offer the following humble suggestions:

(1) Since it is a national institution, the general association should recruit reputable, talented, fair, and honest people from all over the country. Local branches should recruit first-class talents from their respective regions.

(2) The choice of the president of the board of directors should be carefully weighed, with a socially recognized fair person being the best choice.

(3) All rules and regulations must be carefully drafted to take into account the interests of the country and the convenience of merchants and people.

(4) Except for matters that need to be kept confidential, the association's affairs should be absolutely open, accept criticism, and gain the trust of a wide range of people, and automatically cooperate.

(5) The advantages of the previous controlled management by friendly countries should be retained and adopted as much as possible, and the disadvantages should of course be eliminated, in order to achieve perfection.

The above are just general principles, and it is firmly believed that the new institution will be able to achieve them. Secondly, in terms of industry, its importance is no less than that of commerce. It is hoped that in the near future, there will also be an institution with the same nature and national unity, to complete the entire wartime economic system.

### Flour for Sale Today in the West Shanghai District, Household Rice to be Sold Next Week

The sixth installment of household rice in the West Shanghai District has been delayed until now due to insufficient delivery procedures. According to the Shenwen News Agency reporter's inquiry with the West Shanghai District Public Food Distribution Office, yesterday (the 11th), the office received over a thousand bags of rice from the West Shanghai Warehouse. The remaining four thousand bags are expected to be delivered within the next few days. It is estimated that distribution and sale can begin in about three or four days. It was also reported that all 15,282 bags of the third installment of household flour in the West Shanghai District were delivered yesterday (the 11th), and it is scheduled to be sold simultaneously by 55 retailers in the first and second lanes of the district starting at 9:00 AM today. At that time, residents of the two lanes can purchase 2.6 catties of flour per person with a certificate from designated retailers at a price of 5.23 yuan.

### Deadline to Submit Civil Service Qualification Review Documents Extended to the End of April

The city's courts have been ordered to handle civil service qualification review matters and have already submitted the cases for review. The Judicial Administration Department has issued a further order to each court to submit all required documents for civil service qualification review cases by the end of April this year. Failure to do so by the deadline will result in the cases being considered incomplete. All courts are required to strictly comply with this order.

### Secondary School Students' Speech Contest on War Participation Rescheduled to Next Month

### Flour Allocation for Noodle Products Industry Under Overall Planning

Regarding the resumption of flour allocation for the noodle products industry, after the Noodle Association and the Bun and Steamed Bread Association petitioned the Public Works Department, the Public Works Department's Associations Section ordered the relevant industries to jointly organize a unit in order to comprehensively plan the flour allocation method and maintain the livelihood of the industry's workers.

### Partial Free Trade of Coarse Grains: Chinese Merchants Still Studying Profits

According to Yang Heqing of the Coarse Grains Allocation Group, in a conversation with a Shenwen News Agency reporter, since the war, the purchase of coarse grains in the city has been handled by the Military Allocation Bureau. This time, the ability to freely trade is due to the industry's special request to the Military Allocation authorities in order to maintain their livelihood. The regulations for yellow beans, sesame seeds, raw kernels, cottonseed, and rapeseed are that 75% of the local coarse grain quantity will be purchased and allocated by the Military Allocation authorities at a predetermined price, and the remaining 25% can be freely traded by the industry. Other items such as corn, broad beans, and red sorghum are stipulated to be 50%, with the remainder being freely traded by the industry. This method is implemented equally for both Chinese and Japanese merchants. Currently, Japanese merchants are already engaging in free trade transactions, while Chinese merchants are still reluctant to engage in free trade because they have not accurately estimated the amount of profit they can obtain.

### A Record of What I Saw and Heard in Zhenhai and Zhoushan Island

Zhenhai, Ningbo, Zhoushan Island, and other places are China's gateways facing the East China Sea. Now, they possess a renewed character, and their importance increases day by day. Especially for Shanghai, they are vital, and Shanghai's lifeline depends on their maintenance. The materials that Shanghai desires from the mainland are all transported through the aforementioned ports and islands, relying on countless sailboats that cross the East China Sea from the mainland. Zhenhai and Zhoushan Island are also the base for China's coastal blockade line, and they also contain inexhaustible, largest fishing grounds. Because of such value, they are in an inseparable relationship with Shanghai. The renewed character and importance that I want to talk about lie here. However, people in Shanghai do not value this point. With the cooperation of the Fleet Reporting Department and the local garrison of naval and telecommunications forces, I undertook a short trip, and the actual observations and hearings I obtained are as follows:

Zhenhai

In August of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937, or Showa 13), the Japanese Fleet stationed in China issued a decisive declaration to blockade China's coastal navigation, cutting off the sea route to Chongqing. However, Chongqing still maintained routes through Guangdong, Vietnam, Burma, and the so-called Ningbo route from Zhenhai. Subsequently, the routes through Guangdong, Vietnam, and Burma were successively cut off by the Japanese forces. Only one Zhejiang-Jiangxi route connecting Zhenhai and Ningbo remained. Because of its large transportation capacity, it became Chongqing's only smuggling route. Thus, sailboats and large foreign ships crowded in between.

All weapons and ammunition from this port island could directly cultivate the fighting power of the Third War Area. At the same time, it nourished Chongqing's lifeline from the sea. Under such circumstances, the Japanese army naturally could not remain silent. The naval landing forces occupied Zhenhai on July 16th of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939, or Showa 14) in a joint sea and air operation, destroying the source of its anti-Japanese war blood transfusion route. After achieving its mission, it withdrew automatically. Who knew that after the Japanese army withdrew, this secret route would be reactivated. Therefore, the Japanese army reoccupied the area on April 19th of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941, or Showa 16), and then bypassed the Yong River, about eight or nine li away from the area, occupied Ningbo, and completely brought the starting point of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line under control. Therefore, after the area was occupied by the Japanese army, it had a great impact on Shanghai's financial circles. At the same time, the Blue Shirts Society dispatched by Chongqing to Shanghai, as well as special forces disrupting the rear, originally used the area as a round-trip route. Its fall made it impossible for Chongqing to carry out espionage work against Shanghai.

Zhoushan Island

Zhoushan Island has close geographical ties with Zhenhai and Ningbo. It is a well-known trading port and was captured by the Japanese naval landing forces on June 23rd of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939, or Showa 14). The nature of Zhoushan Island is more of a distribution center for materials, and even more so, it is a famous fishing ground. The greatest purpose of the Japanese navy's occupation of the area was to blockade the East China Sea. Moreover, Daishan Island, north of Zhoushan Island, produces three million catties of salt annually. Putuo Mountain, east of Zhoushan Island, along with Wutai Mountain in Shanxi and Emei Mountain in Sichuan, is one of China's three major Buddhist sites and is historically famous. In the past, transportation between Japan and China had to go through Dinghai on Zhoushan Island. Therefore, it is also a place of general concern in history.

The island is juxtaposed with Dinghai. Shenjiamen, located on Lujia Island in the east of the island, is a distribution center for nearby fisheries, and its commerce is more active than the county seat of Dinghai. Even in terms of the import and export of aid-to-Chiang materials, its importance is far above Dinghai. The island was long coveted by Britain and France, who wanted to use it as a base for aggression. During the Opium War in 1840, British General Pulima led 26 warships to attack and occupy Dinghai in June of that year, and then attacked Zhapu Port, blockading Ningbo. Before Shanghai's prosperity, Britain had attempted to make Zhoushan Island a second Hong Kong. From Shanghai to Dinghai, the distance is 132 nautical miles. If going from Ningbo, it is only 35 nautical miles. The island's products are weak, and the supply of rice is insufficient, with about three-quarters being supplied from Shanghai. Before the Japanese army occupied it, the island and Zhenhai were both entrepots for Chongqing's entry and exit, which was also the hub of the aid-to-Chiang route. However, since the Japanese army occupied the two places, they only have the value of blockade bases. As for politics and economics, they do not have any important missions.

Security and Administration

Zhenhai and Zhoushan Island are both governed by the Autonomous Committees, which are responsible to the Japanese Navy, no different from places that are absolutely dependent on the Navy. However, upon closer inspection, there are two differences. In Zhenhai, in addition to the county seat, the army also cooperates in guarding the area. However, Zhoushan Island and other nearby islands are completely guided by the navy. Since March 1st of this year, Zhenhai County has been directly under the jurisdiction of the Zhejiang East Administrative Office of the National Government. Therefore, the "Zhenhai Autonomous Committee" was dissolved at that time, and the former president was reassigned as the county magistrate. However, Zhoushan Island is still under the sole administration of the "Dinghai Autonomous Committee." The change of Zhenhai to the jurisdiction of the Zhejiang East Administrative Office is undoubtedly due to the Japanese side's construction spirit, and in substance, it is no different from before.

The Zhenhai administrative region has a total of seven districts. The security of the first, second, third, and fourth districts has been consolidated. As for the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, bandits still appear from time to time, and they have not yet escaped the era of sweeping away bandits. The bandits who appear in the area call themselves the "Jiangbei Guerrilla Team," but in reality, they are all vagrant bandits with no ideological organization whatsoever. Thoroughly sweeping them away is only a matter of time. The population increases by 200 to 300 people every month, totaling about 17,000 people. Soon, it will be able to restore the pre-war population of 20,000 people. At present, it has generally restored its former prosperity.

The Autonomous Committee on Zhoushan Island has 15 branches on the island, Daishan Island, and other islands. Under a unified organization, the archipelago has a total population of about 500,000 people. There are no fewer than six or seven hundred islands, large and small, and the security is very good, with almost no room for vagrant bandits to move around.

The security force of the Autonomous Committee itself has made significant progress recently. In addition to about 1,300 police officers, there is also a military police force of about 100 people responsible for maintaining security. At the end of last year, the Wang Jineng unit of Chongqing was dedicated to He Yun on Liuheng Island and has been reorganized into a security team to help maintain security. At the same time, the self-defense organization of the people is also working hard. Like Zhenhai, they have organized a self-defense corps and implemented the Baojia system, with good results. From a geographical point of view, the focus of the security problem in the area is at sea. However, because of the recent close transportation with the mainland production areas, it is feared that it will cause the rampant pirates of the early days, so the Japanese naval garrison is fully prepared to counter them.

Progress in Various Constructions

The most noteworthy construction in this area is the roads, because the stability of security and the increase in production are directly due to the construction of roads. For example, in Zhenhai, the Ningbo-Yin Highway connecting Zhenhai and Ningbo has been built. The entire journey is about 30 kilometers and has been mostly completed. It is expected to be opened to traffic by the end of May. After the completion of this highway, it can shorten the distance between Ningbo and Zhenhai. At the same time, the economic development of the two places is also guaranteed. In addition, roads necessary for security are also being constantly built. In terms of the new bridges built by the Japanese naval forces in Zhenhai alone, there are as many as 26.

The construction of Zhoushan Island is even more active, especially the round-the-island road that runs through the entire island, which is even more valuable. This road started at the end of the year before last, lasted about six months, and cost more than two million yuan before it was completed, which has greatly helped to establish the security of Zhoushan Island. It is a pity that the islanders still lack a full understanding of the benefits derived from the road and the spirit of promoting construction, which is a pity. This round-the-island road, which is more than a hundred kilometers long, has become the basis for living and working in peace. At present, efforts are still being made to increase the distance in order to facilitate intermodal transportation. In addition, the salt pan security road on Daishan Island is also under construction recently. Therefore, in the future, in the development of the salt industry, it will be able to obtain unlimited results.

In addition to road construction, attention is also paid to education and culture. Schools, libraries, and sports fields are established. On the one hand, public utilities such as electricity and telephones are actively repaired. On the other hand, in terms of increasing production and construction, farmland is expanded, cooperatives are established, agriculture is improved, and afforestation is promoted. Awards are given for increasing production, and small loans are implemented. In particular, improving fisheries and increasing salt industry work in the Daishan Island area have increased the importance of this area. It can be determined that its future status will be important, and the relevant parties are currently studying all development plans.

Political Issues

As mentioned above, the positions of Zhenhai and Zhoushan Island are absolutely dependent on the navy. All facilities are aimed at restoring pre-war prosperity. Now, due to the geographical distance between the two places, the relationship with the National Government is extremely shallow. The National Government does not have any direct guidance or policies to implement in these two places. Therefore, the people in both places feel that if they change their affiliation to the National Government, the established policies of the past may change. At the same time, there are many other reasons, so there are inevitable doubts. The Japanese naval authorities responsible for that area, in order to avoid increasing the burden on the National Government, firmly adhere to the policy of enriching the local economy. In other words, before achieving economic self-sufficiency, they decided to promote all construction and strive to produce to supply the needs of Shanghai.

### Chief Controller Inagaki of the Public Works Bureau Talks About the Current Status of Oil Rationing: Actively Negotiating Quantity and Types; Residents Eagerly Await Implementation

In order to maintain the supply of major food grains, the concession authorities have determined the method of rationing rice, grains, and sugar in the city based on population. The handling agencies of the authorities have successively issued purchase certificates. After receiving the certificates, citizens can use the certificates to purchase the required household rice and sugar from the designated retailers. As for the supply of edible oil in the city, the demand from citizens is very high. The concession authorities have long determined the principle of rationing oil in the city based on population and have issued oil purchase certificates within the concession to facilitate citizens to purchase with the certificates. However, the date of sale of household edible oil has not been announced, and citizens are eagerly awaiting it.

The Transfer Procedures Are Very Cumbersome

In order to clarify the actual details, the Shenwen News reporter visited Mr. Inagaki, Chief Controller of Materials of the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession on the morning of the 11th. He was received and answered the reporter's inquiries. He explained the issue of rationing oil in the city in great detail. The record of the conversation is as follows: (1) Question: Residents of the city have a high demand for edible oil. The concession authorities have long determined the principle of rationing oil based on population and have issued some purchase certificates. However, I do not know when it will be implemented and what the detailed method is. (1) Answer: The Public Works Bureau does not distribute the major food grains within the concession according to the Baojia system. The Baojia system is only used as a reference for implementing distribution. For the distribution of edible oil, the authorities also implement it according to the method of rice and grain distribution. For the distribution of various small daily necessities, it seems more appropriate to implement distribution according to the Baojia system. However, edible oil is different from this. The edible oil in the city is transported from North China and Manchuria. The transfer procedures and the quantity of supply are not as simple as the distribution of sugar. Especially in terms of quantity, it is necessary to consider it for a long time in order to seek a constant period of supply without fear of interruption. Therefore, the authorities have been actively negotiating with the Japanese Embassy on the issue of the type of oil to be sold and the quantity of supply. The specific method of rationing oil based on population will be clarified by April 15th at the latest.

The Future Selling Price Will Be Carefully Verified

(2) Question: Is the scope of rationing oil based on population in the city limited to the two concessions, or is it universally implemented in the central city, West Shanghai, Zhabei, Pudong, and the South City districts? (2) Answer: The rationing of oil based on population handled by the Materials Control Department of the Public Works Bureau is only within the two concessions. Other districts are handled by the authorities in charge. (3) Question: When the method of rationing oil based on population is implemented, can you tell me how much each person can be allocated per month? (3) Answer: The authorities have prepared everything for rationing oil based on population within the concession. However, the issue of the quantity of supply is still being negotiated with the relevant parties. Therefore, it has not yet been determined how much edible oil each person will be allocated per month. (4) Question: Will the retail price change when edible oil is rationed based on population? (4) Answer: When this bureau handles the rationing of edible oil based on population, it will be calculated based on the total cost. The selling price should be lower than the current price.

### The 29th Period of Food Ration Distribution; Sugar Was Rationed Yesterday; Those Who Have Moved Are Allowed to Use the Purchase Certificates They Have Already Received

After the authorities implemented the system of rationing food based on population to maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens, the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession, the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession, and the Municipal Food Administration issued purchase certificates for rice, flour, grains, edible oil, and sugar, and stipulated methods of rationing based on population. The certificates are used to purchase from designated retailers on a periodic basis. It is reported that the first period of sugar and the 20th period of household rations have been sold with certificates starting yesterday. The distribution period for edible oil and grains will be announced by the authorities after a decision is made.

Sugar Sales

Sugar merchants cooperate. With the approval of the military distribution authorities, sugar rationing has been implemented simultaneously in the city's public and community spheres (including Hongkou), the French Concession, the South City, West Shanghai, Zhabei, the central city area, and Pudong, starting yesterday. Purchase certificates issued by the competent authorities of each area are used to purchase from designated Class A retailers. Each certificate is for half a catty per person, and the price is 2 yuan and 35 cents. The validity period of the first period of sugar certificates is until March 31st. If it expires, it will be invalid and cannot be reissued. As for the second period of sugar certificates, it will be distributed at that time. The quantity, price, start and end dates of the distribution will be announced by the cooperative on April 1st.

Unqualified Sugar Merchants Are All Cancelled

The cooperative has re-registered and merged the Class A retailers who sell household sugar. Those who have passed the review will be given a registration number, and unqualified households will be canceled. The following methods are stipulated: (1) Unqualified households should stop collecting payments immediately if they have not paid the payment; (2) Unqualified households should stop delivering goods immediately if they have paid the payment but have not delivered the goods, and the payment should be returned; (3) Unqualified households should immediately report to the place where the goods have been sent; (4) The cooperative will provide subsidies for the quota of the unqualified households that should have been distributed in February to show consideration.

New Retailers Will Be Implemented in the Second Period

The cooperative has merged more than 1,000 Class A retailers in the city's seven areas into 138 in the Public Concession, 111 in the French Concession, 61 in the South City, and 65 each in West Shanghai and Zhabei. Each store is issued a registration number and ordered to hang it in a conspicuous place for identification. It is reported that it has been decided to implement it starting from the second period. Therefore, the distribution of the second period of sugar certificates will be based on the newly compiled retailer number. As for the first period of sugar certificates, it will be sold temporarily according to the old registration number.

Types of Rice and Flour

Regarding the 29th period of household rations, after the Public Works Bureau and the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession stipulated it, it has been sold with rice purchase certificates and flour certificates by the rice stores established in the two concessions since yesterday. Each certificate can purchase one and a half liters of whole rice and one liter of broken rice, and the price is 6 yuan and 30 cents. 1.8 catties of No. 2 flour and 0.4 catties of No. 3 flour cost a total of 3 yuan and 85 cents. However, most of the whole rice in this period is domestic white rice and foreign rice. The number of brown rice is not large, so brown rice is not distributed in some rice stores. The 30th period of household rations is scheduled to be collected on the 15th of this month and sold starting on the 21st. The quantity and matching will be determined by the authorities.

Edible Oil Rationing Is In Great Demand

After the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office was approved to ration oil based on population, the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession, the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession, and the Municipal Food Administration issued edible oil certificates. It is reported that the military distribution authorities have purchased soybean oil from oil factories in Shanghai and soybean oil that arrived in Shanghai from Dalian, which will be distributed to the wholesale office and distributed to designated edible oil retailers for rationing based on population. As for the date and price of purchase with certificates, it will be announced by the wholesale office in conjunction with the authorities. All those who hold edible oil certificates are requested to purchase according to the methods stipulated by the wholesale office at that time.

The Same Rice Store Also Sells Grains

After the Public Works Bureau and the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession issued the first period of grain certificates, they have designated each established rice store to also distribute grains. Therefore, the rice store registration number on the grain certificates issued to taxpayers in the concession is exactly the same as the rice purchase certificate and flour certificate. It is reported that the grains issued in the first period are soybeans and the like, which will be collected with the 30th period of household rations. The name, quantity, and price of the grains will be announced at that time. It is expected that each established rice store will be clear when receiving the 30th period of purchase orders.

Those Who Have Moved This Month Are Allowed to Use the Original Purchase Certificates

Regarding the issue of grain distribution for those who have moved, according to the Datong News Agency reporter, the food management authorities have stipulated the following methods in order to avoid losses to those who have moved: Those who have moved within the scope of each district in Shanghai, if they have not received the grain purchase certificate for this month in the new location, they will still be allowed to use the grain purchase certificate for this month issued in the original location. This type of grain purchase certificate includes certificates for rice, flour, grains, sugar, oil, and other items. As for the second landlord who deducts grain purchase certificates to operate privately when sub-households move during the certificate issuance period, the authorities will allow the sub-households to report. The reporting location is the police station in the district or the place where rice purchase certificates are issued in the district. Once it is found that it is true, the authorities will severely punish the private operator.

### Two Criminals Confess to Strangling a British Man

Walter Bloom, a British man who was in charge of the boiler room of the Yangshupu Road Power Plant, had been working in the factory for more than 19 years. He was 51 years old and lived at No. 349 Grant Road. After his old wife died, he had no children. He lived alone in his twilight years. Unexpectedly, at 9:30 pm on the 23rd of last month, he was attacked in the dark and remote area of ​​Guiyang Road and Haizhou Road by two hooligans from Jiangbei, Lu Linggui and Liang Yuanxiang, who made a living by robbery.

### Baojia Offices Established in Nanshi and West Shanghai; Nanshi Is a Model Baojia District

After the Municipal Government Baojia Committee officially announced its establishment, the director of the committee, Mr. Jing, believed that the population in Nanshi and West Shanghai was large and complex. In addition to Nanshi District being designated as a model Baojia district, the Baojia compilation should be meticulous. The entire West Shanghai area should also be thoroughly rectified.

### Wu Ding Road Soup Kitchen - Soup Distribution Has Not Been Interrupted

Yesterday, we received a letter from the Social Welfare Bureau stating, "Regarding the Bureau's order to take over the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee, personnel were dispatched on March 1st to take over the case. The winter disaster relief soup kitchen operated by the committee at 220 Wu Ding Road was also taken over on that day, with Deng Fuchu in charge. Soup distribution is vital to the lives of the poor, so there has not been a single day of interruption before or after the takeover. The news in your newspaper on March 9th about the Wu Ding Road soup kitchen stating that it 'was suspended for several days' is slightly inaccurate. This is to inform you and request verification and correction."

### Manure Carts Arbitrarily Parked in Lanes - Strict Punishment Will Be Enforced - Designated Parking Areas Exist

The sanitation workers of the French Concession treat the Public Works Department's manure carts as their private property. After emptying the chamber pots in the morning, the sanitation workers simply take the manure carts back with them, parking them outside their doors like private cars. These large manure carts occupy a quarter of the lane's width, obstructing traffic. Pedestrians often collide with them at night. The stench is overwhelming during the day, and flies swarm in the summer, which is detrimental to hygiene. Now, the authorities, aware of this situation, believe that these sanitation workers are cunning and slippery. Because the authorities originally designated areas for centralized parking of manure carts, in the future, if this is discovered again, the manure cart number will be recorded, and strict punishment will be enforced.

### Supply of Major Goods in Central China - Specific Plans to be Developed - Comprehensive Price Controls Based on New Strategies

According to yesterday's report from a Shanghai-based reporter to authoritative sources, the authorities of both concessions, in order to thoroughly regulate prices and ensure adequate distribution of major goods, have achieved close cooperation with Chinese and Japanese authorities and have decided to formulate specific measures. The scope of these measures will cover the entire Central China region, but the initial focus will be on assisting production and managing consumption, so that production and consumption can be balanced.

Management Strategies

The authorities, in order to strictly supervise merchants' buying and selling and guide the market towards the right track, have decided to manage overall prices according to new strategies to address: (1) Retail merchants in various industries who violate regulations on selling prices, or change the grade of goods, sell inferior goods, or engage in any other misconduct; (2) Shops and firms that need to change selling prices due to cost factors can submit reasons to the authorities through their industry association and request a price change; otherwise, it will be considered illegal.

Buyer and Seller Guidelines

Wholesale and retail merchants of major commodities must join their respective trade associations as members in accordance with regulations. Non-members of trade associations may not engage in the buying and selling of these commodities in any way. However, wholesalers of these commodities must report the quantity of goods sold, the quantity in stock, the storage location, and the cost price to the trade association on a regular basis. The trade association will then report this information to the relevant authorities for their reference. Those who refuse to comply or underreport or overreport will be prosecuted in accordance with the law.

Penalties for Violations

The authorities' penalty measures for shops that violate regulations are extremely strict. Once a violation is discovered and verified, penalties will be imposed in accordance with regulations without leniency. If the violation involves (1) raising prices, falsely claiming to be out of stock, refusing to sell, or changing the grade of goods with the intention to deceive, in addition to revoking the business license, a fine of between 500 and 5,000 yuan will be imposed; (2) If prices are not marked, or secret codes are used, a fine of between 300 and 3,000 yuan will be imposed.

### Trade Associations Will Be Banned if They Are Not Approved

The central government has long had laws and regulations regarding the organization of trade associations. Recently, many industries in this city have organized associations without prior approval, which is inconsistent with central government regulations. It is now heard that the Municipal Economic Bureau, in order to effectively rectify the situation, will strictly ban the above-mentioned illegal associations in accordance with central government regulations, starting immediately.

### Shanghai Industry and Commerce Investigation Institute Begins Work

The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Investigation Institute, jointly organized by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Manufacturers Association, is headed by Tian Heqing from the industrial sector. The investigation personnel are appointed by the two associations. According to the institute, the investigation work was originally scheduled to begin on the 8th of this month, but has been postponed to this week due to procedural reasons. The scope of the investigation will initially focus on aspects such as the control of various new companies.

### Municipal Government Publishes Compilation of Laws and Regulations

The municipal government has hundreds of various laws and regulations. The compilation section of the fifth department of the municipal government has completed the collection and compilation of these laws and regulations and has had them printed and published in two volumes, bound in Western style, which are exquisite and beautiful. The content is comprehensive and can be used for reference. If needed, they can be obtained at a price.

### "World Games" Film - Screening at Domei Theater Begins Yesterday

The 11th World Games, held in Berlin in 1936, was an unprecedented event. The participation of the Chinese team aroused the special interest of the Chinese people. At that time, a German film company produced a film of the Games, but after it was transported to Shanghai, it was banned by the concession authorities.

### Baojia Youth Corps Camped Out Yesterday - Labor Service Begins Today - Grand Parade of 2,000 Members - Assisting with Traffic and Strictly Enforcing No Spitting Every Sunday

The Public Concession Baojia Youth Corps, in order to strengthen the bond between members and improve work efficiency, convened more than 1,500 members at the Racecourse last night at 7:30 PM for a large-scale camping exercise.

### Shanghai Open Basketball League Group B - Shan Team vs. Lian Qing Championship Finals - Tonight at 8:30 PM at Zhong Qing

In the Shanghai Open Basketball League, Xingren won the Group A championship. The Group B championship preliminary round was held at the Zhong Qing Gymnasium last night. In the first game, Shan Team, the Group B first division champion, played against Shenma, the Group B second division champion. The former had defeated the once-famous French police team and had strong strength. Shenma also had many brave and skilled players, so the game was quite tense. In the first half, Shan Team narrowly won with a score of 8-5. After the break, the competition became even more fierce.

### A Complete Picture of French Indochina

- By A Vietnamese

(I) Overview of Vietnamese Geography

Vietnam, also known as Annam, is called "Indochina" by Europeans and Americans. It is located in the eastern part of the Indochina Peninsula, between 8 degrees 30 minutes and 23 degrees 20 minutes north latitude, and 100 degrees and 109 degrees 30 minutes east longitude. It borders China's Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces to the north, the Gulf of Tonkin and the South China Sea to the east and southeast, and Myanmar and Thailand to the west. Its area is 737,000 square kilometers, which is 1.3 times the size of France itself, twice the size of Japan's Honshu, and seven times the size of China's Zhejiang Province.

Within Vietnam, the Annam Mountains run diagonally, which is the remaining range of China's Yunling Mountains. There are two large plains in the north and south. The northern one is the Red River Delta, called the Tonkin Plain; the southern one is the Mekong River Delta, called the Cochinchina Plain. Both are very fertile and constitute Vietnam's beautiful agricultural country. The Red River and the Mekong River are the largest rivers, both originating in China. The Red River is the Yuan River, also known as the Fuliang River, flowing from Yunnan to the southeast into Vietnam and emptying into the Gulf of Tonkin. The Mekong River is the Lancang River, flowing from Yunnan to the south, passing through Myanmar and Thailand, entering Vietnam, and emptying into the South China Sea.

Vietnam's coastline is mostly straight. The east faces the South China Sea, and the southwest and the Malay Peninsula enclose the Gulf of Siam. The northeast and China's Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula enclose the Gulf of Tonkin. Important ports include: one is Fanglan Bay on the southeast coast, which was controlled by Japan for landing before the Pacific War; two is Saigon, which has long been the base of the French Far East Fleet and is also a major commercial port, ranking first in Vietnam in commerce and being the capital of Indochina; three is Tourane, also known as Hoi An, south of Hue, the old capital of Vietnam, also a famous good port; and four is Haiphong, a good port along the Gulf of Tonkin, but it has always been more famous as a commercial port.

The climate is warm and rainy because it is located in the tropics, creating excellent conditions for agricultural development. However, the northern highlands are cooler in winter, just like the southern parts of Guangxi and Yunnan in China. The year can be divided into dry and wet seasons. The wet season is from April to October, and the dry season is from November to March of the following year. However, monsoons often cause dangerous irregularities in rainfall. Many rivers expand strongly during the monsoon rain season, becoming powerful sources of irrigation and hydroelectric power.

Except for the high mountain areas, it is a fertile breeding ground for tropical plants. The mountains and plains are covered with strange forests, including very valuable trees. But large areas are unhealthy swampy jungles prone to epidemics.

Hanoi is the capital of French Vietnam and the capital of Tonkin Province. The French-appointed governor-general is stationed here, governing the entire territory. The urban area is on the right bank of the Red River and is the center of railways and highways. Trade is quite prosperous. Especially after the July 7th Incident, before the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was cut off, its prosperity was envied. Other famous large cities include Haiphong, Saigon, Cholon, Hue, and Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, also known as Jinbiancheng.

Vietnam's population is not large. According to a 1936 survey, it was more than 23 million people, that is, 31.1 people per square kilometer. The distribution of the population is listed in the table below:

(Based on Yoshitaka Wada's "New Knowledge of Western Oceans")

The trend of population development can be seen in the table below:

(Based on the 1943 Allied Press "Where is the World Going?")

Among the residents of Vietnam, the majority are Annamese, belonging to the Mongolian race. Because they have been influenced by Chinese culture for a long time, their customs are also the same. There are also many mixed-race people of Han Chinese and Annamese descent. Due to this situation, when we arrive in Vietnam, it is still the same as in our own country. Although the various major cities already have European-style constructions by the French, they still retain the streets that the Chinese have painstakingly managed, and the various industries of industry, commerce, agriculture, and mining. The clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the Annamese people are indistinguishable from those of our overseas Chinese. The ethnic distribution of the population in Vietnam is shown in the following table.

(Based on the 1936 National Census)

Race Population (in thousands) (%)

Annamese 16,679 72.4

Cambodian 1,925 8.4

Thai 1,375 6.0

Indonesian 1,017 4.4

Other natives 659 2.9

Total indigenous peoples 22,655 98.4

Chinese (Rice) 326 1.4

French 39 0.2

Other foreigners 10 -

Total 23,030 100

(Rice) The variability of overseas Chinese is extremely large, and the increase was particularly large between 1937 and 1940. It is estimated to be over 800,000, but it has decreased sharply since the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was cut off. Mixed-race people of overseas Chinese and indigenous people are not included.

### New Perspectives on the Price Problem

Recently, the prices of daily necessities and essential goods have been rising, almost at a thousand miles a day. This is a serious problem that cannot be ignored for a moment. How to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods? How to break the evils of hoarding and relieve the suffering of consumers? These are all urgent tasks on the road to building the economy of Central China.

Regarding price countermeasures, the various organs of the National Government, the Public Works Department, and the Japanese side are all working separately, racking their brains to find solutions. The people also regard it as a serious problem and are unanimously cooperating with the authorities to promote measures to suppress prices. Although they are working hard in this way, all prices are still rising sharply and are unstoppable. Ordinary means cannot stop the rise in prices of various goods. The most severe measures must be taken to solve the problem.

The fundamental reason for the high price of goods lies in the buying and hoarding of speculators. At the same time, the stagnation of production and the scarcity of various products, the problem of currency is only one of the reasons that stimulate buying and hoarding, but it cannot be said to be the direct cause of rising prices. There is no shortage of hoarding of various commodities in Central China. To give an example, look at cotton yarn and cotton cloth. The inventory in Central China is enough for four or five years of use. Even if production is stagnant, it will not affect the needs of the people. However, speculators are searching for and hoarding goods on the market and are unwilling to sell them, so people feel that production is stagnant and affects prices. Many people discuss price policies, but they often ignore this situation, focusing only on small problems and not seeking thorough solutions. Increasing production, implementing official prices, and cracking down on speculation are, of course, important issues, but these measures are all temporary solutions rather than fundamental ones. Now we should go a step further and consider fundamental solutions.

Rather than cracking down on speculation, it is better to find ways to make speculation impossible. Rather than implementing official prices, it is better to guide prices to automatically fall to official prices. This is the important thing. And the fundamental policies of cracking down on speculation and implementing official prices still exist. As long as we are willing to put in the effort to study, it is not difficult to discover the direction. For example, issuing commodity lottery tickets, buying up hoarded commodities, and selling these goods on the market at any time to absorb excess purchasing power, or transporting these goods to the interior to exchange for raw materials, or using this as a basis to establish a buying group responsible for adjusting materials and prices, this is an effective method. The problem of materials and prices now is quite serious. Clearly recognizing this problem and planning appropriate measures, we deeply feel is a major responsibility that officials and the people should bear. We earnestly appeal again to the Chinese and Japanese authorities, do not use temporary solutions, but must use fundamental and thorough policies.

Economic Commentary

### Private Economics and Public Economics of Banks

Banks are company organizations. According to Article 1 of the Company Law, a company is a group established for the purpose of profit, so there is no doubt that banks are established for the purpose of profit. At the beginning of its organization, how should the establishment procedure be, how should the personnel be arranged, how should the internal equipment be, and how should the accounting system be, all of which are the most important considerations for the person in charge. After its establishment, how to attract deposits, how to operate loans, and how to handle investments are even more important for the person in charge. The purpose is nothing more than how to make a profit? How can I be responsible to the shareholders? Entrusted to operate with the shareholders' capital, in order to be worthy of the shareholders, the more profit, the better, this is the so-called private economics of banks.

However, banks are quasi-public utilities and should take social welfare as a prerequisite. A bank with very high profits may not be beneficial to society. For example, speculation and hoarding may be very profitable for a while, but society has been harmed invisibly. The development of beneficial industries may be slow in the short term, but the long-term benefits are very substantial. When society prospers, banks also develop accordingly, this is the so-called public economics of banks.

A bank that only cares about private economics and ignores public economics may have prosperous business for a while on the surface, but the future is unpredictable. If all banks, within the constraints of national law, can take care of both private economics and public economics, and obtain legitimate benefits from the development of public economics, then the foundation is solid, the effect is great, and the development of the bank itself goes without saying. Therefore, banks should respect the public interest of society and obey national policies. The so-called enriching the country and benefiting the people is the bank's bounden duty. How can it only take the interests of shareholders as its sole goal and one-sided mission.

### New Regulations for Loan Consolidation and Restrictions by the Central Reserve Bank

(Nanjing, 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch) The Central Reserve Bank, in order to stabilize finance and suppress rising commodity prices, has established regulations for consolidating and restricting various types of loans.

Hereafter, no new loans for these items shall be made. (3) Hereafter, those requesting mortgage loans from this bank with goods as collateral shall be limited to members of the relevant trade association who have obtained certification from the association and hold a business license issued by the local competent authority. Non-members are naturally not considered legitimate merchants in that industry and should be refused. The loan officers of this bank must investigate the assets, credit, and business operations of each applicant for a mortgage loan in advance. The maximum limit for the above mortgage loans shall be submitted to the head office for approval in advance before processing. (4) The valuation of collateral for mortgage loans or re-mortgage loans shall be based on official prices and not black market prices. (5) The term of mortgage loans and re-mortgage loans shall be a maximum of three full months. After maturity, the principle is to recover the entire amount.

(6) The interest rates on mortgage loans and re-mortgage loans shall be determined separately based on the actual local market and call money market conditions. (7) The storage of goods for mortgage loans and re-mortgage loans must be in this bank's warehouse or a designated warehouse, unless otherwise stipulated in a contract or under special circumstances. They must not be stored in the borrower's own shops or warehouses. (8) Insurance for goods for mortgage loans and re-mortgage loans shall be limited to coverage by the Central Trust Company and shall not be invested casually by the borrower. It is also heard that detailed regulations have been established for calculating the standard limits for loans to various industries.

### Publication of New Loan Measures for the Banking Industry - All Doubts of the City's Economic Circles Resolved -

Since the financial authorities promulgated loan restriction measures and issued this instruction to the banking community in this city, the general public has speculated a great deal on this issue. Rumors have spread, even suggesting that restrictions on withdrawals would affect people's confidence, which is no small matter. In fact, these rumors are completely unfounded. According to inquiries by this newspaper, the Shanghai Banking Association resolved and passed new loan measures for the banking industry the day before yesterday. Therefore, we are eager to disclose the most definite content as follows, in order to dispel the doubts of the public. The new loan measures for the banking industry are divided into two categories: new loans and old loans. Under the new loan category, there are four clauses: one for borrowers, two for collateral, three for loan terms, and four for credit loans. All restrictions are both strict and reasonable. Due to the creation of these new measures, both lenders and borrowers, even in the environment of loan restrictions, will not suffer the pain of throwing out the baby with the bathwater, and unfounded rumors in the market will also be eliminated. - Editor

### The Issue of Trust Companies Concurrently Operating Lending Business

— Qi

Yesterday, newspapers carried news that the authorities were cracking down on trust companies concurrently operating lending businesses, stating: "In order to suppress commodity prices, the authorities have repeatedly ordered banks and money shops to recall all loans that do not contribute to production, thereby tightening the money supply in the market, preventing speculators from mobilizing funds, and no longer harming the market. A reporter from Commercial News recently learned that several large trust companies in this port also have banking departments established, engaging in lending business to various merchants. This type of operation clearly goes beyond the normal scope of trust company business and must be cracked down upon. Therefore, in addition to strictly ordering these companies to earnestly comply with the 'Regulations for the Management of Financial Institutions' promulgated by the government, each company is also required to voluntarily abolish its banking department business from today and recover the loans already issued as soon as possible."

The authorities are cracking down on improper lending and suppressing commodity prices, and their efforts are deeply admirable. However, this matter relates to the question of whether trust companies can concurrently operate lending business, which has considerable research value in practice and in law, and I would like to discuss it.

First, in terms of the relationship between trust companies and banks, currently, banks concurrently operate trust businesses by establishing trust departments, and trust companies concurrently operate banking businesses by establishing banking departments. The former is permitted by the Banking Law, and the latter is stipulated by the Provisional Regulations for Trust Companies. The licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance to trust companies are also banking business licenses. Therefore, in practice, there is not much difference between banks and trust companies. Because China's trust industry is still in its infancy, the concurrent operation of both is precisely to support the development of the trust industry. As for the convenience in business, it is also one of the reasons. Japan originally separated banking and trust operations. According to recent information from China, the Japanese government's cabinet passed the "Ordinary Bank Concurrent Business Law" on November 24 last year, allowing ordinary banks to concurrently operate savings banks and trust companies. If so, the Japanese system is also changing from separation to concurrent operation. Because the relationship between the business of banks and trust companies is actually too close, the advantages of concurrent operation are self-evident. This is in terms of practical situations. The concurrent operation of deposit and loan business by trust companies is a recognized fact in various countries and there is a genuine need for it.

Of course, facts cannot go beyond the law. The previous section mentioned that the concurrent operation of both is permitted by the banking and trust company regulations. According to Article 12 of the newly promulgated Provisional Regulations for Trust Companies in China: "Trust companies may, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, concurrently operate the following ancillary businesses: (1) Accepting deposits, (2) Handling loans, (3) Discounting bills, (4) Remittance or foreign exchange, (5) Trading in securities and real estate, (6) Warehousing." These are all clearly banking businesses, and handling loans is especially explicitly stipulated. The establishment of current trust companies has been registered and licensed by both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, and their organizational and business regulations have been approved by both ministries. Their business reports are submitted to the financial regulatory authorities for verification on a regular basis and are also under the leadership of the Central Reserve Bank. Whether their operations have a legal basis and whether they exceed the scope are all clearly known by the authorities, and there is no difference from banks.

Based on the above, the concurrent operation of deposit and loan banking businesses by trust companies has a legal basis and should not be regarded as illegal business. However, what we must examine is whether there are any cases where trust company loans are being exploited by speculators. But this problem is not unique to trust companies. Recently, the authorities have strictly established principles for bank lending, prohibiting speculation, and trust companies should absolutely comply with these. This is the first thing that trust companies should examine themselves.

In addition, no fewer than thirty or forty new trust companies have been established in recent years. Are all of them formally registered trust companies? If there are unregistered companies operating under the name of trust companies and engaging in other businesses, or even concurrently operating lending businesses, this is naturally not permitted by law. This situation may also be unavoidable. This is the second thing that trust companies should strive to rectify among their peers.

The news of the crackdown on trust companies concurrently operating lending businesses published in the newspapers this time may be referring to the above two situations. It is not known for sure. That is, (1) if trust companies have made loans in violation of various laws, regulations, and orders promulgated by the authorities, they should be cracked down upon. (2) If there are unregistered trust companies, they shall absolutely not be allowed to engage in banking business. Regarding the first point, the several large formal trust companies here are subject to government supervision at all times and should not have any illegal activities. However, the attention of the authorities to this is solely for the welfare of society, and their attention is to the lending of the entire banking industry, not just trust companies. Regarding the second point, unregistered companies using the name of trust companies hinder the credibility of the entire trust industry. Cracking down on them is, of course, welcomed by the trust industry and the entire financial industry.

Therefore, if the news of the authorities' proposed crackdown is accurate, it may be limited to the above two situations. It is not known for sure. In short, this issue has a significant impact on the business of trust companies and the concurrent operation of trust businesses by banks. Therefore, this examination is provided for the reference of all sectors.

### A Perspective on Today's Insurance Industry

— Lu Shenbao

In the past two years, the insurance business has progressed rapidly. The number of newly established companies is as numerous as bamboo shoots after rain. People in society often talk about it, and there are many records and discussions in books and newspapers. However, most of them are written by economists based on academic theories or statistics. As for those who are engaged in the industry and make comments based on the actual situation, there are relatively few. I am not talented, so I would like to briefly write about my observations over the years, based on the recent development and business improvement of the insurance industry, investment direction, and claims settlement situation. Although it is a limited view, it is all a narrative of facts.

The Causes and Effects of the Sudden Development of the Insurance Industry

There are three far-reaching reasons for the sudden development of the insurance industry in recent years: first, the differentiation of insurance practitioners themselves; second, the decline of foreign insurance companies and the search for a way out by their employees; and third, the reckless actions of blind speculation and investment.

The differentiation of insurance practitioners and leaders is actually the main cause of this deformed development. According to the Chinese insurance companies in the past, Taiping and China were the leaders in the industry, with no less than a thousand employees. Over the years, those in charge often had the problem of difficult allocation of affairs and positions. Therefore, those with strength or foresight who knew that foreign companies would inevitably decline competed for the plan to be strong. Datong created first, and Danan followed. Since then, there have been many new companies that have sprouted from the Taiping China atom. Commentators believe that the establishment of these companies at that time had not yet deviated from the right track of insurance.

When foreign insurance companies declined, most of their Chinese personnel lost their support. These personnel had previously created a considerable position in the insurance industry due to the power of foreign companies, but their business methods were not approved by some Chinese companies. They would not take low positions, and they were not tolerated in high positions. Therefore, in a situation where they were unwilling to bow their heads and no one would ask for advice, the organization of new companies began. At the same time, some blind investors and speculators helped their prestige, thinking that insurance companies did not need capital at all. Even if there was capital, it could be used for other purposes. For example, with a capital of 5 million yuan, 2 million yuan could be used to concurrently operate a bank, and the rest could be used to concurrently operate dozens of businesses such as cloth factories, match factories, and stock brokerages. Then, the bank would absorb deposits, mutually inject funds, and support each other. The future development was unlimited. Therefore, they mutually induced each other, and insurance practitioners persuaded and used each other more widely. Since then, new companies have been established almost every day, creating an unprecedented grand situation.

With so many companies, business became rampant. There were as many assistant managers and deputy managers as crucian carp crossing the river. They only knew how to attract more business and offer excessive discounts. Policyholders also insured because of the relationship of directors or shareholders, only for the sake of friendship. Each did not know what insurance was at all. Brokers disregarded the insured's interests and the company's losses. The more business, the better the face, the more commission, and they went to all lengths to be humble and generous. They regarded the policyholders as the brokers' property, allowing them to be taken from Company A to Company B, and then reinsured to Company C. The insurance that policyholders entrusted their families to was used to this point. It is sad to say. The knowledgeable worry about it.

Recent Business Improvements

In this autumn of insurance industry boom, uniting for survival is a natural trend. Companies whose insured amount exceeds their self-retention limit must cede it to other companies for underwriting. This is a natural example of risk sharing. If any company has difficulty with reinsurance and does not limit its self-retention limit, it is a great risk to the company itself and the policyholders, and a great hindrance to the reputation of the entire Chinese industry and social stability. A certain Chinese insurance company more than ten years ago could not reinsure due to the random setting of insured prices, so it was all self-insured. As a result, the Hangzhou fire created an unprecedented opportunity for foreign companies. Therefore, reinsurance is a crucial plan for the company's own safety. For the sake of their own interests, Chinese companies have recently established Taiping Reinsurance Group and Shanghai Reinsurance Group in addition to the original Chinese Joint Reinsurance. Each has more than 20 large and small companies. The establishment of these groups can make the insurance business tend to a standard, and it is also a success of the insurance industry leaders' design, and its remedy for the current chaotic situation is no small matter.

The insurance price at that time was not based on any claim statistics, (it was impossible in fact), but only based on the regulations of the foreign company association at that time. After that, the Chinese company association revised and revised it, and the discount item was also based on the discount of reinsurance with foreign companies as the minimum limit. Therefore, if there is an insurance company that does not handle reinsurance, it can increase or decrease it according to the degree of risk estimated by the company itself for the insured house. However, since there is reinsurance, it is inevitable to follow the minimum discount of reinsurance as the minimum limit. Therefore, the company must reinsure, and because of reinsurance, it must maintain the insured price and discount. Reinsurance groups (joint reinsurance by several companies) are equivalent to manufacturers, insurance companies, wholesalers, and retailers, and brokers are equivalent to retailers. The retail price cannot be lower than the wholesale price, and the wholesale price cannot be lower than the factory price. Therefore, today's policyholders should know the reason for the difference in insurance price discounts.

However, under this situation, in order to compete for business, each company has to depreciate the price or even issue orders according to the reinsurance discount, (there is no expense for this method) which is also the last policy of commercial promotion, or the policy of maintaining the face and position of the company's salaried personnel. In this way, the company's expenses have to rely on other income, one is the contribution of the surplus of joining the reinsurance group, and the other is the income under the self-insured limit and the income from the use of funds. However, the group's surplus is distributed according to the capital and business of the entire group, and the income is very small, and the self-insured limit must not be too large, so the income is not much. Therefore, the small ones rely entirely on the use of funds. As mentioned above, it is difficult for insurance companies to rely on premium income to contribute, because in addition to the reinsurance premium, a certain percentage of the claim preparation fund under the self-insured item must also be proposed. Therefore, small companies with monthly premium income of less than 100,000 yuan cannot actually maintain expenses.

Considerations for Investment

Since the company has little hope for premium surplus, it has to rely on the use of funds. The insurance industry is closely related to the safety of the entire society. Therefore, the country has certain restrictions and supervision on the use of its funds. If it is allowed to engage in improper speculation or investment, the investor will lose the nature of investment, and once an accident occurs, there is a danger of insufficient compensation. Those who hold the position have to plan for the sake of protecting assets, which is also created by the actual environment. There is no room for denial, but in terms of law and reason, the use of insurance company funds should have certain restrictions.

Talk about Claims

Insurance is to protect against danger. In the event of an accident, the claim issue of today's insurance companies should also be discussed by those who care about the current situation of the insurance industry.

According to the most prosperous era of foreign companies in the past, the company's claims must be estimated by foreign public notary firms. At that time, the companies stationed in China were all agents, and their foreign head office only adopted the report of the notary firm. Therefore, the authority of the notary firm was extremely large, and the brokers all obeyed and feared it would not arrive. In the past, policyholders who had contacted the notary firm due to accidents could all tell it. Since the rise of Chinese companies, in order to avoid direct conflicts between the company and the policyholders, it is inevitable to use public notary firms. These public notary firms operated by Chinese people have learned from the criticisms of foreign notaries in the past. Therefore, most of them can follow the right path, but the right to compensation is actually in the hands of the company. Therefore, the impact is that there are those who should not be compensated and are compensated, and those who add abuse for the sake of publicity. They disregard the company's losses and the industry's regulations, and only please the brokers and policyholders, and publish thank-you advertisements in newspapers.

Fire insurance claims are not like gambling. However, the calculation method is very complicated, and it is all in line with the law and reason. Therefore, public notary personnel who handle claims, in addition to being honest and fair, must be well-versed in law and reason, understand human relationships, and be familiar with local market conditions, and then distinguish their true from false and make detailed estimates. The report must not only use estimated figures as the end, but must report in detail, measure the situation point by point according to law, and add judgment to make the policyholders see it and be sincerely convinced. This is closely related to the notary's credibility and the company's position. Today, whether the public notary personnel meet the above conditions will not be discussed. However, some companies actually regard claims as an advertising technique, and public notary firms are also established one after another. (At present, because strict examinations and registrations have not been implemented, it is impossible to distinguish their qualifications.) For the sake of business, they have to follow the company's orders. Often, the public notary firm first offers an estimated figure with no theory, and then the three parties add compensation. Even more, the company first negotiates a figure with the policyholders based on friendship, and then the public notary firm fills out a report. In short, some authorities adopt the method of compensating more and compensating quickly. If this continues, the competition will be more intense and the situation will get worse. The cunning will use their fraud, and the honest will start their doubts. It is not a blessing for the future of the insurance industry.

Conclusion

The development of each business depends on the unity of the industry. Since insurance is a social undertaking, in addition to the country's laws and regulations that must be strictly enforced, the power of the association is insufficient. It can only rely on the authority of reinsurance to use its reinsurance power for the entire adjustment. Regarding the insurance rate discount and the counter-claims, there must be an overall pace, which will be beneficial to social welfare and industry reputation. The author believes that the current is indeed a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity for the Chinese insurance industry to lay a permanent foundation. The time is not coming again, and it is rising with the tide. The author roughly describes it for those outside the industry who regard insurance as a gold-digging movement and follow the crowd, as a reference. It also serves as a needle for policyholders who insure to protect against danger, and as a review for shareholders who invest in the insurance business.

Special Edition for the Father of the Nation's Death Anniversary and Afforestation Movement

### The Ministry of Industry's Reforestation Efforts Over the Past Year

— Mei Siping

Last year, when I participated in the Arbor Day ceremony commemorating the death of the Father of the Nation, I raised several practical issues regarding reforestation to draw the attention of the nation. Now, another year has passed, and the holding of this year's Arbor Day ceremony inevitably reminds me of the practical issues I raised last year. What were those issues? They were the promotion of privately owned forests, forest protection, and the simultaneous implementation of forestry and land reclamation. If these issues cannot be resolved, then the annual Arbor Day ceremony will likely remain a mere formality, without any practical benefit. It must be understood that the Arbor Day ceremony is a commemorative ritual for the reforestation movement. The majority of the practical work must be carried out diligently by the agencies responsible for forestry. Therefore, to resolve these issues, it requires not only temporary attention during the Arbor Day period but also constant and sustained efforts.

As the head of the Ministry of Industry, forestry construction is naturally an important undertaking within my responsibilities. We must understand that construction is not just theoretical exploration but focuses on the implementation of work. Naturally, after noticing these practical issues last year, I began to implement them step by step. However, due to the short period, the progress has not been significant. This will, of course, require continued and sustained effort. Now, taking advantage of the reforestation movement, I will provide a brief report on the important work related to these issues over the past year. I also hope that all forestry agencies and people across the country will rise up, pay close attention, and work together diligently.

(1) Promoting Privately Owned Forests: The promotion of privately owned forests depends on the supply of seedlings, so the first step is to establish nurseries. In October of the thirty-first year of the Republic, seven nurseries were established one after another, and a general outline for seed collection and seedling cultivation was drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and active implementation. At the same time, the seedlings cultivated by the various forest farms totaled 1.8 million, of which 400,000 could be allocated free of charge to the people for voluntary reforestation, in addition to supplying their own reforestation needs. Therefore, when the planting season arrived, all requests from the people for seedling distribution were met as much as possible. In total, up to now, seedlings have been distributed, including 57,000 black pine and Chinese arborvitae seedlings distributed by the Nanjing Municipal Government to the people of various townships and villages in Yanziji; 2,000 Chinese arborvitae seedlings distributed by the Eastern Zhejiang Administrative Office; 20,000 Chinese arborvitae, locust, and Chinese sweetgum seedlings distributed by the Jiashan County Government of Anhui; 3,500 white poplar, black pine, Chinese arborvitae, and Mongolian oak seedlings distributed by the Liutai County Government; 10,000 Masson pine, Chinese arborvitae, and Chinese sweetgum seedlings distributed by the Chunhua Forestry and Land Reclamation Demonstration Farm and the Changshu Agricultural Improvement Zone; and 50,000 black pine and Chinese arborvitae seedlings distributed to other institutions such as the Central Military Training Corps, the Second Guard Division, the Agricultural College of the National Central University, the China Youth Labor Corps, and the Buddhist Children's Home. Furthermore, the Forestry and Land Reclamation Bureau dispatched technical personnel to provide guidance and assistance in planting. In addition, a large number of seedlings were supplied by the Ministry for the spring replanting of the Beijige scenic forest in Beijing, and personnel were also dispatched to assist the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee in designing the planting. As for the large number of seedlings cultivated by the Ministry, it is estimated that approximately 27 million seedlings will be ready for planting from various nurseries in the thirty-third year of the Republic, which can be used to promote reforestation by the public on 70,000 mu. By the thirty-fourth year of the Republic, the number of seedlings ready for planting each year will reach 40 million, which can be used for reforestation by the public on 100,000 mu. Although the numbers are small, it is hoped that continued and sustained efforts will enable both private and state-owned forest farms to advance simultaneously. I believe that significant results can be achieved within ten years.

(2) Forest Protection: The only essential task after reforestation is protection. In the past, the responsibility for forest protection was mostly borne by forest police, but they failed to establish direct relationships with the people, resulting in little or no effect. Now, to achieve thorough effectiveness, the public must participate in the protection work themselves. Therefore, when we formulated the Forest Protection Regulations, we used the organization of forest protection corps to effectively protect forests. These regulations were promulgated and implemented by the National Government in August of last year. The method for the forest protection corps is to first delineate forest protection zones around the forests, with residents within the forest protection zones organized into forest protection corps according to the baojia system. All men and women over the age of ten can be members of the forest protection corps, and all members have obligations to fulfill and also enjoy corresponding rights. The obligations are: (1) Prohibiting the felling of trees and the plucking of fruits; (2) Preventing and fighting forest fires; (3) Preventing and controlling diseases and pests; (4) Monitoring and prohibiting firewood gathering, branch trimming, hunting, and grazing; (5) Assisting in reforestation. The rights are to enjoy firewood gathering, branch trimming, hunting, and grazing, and to have priority in reclaiming suitable wasteland within the forests, in accordance with the methods, periods, and sections announced publicly. This forest protection corps organization establishes a direct relationship between the forests and the nearby residents, urging the public to protect the forests themselves. It can also promote the public's interest in reforestation. The Ministry's original forestry and land reclamation demonstration farms No. 1, No. 9, No. 11, and No. 12 have all been established and are actively promoting implementation. In the future, we must continue to strive for universality, so that all forest areas in the country have forest protection corps organizations.

(3) Simultaneous Implementation of Forestry and Land Reclamation: Reforestation and land reclamation are closely related, and the periods for land reclamation and reforestation work also differ in sequence. In terms of human resource utilization, they can be mutually adjusted. Moreover, reforestation is a long-term undertaking, while land reclamation yields harvests annually. Therefore, economically, it can also be used to contribute. Therefore, last year, the Ministry first established the Forestry and Land Reclamation Bureau and then gradually merged and reorganized the past forest farms and land reclamation demonstration farms, establishing twelve forestry and land reclamation demonstration farms, so that the two demonstration matters of forestry and land reclamation are handled within one farm. This was organized and established on November 1st of last year. On one hand, cultivating fields and planting forests, and on the other hand, reclaiming land and increasing production, utilizing barren mountains and wastelands suitable for forestry and land reclamation for cultivation and planting, combined with demonstration. Since its implementation, it has taken on a rough form. In the future, it should be continually urged to proceed, in order to receive greater results.

In summary, over the past year, the three practical issues have been addressed with some progress, but they have not yet reached perfection. In the future, we should continue to work hard, building on the work of the past year and gradually expanding. At the same time, we hope to expand from the central government to the local governments, so that the reforestation effort can be popular throughout the country. This is not only the responsibility of one individual but also depends on the concerted efforts of all those who care about reforestation to work together to achieve success.

### Public Awareness of the Reforestation Movement

— Yuan Yuqian

We must understand that reforestation is a construction project for the general public and is by no means the responsibility of any one sector of the public. The government's implementation of the reforestation movement aims to promote a thorough understanding of the benefits of reforestation among the public and to encourage everyone to work hard on reforestation. This task of reforestation can turn useless barren mountains into useful ones, provide employment for the unemployed, and turn them into employed people. This is a major undertaking of productive construction. Increased production can save the declining people and revitalize the weak nation. Its relationship is so important that the people of the whole country should unite and expand the reforestation movement for the construction of the people's livelihood.

We must also understand that the reforestation movement is not only for the welfare of the country and the people in the future but is also a current method of saving the country and the people. This kind of movement not only saves people but is indeed self-help. It is greatly beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, because it originates from the government's advocacy, the general public often mistakenly believes that it is a government matter, and not only does not earnestly promote it, but also does not have the concept of cherishing the trees that have already been planted by the public, and even damages them, resulting in very little effect after many years of reforestation. Up to now, barren mountains are still visible everywhere. The national economy has no way to be enriched, and the people's livelihood is therefore becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore, the country and the people are as poor and weak as before. It must be understood that the people's destruction of trees directly damages public property, but indirectly promotes the people's distress and the country's demise, no different from harming one's own life. Now that we are constantly calling for the survival of the country and the nation, we should unite and implement and expand this reforestation movement to increase productive construction and strengthen the strength of the country and the nation in order to achieve the goal of survival. We must also understand that the reforestation movement is not only beneficial to the general public but can also meet the needs of the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors of the public and provide special benefits. For example, farmers engaged in reforestation can make appropriate use of land that is not suitable for cultivation, allowing the whole family to have work to do. As a result of production, it is enough to supply the needs of one's own family for firewood and timber: at large, it can also obtain permanent income to relieve famine and drought disasters. Workers engaged in reforestation can increase timber production, supply raw materials needed for industry, and not only do not have the risk of unemployment themselves, but their families also get income from forest by-products. Merchants engaged in reforestation can turn the smallest expense into a huge value of forest, as insurance savings, and once they encounter an economic panic, they can still maintain their business without defeat with the safe savings of forest capital. Others, such as soldiers, can engage in reforestation, which can enhance their own professional skills, develop an interest in engaging in productive work, and avoid losing their livelihood after being discharged from the army. Students and general intellectuals engaged in reforestation, in addition to gaining interest in labor and developing diligent habits, are also unknowingly refined by the natural beauty of the forest because of their love for their own planted trees, thereby enhancing their lively spirit and cultivating noble virtues. Therefore, if people from all walks of life want to seek their own special benefits and permanent happiness, they should unite and implement and expand this reforestation movement with the greatest benefits and the most macroscopic effects.

### The Guiding Principles for Developing Chinese Forestry

— Shao Zhongxiang

Today is the 18th anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation, and it is also the beginning of this year's reforestation movement. The National Government scheduled the reforestation movement to be held on the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation, and its significance is very profound, because the purpose of this movement is to promote reforestation, realize the Father of the Nation's industrial plan, and build a large-scale national forest to prevent floods and droughts, relieve farmers, and develop industry and commerce. The connotation is so important that the government and the people should encourage each other to work hard to ensure the success of forestry construction with the main purpose of seeking truth from facts.

Speaking of developing Chinese forestry, we should proceed from the following guiding principles:

(1) Vigorously Implement Forestry Protection: Protecting forests is more difficult than creating forests. This statement has been generally recognized by modern foresters. Therefore, protecting forests is more necessary than creating forests, especially urgently. Although the barren mountains and wilds do not have artificial tree planting, they can often be nurtured into beautiful forests by the power of nature due to careful protection. Those that have been formally afforested artificially can also gradually turn into barren mountains and wilds due to inadequate protection. This kind of fact can be seen everywhere as long as we pay attention to observation. Therefore, in order to rapidly develop national forestry, the most important work from now on is to pay attention to the problem of forest protection. All mountains, fields, and forest lands, whether naturally grown or artificially planted, should be strictly protected to enable them to grow into good timber. As for the performance evaluation of public and private industry farms, do not pay attention to the number of tree seedlings they plant, but pay special attention to the results of their protection of mature timber forests.

(2) Implement Reforestation with Forests: The implementation of any construction undertaking must have sufficient funds in order to develop as much as possible. Forestry is also a kind of construction undertaking, and naturally cannot escape this common principle. However, in terms of China's current economic strength, in order to prevent forestry development from being restricted by the economy, unless we implement the policy of reforestation with forests, it will not be possible to succeed.

China has a vast territory, and its climate and soil are unique. In all the high mountains and ridges with sparse population in the country, there are still many natural forests. According to expert surveys, in the north, such as Hebei, Henan and other provinces; in the central part, such as Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei and other provinces; in the south, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian and other provinces. The forest area exceeds 700 million mu, which is more than three times the forest area of Germany, the most developed country in forestry. These large forests are now unutilized due to traffic congestion, and the benefits are abandoned on the ground. If we can apply scientific methods to cultivate them, protect them, develop them, and utilize them, so as to achieve the effect of making the best use of the land and making the best use of things, then the national economy will naturally be sufficient, and it can be used to build other forests or develop other forestry projects, and naturally can avoid the difficulty of funding.

(3) Popularize Forestry Knowledge: The rise and fall of a country's forestry depends on the popularity of forestry knowledge. Because forestry construction must have a considerable understanding of forestry by the majority of the people, because understanding can generate interest, and with interest, they will accumulate efforts in forest protection and management. The Father of the Nation paid special attention to the construction of psychology in the initial stage of material construction, and the intention was like this. China's forestry has been abandoned for a long time, and the people's forestry knowledge is very immature. For example, many farmers do not know about seedling cultivation. Therefore, from now on, we should follow the government's regulations on the purpose of the reforestation movement and make more efforts in promoting forestry knowledge in order to achieve popularity.

(4) Support the Development of Private Forests: "Speaking of the problem of planting forests throughout the country, it is still easier to succeed if the state manages it," this is what the Father of the Nation once showed us, and we must naturally respectfully follow it. However, in modern China, if we want to collect all the barren mountains in the country that are suitable for reforestation, whether large or small, and build forests solely by the government's power, it will be difficult to do it thoroughly, and it will not be possible to do it in the short term. Therefore, in addition to those related to public safety and national defense, as well as other large barren mountains or special areas, which are divided into state-owned forest areas, in the small pieces and small blocks of mountain farms in a considerable area, we must work hard to support the development of private forestry. Because the purpose of the state's management of forestry is to seek welfare for the people, if the people can manage forestry that is beneficial to themselves and beneficial to the entire country under considerable conditions, the government will naturally support and assist them in carrying out it.

What I have said above is just a brief mention of the guiding principles that should be adopted for developing Chinese forestry. As for how to plan and proceed, we should determine the plan at any time and place, referring to the situation.

To go a step further, forestry is a continuous production undertaking, and in order to ensure the success of national forestry construction, the people of the whole country must have continuous efforts. It is hoped that people in the forestry industry throughout the country can always work down-to-earth, and it is hoped that people outside the forestry industry can always give practical assistance to the utmost, so that the Father of the Nation's policy of building a large-scale national forest can be realized in the shortest time, which is the greatest purpose of holding the reforestation movement today.

### The Benefits of Reforestation

— Ministry of Industry's Forestry and Land Reclamation Bureau

Speaking of "reforestation," people in our country's cities regard it as an undertaking of the government and do not know how to value it. People in the countryside are even more at a loss, only knowing that planting trees is a casual matter that does not matter. It can be said that eight out of ten people do not pay attention to reforestation, and they do not know that it has a very close relationship with the country, society, and people. This is all because they cannot thoroughly understand the benefits of reforestation. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity of the capital's reforestation movement, we will introduce the direct and indirect benefits of reforestation to everyone.

(1) Direct Benefits:

(1) Producing Timber Timber is the main and largest product of forests, and it is also something that we need every day. Think about the houses and beds we live in, the bridges and vehicles we travel on, the materials for agricultural tools used in farming, the textile equipment and all the utensils in our homes, which one is not made of timber, which one can be without timber, that is, the equipment used in the mining industry, industry, and other various undertakings, although not necessarily exclusively timber, but timber is indeed an important part.

(2) Supplying By-products In addition to producing timber, forests also have incidental production, such as resin, tung oil, pine oil, camphor, and paint materials. Cork, etc., are sometimes mainly used for producing these kinds of products for reforestation, such as lacquer forests and camphor forests in Fujian, tung oil forests in Zhejiang, etc. It can be seen that these kinds of by-products are very much needed in society.

(3) Developing Capital Forest capital includes growing trees and the land on which trees grow. All land in the world that cannot grow crops can be used to grow trees. If it is used as much as possible to plant trees, then the area occupied by forest land, the capital invested, and the labor used will be very large. Although this kind of investment cannot be recovered immediately, it is a long-term asset.

(4) Accommodating Labor My country's forest land is larger than any other country, so the work of reforestation, felling, transportation, sawing boards, and allocating materials will naturally accommodate a great deal of labor. In addition, incidental undertakings, such as timber transportation agencies and by-product manufacturing agencies, require even more labor than reforestation and felling. Germany is the most developed country in forestry in the world, and 12% of its population depends on forests for their livelihood. If my country's forestry is developed, there is no need to worry about surplus labor.

(5) Improving Soil Quality Trees need relatively little fertilization, and barren land can also grow trees. For example, leguminous plants such as Burmese albizia and acacia not only do not consume nutrients in the soil, but also absorb nitrogen from the air, making it an important fertilizer in the soil. Therefore, reforestation of barren land also has the effect of improving soil quality. Even if other seedlings cannot absorb nitrogen as fertilizer, the branches and leaves that fall after they wither remain on the ground and become fertilizer once they are腐化. Soil can be changed from barren to fertile. Barren land exists in all provinces of our country, especially in the northwest border provinces, where there are more barren areas. Now the government is vigorously advocating reforestation and reclaiming wasteland. If we can engage in reforestation according to the climate and soil quality of each place, first seek to improve the soil quality, and then plant crops after the soil quality is improved, it may not be the way to production.

(2) Indirect Benefits:

(1) Increasing Rainfall Forests have the effect of lowering temperatures and evaporating moisture, so places with forests are more humid than places without forests, and when moist air passes through forests, it immediately causes moisture to condense into rain when it encounters the relatively low and humid air flowing out of the forest land, and fall to the ground, so places with forests often have more rainfall than places without forests.

(2) Preventing Natural Disasters Forests can prevent wind disasters by using the strong trunks and broad crowns of forests to resist wind and reduce the mechanical action of disasters: therefore, countries use forests as natural barriers in places near the sea or near smoke damage. Places with forests can also prevent drastic changes in surface temperature and hinder the rapid rise of air currents. With these two kinds of power, it can reduce the area of hail and reduce hail damage.

(3) Eliminating Floods and Droughts Forests can reduce floods and droughts because forests have the effect of conserving water sources. First, the crowns of forests can prevent the drying and evaporation of water in the land. Second, the fallen leaves, mosses, and roots of forests can prevent the outflow of water. According to actual verification, the evaporation of forest land is only half that of bare land. As for the outflow of water from forests, foresters in various countries have detailed investigations, which can reach 76%, so that this water can flow down slowly, so that it will not wash away sediment and silt up the riverbed, causing floods.

(4) Benefiting Hygiene People in mountain forests have longer average life spans than people in cities, which is a fact that we all recognize. Although there are many reasons for this, the main one is that the air contains the oxygen necessary for our lives. It is because of the physiological respiration of trees that they can eliminate the carbon dioxide in the air, which is harmful to humans, and release the best oxygen for our needs. Therefore, the closer to the forest, the more oxygen there is, and the farther away from the forest, the less oxygen there is. Also, because the air in forest areas is often kept clean, pathogens are not easy to reproduce and are not easy to spread. Also, drinking water is often a major medium for transmitting diseases. The spring water in mountain forests is much cleaner than the drinking water in cities without forest areas. Therefore, it is no doubt that the air in forest areas has more oxygen and is cleaner, and the spring water is clean, which is beneficial to hygiene.

(5) Embellishing the Scenery Scenery is something that we humans cannot forget. However, scenery cannot be established without the embellishment of forests. Because in addition to increasing the fun, the lush and beautiful scenery and majestic posture of forests can make people's spirits refreshed and their ambitions noble everywhere. Therefore, in the East and West countries, whether in cities or villages, there are places where trees are planted next to roads and houses to increase their beauty. There are also specially planted forests to provide people with recreation, and the intention is very profound.
