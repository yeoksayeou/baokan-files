### Practical Ways to Live a Wartime Life for Citizens

The prolongation of the international war and the increasingly fierce reality of the war are already obvious trends. In order to complete the war objectives and build a new order, the Axis countries all recognize this serious reality and trend. They are eager to gather all the strength of the country and provide it to the government and the war. Under this important significance, all citizens are controlled by a sense of responsibility and obligation to the country, the nation, and the war, and no longer care about personal life and enjoyment. With the development of the war situation, anyone who wants to win in the final decisive battle must restrain personal life to a greater extent and shift all its strength to meet the needs of the war. The more arduous and frugal their private lives are, the more prosperous their country will be and the stronger their combat power will be. Therefore, they themselves feel that they have fulfilled their responsibilities to the country and the nation, and they have infinite joy and glory.

Since our China joined the war, we have already received the benefits of participating in the war, such as the acceptance of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. However, how much responsibility have we fulfilled for the war? Of course, this is the task of the government and has nothing to do with the general public. There are not few people who say this. However, observing from the reality of society, the lives of the general public do not have any wartime scene. Even if we do not talk about the obligation to the war, only considering the future of the country and the nation, we cannot help but worry. Try reading the article "Essentials of Wartime National Life" by Japanese doctors Takada and Toda (see today's newspaper). What will we think?

The essence of wartime life is to reduce the enjoyment of the individual lives of the people to increase the strength of the nation, enhance combat strength, strive for victory, and protect the future life and enjoyment of the people. Therefore, the main thing in wartime life is thrift. We have repeatedly raised this issue to society, and the Municipal News Federation has held a special thrift promotion week to awaken the attention of the people. Now, no matter what, it is time to move from words to deeds.

The wartime life we are talking about, the thrift we are talking about, is nothing more than starting from the aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation in the daily life of the people. We demand that on the one hand, we guarantee the minimum living standards of the general public, and on the other hand, we control the excessive waste of a few people. In order to guarantee the minimum living standards, the food rationing system should be made more universal and improved, increasing the number and quantity of rice flour allocated to households. Moreover, it must be done as far as possible without delay, and never reducing the quantity or quality. In order to control waste, it is necessary to seriously prohibit all improper entertainment and restrict all non-productive businesses. We want to reiterate that if the people are not given the guarantee of a minimum living standard, then the degree of understanding and support of the people for the government and national policies will not be deep and enthusiastic! Then, any thrift movement will inevitably fail.

The current fact is that the lives of most people are generally very difficult. It is unbearable to say that they should be thrifty again. However, at the same time, there is also a generation of profiteers who speculate and hoard goods in society. They are not small in number. They are the real culprits who undermine the arduous life of the people in wartime. The phenomena in society that violate wartime life are all caused by them. All the injustice and unrest in society, as well as the crisis in the national economy, are also brewed by their influence. For example, in terms of diet, as Mr. Toda pointed out in Japan, in the coastal areas of Ehime and Kochi prefectures in Japan, only sweet potatoes and sardines from the sea are produced in the deep valleys of the mountains, but the residents there are very strong and are the first source of soldiers in Japan. On the contrary, citizens in Tokyo and other food-loving cities are mostly unhealthy. It can be seen that eating delicacies every day does not help the body. From this, saving extravagance is beneficial to both the country and oneself. In addition, such as clothing, housing, and transportation, in fact, the rural people have always been accustomed to simplicity and simplicity, and they are very strong and powerful. The urban people are just the opposite. The higher the enjoyment, the more their physique declines. This is the general rule of natural evolution.

Today, we hope that those in power will set an example to be a model for the general public, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Welfare Association, the Industry and Commerce Association, the Bankers' Association, and other powerful civil groups in this city should immediately jointly promote all sectors of society to practice thrift. At the same time, on the active side, we also hope to implement a more practical population evacuation in large cities such as Shanghai. All those who do not need to stay in large cities, all those who are rural children, should be advised and assisted to return to farming. On the other hand, the local authorities should provide assistance in land, seeds, etc., and the financial sector should promote genuine agricultural loans. In this way, on the one hand, it can reduce the urban economic crisis, and on the other hand, it can revive the countryside and increase production. The practice of the wartime life of the people can have greater results. It has practical significance for the country, the nation, and the cooperation with friendly countries. We hope that all sectors will jointly study and cooperate to promote its realization.

Ambassador's Eulogy

Your Excellency Chairman: This ambassador, by order of the head of state of my country, is stationed in your esteemed country. It is a great honor to present the Letter of Credence in the name of the specially appointed and fully empowered ambassador of Greater Germany. Since the National Government of the Republic of China joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, determined to jointly resist Bolshevism, and then declared war on the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the United States of America, the Republic of China has also joined the Three-Power Pact countries in the same war. The purpose and the result we want to obtain is only a complete victory over the enemy, so as to complete the new order between the nations we have created, and to make the original friendship between China and Germany closer. This ambassador takes the promotion of friendly relations as the most important task. I dare to ask your Excellency Chairman and the government of your country to continue to assist the previous ambassador and give him assistance. This ambassador hereby sincerely wishes your Excellency Chairman good health and prosperity to your country.

Chairman's Reply

Your Excellency Ambassador: Your Excellency Ambassador, by order of His Excellency Head of State Hitler of your country, is stationed in the Republic of China and presented the Letter of Credence as the specially appointed and fully empowered ambassador of Greater Germany. I am deeply honored to accept it. Under the leadership of His Excellency Head of State Hitler, your country is fighting for justice and peace, giving our common enemy the greatest blow. I express my infinite respect for the bravery and perseverance of your country's soldiers. After the Republic of China joined the Anti-Comintern Pact on November 25, 30, it resolutely declared war on British and American imperialism on January 9, 32, which is a firm expression of cooperation to subdue our enemies. All of our comrades in arms have the same purpose and belief, that is, to defeat the common enemy, so as to complete the new order between the nations, so that the final common victory must be successful. The friendly relations between our two countries have always been close. Your Excellency Former Ambassador Stamer and Minister Guo De have made great contributions to the promotion of the original friendly relations between you and me, and have successfully completed the glorious mission. I am convinced that Your Excellency Ambassador will make the relations between you and me closer. I and the government of this country will wholeheartedly assist you with the convenience required for the duties of Your Excellency Ambassador, so that the noble mission of Your Excellency Ambassador can be completed. I respectfully ask Your Excellency Ambassador to convey my regards to His Excellency Head of State Hitler, and wish your country prosperity.

Foreign Minister Chu's speech

Your Excellency Ambassador: Your Excellency Ambassador, by order of His Excellency Head of State Hitler of your country, is the specially appointed and fully empowered ambassador to the Republic of China. This morning, you met with Chairman and presented your credentials. I am here on behalf of the government of this country to hold a banquet to show our welcome, and especially to take this opportunity to introduce the heads of the ministries and committees of the National Government and my colleagues to meet with you. I am very happy to be here. Your country is an advanced country in Europe, and its science and civilization are admired by the world. Since your head of state has been in power, he has built up the army, reformed politics, and restored the glory of the past. The European war has broken out and has lasted for four years. During this period, your country has endured hardship, persevered, and bravely fought for peace and justice, giving a great blow to our common enemy. I express my sincere admiration and respect. After the National Government established its capital, your country gladly recognized the government of this country and repeatedly sent Ambassador Stamer to station in this country. Ambassador Stamer was outstanding in his talent and knowledge. In the past, he worked hard on the anti-communist front and made great contributions to the success of the Three-Power Alliance. The cornerstone of world peace was thus established. When he was transferred to Tokyo, he was succeeded by Minister Guo De, who fulfilled his duties and completed his glorious mission during his tenure. Now that Your Excellency is coming to China and taking the post of Ambassador to China, you have gone through many hardships on the way. I am convinced that with Your Excellency's profound knowledge and rich experience, you will have more opportunities to promote the inherent harmony and friendship between our two countries after taking office. Now that this country is in the midst of an austerity movement, I apologize for the inadequate treatment of Your Excellency. I also ask for your forgiveness. As for all the conveniences required for Your Excellency's duties, I will certainly give my assistance so that Your Excellency can complete your lofty mission. I hereby raise my glass to wish His Excellency the Head of State of your country good health and prosperity to your country.

Ambassador Wei's reply

Your Excellency Minister: I would like to express my sincere gratitude for your kind words of welcome. Today, I am honored to present to Your Excellency Chairman the Letter of Credence by which the head of state of my country specially appointed me as the specially appointed and fully empowered ambassador to the National Government of the Republic of China. And I and my colleagues at the embassy are very happy to be the guests of Your Excellency Minister today and to be at the same table with the heads of government. I greatly appreciate Your Excellency Minister's friendly words to my country and my head of state. The friendship between China and Germany has a long history. Our cultural relations have also been around for many years. The Chinese people particularly admire the culture that China has contributed to the world. Our economic relations have always promoted mutual benefits. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, the Republic of China has joined its allies and is fighting against imperialism, and is also connected with the Three-Power Pact countries and other friendly nations. What must be mentioned at this time is that the friendly relations between our two countries have become more intense because your country joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. All our will and actions are focused on one goal, that is, victory. I would like to express my gratitude to Your Excellency Minister for the friendly words to the former Ambassador Stamer and Minister Guo De. I will do my best to promote the relationship between us, so I am very happy that the government of my country has heard that the government of your country shares this view and that Your Excellency Minister is willing to provide assistance, so that this ambassador can achieve his mission. I hereby take the host's glass of wine to wish Your Excellency Chairman good health, prosperity to your country, and good health to Your Excellency Minister.

### Central Government Did Not Offer Condolences to Lin Sen

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) After hearing the news of Lin Sen's death, the central government discussed it. Lin was elected as a Central Supervisory Committee member in the 13th year of the Republic of China and as the Chairman of the National Government in the 20th year. At the beginning of the return to the capital in March of the 29th year, he was originally asked to come to Nanjing to take office, but he delayed and did not do so. Until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although Lin's position was irresponsible for international politics, he was ultimately suspected of being hostile. Therefore, it was decided not to offer condolences.

### Fierce Air Battle Occurred Over Munda, U.S. Military Faced Difficult Forest Warfare

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM this afternoon that the Imperial Navy fought 70 enemy fighter planes over Munda on August 4, shooting down 25 of them. Our side lost 4 planes.

Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) Due to the fierce fighting of the Japanese garrison on the Munda area of New Georgia Island, the US military's attempt to land has been delayed and has not been able to advance. The losses of people and materials are very significant. According to a telegram from New Jinshan, the anti-Axis military personnel in the Southwest Pacific told a group of Japanese reporters on the 3rd that the US military is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. Although the Japanese garrison has been fiercely attacked by the US Army, Navy, and Air Force on three sides, it has not shown any signs of decline. The Associated Press and the frontline correspondents of the Times also stated that the US military began its general offensive in the Munda area on July 25, but has made almost no progress in the past few days. The Japanese garrison is now stopping the US military from advancing and resisting to the death. Then, the report described the difficult forest warfare situation of the US military, saying that the difficulty of forest warfare is beyond the imagination of the US military.

### German Troops in Orel Strategically Withdrew, German Counteroffensive in Mius Gained Victory, 18,000 Soviet Troops Captured

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) According to Huitong News Agency, military circles said that the German army had withdrawn from Orel on the evening of August 4, but this was actually a predetermined plan of the German army, so it withdrew with preparation. Five days ago, the German army had destroyed the facilities in the area, and the German people also accompanied the German army to the west. However, the German army's withdrawal from Orel cannot be considered that the Soviet army has achieved its goal, because their army has completed its military requirements for the final heroic battle.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) Judging from the battle results that have been clarified in the German military operations on the Mius front, it can be said that they have been successful. According to the communiqué issued by the Führer's headquarters at noon on the 4th, the total number of Soviet troops captured is about 18,000, which is enough to prove the ferocity of the German counteroffensive. According to estimates by the German military authorities, the Soviet army has lost at least five or six sniper divisions. In order to restore the heavy damage suffered on the Mius front, the Soviet army also tried to counterattack on the Donets front on the 3rd. Six divisions of snipers and 60 tanks were dispatched from the Izium bridgehead to force an attack on the German position and broke into one location, but the German army stopped the Soviet advance after engaging in a bayonet fight. At the same time, the German army also launched a fierce counteroffensive, destroying 24 Soviet tanks. The Soviet offensive was completely unsuccessful at this point.

### Diplomatic Representatives of Various Countries Stationed in the Soviet Union Will Move Back to Moscow to Work

Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) According to New York News: The diplomats of various countries in Kuibyshev are scheduled to return to Moscow within days. Currently, some diplomats have gathered in Moscow. Due to the increasing importance of the Eastern Front and the need to obtain war reports quickly, diplomatic officials urgently need to return to Moscow. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is already in Moscow. It is believed that after the diplomats of various countries arrive in Moscow, they will increase their activities.

### Axis Troops Withdraw from Catania in Sicily, Britain and the United States Compete for Political Leadership, Headquarters Moved to Malta

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) This official recently announced that the Axis troops have withdrawn from Catania.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) German authorities today confirmed that the German army has withdrawn from Catania. The German army's strategy in the area has been one of the most successful military actions in the Sicilian campaign. It is said that the German army has long been prepared with a weak line of defense in the Catania area. The work of the German army stationed there is to fool the enemy so that they dare not take any action even though they have strong combat power. Therefore, the new line of defense behind Catania has been guarded by extremely strong troops. The anti-Axis forces must suffer another difficult war in that area.

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency) According to London News: Anti-Axis leaders in Sicily have disagreed over the leadership position on the island. The US attitude only allows Britain to assume military tasks on the island, while the administrative power in the occupied area must be taken over by the US. It is said that Eisenhower has severely criticized the British separatist movement in Sicily.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) According to news from the North African Anti-Axis Headquarters, the Anti-Axis forces are attacking Sicily, with Malta as General Eisenhower's operational headquarters. Eisenhower and his staff went to Malta four days before the scheduled start of the offensive. In addition to Eisenhower, those in Malta include Admiral Cunningham, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, General Alexander, Commander of the Tenth Army Corps, Air Force Commander Tedder, and Lieutenant General Montgomery, Commander of the British Eighth Army.

### Important Meeting Called by Italian Government; Ambroso Appointed Chief of General Staff

Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Italian government will hold a meeting today to discuss important matters.

Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reported last night: King Victor Emmanuel III has appointed General Ambroso, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army, as Chief of the General Staff. Since Mussolini's resignation, all daily communiqués of the Italian Army have been signed by Ambroso. He has worked closely with the current Prime Minister, Marshal Badoglio, for seven years, especially during the Abyssinian War. Meanwhile, according to Stefani News Agency, Navy Minister Bertoletti and Air Force Minister Dari will be respectively appointed Chiefs of the Naval and Air Force General Staffs.

Confiscation of Property of Corrupt Officials

Weimar, 5th (Central News Agency) – Stefani News Agency reports: Italy has now established a special committee to investigate, based on reports from financial institutions, the increase in movable and immovable property of those who served as civil servants or participated in political activities between October 22, 1922, and July 24, 1943. Any property for which the source cannot be explained will be confiscated by the state. The chairman of the committee will be an official of the third rank or above, and the two members will be officials of the fourth rank or above. The committee may invite financial experts as consultants. Any transfer of property that should be confiscated after July 23, 1943, will be considered invalid.

The Roman Catholic Bishop Holds Another Meeting

Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to Vatican News Agency: Sixteen Roman Catholic bishops and Tadini, the secretary of the Foreign Church Affairs Committee, held a meeting yesterday. The Vatican’s Secretary of State, Mgr. Maglione, was also present. The meeting lasted for an hour and a half.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – Several Japanese military attachés and officers stationed in Berlin are currently visiting the Eastern Front.

Xindu Hotel, published on the 3rd in Xindu, is equipped with air conditioning and is open all day, cool and comfortable.

Xindu's service motto is "Young and New, Satisfying People": no wonder guests feel at home, and it is a "social center, government authority!" The Western food on the seventh floor is fully booked every day: at night, dine on Western food on the rooftop garden, with a cool breeze, looking up at the universe, truly enough to escape the mundane and relax your mind. As for the grape trellises on both sides, with flowers and trees separating the seats, it is even more suitable for intimate conversations.

### Key Points of Wartime National Life (1)

Dialogue between Dr. Takata Yasuma and Dr. Toda Masazo

The situation on the Southern Front is intensifying, and it will inevitably become more severe in the future. Our people should grit their teeth and strive for the final victory. Although we are actually living a frugal life, the general public believes that we have no choice but to endure everything because we are in wartime. There may be some who hold this most passive attitude. This attitude cannot be agreed with. Whether in war or peace, if the minimum standard of living cannot be achieved, the country will decline. If we want to expect the eternal prosperity of the nation, we must, as history has shown, absolutely practice a life of endurance. This proactive approach is the belief and virtue that the people should have. At that time, not only will the Greater East Asia War be won, but the Japanese nation will also achieve a permanently stable position. This frugal life can be said to be our people's obligation to the country, which is serving the country. Therefore, understanding the principles of a frugal life and the specific methods of implementing it is indeed a matter of urgency. Therefore, we specially requested Dr. Takata, Director of the National Institute for Ethnic Studies, and Dr. Toda, Professor of the Faculty of Medicine at Kyoto Imperial University, who has extensive knowledge in design, to discuss this issue so that the people can have a thorough understanding of it.

Wealthy People Without Offspring – The Minimum Standard of Living is the Foundation of National Prosperity

Takata: I have never intended to publish anything particularly rare or novel, but this requires a premise: should we focus on individual life or on the nation or ethnic group? Once this premise is resolved, we can act freely. The idea that individual life should be improved as much as possible has indeed dominated the minds of the general public for a long time. It is true that if we want to focus on individual life, we will fear not having enough prosperity and worry about not having enough care. We will also want to find ways to improve our interests and education as much as possible. This kind of desire is natural to human beings. However, from the perspective of the nation or ethnic group, this is absolutely impossible. Competing with the technologically advanced and wealthy United States and Britain, if we want to make the country independent and the nation develop, we must use all our strength. Therefore, we must suppress our individual enjoyment or improvement of life, and at the same time, we must find ways to increase the population. This is not only for the sake of the war in the past few years, but also necessary for the eternal prosperity of the nation. It is natural for culture to improve and life to become stable, but as a result, people lose their wildness from their lives, and competition and combat gradually increase the unfavorable situation. The biggest reason is probably the decrease in the population growth rate!

Toda: What you said has two major distinctions: physiological reasons and human reasons. From a physiological point of view, improving individual life means indulging in luxury, which leads to a preference for a wealthy life, and as a result, the population decreases, especially the inability to produce male offspring. The so-called wealthy families having no descendants has become a well-established principle. Why is this? Everyone knows that humans have not changed in any way from millions of years ago to today. So, how have people lived for these hundreds of thousands of years? It's very simple: the easiest thing to obtain on Earth was food. For example, in the south, people could cultivate grains, and in the north, they could cultivate wheat or potatoes for food and life. Furthermore, all animal resources, such as cattle, sheep, or fish, would naturally increase their production capacity as much as possible to proliferate their own species, but now when I look at luxurious or wealthy lives, it is completely the opposite of the lives of the past hundreds of thousands of years. People do not make any effort to obtain the natural things they desire. However, they work hard to obtain things that others have acquired to supply themselves, which requires a lot of effort. This kind of behavior of seizing others' resources is not the original life of human beings. The reason why human beings have survived to this day is due to a life that conforms to nature. Any life that contradicts nature will naturally be eliminated in this world. Takata:

According to European statistics, aristocratic family lines die out very quickly. From a long historical perspective, all the upper classes within a country naturally die out, and the lower classes come to fill this gap, creating a cycle. And in the relationship between cities and villages, countries and countries, and ethnic groups and ethnic groups, there seems to be this kind of cycle.

Toda: I am currently conducting an interesting experiment on this matter. Although it is not yet ready for publication, the general idea is this: raising chickens from a difficult period under completely equal conditions. Although the conditions are completely equal, there is one difference: one group of chickens is kept in a well-ventilated house, while the other group is kept in a house with no ventilation at all. Then, by investigating their developmental status, we know that the chickens in the well-ventilated area, if they are hens, can lay 250-300 eggs each, while the fertilization rate of the eggs laid by the hens in the non-ventilated house will be greatly reduced, regardless of how many roosters are mated with them. Keeping chicks in a non-ventilated state also weakens the reproductive power of their offspring.

Takata: That's right. This is a very interesting experiment. It can be seen that the old-fashioned way of raising daughters is absolutely unacceptable.

Toda: Yes, it is naturally unacceptable to go against nature. In terms of occupation, if farmers are willing to practice the frugal life that you advocate, they can have many children. During the Tokugawa era, the rural population increased greatly, but the total population at that time did not decrease much because at that time, families with too many people had the bad habit of infanticide. If there had been no infanticide, how prosperous would the rural population have been? However, during the Tokugawa era, the population of Edo (Tokyo) of one million did not increase at all. The so-called aristocratic families would completely die out after only three generations. There was a similar situation in the Osaka shipyard. They organized and classified the things that others cultivated and used them for their own lives. In other words, they lacked the original driving force for self-development. Originally, boys maintained this driving force, but because they did not need boys, they took away this driving force and nurtured it deep down, so they could not raise adults. Therefore, in cities or wealthy families, male offspring cannot be produced, and even if they are produced, they cannot be raised successfully. This is a natural phenomenon.

Consider Babylon or Rome, as well as today's London, Paris, New York, etc. Although the history of New York is short, the same situation can be seen, because this is the truth! (Source: Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)

### Greater Efficiency after Unification of Police Agencies; Watanabe, Supervisor, Delivers Speech Hoping Officers Will Perform Their Duties, Eliminating Past Differences Pending Government Decision

Watanabe Tadashi, the newly appointed Deputy Director of the First and Third Police Stations, spoke to reporters yesterday, saying that since the police force of the First and Eighth Districts under the Shanghai Special Municipal Government is now under the same management, all personnel of the medical bureau should do their best to serve in the future in order to achieve the highest possible efficiency.

Individual Treatment of Police Officers Remains Unchanged

Watanabe Tadashi, former Supervisor of the Shanghai Police Department, was appointed Deputy Director of the Third Police Station after the French Concession was recovered on July 30. On August 1, he was appointed Deputy Director of the First District (former International Settlement) Police Station. According to Watanabe, the individual treatment of police officers will not be changed, and salaries will be paid as before. Other benefits, such as allowances, bonuses, and pensions, will also be in accordance with customary practice.

Regarding the Elimination of Obstacles

According to Watanabe, the Baojia Self-Defense Corps will become a separate Baojia Office, just like the police station, and will directly contact the police authorities. When reporters asked about how to eliminate the obstacles between the former two concessions, Watanabe replied that this matter was not within his jurisdiction and must be decided by the military authorities.

The Scope of the First Police Station is Quite Broad

At the same time, Watanabe also said that the area of the First Police Station includes the former West Watanabe District (east of the railway), Zhabei, and part of the city center. The responsibilities are indeed very broad, but he said that he will definitely act in accordance with the expectations of the mayor.

### Broadcasting Speech by Director Ye Gongyong

The Municipal Propaganda Department held a long-term broadcast to celebrate the recovery of the concessions. Last night, it was undertaken by Ye Gongyong, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, entitled "Hopes for Citizens after the Recovery of Shanghai Concessions." Excerpts from the speech are as follows:

The Greater East Asia War is currently underway, and since Shanghai has recovered its concessions, administrative unification is naturally needed to adapt to the wartime system. We hope that after the recovery of the Shanghai Concessions, Shanghai will become a model area for Chinese politics. The citizens of Shanghai should sweep away the past concept of not having a nation, earnestly obey government orders, and promote national policies. Only then can China's recovery be successful. This is my first hope for the citizens of Shanghai.

Shanghai has always been the economic center of China. In the future, Shanghai should become the industrial center of China. Strict restrictions must be placed on all places of consumption and distorted prosperity in order to save resources. We must strive to assist and develop all productive undertakings. We hope that the citizens of Shanghai will strive to save consumption and increase production, and absolutely correct the erroneous concept of only seeking private gain and not serving the country. We hope that every citizen will earnestly abide by Chairman Wang Jingwei's instruction of "Contribute more, enjoy less" and serve the country wholeheartedly. This is my second hope for the citizens of Shanghai.

Shanghai has always been known as a cultural center, but since the war, social education has been constantly regressing, and cultural undertakings have been very depressed. We hope that after the recovery of the concessions, the government and the people will work together to eradicate the roots of evil and promote culture. We must ensure that Shanghai does not lose its beautiful reputation as a cultural center and becomes the center of cultural communication in East Asia. This is my third hope for the citizens of Shanghai.

### Municipal Police Headquarters Renamed Second Bureau

The Municipal Police Headquarters has recently received instructions from the Municipal Government that, in order to unify the names of all police stations in Shanghai after the recovery of the concessions, the First and Eighth District Police Stations will be renamed the First and Third Police Stations, and the Municipal Police Headquarters will be renamed the Second Police Station of the Shanghai Special Municipality. Lu Yingchan will continue to serve as the director of the bureau, while the police stations in Songjiang and Fengxian districts will still be under the jurisdiction of the Second Bureau.

### Uniforms of the Third Police Station

The Third Police Station of the Shanghai Special Municipality has made special regulations for the uniforms of the police, in order to achieve uniformity. Western police officers wear summer uniforms without jackets or ties (cork helmets) from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM. From 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM the next morning, they wear summer uniforms, including jackets, French-style military caps, belts, and batons. Russian police officers wear summer uniforms without jackets (cork helmets) from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM. From 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM the next morning, they wear summer uniforms, including jackets, military caps, belts, and firearms. Chinese police officers wear summer uniforms and oiled straw hats from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM. From 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM the next morning, they wear summer uniforms, military caps, belts, handguns, and batons. All police uniforms must be neat and clean.

### Shanghai District Procuratorate Prevents Abuse of Litigation in Criminal Cases

In order to effectively prevent the abuse of litigation in civil cases, the Shanghai District Procuratorate will require all criminal complaints to be accompanied by a document stamped by a lawyer before issuing receipts. When receiving criminal complaints, it should also first verify whether the end of the complaint has been signed and stamped by a lawyer, in order to prevent the abuse of litigation.

### The Second Phase of the Epidemic Prevention Campaign Actively Begins to Promote; The First District Office Stipulates Injection Sites to Promote Cleanliness Campaigns to Eliminate Sources of Disease

The second phase of epidemic prevention injections in this city has started from yesterday. All citizens who were injected before May 31 or have not been injected yet must request free injections from the health sub-offices in each district within the shortest period of time. The health departments of the first and eighth district offices will soon organize mobile injection teams to be stationed at various important road junctions to facilitate citizens to get injections nearby.

Injections in the Seventh District Have Also Begun

Expand the Promotion of Cleanliness Campaigns

At a time when the weather is hot, the Health Administration Bureau is now trying to expand the promotion of cleanliness campaigns to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The Baojia Self-Defense Corps members in each district should work closely with the authorities on cleanliness campaigns. All citizens are strictly prohibited from urinating everywhere, posting miscellaneous notices on walls, and accumulating stagnant water. Vendors selling unclean cold drinks are also strictly prohibited. If the self-defense corps members find that citizens in their jurisdiction are suffering from cholera, they should quickly report to the police station so that emergency measures can be taken.

### Jianghai Customs Implements Ship Quarantine

Yesterday, Feng Jie, General Manager of China Film, and Fuha Yositoshi, Director of the Research Institute, invited the press of this city to clarify the purpose of the establishment, the scope of work, the internal organization, and the future prospects of the institute. First, General Manager Feng reported on the purpose and hopes for the establishment of the film research institute. Then, the Director of the Institute, Fuha Yositoshi, reported on the organization and work scope of the institute. The institute is named the China Film Research Institute, with a research headquarters and departments of culture, technology, and chemistry, which will carry out research work in groups. In addition, there will be a film school, divided into undergraduate and short-term training courses, as well as laboratories, experimental machinery workshops, experimental theaters, experimental film production sites, a film library, and a film museum. In addition to the employees of various departments of China Film, the institute will also recruit experts from various departments of the Chinese and Japanese film, drama, and cultural circles as researchers. On the one hand, it will also actively train and cultivate specialized talents in various departments, in order to lay a solid foundation for the Chinese film industry.

### Commemorating Master Yinguang by Building a Stone Pagoda

Master Yinguang, the only master of the Pure Land Sect of Chinese Buddhism, passed away the year before last. His relics pagoda has not yet been built. The devout believers and disciples in Shanghai decided at a meeting the other day to build a stone pagoda and pagoda courtyard on Lingyan Mountain in Suzhou. Because construction materials are currently expensive, they are actively raising funds from believers in this city and other places, and have entrusted the Far East Bank at the intersection of Tianjin Road and Henan Road, the He Cheng Bank on Jiangxi Road, and the Jin Kang Bank on the Museum Road to collect donations on their behalf.

### Food Rations in the First and Eighth Districts are Arranged and Distributed by the Jointly Operated Cooperative; The Active Transportation of Grain will be Carried out in the Future, and the Quantity will be Subject to the Unified Distribution of the Food Department

Since the recovery of the two concessions, the former organs of the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council have been reformed one after another. However, whether the administrative system and working relationship of the Grain Jointly Operated Cooperative, which is responsible for the purchase of food for the two districts, have changed is of great concern to all parties. According to the person in charge of the cooperative, who spoke to a reporter from the Guofeng News Agency yesterday, there has been no change in the work of the cooperative after the recovery of the concessions. The system still belongs to the Grain Administration Bureau, and the rice purchased each month is still delivered to the First and Eighth District Offices for distribution as household rice. The transportation of food will be carried out actively in the future. A total of more than 20,000 bags were transported last month. The cooperative is acting on the orders of the Grain Administration Bureau and cannot predict how much will be transported each month. The purchase of rice in various places is based on the reports of the grain sub-bureaus in various places to the Ministry of Food, stating how much can be purchased in a certain place. Then, based on this number, the Ministry of Food makes a unified distribution. The quantity that this city and the First and Eighth Districts should receive is instructed by the Municipal Grain Bureau to the cooperative to send personnel to the designated locations to collect and transport the rice.

This Phase of Food Rations will be Released for Sale Soon

Datong News Agency reports that the Rice and Flour Allocation Office of the Resources Control Department has distributed the warehouse receipts to the rice shops today (5th), and the rice shops will universally release the 43rd phase of household rice within the next few days.

The Sixth Phase of Food Sugar is Released for Sale in West Shanghai

The Sixth Phase of household sugar was already sold out in the First and Eighth Districts at the end of last month. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the West Shanghai District only began to universally release the household sugar of this phase on the (4th). The sugar purchase certificates for each neighborhood were also distributed on the previous day. Each resident is allowed to purchase half a catty with the certificate, at a price of two yuan and thirty-five cents, with a separate packaging fee.

Household Flour in the Seventh District will be Universally Released for Sale Starting Today

The Municipal Grain Bureau has completed the allocation of the thirteenth phase of household flour in the Nanshi District. It is stipulated that one catty and ten taels of No. 1 flour, four taels of No. 2 flour, and two taels of No. 3 flour will be allocated. Bean flour will be temporarily exempted, totaling two catties. The selling price is thirteen yuan and sixty cents. Citizens of the district should purchase it with the thirteenth phase of flour certificate. It is scheduled to be universally released for sale throughout the district starting today (6th) and will end on the 14th. It will be invalid after the deadline.

### Cigarettes are Distributed after Removing the Outer Packaging, Eliminating Abuse in Distribution, and Thoroughly Eliminating the Black Market

After the Huazhong Tobacco Allocation Association implemented unified cigarette distribution, it formulated various regulations and dispatched goods on schedule to meet legitimate needs. Recently, in view of the increasingly rampant black market for cigarettes, which exceeded the official price by more than double, and the fact that general vendors and hoarders did not hesitate to pay high prices to purchase them, and even the distributors were involved in black market activities, this phenomenon violated the regulations. In order to thoroughly eliminate the black market and prevent transshipment and eliminate abuses, in addition to sending supervisors to supervise the operations of all wholesalers and retailers, it is stipulated that the empty packaging of all allocated cigarettes must be collected from today, and retailers are required to sell the cigarettes without the outer packaging. However, each person is still limited to one pack. At the same time, the police authorities are responsible for cracking down on peddlers who specialize in selling cigarettes on the black market on the streets.

### Shen Bao Scholarship Exam Papers Graded in Order of Priority, Approved Amounts for Each Level to Be Increased, Those with Poor Grades Still Difficult to Subsidize

The fifth Shen Bao Reader Scholarship exams for senior primary, junior high, and senior high school groups were held successively on the 1st and 2nd of this month. Current primary and secondary school teachers were hired by the Men and Women's Christian Association to grade the exam papers. The primary school group's exam papers have now been graded, and the overall performance is satisfactory. An investigation and review are currently underway. It is decided that starting from the 10th, results will be announced gradually and in order. The exam papers for the other junior high and senior high school levels will also be completed soon. As for the university and business groups, various procedures are being expedited in order to announce the approved list of names as early as possible.

Approved Amount to Be Appropriately Increased At the beginning of this year's scholarship program, due to the large number of applications and limited funds, the scholarship amount was small. However, with the enthusiastic support of various sectors of society, the scholarship funds have been increasing daily. However, with the sharp increase in tuition fees for various schools this semester, it is now planned to appropriately increase the amount based on the circumstances. It is still hoped that people from all walks of life will continue to donate generously in order to reduce the burden on impoverished students. However, those with poor grades and those whose families are not impoverished will still be rejected by this newspaper in accordance with the scholarship regulations.

Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday The scholarship funds received by this newspaper yesterday, with titles listed below: Shou Zhe Xiang (submitted by Universal Trust Bank) 2,500 yuan, Jin Xing Industrial Raw Material Company 2,000 yuan, Cao Jiexie 1,000 yuan, Youth Department of the Christian Youth Association Zhong Guang Si Qing Fellowship 530 yuan, Quan Liang and Hong Meiyu (Wang Hejun and Hejun He respectively) 100 yuan each, Shen Xinrong (to commemorate the 70th birthday of the late aunt Yu) 60 yuan, Tang He 20 yuan, totaling 6,310 yuan in reserve bonds, with a balance of 1,476,646 yuan.

### Red Swastika Society Increases Skills of Refugees, Opens Knitting and Sewing Courses, Continuously Accepting Over 800 Refugees

The World Red Swastika Society's Refugee Skills Training Center has successively taken in over 600 refugees. Currently, refugees are being continuously sent from various Wan Song centers. After inspection and elimination of over 70 people, the statistics for the most recent week show an increase of 195 people, totaling approximately 800 men. The Executive Committee of the Society has been earnestly planning small-scale handicrafts for the center in accordance with the training guidelines. Recently, 72 hand-operated knitting machines and 10 wooden yarn-shaking machines were specially transported there. Sheng Jun of Sheng Jia Weaving Company is in charge of the work, and five skilled technicians have been selected to live at the center and provide instruction. The raw materials for knitting are being negotiated with various yarn factories by the Executive Committee of the Society. In addition, the center has 15 tailors with both Chinese and Western skills. The Society has specially purchased four sewing machines and handed them over to the director to organize a garment department, soliciting business from all walks of life. At the same time, refugees with an interest in sewing are being selected and instructed to learn, in order to expand the business.

### Tax Exemption for Faculty and Staff of Universities and Colleges, Welfare Association Previously Submitted a Request, Ministry Approved Exemption for Months Prior to April

The Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association previously stated that the income of faculty and staff of universities and colleges was extremely meager, and they still had to pay salary income tax, making their lives even more difficult. Therefore, it submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education, requesting that they be granted the same treatment as primary school teachers and be exempt from income tax, in order to show the government's concern for and respect for teachers. A reply has recently been received from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education, stating: "The salary income tax reported for the months prior to April 1932 for faculty and staff of universities and colleges is tentatively approved for exemption. Starting from May 1932, it will still be collected at the prescribed rate in accordance with the Income Tax Regulations. However, taxes that have already been paid will not be refunded." It is also stated that the Income Tax Bureau has already instructed its subordinate collection bureaus in all districts to comply.

### Funeral Gifts for Self-Defense Guards Who Died in the Line of Duty

(Note) The funeral gifts sent by the colleagues of each Bao in the Second Joint Bao of the Old Gate District to the self-defense guard Guan, totaling 15,412 yuan in reserve bonds, could not be published with the names of the donors due to space constraints. Mr. Zhang Songtao, the head of the Joint Bao, has sent a letter requesting the return of the funds, and this newspaper has returned the funds in full. The amount has also been removed from the total balance. This is a special announcement.

In the first act miniature football match, Fang Rongdang will be the referee. Since its establishment, the San Sheng team has been invincible, with a seemingly miniature football hegemony. St. John's is a Western iron army, which dominated the Fourth Group C competition in the last competition. Wang Li will take the stage at 6:00 PM. After defeating the Western Union a few days ago, San Sheng has spare strength to fight the Righteous Naval Forces again today. Zhang Le will be the referee. In addition to inviting Zhang Lingen to participate in the San Sheng lineup, Wu Binghao, who has just returned to Shanghai from the South, will also assist, serving as the left wing, making the cooperation more seamless. It is said that the position of left wing in the Shanghai Chinese football world has always been a talent shortage. Sun Tie Leg is now recovering to his former peak state, and Ayou Liang is even more impeccable. Fei Chunhua has excellent speed. The five forwards are exceptionally well-matched. The central defender line of Song Qu has been cooperating for a long time, and their performance is even more magical. Wu Qixiang on the right, this public figure is an all-rounder and can often perform happily. Defender Li Tiansheng, who is not old in the competition, has seen him grow stronger in his old age. Zhang Lingen's right guard, with his broadsword, will definitely be able to repel the enemy thousands of miles away. In addition, the goalkeeper Liu Xianhan, his daily performances, his technology has reached the pinnacle. As for the Righteous Army, which has been dormant for a long time, this time they are righteously sending troops. The original generals Rossier, Maiqidi, Xilati, Xue Davila, and Dipanna are all as fierce as before, and the new generals K伦鲍,史蒂法诺,契格尼,潘格诺, etc., are also brave soldiers. Sijia Luodi, with the same style as Mainidi, has a higher level of saving skills. The overall strength of the team is strong. The competition between the three parties is worthy of being evenly matched. A thrilling and tense performance is inevitable. Tickets are 50 yuan and 20 yuan.

Economic Commentary

### Thoroughly Eliminate the Black Market

Universal consumer rationing is enough to block the path for merchants to seize illegal profits. It was already mentioned yesterday in the discussion on "Rationing Matches to Households." At the same time, this argument is also being made for the black market in cigarettes. Because if rationing is inadequate, or it is difficult to get rations and you can't get them, then a black market will arise; the black market for rice, sugar, salt, and oil can be extended to the black market for any kind of goods.

Taking the cigarette black market as an example, the Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association has also realized that what actual consumers are getting is not the limited-price cigarettes rationed in tobacco stores, but the high-priced cigarettes sold by Han peddlers in front of theaters and on the streets and alleys. These high-priced cigarettes are two or three times higher than the limited price. Is this the profit of the peddlers? Or the common interest of small shops? We don't know, but in short, actual consumers have increased their burden several times.

In order to thoroughly eliminate the black market, the association specially announced yesterday that "all rationed cigarette empty packs must be collected from today onwards." This is of course a standard approach to strictly curb the black market. I still remember in Hong Kong after December 8th of the year before last, everyone hoarded canned food, and the black market was rampant, so the authorities had to order shops to sell canned coffee and milk powder, they must open the can, sell canned fish, meat, vegetables and fruits, and the sign paper must be torn off, so that they cannot re-enter the black market. These are all the same in terms of thoroughly eliminating the black market.

### Interbank Lending by the Banking Association to Be Handled According to New Regulations

The Shanghai Banking Joint Preparation Committee settles once. After the committee reconciles interbank lending among various banks and firms, starting in August, each interbank lending amount will be handled according to new regulations. Interbank lending is limited to: Banks that are members of the Banking Association, Qianye United Preparation Bank re-lent to various firms, member banks of the Preparation Committee exchange banks and correspondent banks, and trust companies.

### Private Warehouses Begin Investigation Today

Since the Materials Investigation Committee appointed one investigator from the Japanese related authorities, a total of fifteen people, leading more than one hundred investigators, divided into thirty groups, began the investigation, more than two weeks have passed. Now the first step of investigating the public warehouses and promotion stations in the first and eighth districts, the materials stored are generally investigated and completed, and the continuation is being audited. Once the audit is completed, those belonging to hoarding behavior will be reported to the congress and punished according to law. It is now learned that the association will start today (the 6th), and the investigators will still be led by each investigator to investigate the materials hoarded in private warehouses. The selection of investigators for this time has been strictly screened, and they all hold proof documents when going out for investigation, and they have been strictly warned that the members are not allowed to have illegal investigation behaviors.

### The First District Will Thoroughly Investigate the Hoarding of Foreign Goods

After the formal establishment of the First District Office of the Concession Recovery, the district office authorities are now carefully studying countermeasures for all activities in the district. It is said that the district office authorities, in addition to continuing the policy of the former Shanghai Municipal Council in principle, strictly implementing commodity price limits, and cracking down on speculation and hoarding, the first step is to find out that the black market sales of foreign goods in the city in recent days, such as soap, candles, matches, cigarettes, paper, etc., are extremely rampant, and illegal merchants are searching for and hoarding a large number of goods, causing the prices of daily necessities to skyrocket day and night, almost doubling compared to a month ago, and poisoning the people's livelihood to a deep and huge extent. Therefore, the district office authorities have decided to immediately take the same measures as the former Shanghai Municipal Council to thoroughly investigate cotton yarn and cotton cloth, and to thoroughly investigate them. No matter whether a store or an individual has conclusive evidence of hoarding foreign goods, they will be severely punished, without exception.

The rice market in this city has been quite chaotic recently. The price of white rice on the black market is rising under the pull of hoarders. Yesterday, 3,000 to 4,000 packages of rice were transported to the rice market on Che Lun Er Road. Although the number was not small, and the transactions on this street were very small, the market price rose again under the absorption of new hoarders.

It is estimated that in another two weeks, the number of new Japonica rice transported to Shanghai will increase.

### Creating Our Path

— Sheng Quan

Life is inherently about walking: advancing, retreating, wandering, hesitating...

Mediocre people only seek a single type of path; a path to survive and enjoy from birth to death. Great people create great paths, allowing many to live peacefully and even propel the world forward. General Kemal created a path that granted freedom, equality, and happiness to the Turkish people. Father Sun Yat-sen created a path that freed the descendants of the Yellow Emperor from the shackles of imperial rule.

Originally, there were no so-called paths in the world. Paths are formed by people walking them. Therefore, paths are created by people.

Many people walk down dead ends and do not turn back, groaning and even being destroyed there. Many people embark on broad roads, but their will wavers, and they cannot endure fatigue and hardship, ultimately retreating.

Young people, look at the bloodstains of predecessors, your own scars, and learn from your own walking experiences. Then, with caution, courage, and solemn steps, set upon a bright and broad path. Although it will inevitably be difficult and arduous, create new paths or complete the unfinished paths of predecessors. And eliminate those dead ends to spare future generations from groaning and being destroyed there, because we no longer recognize them as paths!

Life is inherently about choosing a path, but let us not forget to choose the right path!

### Striving and Complacency

— Li Xiang

Generally, when a person, especially one of the scholar-official class, reaches a point where their living environment is dire, with no means of support, they know to be stimulated and encouraged. But when they are in a state of leisure and comfort, without worries, they become complacent and seek only temporary ease. This is truly a universal phenomenon, "It has been so since ancient times, and is even more so now."

We often see many wealthy sons and brothers relying on their ancestors' fortunes, not engaging in production, not pursuing proper occupations, indulging in extravagance and dissipation, and abandoning themselves. When they eventually exhaust their resources and fall into destitution, they may even become thieves, endangering social stability. These people, as described in Zheng Banqiao's poem, "Pitiful are the hungry and cold children on the road, who yesterday slept on silk cushions in magnificent halls," illustrates the fallen state of those wealthy sons and brothers, which is the result of "comfort leading to complacency."

Consider the ambitious individuals of ancient times, such as Che Yin, who used the light of fireflies to study, and Sun Jing, who tied his hair to the beam to encourage learning. Su Qin pricked his thigh with an awl; Bai Lixi and Guan Zhong, as well as the historical figures who rose from commoners to become princes and lords, none of them were not born in adversity and died in comfort. As the saying goes, "For ten years, no one asks about the scholar under the window; once he succeeds, the whole world knows." In an instant, they transformed into prominent figures, returning to their hometowns in glory, their heads held high. These individuals achieved this due to "poverty leading to striving."

The traces of past history are inherently the best lessons of reality. It must be known that "starting a business" is certainly difficult, but "maintaining the legacy" is not easy either. How many people in the world can escape the temptation of material enjoyment? "Striving" and "complacency," which path to take, depends entirely on each individual's rational choice.

### Fortune-Telling and Divination

— Shou

People often resort to fortune-telling and divination when they are indecisive. This is not necessarily done only by those who are ignorant. Even those who have received a considerable education, once they pass the age of forty, many unconsciously become somewhat fascinated by astrology. "Is there any harm in fortune-telling and face-reading?" This is their explanation for consulting fortune-tellers.

Perhaps some might think, "No matter what, fortune-tellers must have some ability, right?" But heaven knows, nine out of ten fortune-tellers are blind fools. Someone with eyes who can see the realities of society instead seeks guidance from a groping blind man – it's truly the most absurd thing in the world! What are their abilities? Fortune-tellers with eyes have eyes that can discern appearances and hands that can write vague predictions; blind fortune-tellers have ears that listen carefully to what you say and mouths that are good at deceiving. To put it bluntly, they are just big swindlers.

However, in the eyes of some who are obsessed with astrology, the words of fortune-tellers are golden advice, and their predictions are "compass needles guiding the way." If one or two sentences about the past or future happen to be correct, it is considered the divine skill of the fortune-teller. If they are incorrect, it's just their own bad luck. When they undertake a task, instead of exerting effort to do it, they wait for their "luck" to arrive. In the end, they achieve nothing and still shake their heads and sigh, saying it's fate!

Those who are obsessed, wake up! The person who can control your life is yourself! If you want to achieve something in this difficult era, you must firm your own will, work hard, and remember that you are the master of your own destiny.

### Please Pay Attention to the Serious Problem of Housing Hoarding

— Fang Zhi

Currently, the authorities are being quite strict in investigating hoarding, which is truly a blessing for the new citizens of Shanghai. However, some speculators are using their imagination and gathering huge amounts of capital to engage in planned hoarding and trading of houses. They either collect several years' rent in advance or threaten tenants to move out, then repeatedly rent out the properties to seek profit. The housing hoarding and trading on Rue Luber is a prominent example. The houses in 　　Fang, numbering hundreds, were originally the property of the French company "Construction & Real Estate." Recently, the company sold them for over 22 million yuan to a large housing hoarding group, "　　Company," which then sold the houses individually, ranging from over 400,000 to 500,000 or 600,000 yuan each. The company sent letters to the residents of the neighborhood, demanding that they sign contracts within three days, pay a 30% deposit on the spot, another 20% later, and the remaining 50% in two months, with interest calculated according to market rates. Failure to comply would result in the cancellation of the deal. 　　Company can make a profit of over one million yuan in one transaction, which is extremely illegal.

Now that the two concessions have just been taken over, the people are eagerly hoping that the authorities will demonstrate their new policies and cultivate the people's faith in politics. How can we tolerate these lawless profiteers doing whatever they want? It not only affects the security of wartime rear areas but also threatens the housing burden of residents in this city. If this trend is allowed to continue, those with ulterior motives will surely follow suit and intensify the problem, which would be disastrous. It is deeply believed that the municipal government, while focusing on ensuring food for the people, should also pay attention to the "housing" issue within the principles of people's livelihood. Strong measures should be taken against such profit-seeking groups engaged in housing hoarding.

### A Visit to the International Charitable Organization: The Salesian Society (Part 1) - A Relief Organization for Suffering Children - A Training Institute for Building Talent

The most famous industrial area in Shanghai, Yangshupu, the most tranquil cultural area, Guohuo Road in Nanshi, and the pastoral Nanhsiang and Jiangwan, are home to the cultural and charitable endeavors of the Salesian Society, founded by Italians. As the word "Italy" is being widely discussed, it would be particularly meaningful to visit and introduce the undertakings founded in China by these Italians to our fellow countrymen.

A Great Man of the Nineteenth Century - Bosco

Father O'Mié, who currently oversees some of the Salesian Society's work in Shanghai, spoke enthusiastically about their endeavors, first emphasizing the remarkable history of Saint John Bosco, the founder of the Salesian Society of the Catholic Church. This Saint Bosco has stories and biographies circulating internationally, full of interest and wisdom. Un Grande Italiano by the famous Italian author Ruffino Uguccioni is being eagerly translated by various countries, and the Chinese version, "A Great Man of the Nineteenth Century," published by St. Louis Industrial School in Hong Kong, vividly depicts the life of this Saint Bosco, who "used poverty to save the poor." He was born in 1815 in a humble cottage in Becchi, near Turin. At the age of two, he lost his father and was raised by his widowed mother, who was only twenty-seven years old. Due to poverty and the good guidance of his compassionate mother, he was very intelligent from a young age and hoped to improve the lives of poor children. Lacking enough food and clothing himself, he naturally couldn't afford to study. He had to learn some skills from traveling performers. At a young age, he left home with tears in his eyes to make a living. Because he was quick-witted, he had a deep understanding, especially in illusions and drama, and had a great attraction and appeal to both children and adults. However, until the age of thirteen, he had not attended school, but only worked as a servant while learning privately. At the age of twenty, he entered the monastery to study. At the same time, he also put into practice his kindness in improving the lives of the poor and fallen youth in the neighborhoods. His first step was to find an empty house to accommodate children who were without clothing, food, or a home, teaching them some knowledge and small crafts to enable them to support themselves in a very short period of time. The news spread, and soon he had taken in more than three hundred people. However, on the one hand, there was not enough porridge for everyone, so he had to find another place to live. On the other hand, the neighbors were annoyed by the children's noise, so he was driven out by the authorities. After several setbacks, he finally overcame the difficulties. Later, he even established larger-scale charitable organizations such as schools for the poor, raising funds and educating poor children, which consumed almost all of his time. From 1841 onwards, he organized Salesiano Salesian Society schools in various industrial areas of Italy, specializing in the admission of poor, out-of-school children, providing them with general and vocational education. Later, he gradually expanded abroad, and the name of the Salesian Society of Bosco became well-known throughout the world. From 1861 onwards, he founded the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians (the Immaculate Conception) to help poor girls, coordinating with the Salesian Society to become an international charitable organization that educates poor boys and girls. Although he was already seventy years old, he still traveled to foreign countries for this cause, and did not pass away amidst universal mourning until 1888. However, he had left behind an immortal career. His missionaries now number in the thousands, and his work has spread to five continents, with tens of thousands of Salesian monks and Daughters of Mary Help of Christians nuns continuing his great work.

### Income and Expenditure Report for Donations in July

With soaring prices and high cost of living, coupled with the scorching heat, the number of people suffering from poverty and illness is increasing daily. At the same time, the number of people applying to this office for relief is also increasing. However, because this office has been committed to promoting disaster relief in North China and scholarships in the past, there have only been expenditures and no income for various subsidies. Now that the accounting for disaster relief and scholarships has come to an end, it is unbearable to see the poor and sick crying out without help. We eagerly hope that benevolent people will quickly open their purses and continue to donate. The income and expenditure report for last month is as follows:

Poverty Relief Fund: Balance at the end of June: 48,184.70 yuan. July expenditure: 900.00 yuan. Balance: 47,284.70 yuan.

Small Business Loan Fund: Balance at the end of June: 7,635.00 yuan. July expenditure: 910.00 yuan. Balance: 6,725.00 yuan.

Elementary School Scholarship Fund: Balance at the end of June: 45,900.50 yuan. July income: 1,000.00 yuan. July expenditure: 6,043.00 yuan. Balance: 40,857.50 yuan.

### The Chao-Shan Relief Association Will Hold a Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting

Since the Chao-Shan Association in Shanghai launched its campaign to raise funds for disaster relief in Chao-Shan, it has received the support of famous people in Shanghai and the generous donations from all walks of life, with quite remarkable results. However, because the disaster area of Chao-Shan is located in a remote corner by the sea and transportation is difficult, it has not yet received the deep attention of society. Therefore, the Association has initiated a charity exhibition of calligraphy and painting, firstly to awaken the attention of all walks of life, and secondly to conduct a more general fundraising campaign. The Association sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, entrusting us to widely solicit famous works. This newspaper believes that since the disasters in North China and the waters of Hua are all suffered by our compatriots, disaster relief should not be divided by regions. We have agreed to transfer all the remaining items from this Hua North Emergency Exhibition to the Association for charity sale, and the funds will be used for emergency relief in Chao-Shan. We hope that all donors to this newspaper will continue to do good deeds. It is heard that the event is scheduled to be held at the Ningbo Association Hall starting on the 15th of this month. We hope that enthusiastic people at home and abroad will show the same spirit of relieving disaster in North China and generously donate to South China.

Free Enrollment of Deaf-Mute Students: Guangya Deaf-Mute School, in response to the fundraising effort, is enrolling ten free deaf-mute students with impoverished families this semester. The school is located at No. 16 Xinshi Market, Jing'an Temple Road.

Lost and Found Residence Permit: Yesterday, a rickshaw puller turned in a residence permit and travel document for Mr. Liu Zhipeng. Please come to claim them.
