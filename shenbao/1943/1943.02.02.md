### "Luxury is the Enemy" – A Re-Discussion on Wartime Consumption Economy

Modern warfare is total war. It must concentrate all the people's strength to provide to the government embraced by the people, so that it can make appropriate deployment and strive for the victory of the war. The country that concentrates the most massive and substantial power and applies it most appropriately has the greatest certainty of victory. Conversely, if a country cannot gather all the mental, material, and human resources of the whole country, or intentionally or unintentionally consumes mental, human, and material resources in meaningless ways, then this country will suffer defeat. Therefore, on the one hand, there must be a strong government embraced by the whole people for the appropriate application of national power, and no wasteful consumption should be allowed. On the other hand, it is even more necessary to require the people of the whole country to absolutely avoid unnecessary consumption of human and material resources and absolutely prohibit any luxury during wartime.

"Luxury is the enemy" is a most popular slogan in Japan after the war. Because the luxury of national life will inevitably excessively consume the country's human and material resources, reduce the proportion in the total war against the enemy in modern warfare, and reduce the factors for the country to defeat the enemy, whether you intend it or not, the result will be helping the enemy. Therefore, use the slogan "Luxury is the Enemy" to raise the vigilance of the national people, everyone should strive to refrain from luxury, economical consumption, so that the country can save more human and material resources to fight the enemy and strive for the final victory. In fact, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, Japan has already implemented an economy policy with concerted efforts from top to bottom, and the national life has met wartime standards. All aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation are within the scope of government regulations, showing the special characteristics of wartime life. The consumption of the general public is subject to the control and guidance of the government, and several major foods, clothing materials, and daily necessities have long implemented a rationing and ticket system. Even housing and transportation (vehicles and traffic) are under strict control. Recently, in order to adapt to the prolongation of the war, accumulate more human and material resources, in order to create the power to overcome the enemy, and promote the "long-term war" to end in a short period of time, a universal economy movement has been further implemented. For example, lunch banquets are limited to 2.5 yuan per guest, and dinner banquets are limited to 5 yuan, both for the government and the public. For example, the paper used by primary school students is also limited every week. For example, the tickets issued by the government to the people for the purchase of consumer goods will be reduced even more this year, and the tickets required to be paid when purchasing goods will be increased, and the government will use planned and organized power to promote the economy movement. Although it increases the inconvenience of the people on the surface, its purpose is to require everyone to endure temporary inconvenience in order to shorten the war time and win victory as soon as possible. In fact, this method of prohibiting luxury and implementing economy has already been implemented by the enemy countries of Britain and the United States, which have always been known for the luxury of their national life, and have already implemented a strict consumption restriction policy. For example, in terms of clothing, the British people are subject to strict control in the purchase of clothing and clothing materials. Everyone must first go through registration procedures to obtain a certificate, which contains a total of sixty-six tickets. Generally, it takes twenty-two tickets to make a suit, and it takes five tickets to buy a pair of leather shoes, and it also takes two tickets for a tie. The government restricts you to spend only sixty-six tickets a year, and when the tickets are used up, you can't buy anything to wear even if you have money. In terms of food, the purchase of bread, milk, butter, and other foods is subject to designated shops and strict restrictions. Sometimes you can only buy beef or mutton once a week. In the past, there were several dishes for a meal, but now one soup, one dish, and a snack are popular. In terms of housing, in the past, one family lived alone, but now they are all designated by the government, and four or five families live together. For example, the source of paper in Britain has always been dependent on Canada and Norway. During the war, the source of wool was reduced due to shipping relations. Therefore, the British government launched a campaign to collect waste paper. Now, when you buy things in British stores, there is no paper to wrap them. For example, if you buy a pair of leather shoes, you can only hold them in your hands when you come out of the store. The official documents mailed by government agencies are all placed in old envelopes. One envelope is used seven or eight times, and at least three or four times. On the contrary, in our country, although there are many people who advocate economy, it is still very common to indulge in luxury and squander at will.

During wartime, the government should vigorously promote economy for very obvious reasons. For daily necessities such as clothing materials and food, of which our country does not produce enough and whose consumption will increase, there should be reasonable restrictions to seek a balance between supply and demand in order to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices. Even non-daily necessities and high-priced consumer goods, commonly known as luxury goods, must also be paid attention to, because seeking a superior and comfortable life is one of human desires. As long as there are delicious and fun things to get, people always want to get their hands on them. In order to satisfy this desire, those without money want to get money, and those with money want to get more money, and the trend of speculation is prevalent for a while. The surge in prices and the size of society cannot be ignored. Therefore, the restriction on non-essential goods or luxury goods and the restriction on improper entertainment places are problems that must be considered at present. We believe that as long as there is a comprehensive plan, careful consideration, and reasonable methods, then the result of prohibiting luxury and restricting consumer goods can not only reduce consumption and save materials and human resources for the country and society in a passive way, but also increase the people's proper working hours and productivity in an active way, so that the society can get on the right track.

Consumption economy and strict prohibition of luxury are not only necessary for the new environment of participating in the war, but also indispensable for peaceful nation-building. However, in consumption economy and strict prohibition of luxury, the most important thing is still the people's automatic attention and the full display of the power of social sanctions. Therefore, on the one hand, we expect the government to set comprehensive and reasonable methods as soon as possible, and on the other hand, we expect the efforts of all aspects of society, from the government to the people, to jointly eliminate our first enemy – luxury? Here, the exemplary role of political workers is of the first significance. And what the authorities and social leaders should pay special attention to is: the target of our strict prohibition of luxury and economical consumption today refers to those wealthy and powerful social components, not the common people. To be honest, most of the common people today are struggling in cold and poverty. They can't talk about luxury, let alone economy. If all prohibitions and restrictions only revolve around the common people, it will be ineffective.

### Battle of Rennell Island: Great Battle Achievements of Japanese Air Force; Five Enemy Warships Sunk, Two Severely Damaged

At that time, the weather was bad, and the enemy ships were caught off guard and fled south immediately. However, on January 30th, the Japanese naval air force made a daytime attack on it again, giving it a fatal blow. The enemy's counterattack attempt failed because it was controlled first. As of now, the battle results that have been ascertained are as follows: Two enemy battleships and three cruisers were sunk, one battleship and one cruiser were damaged, and three aircraft were shot down. Our losses include seven aircraft that were self-destructed and three others that did not return. (Note: This naval battle is called the Battle of Rennell Island)"

Tokyo, 1st, Domei News Agency – According to well-informed sources here, the Japanese navy has sunk or damaged 132 enemy warships and transport ships in the Solomon Islands waters alone, including 10 battleships, 8 aircraft carriers, 40 cruisers, and 36 destroyers, and shot down 910 enemy aircraft.

Naval Minister Shimada Reports on War Situation

Tokyo, 1st, Central News Agency – Naval Minister Shimada reported on the new naval battles in the Solomon Islands area at a meeting of the House of Peers on the 1st, explaining the war situation as follows: "On January 29th, the Imperial Navy Air Force discovered a powerful enemy fleet composed of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers in the sea east of Rennell Island at the southern end of the Solomon Islands. This battle occurred because the enemy planned to launch a counterattack against our army in the Solomon Islands and eastern New Guinea. The enemy's attempt has completely failed. The battle results of the Battle of Rennell Island that have been ascertained so far are: Two enemy battleships and three cruisers were sunk, one enemy battleship and one giant cruiser were destroyed, and three enemy fighter planes were shot down. Our naval air force braved the bad weather and carried out fierce attacks, instantly sinking one battleship and two cruisers, and other ships also suffered considerable damage. The enemy then attempted to flee south, but our troops pursued and attacked them. On the 30th, powerful air forces were again used to carry out a powerful daytime raid on the enemy, sinking one more enemy battleship and one cruiser. Here, I would like to add that in the battle on the 29th, the commander of our attack team braved the fierce enemy defensive fire and fought bravely. After launching a torpedo at an enemy battleship, he was unfortunately hit by an enemy shell. Knowing that he could not return to base, he took the bridge of the enemy battleship as his target and carried out a surprise self-destruction, finally sinking the ship. After receiving the report from friendly aircraft, the entire army was extremely moved."

### Australia Feels Seriously Threatened

Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency – A telegram from Sydney says that Australian Army Minister Spender delivered a broadcast speech to the entire Australian people on the 30th, saying that the Japanese army's actions in the Southwest Pacific are increasing the threat to Australia day by day. At this time, in addition to the timely defense by the American and Australian armies, the people

Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency – A telegram from Canberra says that Australian Air Force Minister Drakeford warned the Australian people on the 31st, pointing out that the Japanese air force in the Solomon Islands is increasing its threat day by day. The general idea is that Japan will definitely do its best to seize control of the air over the Solomon Islands and the Emperor's aspect. Therefore, the activity of the Japanese air force will definitely increase day by day.

### Trends in Japanese Politics; Forming a "War First" Doctrine; Government and People Jointly Seek to Achieve the Goal

Tokyo, 1st, Central News Agency Special Telegram – Under the Greater East Asia War, Japan must devote itself to enhancing its combat power and expanding production in order to achieve its goals. The goal of Japanese political trends is also to unify and concentrate political power in order to establish the basic conditions for implementing policies. In the past, all aspects of Japanese domestic politics, economy, culture, and national life were full of the remaining poison of liberalism, and they should be thoroughly attended to first. From this, establish a new worldview and new order produced by the Japanese people from their awakening, hoping to truly reform East Asia and even the world with the belief, and seek lasting world peace. At present, the first goal of implementing this concept is to complete the Greater East Asia War and destroy the Anglo-Americans who are delusional to maintain the old order. However, since the Greater East Asia War has a trend of long-term war, a huge consumption is inevitable. Therefore, a large increase in production is also necessary. In the past, the situation in which politics was the main and war was the auxiliary has turned to the trend in which war is the main and politics is the auxiliary. Therefore, the domestic war-winning system must be further strengthened. After the start of the war, the Japanese government immediately began to reform the administrative organs, such as preparing for the implementation of administrative simplification, the unification of domestic and foreign administration, and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Province. At the same time, all policies focused on enhancing production, such as strengthening the control association, reorganizing small and medium-sized businesses and industries, improving financial and capital institutions, and establishing centralized control of all materials, transportation funds, and labor, working hard, operating methods, etc. in order to enhance production. Recently, in order to obtain the expected results of enhancing combat power, it has also promulgated wartime administrative special cases and wartime administrative special cases bills to seek to enhance the unity of political power. This trend in the war and political aspects is enough to show that war has a priority. For example, in the wartime administrative special law bill, it is stipulated that the prime minister of the administrative minister has the authority to command the cabinet members who are also administrative ministers. Therefore, the so-called political and other first system in the past has been difficult to achieve, and the fact of war first has been formed. Therefore, today's Japanese political trend can be said to have focused on completing the war. At the same time, the parliament itself will have major changes and developments as a result, which is self-evident. Tracing the development of the Japanese parliamentary character, there was a trend of change when the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, because although the parliament at that time was a national political participation organ stipulated by the constitution, it was actually completely controlled by various political parties. The Seiyukai and Minseito were the most prominent of these. The parties fought each other for rights and political strategies. By the time the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, Japan deeply felt the need to strengthen the domestic political system. Therefore, in the political aspect, it first changed the past style of party politics and faction control, such as the Hirota Cabinet, the Abe Cabinet, and the Konoe Cabinet, etc., which used the comprehensive strength of various parties and factions and the balance of various forces to exert their ability in politics. Abe, the president of the Seiyukai, once elaborated on the attitude that the parliament, the people, and the government should take towards the implementation of established national policies, saying that all members should abandon partisan prejudices, work together in harmony, and that the parliament's responsibility is neither to follow the government without a direction, nor to make a temporary compromise with the government, but to correct what the government should correct and suggest what should be suggested based on the lofty national position. In particular, it is necessary to deeply understand the situation and complete the mission, that is, the members and the government are in a position of sincerity and encouragement. Regarding the implementation of established policies, we must not fail to urge the government and cooperate with it. Therefore, the purpose of this parliament transforming from a wartime parliament into a decisive battle parliament is to actively enhance combat power in the war and to prepare the domestic system as a result. The Japanese government this time submitted various important bills and budget bills to the parliament, so as to explain to the world the Japanese government's policy of implementing the war and stimulate the national's will to fight. The atmosphere of the parliamentary side concentrating the total strength of the country to actively cooperate with the government is also extremely strong. Moreover, before the parliament meeting, a large number of members cooperated in planning various administrative policies in the capacity of members of various provinces. Another group of members organized a combat power enhancement commando team and widely adopted the opinions of local officials and people in the parliament. During the recess period, they also actively cooperated in enhancing combat power and wartime administration. The government's proposed bills were first carefully reviewed by representatives carefully selected by all members. At the time of the meeting, the principle of focusing on key points was adopted. All these situations were unprecedented. Therefore, today's Japanese people, government, and parliament have united as one, determined with the belief of sure victory, to overcome all difficulties and move forward bravely. At the same time, the parliament also responded to this, regardless of party affiliation, and members are still representatives of the people, but also representatives of various interest groups. In terms of the relationship between the government and the parliament, because the positions of the two are different, disagreements are inevitable. However, the parliament is the representative of the people and should supervise the government. This trend has completely changed in the Japanese parliament after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and the true character of the Japanese parliament has been established accordingly.

### Germany Completes All Preparations; Will Expand Submarine Warfare; Defending Against Submarines Becomes a Difficult Problem for Britain and the United States; Convoy System Proves to Have Little Effect

Berlin, 1st, Huitong News Agency – German Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Dönitz lectured his subordinates yesterday, saying that he was determined to engage in submarine warfare with all his strength and expand it to a wide range. Also, his special flag emblem has been hung on the submarine command headquarters since yesterday.

Geneva, Switzerland, 31st, Havas News Agency – Submarine warfare is still the focus of attention for military and political circles in Britain and the United States. According to news from London, the convoy system has completely failed due to the lack of thorough preparation for preventing submarine activities. It is found that during the First World War, the British side designed several defense methods in order to stop the activities of German submarines. According to Churchill (then Minister of the Navy), Germany was almost completely subdued at a certain period. The destroyer fleet was used to drive away submarines, and the hydroelectric network was also laid, and the scope of the network was expanded to the English Channel. "Q ships" (disguised submarine destroyers) also joined the service. However, the only effective way to protect ocean transportation was to protect shipping with warships. Under strict protection, merchant fleets often took circuitous sea routes. At the end of the First World War, 99% of convoyed merchant ships were able to reach their destinations. By this time, the situation has become more and more difficult. Submarines operating in groups have been able to break through the convoy defense. Therefore, the convoy system is very costly and has very little effect. Military experts believe that the convoy system has the following difficulties: (1) Protecting merchant fleets requires a large number of warships. These warships may be more useful elsewhere. (2) The speed of the convoy is based on the slowest ship. Therefore, each voyage is greatly extended. (3) Each convoy must gather at certain ports on specific dates. As a result, merchant ships full of goods are waiting in vain and must be detoured to reach the concentration point, which is more complicated. (4) The destination of the convoys often has no pier facilities, and unloading is extremely difficult. After the merchant ships arrive, they have to stay for many days, and sometimes it takes weeks to unload the goods continuously. Sometimes, even during the unloading period, they are still threatened by aerial bombing. All these points were experienced during the last war, but this time the situation is even more serious. The position of Britain and the United States is also more difficult than in 1918. The sea lanes of Britain and the United States have been completely deprived, and the losses they have suffered have been extremely heavy. Moreover, the sea lanes from North America to Britain and then from Britain via Cape Town to North Africa are extremely long. Britain now not only has to deal with the crisis of German submarines in the Atlantic Ocean, but also has to take into account the activities of Japanese submarines in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, making it feel overwhelmed. Since Admiral Dönitz took office as commander of the German fleet, he has proved that Germany intends to expand submarine warfare. Therefore, London will become more and more uneasy about this.

### Allied Ships Sunk in January Reached Sixty-Three

The merchant ships were loaded with war equipment to supply North Africa. It is said that among the British destroyers that were sunk, two were sunk by one Italian submarine.

He was then transferred to serve as the commander of the Savoia Cavalry Brigade and deputy principal of the Pinerolo Cavalry School. From 1928 to 1932, Ambrogio served as the Inspector-General of Mechanized Units. In 1938, he was appointed as commander of the Italian Army's Second Army Corps and has been credited with meritorious service in Yugoslavia.

In November 1941, he captured Rostov, gaining widespread fame.

### The Powerful Tojo Cabinet: Promoting New Talent Regardless of Seniority; Advocating the Spirit of Selflessness and Devotion to Public Service; Translated from the January Issue of "Enterprise" (1)

The Nature of the Tojo Cabinet

The political power of the four chief officers of the cabinet has never been as strong as in the Tojo Cabinet. Suzuki, president of the Planning Board, concurrently holds the position of Minister of State. Tani, president of the Information Bureau, in addition to his original position, also concurrently serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs. As such, two of the four chief officers in the current cabinet hold the position of Minister of State, which is unprecedented. In strengthening the authority of the Prime Minister, the Tojo Cabinet does not adopt the form of amending the Cabinet system, but instead focuses on strengthening the authority of the Prime Minister's political staff.

In October of Showa 16 (1941), following the resignation of the Third Konoe Cabinet, Lieutenant General Hideki Tojo received the imperial command to form a cabinet. When selecting cabinet members, he avoided recruiting well-known figures. At that time, the international situation was becoming increasingly urgent. Although political parties had temporarily dissolved, the former leaders of the political parties still held the potential to influence politics. Therefore, people generally believed that representatives from all levels would be recruited to form a leadership cabinet. However, Prime Minister Tojo defied this expectation and boldly promoted his former acquaintances who were in lower positions. It seems that Prime Minister Tojo had already made up his mind and had decided on the fundamental policy for the cabinet's operation from the time he formed the cabinet.

Whether a so-called leadership cabinet is appropriate for effectively exerting political power is worth discussing. The Konoe Cabinet attempted to recruit so-called big figures from the political and financial circles, such as Kazushige Ugaki, Nobumasa Suetsugu, and Shigeki Ikeda, and diligently worked towards the unity of the emergency cabinet. However, it did not achieve the expected results. To avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, Prime Minister Tojo not only did not recruit big figures, but also valued personal relationships. When selecting cabinet members, he tried his best to avoid unfamiliar people. He chose people whom he was confident that his influence could reach. The Tojo Cabinet's appointment of Foreign Minister Tani and Greater East Asia Minister Aoki still maintains this consistent principle. However, this has led to criticism of a "family cabinet." This is the first characteristic of the Tojo Cabinet. The aforementioned establishment of the four chief officers of the cabinet, with comrades as the core, is its second characteristic.

The political center of power of the Tojo Cabinet is naturally in the hands of these four chief officers of the cabinet. A powerful cabinet organization like the "Inner Cabinet" in the British wartime cabinet was studied shortly after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. In a sense, the meeting of the four chief officers has the function and power of an "Inner Cabinet."

Organizing a cabinet based on the union of comrades and placing its political center on the four chief officers is proving, as Prime Minister Tojo expected, to exert a powerful political force for the cabinet. The Tojo Cabinet advocated "consistency between words and deeds" as its highest principle. Reversing the previous cabinets' malpractice of only focusing on empty talk and neglecting practical matters, it has gained the support and trust of the people. The biggest reason for the success of the Tojo Cabinet's consistency between words and deeds lies in the aforementioned new method of cabinet operation.

The establishment of the Ministry of Greater East Asia to reorganize and integrate the administrative agencies and the generation of this political power are naturally due to this, which previous cabinets could not achieve. The original plan for the Ministry of Greater East Asia was kept secret by the four chief officers of the cabinet. When it was presented to the other cabinet members a few days before the cabinet meeting, some cabinet members held different opinions, but it was too late to do anything about it.

Prime Minister Tojo's political operations, such as the simplification of administration and the reorganization of matters jointly managed by various ministries, are most effective against the impenetrable factionalism of the various ministries. Each minister has a firm conviction and powerful authority. The position of the Prime Minister can only be stabilized on the balance of power of the various ministers. In such a cabinet, it is extremely difficult to implement various reforms. Rather than that, it is easier to achieve results by appointing comrades with lower positions and placing its political center in the four chief officers of the cabinet, and promoting powerful politics on this basis. In this regard, Prime Minister Tojo has almost completely achieved the results he expected.

The Duties of the Four Chief Officers of the Cabinet

As mentioned above, the power of the four chief officers of the cabinet is exceptionally strong in the Tojo Cabinet. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to choose the right people for the positions of the four chief officers of the cabinet. Furthermore, the people who hold the positions of the four chief officers of the cabinet should be more selfless and devoted to their duties than anyone else. This is based on the demands of Prime Minister Tojo's nature. Prime Minister Tojo is straightforward and is a typical person full of conviction. He is strict with himself and is stern. With the conviction of selflessness, he resolutely implements the results of his own careful deliberation and has absolute certainty. After careful deliberation and judgment, he quickly handles affairs. This kind of political operation is in line with the wartime administration's requirement of putting judgment and implementation first. Therefore, Prime Minister Tojo himself has a stubborn and confident personality, but such a personality can easily be blinded by prejudice. Thus, the duties of the four chief officers of the cabinet who assist the cabinet become even more important.

During wartime, it goes without saying that all political changes must be absolutely avoided. Since the Sino-Japanese War, there have been many political changes in Japan's recent political history. The leaders of the countries who are struggling often take the lead in sacrificing themselves for the country. Japan is not as good as its allies Germany and Italy in this regard. The resignation of the cabinet is regarded as the completion of the cabinet's responsibility. This concept of political change is extremely dangerous during wartime. In Japan, the old concept of political change has been abandoned. Supporting the Tojo Cabinet to advance vigorously for the completion of the Greater East Asia War is the duty of the wartime government to the people. Prime Minister Tojo's dedication to the country is unprecedented by any cabinet leader since the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, the Japanese people will definitely give him their complete trust.

However, the above does not mean that all actions of the cabinet's leadership are unconditionally justified. The duties of the four chief officers of the cabinet are all the more important in the sense that they assist Prime Minister Tojo, as mentioned earlier. Prime Minister Tojo is a soldier, and his straightforwardness is also reflected in his politics. The cabinet staff who assist him should calmly and widely gather opinions and advise on the best policies. A selfless spirit is even more necessary. This kind of cultivation of the cabinet staff is a pressing requirement for Prime Minister Tojo and the people to complete the wartime policies.

During wartime, the government's leadership must not be afraid of difficulties and avoid responsibility. Using the name of war as a talisman, rejecting loyal advice, and repelling criticism is an abuse of the term wartime. During wartime, the people cannot help but speak out. If this criticism is used as a shield under the name of war, it is the most heinous crime during wartime.

On the path to completing the Greater East Asia War, the strategy of expanding war power centered on expanding productivity has already departed from the old concept of capitalism's pursuit of profits and is moving towards the path of gathering the total power of the people. The road ahead is full of thorns. The final victory of the Greater East Asia War will also be quite arduous. Therefore, what we require of the cabinet staff—the cabinet staff who will not be changed before the victory is completed—is to have the spirit of self-sacrifice with flowing hot blood and a calm, scientifically constructed mind. As this new year begins, we wish the staff of the glorious wartime cabinet even greater vigor and also hope that they will make even greater efforts and work tirelessly.

The Tojo Cabinet's Policy Direction

The center of gravity of the Tojo Cabinet is, of course, Prime Minister Tojo. Lieutenant General Hideki Tojo, who has commanded on the front lines, is a man of conviction and emotion. His aggressive attitude during parliamentary debates is a revelation of his true feelings. The evasiveness and vagueness characteristic of politicians, which can be seen as refined on the one hand, and as political cunning on the other, have not been tainted by Prime Minister Tojo in the slightest.

The reason why Prime Minister Tojo is able to win people's hearts is fundamentally due to his selfless devotion to public service and responsible political operations. This is probably due to the Prime Minister's own pure character. Under the iron rule of consistency between words and deeds, he realizes the pure sentiments of a soldier in politics. When encountering difficult problems, he never procrastinates and goes straight ahead. He never uses political tactics like the politicians of the past, nor does he engage in false courtesies. For example, the school system reform plan, as everyone knows, once it is decided by the cabinet, it becomes the formal official system. Faithful to the belief of consistency between words and deeds, he does not fear difficulties and resolutely implements it. The previous cabinet adopted a policy of local resolution and non-expansion for the Sino-Japanese War, which dragged on to this point. There is a world of difference between that and the current cabinet's straightforward launch of the Greater East Asia War to investigate the root cause. The difference lies in the different ways of operating politics.

In other aspects, Prime Minister Tojo also has a character of enduring hardship, being meticulous in handling affairs. For example, when the Prime Minister was out on the street, someone asked him how he felt. He said, "People often ask me what I am most interested in, what kind of games I like, and what personal hobbies I have. This is definitely not something to talk about easily at this time." His answer was: "First, having taken on the important task of assisting, and His Majesty taking the heart of the people as His own, the Prime Minister's responsibility is, of course, to embody this sincerity. Second, the matters decided by the cabinet, that is, the government policies decided by the cabinet, how to permeate the lower organizations of the people, must be deeply understood in order to see their hidden aspects. Third, in order to share the hardships of the industrial warriors and the soldiers on the front lines, I am working desperately to arouse the greater efforts of the industrial warriors and to let the soldiers on the front lines know the tranquility of the rear." From the old to the young and the industrial warriors, everyone who heard these words deeply understood the Prime Minister's feelings. This is truly Prime Minister Tojo's profound political philosophy and is truly the best policy for creating psychology. Former Duke Konoe cannot be said to be a person who did not know the character of others, but the direct connection with the masses was very weak. Prime Minister Tojo was able to win people's hearts unexpectedly even when he was out on the street, and his answer, "This is definitely not something to talk about easily at this time," aroused infinite respect in us.

By virtue of his strategic planning, Paulus has held down a large number of Soviet troops in Stalingrad for eight weeks, preventing them from launching a breakthrough and inflicting heavy damage on several Soviet armies. Therefore, the achievement of the Sixth Army is important and is not inferior to other armies that have previously engaged in blitzkrieg strategies.

### American Education System Under Contradictory and Confused Emotions; Rigid Military Training Forgets Spiritual Strength; Special Correspondent Hosokawa, Argentine Capital

(Dispatch of the 23rd) The United States is currently aiming to become a highly militarized nation, reorganizing government agencies, restructuring economic institutions, and reforming various social organizations. Under the wave of this wartime situation, the education sector has also undergone significant changes. The main characteristics of this trend are roughly as follows:

Militarization of School Facilities

This academic year, 250,000 military personnel from the U.S. Army and Navy have entered universities and specialized schools to receive specialized education. In addition, schools have also provided special combat education to another 250,000 students. The ordinary student corps in various schools have also abolished the original "Reserve Non-Commissioned Officer Corps" organization and have been incorporated into the "Army and Navy Trainee Officer Corps." Eight hundred thousand male and female students under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education are receiving six months of training in order to learn the specialized skills of general factories and military supply factories. At the same time, the U.S. Army and Navy have each established directly affiliated schools within universities and specialized schools. The student groups within these schools are independent, using self-compiled textbooks and establishing their own school rules. Students above the level of specialized schools study with them, which is cumbersome because they have not received military training.

For example, the University of North Carolina has provided ten of its twenty-two dormitories, as well as sports facilities, dining halls, infirmaries, and many other facilities, to the Navy for the training of 1,500 candidates at the preparatory flight school attached to the university. In addition, Indiana University opened a naval training center in July of last year, recruiting 600 soldiers. The same number of women recruited by the Navy are being educated. Thomas University has had 13 classrooms, the assembly hall of the athletic field, and five dormitories requisitioned by the Navy for visiting athletes to stay in when competing with other schools.

The above is regarding the Navy. As for the Army, it is also using the same method to make maximum use of the facilities within universities.

Reform of Universities and Specialized Schools

Students aged 18 and 19 who are currently studying in specialized schools and secondary schools cannot but leave school due to the provisions of the new conscription law. Therefore, at the meeting of the American University and Specialized School Alliance held in Philadelphia, in order to enable students who are over the conscription age of 18 to take advantage of specialized schools and universities, it was decided to establish a "Student Training Corps to be Called Up." The plan was that the principals unanimously believed that due to the provisions of the new plan, students could receive education not only while in school, fundamentally reducing the higher education system, to the point that it could be said that the higher education system has been eliminated.

Therefore, research in technical sciences, mathematics, and other departments in various specialized schools and universities must be taught only when deemed necessary by the Army and Navy authorities, completely changing the curriculum of each school in order to adapt to the total war wartime system.

This fundamental reform implemented in the field of higher education will be handed down permanently, making it the most fundamental and drastic change in American higher education in the past four and a half centuries. It can be said to be a comprehensive reform implemented to adapt to total war. The content of the reform, in addition to preparing special courses for students of conscription age and students in military supply industries, also pays special attention to physical fitness training under the supervision of military authorities.

The University of North Carolina has opened a "Wartime Training Section" to train students over the age of 16 for "frontline and rear" tasks. Also, last autumn, a "Preparation for Enlistment Section" was opened for senior students, planning to first train a portion of the national army in the wartime training section for conscripts aged 18 and 19.

Changes in Secondary School Subjects

Secondary schools throughout the United States are changing their curriculum to adapt to the necessities of wartime, abandoning traditional classical subjects and replacing them with practical subjects. The changes in the various subjects in the technical field are most noteworthy. Various schools are making aeronautics, electricity, radio construction, as well as labor, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, etc., the main courses, as they are related to aviation. The Cleveland City Board of Education recently passed a revision案 of the secondary school curriculum, and senior students in New York City's secondary schools are required to take flight preparation lectures, aeronautics, and enlistment preparation as required courses.

The curriculum of Chicago's secondary schools has also changed, with newly established flight preparation lectures and aeronautics becoming required courses from January of this year. Technical training is also the main focus of Boston's secondary schools, fundamentally changing the curriculum and establishing courses in applied mathematics, aeronautics, aerodynamics, meteorology, and navigation. Schools in Lausanne are also offering "Victory Lectures" as remedial courses.

Wartime Education for Female Students

American women are now also holding important positions in the government and military supply industries. Women's colleges and specialized schools in the United States are now also adapting to wartime needs and revising the content of their teaching. Many women with liberal arts degrees are now returning to school to receive several months of remedial education before taking on various special tasks. Therefore, women's colleges and specialized schools are also adding mathematics, physics, chemistry, and other subjects that are currently urgently needed, and are encouraging women to receive technical training.

Poverty of Spiritual Education

On the reverse side of the militarization of education in the United States, we have discovered the poverty of spiritual education. They overemphasize materialism, so they do not know the importance of spiritual education, and they also lack the ability to understand its importance. However, some people in the American education sector have noticed this and have expressed dissatisfaction. For example, Winifred Fisher, the executive director of the New York City Adult Education Association, lamented that only a few percent of the city's adult education attendees were at a recent [lecture] on American history.

Confusion and Contradictions in the Education Sector

The contradictions currently faced by the American education sector are extremely profound. First, the war is about to reach the stage of sacrificing schoolchildren, and Margaret Lewisohn, president of the New York City Education Association, is very worried about this point. As mentioned above, American schoolchildren have already been sacrificed for the war. The juvenile crime rate in New York City increased by 14 percent in the first half of 1942 compared to the same period in 1941. This is because the city's education budget was cut by nearly 4 million yuan, preventing the social isolation facilities from functioning and contributing to the rise in the juvenile crime rate. Therefore, the short-sighted policies of the authorities are quite unreasonable.

Second, as a result of the decrease in the number of students after the implementation of the new conscription law, the finances of various universities are in a very difficult situation. Marquette University President [Father] McCarthy said:

"Many universities will not be able to operate without government subsidies."

Third, the biggest reason for the chaos in American school education during wartime is that the government does not have a unified education policy. Originally, various government departments had a great influence on universities and specialized schools. The unplanned implementation of various policies is bound to lead to mutual contradictions. For example, professors of economics and statistics are mostly poached by the Wartime Production Planning Board, the Price Control Board, and other government offices. Many are also summoned to Washington for urgent matters. Therefore, the educational capacity of universities is inevitably significantly reduced or destroyed: as a result, the military or civilians cannot obtain young people with sufficient academic ability.

### East Asia League Second Anniversary Celebration; Chairman Wang Attends to Give Instructions

Nanjing, 1st [of the month] (Central News Agency) - Yesterday (the 1st) was the second anniversary of the founding of the China General Association of the East Asia League. The General Association and the Nanjing Branch held an enlarged celebration ceremony at the National Assembly Hall at 4:00 PM. Attendees included Chairman and Directors Chu Minyi, Wen Zongyao, Lin Baisheng, Chen Qun, Jun Qiang, Zhou Xuechang, Cai Pei, Zhou Huarren, Xu Suzhong, and others, as well as over a thousand representatives from various local branches. The meeting began with the entire assembly bowing three times to the national flag and party flag, and bowing once to the chairman in tribute. Chairman Wang was then respectfully invited to give instructions, followed by the entire assembly shouting slogans and the ceremony was declared complete amidst the resounding music.

Nanjing, 1st [of the month] (Central News Agency) - In his address at the second anniversary celebration of the East Asia League, the chairman first pointed out that holding the second anniversary celebration of the China General Association of the East Asia League after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and China's participation in the Greater East Asia War has great significance. The work of the past two years has focused on the ideological movement. From today onwards, the East Asia League movement should move from the ideological movement to concrete action. He then explained in three points: First, in principle, he pointed out that the foundation of the East Asia League lies in the Eastern moral spirit. The biggest difference between the Eastern moral spirit and Western utilitarianism is that one is a co-prosperity sphere ideology and the other is colonialism; one aims for coexistence and the other aims for exploitation. Both need material resources, but with regard to human resources, one treats people as people, respecting their conscience and personality, while the other does not treat people as people, viewing them as cattle, horses, machines, or materials, stifling their conscience, disregarding their personality, extracting their blood and sweat, and discarding their shells. The collapse of British imperialism is due to this. The East Asia League is based on the Eastern moral spirit, reversing the utilitarianism and colonialism of the past, so it will be able to stimulate the pure patriotism and East Asian awareness of the East Asian nations, enabling the people of each East Asian country to love their own country, love their neighbors, and love East Asia together. Second, in terms of basic conditions, he analyzed that the four major綱領s of the East Asia League movement, namely political independence, economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication, are the concrete embodiment of the Eastern moral spirit. The forms and institutions of the League are yet to be discussed, so they will not be discussed in detail here. However, these four major纲领s will surely clear away the poisonous influence of Western utilitarianism, unite the human and material resources of Greater East Asia to establish a new East Asia of coexistence and co-prosperity, unite internally, and resist external aggression. This can be asserted. Third, in terms of concrete action, he pointed out that the emergence of the East Asia League recognizes that the revival of China and the construction of East Asia are inseparable, that is, the two major missions of reviving China and defending East Asia are inseparable. China's participation in the war is to share the obligation of defending East Asia. The return of concessions by friendly nations and the abolition of extraterritorial rights are to assist the progress of reviving China. The two are by no means conditions for exchange, but are completely based on the Eastern moral spirit as a starting point. According to the development of the situation, the four major纲领s of the East Asia League are being gradually advanced. We must make redoubled efforts in the political, military, economic, and cultural aspects under the grand goal of completing the Greater East Asia War. As for the point of cultural communication, some people mistakenly believe that it is revivalism, which is a great fallacy. In order to complete the war and build East Asia, we must lead in promoting the inherent moral spirit of the East, and we must also strive for the progress of science and technology. The scope of culture is very broad, but in terms of current needs, those used in science and technology should account for ninety-five or six percent, and those used in other aspects should only account for four or five percent. In short, since we are now entering the stage of concrete action of the East Asia League, we should take the East Asia League as our goal, arouse the spirit of the New National Movement, and advance bravely. On the one hand, we can start from the assurance of political independence, and then economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication can be put into practice. On the other hand, we must make our greatest efforts in the three aspects of economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication to provide the greatest guarantee for political independence. The completion of the Greater East Asia War and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere lie in this. The revival of China and the defense of East Asia also depend on this.

### Minister of Construction Chen Delivers Speech

Nanjing, 1st [of the month] (Central News Agency) - Minister of Construction Chen has taken office and delivered the following inaugural address: "In order to establish a wartime system and give full play to efficiency, the National Government has resolutely reformed the administrative structure to concentrate power and simplify the organization. Such measures are indeed necessary in wartime. As for merging the Water Conservancy Commission into the Ministry of Transportation and reorganizing it into the Ministry of Construction to manage transportation, water conservancy, and urban construction, it is also one of the government's single化 policy. Transportation is the foundation of construction, water conservancy is essential for increasing production, and cities are transportation centers and economic hubs, which are closely related to the former two. Therefore, urban construction is also not to be delayed. To seek balanced development, a unified coordinating agency is established. Today, our country is dedicated to the Greater East Asia Liberation War, and has progressed from the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows to the action of sharing life and death. The development of various construction projects in the rear is not only related to ensuring the wartime life of the people, but also an element in strengthening the overall strength of the military economy and other aspects. In order to establish the foundation for national revival, enrich national strength, and cooperate with friendly nations to ensure victory, all our compatriots should promote奮勵 and assist the country in completing this era's mission as soon as possible. Regarding the work aspect, I have been in charge of the water conservancy industry for over four months, and all the projects that should be urgently handled this year have been planned and are being actively prepared and started. Now, having been ordered to take charge of construction, in addition to actively promoting the water conservancy project in accordance with the established plan, we should strive to improve the management of transportation undertakings such as railways, highways, shipping administration, telecommunications, and postal services, and further plan to expand them. As for urban construction, the central government and local governments must plan carefully before implementing it in stages. All of these are current priorities, which require considerable expense and time. The difficulties ahead are deeply daunting. However, I can only do my best under the guidance of the highest leader to repay the great trust. I hope that all parties will provide assistance and that the people of the whole country will work together to complete the great cause of national construction. I am extremely fortunate."

### Vichy Government Resolves to Organize Militia - Volunteer System to Maintain Domestic Security - Darnand Appointed Secretary-General

A decision was reached regarding the organization of the French militia. The organization will be based on the current veterans' groups, and 30,000 laborers will be recruited on a voluntary basis. In addition, it was decided to reform the organization of the existing French Gendarmerie. The organizational law for the newly formed French militia has been published in the official gazette, with the following main points: The French militia will be organized from selected members of the French people to engage in the reconstruction of France's political, social, economic, and spiritual life. The recruitment of the militia will be voluntary, but subject to strict scrutiny, and only those deemed qualified will be accepted. The militia must have the desire to protect the people and maintain order in France. Furthermore, as the militia is a political organization, it will also engage in propaganda and all aspects of economic, social, and cultural endeavors. Chief Laval has appointed Darnand, the current security director of the French Veterans Association, as the first commander of the militia.

Vichy, 1st (Havas) - French government Chief Laval has appointed Darnand as Secretary-General of the French militia. He is the Security Chief of the Solar League. The League has 30,000 members, most of whom are workers.

The unrest in northern France and the unstable attitude of the French army have created a political crisis, while the loss of resources in African colonies has created an economic crisis. The Communist Party is a threat to French security. The authorities have transformed the Gendarmerie into a military organization. The mission of the militia is to build France in the political, economic, social, and spiritual aspects.

### Economic Trends in Central China - Recruiting Talent to Strengthen the Economic Commission - Sino-Japanese Cooperation to Enhance Combat Power

February 1st, Continental New Paper

Now we have reached the second year of the decisive battle against Britain and the United States. The National Government should participate in the war, and the New China is also beginning to move forward at this time. Japan, in order to practice equality and mutual benefit, has decided to abolish extraterritorial rights in China, return concessions, and declare its policy towards China both internally and externally. It is expected that the economic policies of Central China will also follow this goal. The direction of Central China's economic progress this year became clear in January. Now, let's briefly list a few of the important economic matters:

Participation of the National Government

The National Government's participation in the war on January 9th created the biggest turning point in the economy of Central China since the start of the Greater East Asia War. This new path is the National Government's voluntary participation in the war, deciding for itself the direction that China should take. The Japanese side supports the National Government's participation in the war and changes its policy in China. With these two relationships, a new path is created.

The former means strengthening the National Government and implementing an autonomous economic policy. The goal is very clear. At the Supreme National Defense Conference on January 13th, the National Government passed a comprehensive reform of institutions. At the second Supreme National Defense Conference on January 20th, a new structure for the National Economic Commission was decided. The list of the new Economic Commission added seven people from the Northern China economic giants Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, and Wu Zhenxi. At the third meeting on the 28th, Qian Daqun, Li Quanshi, and eight others were added.

This time, the National Economic Commission invited private economists to participate, which is to closely combine the National Government, which has always been less accessible, with the economic community, and to consult the views of the economic community to serve as a reference for the National Government's economic administration. Preparing to harmonize economic controls with implementation, as a result, the representatives of the economic community all stood on the government's position. In other words, they stood on the side of control. In the future, following the plans of the commission, a new economic system will be established and smoothly promoted.

The latter is to consider and discuss the new China policy, with the Japanese determination to cope with the decisive war period as the first premise. The United States is trying its best to reverse the decline this year, so Japan has to put all its efforts into suppressing it. Because of this relationship, it is necessary to quickly strengthen the political power of the National Government to avoid future worries and adapt to the current needs to implement the transformation of Central China's economy.

What are the specific strategies for policy transformation? Although it has not been explicitly told to us, due to the various needs of the times mentioned above, its direction is of course: "Chinese affairs are handled by the Chinese." Because the National Government participated in the war, the past economic separation between China and Japan in China has been completely removed. This is a noteworthy point.

Food Countermeasures

The Japanese Army and Navy authorities stationed in Shanghai and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government issued a notice on the 11th of last month, restricting the movement of important food supplies. From January 13th, all important food supplies are prohibited from being moved into the Shanghai concession area or exported from the "cleansing" areas without proper procedures. The authorities have taken this measure to eliminate the collusion between the Shanghai food black market and the inland areas, stabilize rice prices in the production areas, and promote purchases to cope with this serious food problem. Since the publication of this notice, the price of rice has gradually returned to normal, not only in the Shanghai surroundings, but also in the "cleansing" areas. Because the Lunar New Year is approaching, farmers need cash, and now they can buy in large quantities, which is a good opportunity.

Since the beginning of January this year, the National Government's Ministry of Food has received strong assistance from the Japanese military authorities and has begun to purchase food, and the work is progressing very smoothly.

Controlling Prices

The strengthening of economic controls has become an extremely important issue due to Japan's decisive battle and the National Government's participation in the war. In this situation, the Public Works Department took two measures, first issuing a notice on January 23rd. Strengthening control measures, stipulating that the prices of all manufactured goods and wholesale goods must not exceed the level of January 23rd. From then on, the control of retail prices was also more severe than in the past. On January 27th, a notice was issued to restrict the transfer of cloth. The purpose of this measure is to prevent speculative transactions of cloth that take advantage of the opportunity to transfer cloth without the permission of the Shanghai Embassy Office. After the Public Works Department implemented this measure, then apart from the absolutely necessary transfer, there is no way to transfer, so the price limit of cloth is easy to maintain.

### Authorities Concerned About People's Food Supply - Decide to Increase Ration Quantities - Purchasing Situation Improved After Embargo - Bangkok Rice Supplies Needs of This City - Monthly Ration Per Person to be Increased by 1.2 Kilograms Again

Central News Agency, Shanghai - The relevant authorities are actively working to increase the quantity of rationed rice in Shanghai and to regulate the supply and demand of food. With the end of the Lunar New Year approaching, the authorities have decided that the quantity of rationed rice for Chinese people in the Shanghai area will be increased by another 1.2 kilograms (1.5 shi sheng) per person per month in the near future. At present, the quantity of rationed rice for Chinese people is 4.8 kilograms per person per month. After this increase of 1.2 kilograms, it will total 6 kilograms. As for the rationed flour, which is 2.5 kilograms per person per month, it will remain unchanged. Therefore, it is expected that the shortage of food will be greatly alleviated in the future. This increase in the quantity of rice is due to the fact that the purchasing situation in the rural areas of the mainland has improved after the implementation of the ban on the private transportation of rice to the Shanghai area on January 13. The amount of purchases has greatly increased. At the same time, the import of foreign rice is very smooth. However, the collection of fees in the mainland is still progressing gradually. After this, the anxiety of some of the people about the food shortage can be gradually eliminated, and it is expected that the black market transaction of rice will also disappear completely.

Strictly Inspecting Suspicious Pedestrians

A reporter learned from relevant sources that the authorities have been tightening their search efforts in recent days in order to thoroughly stabilize the rice market. Anyone carrying heavy packages, boxes, or suspicious pedestrians must undergo extremely strict inspections in order to prevent various food supplies from being stolen and transported for profit by petty thieves, and to reassure the people.

Purchasing as Much Rice as Possible from Various Regions

In order to maintain the food supply for Shanghai residents and fully ration household food, the authorities will purchase foreign rice from Bangkok, Vietnam, and divide the domestic rice-producing areas into five regions for unified purchasing. At the same time, the flour produced by flour mills in Central China will be supplied to the authorities as much as possible to meet the needs of the people. The rationing of household food in Shanghai will be planned and distributed by the authorities as a whole, according to the actual needs, and designated rice shops will be responsible for selling household food.

Purchasing Agencies Divided into Five Regions

The purchasing work in Central China was previously carried out separately by Showa Trading and the Gunbai Cooperative. The portion purchased by Showa Trading is purely for "special needs," while the portion purchased by the Gunbai Cooperative is supplied for general civilian use and for export to Japan. The Gunbai purchasing work was previously carried out by each business firm participating in the cooperative. Now, it has been changed to be handled by the local purchasing agency. There are five local purchasing agencies: (1) the Bengbu Purchasing Association, centered on the Jinpu Railway line and the Huai River basin; (2) the Anqing Regional Purchasing Association, centered on the Anqing section of the Yangtze River; (3) the Nanjing Regional Purchasing Association, centered on the Grand Canal; (4) the Suzhou Regional Purchasing Association, centered on the "cleansing" areas; (5) the Wuhu Regional Purchasing Association, centered on Huainan. The regional purchasing associations will make full use of existing organizations, such as the Japan-China Miscellaneous Grain Cooperative Committee in Bengbu and the Anqing Grain and Fertilizer Association in Anqing, and will not form new purchasing agencies. As for the purchasing associations in Nanjing, Wuhu, and other regions, there are no similar organizations that can be utilized, so they will be re-established.

Trying Every Possible Way to Regulate the People's Food Supply

A reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Japanese Cabinet has decided to allocate huge sums of money to subsidize the Central China Agricultural Assistance Association for the purpose of increasing agricultural production. With the government leading the way and the local authorities cooperating behind the scenes, there is hope for improvement in the food problem. (1) The Japanese side has allowed the Food Management Committee to handle the rice purchasing matters. (2) The Food Committee has now decided to reorganize into the Ministry of Food, and has decided to implement state management for rice purchasing. The purchasing work will be the responsibility of the specially established Rice and Grain Purchase and Sales General Management Office. (3) Food warehouse bonds of 500 million yuan will be issued for the purpose of purchasing and storing food. (4) The purchasing price will be readjusted to avoid the abuse of squeezing farmers. (5) A batch of foreign rice has recently been shipped in. According to the third economic agreement between Japan and Vietnam, Thai and Vietnamese white rice will continue to be shipped to Central China in the future. Therefore, the food problem in Central China has now shown signs of being resolved. This is a gratifying thing.

### Mayor Chen's Broadcast Speech

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) The Shanghai Branch of the China General Association of the East Asia League, in celebration of the second anniversary of the founding of the Nanjing General Association, has invited officials from various agencies in the city to give broadcast speeches starting yesterday (1st). Yesterday from 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM, Mayor Chen Gongbo was invited to give a speech on the second anniversary of the China General Association of the East Asia League and its significance on Shanghai Radio. The original words of the broadcast are recorded below:

Fellow citizens, today is the second anniversary of the founding of the China General Association of the East Asia League. It is also the occasion of China's participation in the war, and its significance is far-reaching.

It can be said that Dr. Sun Yat-sen was the originator of the idea of the East Asia League. His advocacy of Pan-Asianism in 1924 was a concrete expression of the East Asia League idea. Dr. Sun reviewed the current situation in Asia, traced its past glory, and knew that the various ethnic groups in East Asia, especially the Chinese and Japanese, had a close relationship of sharing life and death, and sharing joys and sorrows. Therefore, the East Asia League can be said to be a sacred product of history, and it is bound to happen.

In East Asia's geography and history, there is no China without Japan, and there is no Japan without China. Dr. Sun Yat-sen has already told us this, because if there had not been Japan's restoration and become a strong country in East Asia, China would have long been divided by the white British and American imperialists. The reason why Britain and the United States did not dare to rashly divide China was because Japan, which led East Asia, was there. But on the other hand, if China had been divided by Britain and the United States earlier, then the situation in East Asia would have long changed. East Asia would have been entirely in the hands of Britain and the United States, and Japan's restoration would have easily encountered difficulties. Britain and the United States would have put entire pressure on Japan. Therefore, from a historical perspective, the alliance of East Asian nations, the close cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese nations, has long been determined in politics, military affairs, economy, and culture. China hopes that Japan, with the position of leader of the East Asian nations, will assist China to make China strong and to take on the responsibility of the East Asian region. If China is weak, Japan's responsibility will be increased. If China is strong, it can shoulder a portion of the responsibility for the liberation of East Asia and can assist Japan to achieve the liberation of East Asia as soon as possible. Japanese intellectuals also feel this great vision, so they cooperate and support the East Asia League. From a historical perspective, during the Russo-Japanese War, China's power was very weak and could not resist the invasion of Manchuria by Tsarist Russia. Japan, feeling that it was its inescapable duty to defend East Asia, did not hesitate to sacrifice itself to declare war on Tsarist Russia. If China had had the power at that time, it would not have been necessary for Japan to sacrifice itself so much, and it could have driven Tsarist Russia's forces out on its own. This proves that China's weakness is harmful to Japan. Similarly, in today's Greater East Asia War, if the peoples of India, the Philippines, Burma, Malaya, and other countries had their own power, the Greater East Asia War would have been successful and victorious long ago. Therefore, the East Asia League hopes that all East Asian nations will be strong and equal, and that each will stand on its own position and strive to share the task of liberating East Asia.

I just said that Dr. Sun Yat-sen can be said to be the first person to advocate the idea of the East Asia League, but decades of environmental changes and the instigation of Britain and the United States have prevented this idea from being realized. Now, the idea of the East Asia League is gradually flourishing, and it can be divided into three periods:

1. The first period: since the July 7th Incident, the idea of the East Asia League has been a period of enlightenment. Chinese and Japanese intellectuals have strived to promote the East Asia League in order to clear up past misunderstandings and to implement cooperation, equality, and mutual support.

2. The second period: since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th, it has been a period of promotion of the idea of the East Asia League. Japan has used force to eliminate the evil forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia, so that the East Asian nations can return to East Asia.

3. The third period: since the National Government's participation in the war on January 9th, it has been a period of realization of the East Asia League. China has already taken out its strength to participate in the war and realize the East Asia League. After this, the East Asian nations will naturally all take out their strength to realize the East Asia League. Time is very short, and the speech is very simple. On the occasion of celebrating the second anniversary of the China General Association of the East Asia League, I would like to wish the East Asia League to be realized as soon as possible and the East Asian nations to be liberated as soon as possible.

### Hoping That All Sectors Send Fewer Letters

The Shanghai Postal Administration has been actively trying to clear and deliver mail from various places. However, due to the fact that land and water transportation in various places has not yet returned to its original state, it is difficult to deliver any kind of mail. The relevant authorities hope that all sectors will reduce the sending of unnecessary letters, which can not only save paper consumption, but also prevent the post office from accumulating large amounts of mail.

### The Two Settlements Requisition Hemp Bags; Overdue Confiscation and Punishment; Final Deadline is February 13th

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council issued notices in mid-last month regarding the requisition of inland grain shipments to Shanghai. They stipulated that from January 18th, empty hemp bags would be purchased at a fixed price and must be delivered to the requisition offices of the two settlements by a deadline. It is now learned that the authorities of the two settlements, considering the urgency of the deadline for requisitioning hemp bags, have requested hemp bag owners to cooperate and promptly deliver the bags for purchase at the set price. Furthermore, the deadline has been extended to February 13th of this year. If the empty hemp bags are not delivered to the requisition offices by this deadline, the goods of the owners will be confiscated, and the hemp bag owners will be punished.

### Continuing Mr. Bao Fu's Ideas

At this time of hardship, with devastation everywhere, the poor and sick are in a state of worry and suffering. Even the wealthy feel uncertain about the times and lack a sense of security. After reading Mr. Nie Yuntai's article "Methods for Preserving Wealth" published in the Shanghai Shen Bao, I was deeply moved. Disregarding my own limited knowledge, I wish to expand on his ideas and humbly seek correction from wise individuals within the country! Yang Yusheng

The ancients said, "The wealthy are unbenevolent," and also, "The virtuous are wealthy." These two sayings have opposite meanings, but in reality, everyone acknowledges that both are true. The wealth of the rich invariably comes from the flourishing of their businesses, accumulated from the labor and interest of everyone. If they enjoy their wealth alone, living in luxury and refusing to give, they will be envied by society. As the saying goes, "One family's warmth and fullness cause the resentment of a thousand families." They are thus seen as unbenevolent. Conversely, when a wealthy person sees the suffering of others, their fellow humans, and is moved to compassion and offers assistance, or when, guided by their conscience, they take out some money from their own pocket, no matter how much, to do good deeds, they are universally called "virtuous." Both are wealthy, but due to their different approaches to life, one is condemned as unbenevolent, while the other is praised as virtuous. There are also many wealthy individuals who sincerely do good for their own sake, regardless of the laughter and criticism of others, doing good deeds on their own.

Looking at Western history, there have been several wars fought to win freedom. And looking at the Republic of China after its establishment, there have been several civil wars fought by warlords and politicians to gain wealth. The pursuit of wealth seems to be the greatest aim of the masses. When meeting during the Lunar New Year, people first say, "Congratulations on getting rich." When entering the home of a scholar-official, you will see auspicious pictures of fortune, prosperity, longevity, and happiness hanging in the hall to express good fortune. "Fortune" refers to the hope of becoming a high official and getting rich. "Prosperity" refers to having a salary and not worrying about hunger and cold. "Longevity" refers to enjoying a long and healthy life. "Happiness" refers to having many children and grandchildren, bringing glory to ancestors and benefiting descendants. All of these represent the ideal picture of preserving wealth. However, how many families can realize this ideal? Even if they achieve this ideal state, becoming a high official and enjoying great fame, it is not necessarily a blessing! We often see that in fortunate families, the greater the fortune, the more anger there is. The head of the family is the receiver of anger. Zhang Gong's nine generations lived together, known as the "Hall of a Hundred Tolerances." The character "tolerance" (忍) is composed of "knife" (刀) and "heart" (心), signifying hidden pain that is not spoken. Enduring anger on the surface is a type of suffering. Gaining prosperity (祿) is also not easy. As the saying goes, "Receiving prosperity without merit is uneasy to eat and sleep." If you cannot fulfill your duty, you cannot receive your due prosperity! Receiving the prosperity of others means taking responsibility for them. Exchanging labor or sweat for money is not considered prosperity. The length of one's life cannot be calculated based on age. If a person cannot establish virtue, merit, or words, even a long life is premature. Wasting time is like being a stubborn stone, not keeping up with the times, and being falsely labeled as a "longevity head." Having too many children and grandchildren, traditionally considered having descendants, is truly a heavy burden of sin in the current difficult life. If they are not properly educated and cannot benefit society, their sins will extend not only to their ancestors but also to the parents. Many virtuous parents and glorious families are ruined by their children and grandchildren. The desire to preserve wealth is unfulfilled, which is truly lamentable.

I once tested the minds of elementary school students, asking them about the purpose of their studies. They all said, "To earn money in the future." Money is wealth, and although it is a good thing and can be used to enjoy life, it is not necessarily the right thing. I have asked many friends why they send their children to school, and they also say it is to allow them to earn money and become wealthy in the future, which makes me doubtful. I remember when I was young and receiving education, my teacher told me: "In books, there are houses of gold; in books, there are thousands of bushels of grain." This kind of teaching is not in line with the times. Nowadays, scholars cannot even afford food and clothing, so where are the houses of gold? Officials are public servants, and they are still worried about making ends meet, so how can they have thousands of bushels of grain? Reading Mr. Nie's article, he recounts the facts of prominent families educating their children, and quotes the teachings of Chinese sages, such as "Good fortune for the virtuous and misfortune for the wicked," and "Heaven's way diminishes excess and benefits humility..." The Qian hexagram says, "Able to benefit the world without prioritizing one's own benefit." Family needs say, "Filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" - these eight virtues emphasize a sense of duty and deemphasize the desire for rights. These are truly medicinal words and pearl-like sentences. I want to advise families to use these ideas to teach their children, not focusing solely on earning money and becoming wealthy, and they will naturally be able to preserve their wealth in the future. I also want to advise educators and teachers to teach elementary school students, with their innocent hearts, how to establish character and live their lives in the future, as this is the long-term plan for enriching the country and the family!

Mencius said to King Hui of Liang: "The King says, 'What can benefit my state?' The ministers say, 'What can benefit my family?' The common people say, 'What can benefit myself?' When superiors and inferiors contend for profit, the state is endangered." "Qin Shi Huang conquered the six states, becoming wealthy throughout the world. He wanted to create a business for ten thousand generations, building the Great Wall and seeking the elixir of immortality. However, Shi Huang died in Shaqiu at the age of fifty, and the dynasty lasted only two generations before perishing. This wealth of the state is unreliable. A Dream of Red Mansions narrates the rise and fall of a large family and their joys and sorrows. This wealth of the family is unreliable. Jesus said in the Bible: "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven." Buddha had great wisdom and intelligence, with twenty "no" characters in the Heart Sutra, indicating to people that everything is empty. "No color, sound, smell, taste, touch, or dharma" means cutting off the desire for wealth, and then one can have a mind without hindrance, without terror, and free from reversed dreams... able to remove all suffering. And Lao Tzu's philosophy actually says that nothing is greater than having a body, and even regards wealth as insignificant. In this way, wealth is not happiness.

Happiness is an internal thing, not an external one. It is self-aware rather than aroused by an object. Happiness is built entirely in one's own mind. Only in a life of contentment in poverty can one have the feelings of kites soaring and fish leaping. Even in a stormy environment, one can have the attitude of a benevolent person who is not worried. Even in the poverty of simple food and drink, one can still have Yan Hui's unchanging joy. Ibsen said it well: "Wealth can buy the shell of everything, but not its core. It can give you food, but not appetite; it can give you medicine, but not health; it can give you friends, but not loyalty; it can give you joy all day long, but not peace and interest." The nature of wealth is only like this. Now, times have changed, materials are scarce, and currency values fluctuate. Even if there are gold, silver, houses, and land, whether they are wealth still needs to be re-evaluated!

Several clever friends said, "To truly love your children, you should first teach them how to spend money, not teach them how to earn money. If they don't know how to spend it, earning it will be in vain. It is wise love to spend money on beneficial paths, generously helping others, and not being a miserly miser, lest they be envied and stolen from and suffer losses. Conversely, if they only focus on earning and not spending, they will inevitably resort to cunning and plunder. Money is fluid, and they will inevitably indulge in extravagance, harming their body and ruining their virtue. Loving them in this way is actually harming them." Therefore, the ancients said that accumulating wealth for descendants is not as good as accumulating virtue for descendants. In this time of uncertain world changes, wealth and status are like floating clouds. Doing good deeds and providing relief is also an investment. Rather than planning for temporary enjoyment for descendants, it is better to jointly plan for preserving the country and the family for a hundred years! Being able to earn money and being able to give is not unbenevolent. The wealthy should broaden their horizons and be willing to think of their poor and sick compatriots, helping each other through these difficult times. This is not only in line with the saying that "a virtuous person is wealthy," but also a shortcut to seeking happiness.

(Note) Written hastily, I am deeply ashamed of my limited knowledge. When I have more free time in the future, I plan to write "Scientific Methods for Preserving Wealth" to compare with Mr. Nie's ideas. It is not mysterious. I hope that economists, insurance experts, psychologists, and biologists will all share their insights.

### Various Trade Associations Strictly Assess the Standard Price Limits for Goods; Punishment According to Regulations for Any Exceeding Limits; Absolute Ban on Trading with Non-Industry Members

The various trade associations of this port, in order to uphold the intentions of the authorities, thoroughly stabilize the commercial market, and suppress the prices of various goods on a large scale, have successively established "Commodity Evaluation Committees" of each industry according to law to be responsible for evaluation matters. Progress has been particularly smooth. According to reporters, the matters under the management of the evaluation committees of various industries are divided into the following points: (1) Setting standard price limits; (2) Dispatching personnel to investigate the sales of goods by members of the same industry; (3) Conveying the opinions of the industry regarding the evaluation of commodity prices; (4) Finding ways to dredge the sources of goods from various places; (5) Adjusting the supply of goods; (6) Managing market transactions among industry members, etc. However, in order to achieve results, each industry is quite strict in its procedures. When ordered to evaluate the standard price limit of a certain commodity, it first sends a letter to the members of the respective industry associations, requiring them to submit the cost, source, amount of inventory, and transaction price among industry members of the commodity to the association by a specified date. Then, it convenes a meeting to strictly review the information. After the price limit is evaluated, it is submitted to the relevant authorities for review. After approval, evaluation forms are printed and distributed to members for compliance. If there are any violations, once discovered, they will be severely investigated. However, in order to achieve the effect of punishing one as a warning to a hundred, each industry has established penalty measures. Anyone who violates the price limit will be punished according to the relevant regulations, including expulsion from the association or denial of all rights. In addition, in order to clarify spot transactions and eliminate malpractices, each industry limits all spot and future goods transactions in the market to industry members only, strictly prohibiting resale to non-industry members, with the aim of preventing illegal hoarding and reducing the number of spot supply chips in the market.

### Truth About Yarn Industry Association Meeting: Only Reporting Government Laws and Regulations, No Exchange Matters

Regarding the news published on the 30th of last month that the yarn and cloth exchange would resume trading next month, stating that the industry association had obtained approval from the authorities to resume trading from the fifth day of the Lunar New Year (i.e., February 9th in the Gregorian calendar), but should comply with the limit price for spot transactions, and that the industry association had convened a meeting of directors and supervisors on the 27th of last month to decide and notify the industry members to comply, the Shanghai Special Municipal Yarn Industry Association stated in a letter, "This association is an industry association formed by collecting industry members. The members usually gather at the association to discuss spot business only. Therefore, this association is not a yarn and cloth exchange and has no exchange business. As for the convening of all members on the 27th, it was to report on association affairs and government laws and regulations. The outside world does not understand the truth and often mistakes this association for a yarn and cloth exchange, which is obviously a false rumor. The organization and affairs of this association should be corrected to avoid misunderstanding."

### Total Number of Inmates in the Shanghai Municipal Council Prison Last Year Greatly Reduced Compared to Previous Years: Part 6 of the Shanghai Municipal Council Annual Report

Last year, the total number of inmates detained in the Shanghai Municipal Council Prison, excluding the Juvenile Reformatory and foreign inmates, was greatly reduced compared to the previous year. At the beginning of last year, the three sections of inmates totaled 7,139, and at the end of the year, there were 5,441. The highest record was 7,139 on February 10th, and the lowest was 5,081 on December 27th.

Two Meals a Day

Last year, the Shanghai Municipal Council established a committee to study the reduction of prison expenses and investigate work conditions. As a result of the committee's recommendations, the boiler room and kitchen equipment were re-examined to save coal consumption, and a two-meal-a-day system was implemented in the prison. In addition, the ration of rice for inmates who did not work or were ill was reduced by one tael per day. This method was implemented for three months from September 14th to December 13th. According to the medical officer's report, the results were deemed inappropriate, as most of the inmates whose rice ration was reduced lost weight. The medical officer's report was then submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council for review.

Difficult Food Supply

Due to the difficulty of food supply, the supply of corn and sorghum was suspended. In the second half of last year, it was also difficult to obtain soybeans and wheat. Therefore, the two items of soybeans and wheat were temporarily replaced with rice and soybeans.

Last year, there were 1,576 inmates imprisoned for theft. As of the end of the year, there were a total of 2,235 such inmates.

The number of Chinese inmates totaled 6,954 on January 1st of last year, and 5,236 on December 31st. The highest record was 7,361 on February 10th, and the lowest was 5,081 on December 27th. The daily average was 6,346.

Amnesty and Commutation

Last year, a total of eight inmates were released in accordance with the Amnesty Act promulgated on June 24, 1932. The new regulations on amnesty and commutation promulgated on July 2, 1940, stipulated that inmates who committed crimes before March 30, 1940, could be granted amnesty or commutation, except for those with serious cases. A total of 1,111 inmates were released in accordance with this new regulation.

A total of forty-nine inmates were released in accordance with the parole regulations. The validity period of the inmate medical parole regulations expired at the end of the year before last. The relevant authorities did not announce an extension. Five inmates who had been granted parole in accordance with this regulation the year before last were released last year.

Juvenile Reformatory

There were eighty-three juvenile inmates in the reformatory at the beginning of the year, which decreased to forty-five at the end of the year. A total of ninety-one juvenile inmates were sent to the reformatory throughout the year, and 126 were released. The juvenile inmates' behavior in the reformatory was generally good, and the sanitary conditions were generally good. Last year, a teacher was hired to take charge of the juvenile inmates' education, and another teacher was hired in January 1943.

An official from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Children's Protection Section visits the reformatory once a week and provides assistance to juvenile inmates after their release.

### Fresh Milk Consumers in This City Should Register with the Shanghai Municipal Council

The Shanghai Municipal Council has recently issued Announcement No. 6255, which states that in order to ensure the fresh milk needs of children under the age of ten and patients, residents of the Public Settlement who obtain or intend to obtain a normal supply from the milk company at the official price should register the quantity needed at any of the council's certificate issuing offices on February 3rd and 4th, and February 9th and 10th. When registering, they must present their ID card or citizen card, and the doctor's certificate for patients and the household registration certificate proving the number and age of children must also be submitted for review.

### Grain Bureau Orders All Public Rice Shops to Pay and Release Rice on Time

The purpose of the city's implementation of food rationing per capita by the City Food Management Office is to resolve the threat to the food supply of the urban area. However, it has been found that the public rice shops in each district that handle food rationing per capita have failed to pay for rice and release rice on time, resulting in the failure to open the ration on time, which is contrary to the purpose of handling food rationing per capita. Therefore, the bureau has yesterday strictly ordered the joint office of public rice shops and the district public offices in each district of the city not to delay in the future, so as not to hinder the implementation of the food policy.

### Hot Water Industry Association Requests Sale of Cheap Coal

The Hot Water Store Industry Association of this port has previously received a large number of letters from members of the same industry, requesting to implore the authorities to approve the continued sale of cheap coal cinder for hot water, in order to reduce the cost of burning water. The association believes that the points stated by the members are factual and has submitted a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Settlement last month, appealing for the resumption of the sale of cheap coal as soon as possible, at four tons per household per month. At the same time, it also ordered the Yangshupu Water and Electricity Plant to sell the surplus coal directly to the industry association, and the members are responsible for purchasing and distributing it to solve the urgent need. The reporter continued to inquire from the association yesterday and learned that since the association sent the letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, it has been a week, but it has not yet received a reply from the Shanghai Municipal Council, or it may be delayed until the Lunar New Year to receive a reply. However, the members of the association are all in urgent need of goods and are looking forward to the authorities approving their request and releasing cheap coal as soon as possible, so that they can continue to sell water.

### Public Works Department Police Annual Report

According to the Public Works Department Police Annual Report, the Police Department underwent a comprehensive reorganization last year to improve efficiency. There were a total of thirteen shooting incidents between police officers and bandits, resulting in one officer killed in action and one injured.

Approximately 5,000 Police Officers, Over 200 New Recruits

As of the end of the year, the Police Department had 3,762 Chinese police officers, 302 Japanese police officers, 339 foreign police officers, and 465 Indian police officers. Excluding internal staff, there were 4,028 Chinese, 132 Russian, and 194 Indian officers under the supervision of the Police Department. The Police Department maintained good discipline throughout the year.

Seven Chinese police officers received special merit awards, and three Japanese police officers received awards. In addition, one Russian police officer from the Russian Auxiliary Unit received an award.

A total of 238 new police officers were recruited, including 187 Chinese, 27 Japanese, two foreign, and 22 Indian officers. All underwent training and were assigned to duties. The refresher courses on traffic control, police duties, and drills for Chinese and Indian constables were continuously conducted throughout the year.

Last year, the reserve team was dispatched to deal with one armed robbery case, one labor strike, one tram strike, six armed fights, four bomb throwing cases, one explosion case, four terrorist cases, and six false alarms. They also performed guard patrols and search activities. The overall work efficiency of the team was as outstanding as the previous year.

The Police Department handled 616 cases of lost children.

Taxi Licenses Issued: 400

Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War on December 8th of the previous year, the number of vehicles on the road has greatly decreased due to the Bureau's announcement restricting the use of automobiles to save gasoline. Only vehicles with triangular permits are allowed to operate. Many of these vehicles have been retrofitted to burn gasoline substitutes.

As a result of an agreement between the three municipal authorities, private car licenses issued in the concession or the city could be mutually used in the three districts, starting from the beginning of the year. This joint license measure was later extended to private bicycles, starting with a six-month trial period from July 1st. Over 95,000 people attended lectures emphasizing the importance of "Safety First."

In October of last year, the Bureau issued licenses to taxis that burn gasoline substitutes, allowing them to apply for operating permits. By the end of the year, 217 such vehicles had applied for licenses, of which 200 were approved and issued. At the same time, the Municipal Government and the French Concession Municipal Council issued 100 licenses. A total of 489 private and 1,264 public tricycles were licensed. 46,148 bicycle licenses were issued, compared to 53,231 in the previous year. This decrease is because residents of the western Shanghai area now obtain licenses from the Municipal Government, so the number of licenses issued by the Police Department was less than the previous year.

Last year, there were a total of 3,732 traffic accidents on the roads, resulting in deaths, injuries, or property damage, a significant decrease from the previous year. This is due to the sharp decline in the number of automobiles.

Increased Warehouse Rent by Jardine Matheson & Co.

Jardine Matheson & Co. issued a notice to grain merchants regarding the increase in warehouse rent: Dear Sirs, due to difficult economic conditions and a sharp increase in expenses, the warehouse rent will be revised from February 1, 1943, to 5 jiao in Central Reserve Bank notes per cubic foot for the main warehouse and 4 jiao in Central Reserve Bank notes per cubic foot for the East warehouse. All goods currently stored in our warehouses will be calculated at the new price.

### Tax Revenue for the First Half of This Year Expected to Reach 30 Million Yuan, Increase Expected in Various Tax Revenues

The total government tax revenue for the first half of this year is expected to reach 340,473,000 yuan due to recent increases in customs and salt tax revenue and revisions to the consolidated tax regulations, which is a significant increase compared to the same period last year. As for expenditures, the first half of this year will reach 600 million yuan. In order to balance revenue and expenditure, the authorities will find ways to modify the tax system. The estimated amount of various tax revenues for the first half of this year is listed below: (1) Customs Duty: 72,000,000 yuan; (2) Salt Tax: 32,700,000 yuan; (3) Consolidated Tax: 181,716,358 yuan; (4) Tobacco Tax: 2,191,600 yuan; (5) Stamp Duty: 2,140,900 yuan; (6) Mining Tax: 2,804,130 yuan; (7) Special Tax: 16,460,000 yuan; (8) Income Tax: 20,400,000 yuan; (9) Transfer Tax: 5,400,000 yuan; (10) Additional Silk Tax: 4,650,000 yuan.

### Spring Break for Schools is Approaching Quickly, Scholarships Still Depend on Donations, Many Generous and Righteous People in Shanghai, Cultivating the Younger Generation is of Utmost Importance

The approved list of students in the sixth grade of primary schools for the 4th Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship is announced today. The junior high school exam papers have been graded, and the high school students' papers are being reviewed. University applicants have been notified in the past two days to come to the office for interviews. The details are as follows:

### Thousands of Middle School Students Rely on Assistance from All Sectors

The approved lists of students in the fifth and sixth grades of primary schools have already been announced. More than 1,600 middle school students have applied for scholarships. These students have either lost their parents or come from impoverished families. Who is without feelings? How can we sit idly by? We are deeply grateful for the generous donations of more than 20,000 yuan from all sectors yesterday. In the past ten days or so, we have been appealing to all sectors for donations for students applying for scholarships, because the students are in urgent need of assistance. Scholarship assistance is like putting out a fire. Delaying action for a moment is tantamount to destroying the future of many aspiring young people. We have been entrusted with this important responsibility, and we cannot bear to see these young people lose their schooling due to our insufficient efforts. We hope that people from all walks of life will understand this heart and this wish. The approved list of students for junior and senior high schools will be announced soon. Each additional scholarship awarded means fewer people dropping out of school. All sectors must not bear to see so many young people fall into the sea of suffering of dropping out of school, so saving and rewarding them still depends on donations from all sectors. The goal of this year's 300,000 yuan scholarship fund is also the need of this year's scholarship applicants. We are now less than 100,000 yuan away. We hope that all sectors will generously contribute to complete the scholarship undertaking. This is the good fortune of the students, and also the good fortune of society.

Return Method for Application Documents

The return method for the transcripts and certificates attached by the applicants is as follows: (1) Those who are approved for scholarships will have them returned on the spot when they personally come to the office to collect the scholarship check; (2) Those who are not approved for scholarships will have their transcripts mailed back by this newspaper to avoid the trouble of traveling back and forth. Regarding the pending cases mentioned in the letters from all sectors, they will be submitted to the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Committee for case-by-case decisions. The handling methods will be announced in the coming days.

Scholarships Received Yesterday

Yesterday, the scholarship funds received totaled 2,500 yuan from Rong Feng Textile Company; 2,000 yuan each from Micki, Ching Kee, Tze Kee, Hsin Kee, Wong Kee, and Heng Kee; 1,000 yuan each from Ku Kee, Ching Kee, and Tzu Kee; 500 yuan each from Hsing Kee, Jung Kee, and Wang Tzu-yang; 450 yuan from Chou Yung-ching (extra reward for garden workers); 200 yuan from Chang Mei Kee; 100 yuan each from Chou Keng-hsin and Chang Chi-lai; 60 yuan from Shen Feng-piao (monthly donation); 50 yuan from Hsing Kee; 40 yuan from Hsieh Ho Hsiang Glass Company; 30 yuan from an anonymous person (receipt number 2455); 20 yuan from Tu Tsu-nien; 10 yuan from Ma Ching-chih; totaling 20,060 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. The previous balance was 222,071 yuan, 7 jiao, and 2 fen, leaving a balance of 242,131 yuan, 7 jiao, and 2 fen.

Joint Donation, Generous Surrender of Scholarship

Yesterday, we received a letter from Ku Kee and nine others supporting the Shen Bao's scholarship campaign, jointly contributing 15,000 yuan to benefit the poor students. We admire their generosity immensely. Also, Mr. Tsao Shih-pin wrote a letter stating that if his son is able to obtain a scholarship, he would give it up to benefit others. The letter states: "My son, Tsao Chi-feng, took the scholarship exam of your esteemed association this time without my prior consent. According to the scholarship regulations, it is designed to support poor students. Although my income is not high, I can barely afford the tuition for one son. There is no need to hinder others from seeking educational opportunities. If he fails due to poor grades, I will let it be. If he is admitted, I am willing to give up the scholarship and transfer the amount to help others."

Enthusiastic Assistance, Students' Gratitude

The newspaper received a letter from a street vendor the other day who has been setting aside 1% of his daily earnings from sales to donate. He has now collected more than 200 yuan. His act is deeply meaningful and shows a great eagerness to help. It is admirable that a small vendor, feeling the need for knowledge, has such a righteous act. The letter states: "I am a street vendor, and because of heavy burdens, I have to sell along the streets even in wind and snow. I am now so poor that I don't have enough food for the next day, but my desire for knowledge cannot be stopped by the environment. Since learning last year that your newspaper emphasizes the importance of education and launched a scholarship fund to help young people who have dropped out of school, I, as someone who has been there, deeply know the pain of dropping out of school. At that time, I vowed to do my best to help those with the same suffering. I thought of a way to set aside 1% of my daily business income, a few jiao each day. At first, I thought it would not have much effect, but little by little, it has accumulated to 205.7 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. I respectfully offer it all, but I think of how many wealthy merchants in Shanghai earn no less than tens of thousands every day. If they could donate 1%, the amount would be considerable." Also, Mr. Hsieh Yi-yun wrote in a letter: "I have received gifts from friends for the New Year, and returning them would be contrary to my original intention of not giving gifts. Therefore, I am converting them into cash to donate to your newspaper's scholarship fund, to benefit all my friends. I respectfully enclose 200 yuan and ask that the receipt be written in the names of Fang Yi-ao, Wang Yi-yai, and Pao Yi-hsiao." Also, yesterday we received donation letters from all sectors. Young readers Ma Hsiao-hsin and Hsiao-liang wrote in a letter: "We saw many children who don't have money to go to school and want to help them very much. We also saw that your newspaper has a scholarship fund, so my younger brother and I each donated 20 yuan. This is our allowance for several months. I think, we have food to eat and clothes to wear, what do we need allowance for? When we donated, our father was also next to us, and he agreed very much, so he also took out 60 yuan, making it 100 yuan. We hope to help pay for a child's tuition. If it's not enough, we will definitely have New Year's money in the New Year, and we will come to help again." (2) Mr. Wang Tzu-yang of Hsin Yi Construction Company wrote in a letter: "Our company holds a New Year's banquet every Lunar New Year to thank the colleagues for their hard work. In these difficult times, we can't bear to waste. Therefore, we are saving the banquet expenses of 1,000 yuan, sending 500 yuan to your newspaper and 500 yuan to the Hsin Wen Pao scholarship fund."

The fifth grade primary school scholarship was awarded yesterday. Young students came in the rain, lining up quietly at the payout location, with excellent order.

After the newspaper staff verified that the procedures were in order, they distributed the scholarships according to the approved amounts. The students who received assistance were all delighted. Seeing that they will become talented people in the future and contribute to society, they should drink water and think of the source, and never forget the expectations of the donors from all sectors today. This is what this newspaper repeatedly emphasizes to the students.

The students who receive assistance should be aware of their poverty and strive hard, hoping for excellent grades, which is the glory of the students. But remembering the source, the students should never forget the enthusiasm of the donors from all walks of life.

### Public Works Department Commodity Control: Summary of Important Administration (Continued from January 30th)

Changes in Key Personnel

Mr. Philippe, the former Chief Secretary and Director General of the Bureau, left his position as Chief Secretary on March 1st of last year. The position was filled by Mr. Teraoka Kohei, the Deputy Chief Secretary. The position of Director General was concurrently held by Mr. Okazaki Katsuo, the Chairman of the Board. Mr. Teraoka Kohei resigned from his position as Chief Secretary in December. Major Bowen, the former Commissioner of Police, retired on February 19th. His vacancy was filled by Mr. Watari Masaru, the First Deputy Commissioner of the Police Department. On February 21st, the Bureau approved the resignation of Mr. Smythe, the First Deputy Commissioner of the Police Department, and appointed him as an advisor to the Commissioner of Police. He later resigned and returned to his country in August. Dr. Jordan, the former Director of the Health Department, resigned on July 31st. His vacancy was filled by Dr. Tashiro.

Revision of Land Regulations

In September of last year, the Bureau established a subcommittee to discuss the revision of the Land Regulations and its appendices. The committee members were Mr. Okamoto Otsuichi, Mr. Grote, Mr. Godown, and Mr. Xu Jianping. The committee sought the opinions of the heads of various departments and the Legal Department submitted a draft of the new regulations. The committee conducted a thorough review of this matter and provided various opinions to the Board of Directors.

Last year, the Bureau drafted several new appendices and amendments, submitted them to the Consular Body for approval, and announced them separately.

Establishment of a Comprehensive Committee

Previously, the Bureau established a Comprehensive Committee on December 11, 1941, in order to integrate the work of various emergency committees and to make quick decisions on various matters. Since its establishment, it has achieved remarkable results. Last year, the Board of Directors of the Bureau believed that in this extraordinary period, the handling of various urgent matters should be expedited so that there would be no need to obtain the approval of the Board of Directors or the Standing Committee. Therefore, the Bureau granted special powers to the Comprehensive Committee to handle all matters. However, matters relating to the Bureau's administrative policies and principles should still be submitted to the Board of Directors and the Standing Committee for approval. Over the past year, the committee has met two or three times to deal with complex matters too numerous to mention. The members of the committee are currently Mr. Okazaki Katsuo (Chairman), Mr. Godown, Mr. Grote, Mr. Ozawa, Mr. Jie, Mr. Kawamura Makoto, and Mr. Bislip (Secretary).

Prohibition of Issuing Vouchers

On June 27th, the Bureau issued a notice prohibiting the issuance of vouchers from the 28th of the same month. All companies and firms should recall all previously issued vouchers before July 11th. When recalling the vouchers, they should be exchanged for cash. Customers should not be forced to exchange them for goods. As for gift certificates issued by department stores, they are still allowed to circulate, because gift certificates are purchased by customers as gifts for relatives and friends. They can be exchanged for items of the same value at the respective companies, which is different from the nature of vouchers.

No Price Increases Allowed

On June 15th, the Bureau issued another notice stating that from June 17th, the retail prices of all items sold in the Public Concession, regardless of their nature or type, should be calculated in Central Reserve Bank currency. The prices converted to Central Reserve Bank currency should not exceed half of the average price calculated in old legal tender from May 26th to 28th. Without the Bureau's approval, no increases should be made without authorization. As for the various items for which the Bureau has set price limits, prices should still be charged in accordance with the provisions of the various notices.

The Bureau also issued a notice on June 10th, stipulating that the retail prices of various items, which had been converted into Central Reserve Bank currency before May 26th, should not be increased without authorization after that date without the Bureau's approval. Violators will be dealt with according to regulations.

Three New Taxes Levied

At the beginning of 1941, the Bureau established a Standing Subcommittee under the Finance Committee, named the New Tax Revenue Subcommittee, to study the implementation of new tax regulations. As a result of repeated discussions, the committee proposed several suggestions for levying new taxes. After consideration by the Bureau, three new taxes were levied in the previous year: the telephone tax, the 10% tax on hotel and teahouse bills, and the 2% tax on retail goods. Before these new tax measures were approved for implementation by the Bureau, they were submitted to the Special Advisory Committee for discussion and received its approval. (End)

### Public Works Department's Price Control Implementation Last Year (January 27th)

Questioning Procedure Similar to Court

All cases, which are suspected by Investigation Team lawyer to have violated the regulations, are transferred to the Price Control Implementation Group for review. The Price Control Implementation Group currently has five lawyers who are responsible for handling the interrogation matters of the cases. The interrogation procedure is similar to that of a court. All those suspected of violating the regulations have the opportunity to defend themselves and are allowed to go to the Bureau for questioning with a lawyer. They may also apply to the Executive Committee for reconsideration, and then be summoned for questioning again. At that time, they are allowed to submit new evidence on the original decision of the Executive Committee.

Executive Committee Serves as Judge

The judgment of the case is made by the aforementioned Executive Committee. The committee is supervised by the Director-General of the Bureau. The committee members include two Bureau directors and one senior police officer. The committee gives special consideration to each case in light of the circumstances, and tries its best to avoid unfairness. However, if the committee obtains sufficient evidence to prove that the violator has indeed violated the regulations and has engaged in conduct that harms the public interest, it will not hesitate to punish them.

Scope of Work Expanding

The scope of the Commodity Control Office is expanding day by day. Therefore, the important work of the Investigation and Price Control Branch is also increasing. The most urgent task of the department now is to crack down on speculation and black market transactions. In the future, the penalties for such transactions will be extremely severe in order to eliminate the main factors that disrupt people's livelihood. Through this organization, the Bureau will work with other authorities that currently control many major commodities, such as cooking oil, matches, soap, candles, etc., to improve people's livelihood. It is hoped that for their own benefit, the citizens will fully cooperate with the Bureau and support the Bureau's measures to improve people's livelihood. (End)

The Shanghai Cooking Oil Industry Wholesale Office, in order to meet the needs of residents during the Lunar New Year holiday, has specially ordered the Group A retail stores to sell 2,500 piculs of cooking oil over two days. The distribution of oil according to the number of people is still in progress.

### New Silver Dollar Square Ingot: Uneven Quality

Yesterday, there were only scattered transactions of new silver dollars, new silver squares, and new silver ingots. Wholesale business is still difficult to move. The market is actually affected by uneven quality and is difficult to prosper. Moreover, coarse quality is rarer than fine quality, so the market is also uneven. More than seven-tenths of coarse quality must be sold at 24,000 yuan per ton. Two-tenths to six-tenths new silver yuan squares are sold at 16,000 yuan per ton. New silver ingots are priced at 20,000 yuan per ton (quality is added appropriately). New triangular iron is 24,000 yuan per ton. Zhenghao hacksaw blades are 45,000 yuan per ton. Circle head soft steel road skin is 30,000 yuan per ton. Jianpi light brand steel is 17,000 yuan per ton. Tobacco skin head is 30,000 yuan per ton. All of the above goods are priced by the Chamber of Commerce, and the industry is not allowed to sell them at higher prices privately.

### Tobacco Exchange Association Market Officially Reopens

The market of the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association has been automatically closed since the beginning of December of last year because the market prices of cigarettes and daily necessities have been manipulated by speculation and continue to rise. The persons in charge of the industry association are deeply afraid that the rising momentum will be unlimited, so the industry transaction can only be carried out informally outside the market. It has been two months now. The association has been actively preparing all the reopening procedures since the end of last year, such as re-registering the industry in the city, re-issuing new passes, revising market rules, and electing 18 market supervisors. By the 26th of last month, everything had been prepared, so the reopening was informal, but it only lasted for one day and was banned by the authorities. The industry association authorities deeply felt that this would not be a good policy in the long run, so they strongly requested the authorities to allow the market to officially reopen. It is now known that the authorities have accepted the request of the industry association, so the market of the industry association has announced its official reopening since yesterday. After the reopening, the various transaction methods will remain the same as before, but 15 market supervisors will be re-elected to take office, and the authorities will also send personnel to the market to supervise, so the transactions of cigarettes and daily necessities can always be brought into the right track.

### Cigarettes Turn Firm and Strong Again

The cigarette market, the prices of British and American goods have turned firm and strong, and the prices are still moving upwards. The rise in Japanese and domestic cigarettes is still slow. Great Britain brand is 13,100 yuan, Old Gold is 10,650 yuan, Pinhai is 7,800 yuan, Wuhua is 6,800 yuan, Little Fairy is 8,150 yuan, Japanese cigarettes Golden Gun is 3,000 yuan, Golden Building is 3,800 yuan, Red Rose is 2,600 yuan, Quanlu brand is 3,600 yuan, Nianzhi is 3,100 yuan, Guide brand is 2,850 yuan, domestic cigarettes Pyramid is 6,700 yuan, Beauty brand is 6,100 yuan, Golden Mouse is 4,150 yuan, Platinum Dragon is 4,500 yuan, all of which have risen compared to the weekend.

### Soap and Candle Sales Are Quiet

The daily necessities market is quiet in terms of sales, and prices are stable. Phoenix brand matches are 4,000 yuan, Beauty brand is 4,200 yuan, Golden Tripod brand is 3,400 yuan, miscellaneous brands are 2,250 yuan, Tongmu soap is 780 yuan, White Xiangmao soap is 720 yuan, Yellow Xiangmao soap is 650 yuan, Scissors soap is 740 yuan, White Label candle is 560 yuan, Monk Hat brand is 480 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 340 yuan. All are reported to be stable.

### Everyday Medicines Are Firm

The selling prices of everyday medicines continue to rise, because hoarders are collecting them without sparing any effort. Those who hold the goods are also firmly holding on and intend to sell them at good prices after the start of spring, so the market presents a trend of rising without falling. Headache powder is 40 yuan, Balm is 54 yuan, Bagua Dan is 48 yuan, Partridge Tea is 76 yuan, Dragon Tiger Ren Dan is 47 yuan, all of which have risen.

### Overview of the Canned Food Market

— Hua Yun

The Association Makes Every Effort to Suppress the Black Market: Distribution Will Continue After the Spring Festival

Since the Greater East Asia War, imported canned food has been subject to control by the authorities. Except for agricultural products, fruits, and vegetables, which are allowed to move freely, other marine products such as scaled, shelled, and shelled seafood and poultry and livestock meat must be transferred to the authorities in charge (the Food Section of the Embassy Office) to request the issuance of a movement permit before they can be moved. At the same time, due to insufficient inventory and declining sources, there are occasional shortages. And European and American goods will disappear, causing prices to rise repeatedly. No matter what kind of goods, they are very popular. Fellow traders and non-industry hoarders have been searching and purchasing in various ways, and high prices have been seen repeatedly. The market conditions for canned food, which have never had much ups and downs, have actually been rising day and night.

In April of last spring, with the assistance of the United Association of Japanese Importers and Distributors of Friend Nations in Central China, and with the approval of the competent authorities, the Shanghai Special Municipality Bottled and Canned Food Industry Association was organized, with its headquarters located at 759 Jiujiang Road in the city. Since its establishment, it has first sought to solve the problem of supply of goods, and has made great efforts to dredge the source to the authorities concerned. On one side, it has promoted the rationing system and openly rationed it in newspapers. The market conditions once tended to stabilize. Afterwards, due to the small number of goods dispatched, there were too few porridge and too many monks, which was not enough for distribution. It has also aroused the black market and dark trading, and some illegal fellow traders have cooperated with those who have strong connections to raise prices and search for goods, and even asked third-country foreign merchants to buy them in large quantities from Hongkou. As a result, the supply quantity of the United Association? The number of public allocations has decreased day by day. The goods of the Association and the Friendly Association's sales combination are all supplied by the United Association. Japanese canners in Hongkou prevent resale and hoarding and do not sell to Chinese merchants, while general illegal speculative traders use foreign brokers to buy from them in order to fulfill their desire for hoarding, and they get high prices and reap huge profits. On one side, they requested the combination to allocate them again, causing a panic that the inventory of the United Association was running out. Based on the above factors, it stimulated the black market and created an unprecedented record of dark trading. For example, a box of three-dozen 550-watt Tonghe films of pineapple was only 3 cents of French currency per hearing before the incident, but now the black market is actually trading at more than 600 yuan per box, which is difficult to buy. Compared with the association's allocation price of only 212 yuan and 10 cents per box, the difference is as much as more than 400 yuan. It is indeed a shocking initiative. It is heard that the association has requested the United Association to prohibit the resale of private goods and to notify all friendly association members.

Although the association has only been in existence for more than eight months since its establishment, it has made its best efforts to openly distribute goods, and there have been four phases. The most recent fifth batch of allocation goods has been agreed by the United Association to supply a large number of goods. In order to help the authorities suppress prices and eliminate the black market, it has been decided to openly distribute after the Spring Festival, and the method of improving the allocation is now being studied. As for the prices, there is still no change. After that, the black market transactions will probably be severely hit. Although it is now the end of the old lunar year, the market is still very firm. The recent market prices are listed on the left:

All of the above are the official standard products, so the selling price is the same regardless of the brand.

### Group A Cooking Oil Retail Stores: Continue to Sell Oil for Two Days Starting Yesterday. No Confirmation on Distribution Based on Population.

The Shanghai Cooking Oil Industry Distribution Office, in order to meet the needs of citizens for cooking oil during the Lunar New Year, has purchased approximately 2,000 piculs of cooking oil from the military authorities and distributed it to the Group A cooking oil retail stores throughout the city. The sales have been continued for two days starting yesterday (1st) and will be sold out today (2nd). As for whether the oil sales will continue to be divided into Group A and B or whether the oil will be distributed according to the number of people, there is no confirmation yet.

Free Talk

### On the Principles of Division of Labor and Cooperation

— Yale

After reading Mr. Chunqiu's article "Work and Remuneration" in "Free Talk," I would like to express some thoughts from the perspective of young professionals. Indeed, the disproportion between work and remuneration is a common phenomenon in various industrial and commercial organizations. Mr. Chunqiu has already provided concrete descriptions, and I do not wish to add to them. However, the unreasonableness of work and remuneration leads me to think about the issue of "division of labor and cooperation."

In any enterprise with a considerable scale, there are departments for internal and external affairs. Each department has a person in charge and staff members. The powers and responsibilities are different and divided. This distinction in the nature of work is what is called "division of labor." Whether handling routine official matters or related affairs, there are certain steps from beginning to completion. During the process, there must be contact between departments and between personnel, whether in writing or verbally. This mutual contact and cooperative form is what is called "cooperation." In short, in any enterprise, there are rules for division of labor and cooperation, and the practitioners have the same goal. The saying "different routes to the same destination" can represent a concrete explanation of "division of labor and cooperation."

The above is just an outline of "division of labor and cooperation." In fact, analyzed in detail, division of labor is related to technical issues, and cooperation is related to personnel issues. Technology is the prerequisite for division of labor, and personnel is the prerequisite for cooperation. However, technology cannot be separated from personnel, and personnel cannot be separated from technology. The two are interdependent. Only when there are no problems in technology and personnel are handled appropriately can the effect of division of labor and cooperation be fully achieved.

What is meant by division of labor being a technical problem, to put it plainly, is the problem of "using people." Because there are many different types of work in an enterprise, it is necessary to distinguish techniques in terms of employment. After technical differentiation, division of labor begins. However, the beginning of division of labor is quite difficult because there are no established rules to follow. This requires careful consideration of the issues of "choosing people according to the task" and "exploring tasks according to the person" in the future, to ensure that all talents are used appropriately. When talents are used appropriately, it conforms to the principle of division of labor. Then, situations such as "disproportionate remuneration and work" and "busy people are too busy, idle people are too idle" that hinder business should also be resolved through fair measures.

What is meant by cooperation being a personnel problem is that any enterprise requires cooperation between superiors and subordinates, and the main condition for cooperation lies in personnel. Proper personnel management can avoid many overt or covert disputes, enabling everyone to have genuine sincerity in cooperation and generating a spirit of mutual cooperation. However, in the matter of cooperation, those in leadership positions must have a rationalized personnel management structure, but practitioners must also have the virtue of being dedicated to their duties. Many practitioners in industry and commerce do not understand that cooperation is a mandatory duty and are very casual about their duties. If this does not affect the overall situation or burden other colleagues, that is fine. Otherwise, due to personal irresponsibility, lack of the virtue of cooperating with others, and lack of the necessary discipline in service, the entire profession is often prone to direct and indirect losses.

Obstacles are naturally unavoidable in the conduct of any business. However, division of labor and cooperation are important issues in any enterprise that cannot be ignored. Therefore, I humbly present its general outline, hoping that wise leaders and outstanding practitioners in industry and commerce will work together.

### Impressions of "Begonia"

— Qinmin

The play "Begonia" is quite long, taking up four hours and twenty minutes in the theater. While watching the play, I often noticed the expressions, sighs, and tears of the surrounding audience. This can very well explain how this play gripped the audience's heartstrings. But to me, it seemed like just revisiting a familiar story. In my childhood, I often liked to run around amusement parks: a warlord, a performer, an oppressed concubine, and a treacherous and wicked adjutant, plus some arrangement of joys and sorrows, and thus a tragic, lingering, and heart-wrenching drama was formed. At that time, I was indeed deceived into shedding quite a few tears, but as soon as I walked out of the theater door, wiped away my tears, I forgot everything, and I would never think about it again after returning home. This performance of "Begonia" is nothing more than that, except that "Begonia" has a tighter structure and has undergone formal rehearsals. Therefore, it is superior to those variety show civilization dramas in terms of quality, and at the same time, it exerts greater power in moving the audience!

In short, from this performance, we can see that both the script and the director paid great attention to the audience's reaction. Like in the third act, Ji Zhaoxiong's accusation of the relationship between Qiuhaitang and Luo Xiangqi, the on-the-spot coercion, crying, and beating were enough to make the audience feel very excited and tense, and the final reunion and happy ending are the most welcome to the psychology of the petty bourgeoisie. I admire the author and director of "Begonia" for understanding the psychology of the audience and achieving success; but I also regret that their success is only a success in terms of audience numbers. They have indeed attracted those audiences who often run to variety shows and the New World to the Carlton. But is such attraction an improvement? I think that even the most business-minded drama directors and actors cannot but admit that drama should include the meaning of educating the audience and raising the audience's standards! So, will this performance of "Begonia" be of any help to the future of drama? Will it make today's drama take the path of decline like the previous Ai Mei dramas? I think these are all questions worth considering.

Speaking of the actors, Shi Hui's Qiuhaitang in the first half was not dashing enough, the second half was more of a play where he could发挥 his acting skills. Although restricted by the script, his acting skills were generally solid and mature. Shen Min's acting has improved slightly compared to before, and she was able to express Luo Xiangqi's dignified and graceful demeanor quite well. However, her consistently flat tone when reading her lines needs to be changed. Yingzi is still working hard, but I think her understanding of the role of Mei Bao is not very accurate. Mei should have two sides to her personality: on the one hand, she is infected with the lively style of a female student, and on the other hand, because of her background, environment, and other reasons, she should be precocious and melancholic, while Yingzi's performance makes her too "hard" and not enough to arouse sympathy.

### Reading "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" (6)

— Hua

——To My Daughter

But since this is the case, why do people all over the world, from ancient times to the present, rarely add any derogatory terms to those parents, but only advise children to be filial? Originally, there are some incomprehensible things, such as when a woman encounters rape, the formula on the rape side cannot avoid the sudden rise of lascivious thoughts, leading to many things. The commentators afterwards always do not blame the rape, but only ask whether the woman has surrendered, to determine whether to write poems and compose fu to praise or to punish her by being despised by mankind. But that is rape, and it is really excusable to rarely reason with rape. Why do you take the same attitude towards the occasion of parents? Is it not a hidden concern for the world and people's hearts that parents are so cruel, harsh, and abuse their children? It is already a tragic thing that children's age and intelligence are limited, and they cannot escape the net of the family; those who make up stories also take this to teach, advising people to be filial to answer is simply intentionally persuading children to surrender to violence. Childhood habits become nature, and habits become natural. In this way, what is learned from childhood will definitely be a docile slave accustomed to kneeling to the powerful when they grow up. This may be exactly what the storytellers intended, because it is beneficial to him and the emperor and the rich. However, Chinese people can become emperors and the rich, and foreigners can also come to China to become emperors and the rich. Some people say that the Chinese people have a weak national concept and are good at flattering foreigners, etc. In fact, this is not entirely true. Foreign forces can come to China, needless to say, it is always power. Kneeling to power has long been a habit? There is also no time to distinguish between Chinese or foreign. If you don't mind stretching it too far, then tell me how much relationship those brilliant stories have with the emergence of traitors and obedient people today, I am afraid it is not an excessive exaggeration.

"Wu Chuwen Lu" has not been flipped for many years, and there are no books on hand, so based on the impression I saw a few years ago, the discussions on filial piety inside are generally agreeable. Lu Xun's saying about "governing the world with filial piety" in "Wei Jin Demeanor and the Relationship between Medicine and Wine" is also very insightful. You may wish to recommend it to readers. As for me, I feel that since the family system still exists and social changes cannot be completed in a day or two, and the family economy is in the hands of the parents, and the parents probably all love their children, then today, entrusting our nation's future masters to others is not as suitable as entrusting them to their respective parents.

The scholars and professors of today have a wonderful theory, saying that filial piety is youth culture, and detailed discussions are rare, and I don't quite understand what the reason is. Filial piety is naturally all about youth, but if you look at some of the unhealthy creations in the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars, filial piety does not seem to be youth culture, but a culture that makes youth suffer and suffer. And the gentlemen who make this wonderful theory are no longer young, and they are sitting high in a chair to guide the youth and receive the worship of the youth. It is not difficult to figure out how much correctness there is in their words. (Reward for poverty relief)

### "One Heart and One Virtue" and "Perseverance"

— Junhao

"One heart and one virtue" can be replaced by "concentration," and "perseverance" can be replaced by "persistence." Originally, when doing the same thing, why does he get 100% results; but I am always not as good as him, and even achieve nothing. Does his success have some mysterious magic? Or does he have his own unique genius? In fact, he is a person, and I am also a person; he has five sense organs and four limbs, and I have not lost anything either. The reason why he succeeded is really because he knows how to be "concentrated" and "persevering."

To be concentrated, you must first start with perseverance and composure. Perseverance is the cultivation of will, and composure is the cultivation of action. After being well-cultivated in these two aspects, you can enter the realm of concentration. Because the road to success is not only full of vines and thorns, but also full of all kinds of dazzling and charming temptations, this temptation will shake your will at all times and make you doubt your original goal. At that time, you will step into a fork in the road, and your persevering will and calm actions will immediately break up with you. Without a persevering will and calm actions, you cannot talk about concentration. Finally, it will make you helpless, and you will see others rise straight to the top, but you are still failing in the exam.

Perseverance is persistence. I don't know how many articles have been written about the benefits of persistence in doing things. However, the cultivation of perseverance is indeed not an easy task. People often say: so-and-so does things well, but unfortunately he has no perseverance. Indeed, there are too many people in the world who start strong and finish weak; and all those who start strong and finish weak, who have a beginning and no end, will never achieve anything in their work, let alone any great achievements. What exactly are the prerequisites for perseverance? On the one hand, you must be able to not be dominated by the environment; on the other hand, you must bury yourself in advancing towards a goal. In the meantime, you need the spirit of hard work and endurance, as well as the attitude of courage and diligence. With the spirit of hard work and endurance, you can have a body that has been tempered thousands of times, thereby overcoming the environment to the point of dominating the environment; with the attitude of courage and diligence, you can have the mood to work hard and do hard work, thereby overcoming obstacles and moving towards a bright future.

### The Teacher of All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

(10) (1)

Suddenly, a series of thoughts surged in, pressing so tightly that Chips could not open his mouth, and could only answer to himself. What did these exams and checks have to do with anything? What did all this efficiency and modernization have to do with anything? Ralston managed Brookfield like a factory - a factory to produce a snobbish culture based on money and machinery.

The traditions of the old families and vast fields are changing, no doubt they must change; but Ralston does not expand them into a true democracy, including both aristocrats and commoners, but narrows them into a thick bank account. There have never been so many rich kids at Brookfield, the garden party on the day of the speech is like Ascot. Ralston met those rich men in various clubs in London, and seduced them, saying that Brookfield was exactly the school for advancement; since they could not use money to buy their way into Eton or Harrow, they greedily swallowed this bait. Some of them are extraordinary like伙—although others are normal. Financiers, company founders, pill manufacturers. One of them gave his son five pounds a week as pocket money. Vulgarity... exaggeration... but everything consumes corruption and maturity... Once, Chips told a joke about a student named Isaaestein and his ancestors, so he got into trouble. That student wrote home about it, and old Isaaestein wrote an angry letter to Ralston. Irritable, no sense of humor, no sense of proportion - that's all these new guys are... No sense of proportion. Especially more important than everything is the sense of proportion, which is what Brookfield should teach. Not so much Latin or Greek, or chemistry, or arithmetic. You can't hand out test papers to them, give them certificates, and test this sense of proportion... (28)

### Fellow Villagers of the Laochan District Baojia Donate to Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund

The heavy responsibilities and sighed magnitude of the mission of elementary school teachers, and the meager treatment they receive, are recognized by the public. In the face of rising living costs at sea, elementary school teachers earn only one or two hundred gold per month. How will they cope with this living environment? If they unfortunately suffer from illness, they will inevitably suffer from poverty and disease. The emotions of their groans and pain cannot be described in words. The purpose of this newspaper's initiation of the "Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund" is to stimulate human sympathy and provide practical assistance to poor teachers. Yesterday, we received a generous donation of 500 gold from the fellow villagers of the Laochan District Baojia, along with a sincere letter. Their kindness is very grateful. The original letter said: "Your newspaper has a long history and pure opinions. It is the mouthpiece of the people and can do its best to advocate for social charities, benefiting the people greatly. We deeply admire it. Now your newspaper has initiated the Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund, and we express our sympathy all the more. The importance of the status of elementary school teachers and the hardship of their lives cannot be believed by those who have not experienced it firsthand, even if they are told. They work hard all day, and they are still worried about their own food and clothing, let alone supporting their parents and raising their children. Once they are invaded by illness, where will the consultation fees and medicine expenses come from? The painful situation must not be describable in words. Your newspaper, in view of this, pioneered the medical aid fund to benefit elementary school teachers. We will do our best to follow in your footsteps, and we hope that social leaders and people from all walks of life will respond, so that poor elementary school teachers will not be forced by poverty and illness, and affect their sacred work. Then, the beneficiaries will be directly the elementary school teachers, and indirectly our children. Now, we are enclosing 500 gold, which is saved from our daily expenses, to express our support. Sincerely, the fellow villagers of the Third Bao of the Fourth Sun Bao of the Lao Zha District."

### Tuberculosis Lecture (1) The Most Dangerous Age of Life

Germany's lung examinations for university students are very strict. Between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five, they must undergo mandatory examinations. The results found that active tuberculosis accounted for 0.5 to 1.8%, inactive tuberculosis accounted for 27%, and various tuberculosis phenomena were found to increase with age, until the age of twenty-five. The most numerous phenomena of various early symptoms were at the age of twenty-two. Therefore, young people around the age of twenty can be regarded as the most dangerous period of life. All young people in this period should undergo strict X-ray examinations to prevent them, which is the key to lifelong health and happiness.

### Anti-British and American Association Scholarship Registration Deadline Today

After the recent heavy snow, followed by overcast rain, coupled with the biting cold wind, the skin feels like it is about to crack. The students who registered had to wade back and forth, which was very hard. Fearing that due to the long distance, inconvenient transportation, or other accidents, they could not register as scheduled, the Anti-British and American Association Scholarship Office has extended it for two days, so that they have enough time to handle it calmly. It is heard that the association has decided to close the registration at 4:00 pm today (2nd). This is the last day, and those who have not registered are requested to hurry up and handle it, so as not to delay themselves. Applications will not be accepted after the deadline. As for the examination date and location, they are currently being negotiated. Once they are ready, they will be published in this newspaper.
