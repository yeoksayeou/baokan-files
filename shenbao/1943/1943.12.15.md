### From Cairo to Tehran—International Questions and Answers

Question: Since the Cairo Conference of the United States, Britain, and Chongqing and the Tehran Conference of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain each issued their declarations, they have aroused considerable discussion among the general public. What is the significance of these two conferences?

Answer: In essence, these two conferences are entirely consistent. However, from the perspective of the actual world situation, they are quite different. The consistency lies in the fact that in the new stage of the current world war, due to the new developments on all fronts of the Axis powers, and the evolution of the war situation in Europe and Asia, it is necessary for the anti-Axis countries to achieve coordination in their war strategies and political issues between each other. This is a consistent requirement. The differences lie in the fact that the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and Chongqing have different intentions and positions, and even have many difficult-to-resolve contradictions between them. Chongqing could not participate in the US-Soviet-British conference, and the Soviet Union had the dilemma of having to avoid participating in the US-British-Chongqing conference. The most important point here is the subtle existence of Japanese-Soviet relations and the contradictions between the Soviet Union and Chongqing. Everyone knows that Stalin is a famous realist today. He will never accommodate the Chongqing regime that is currently embroiled in friction with the Communists, and he cannot ignore the serious consequences of violating the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact.

Question: In that case, the fact that the Cairo and Tehran conferences were held separately indicates that the greatest contradiction among the anti-Axis countries has not yet been eliminated. However, the results of the Roosevelt-Churchill-Chiang conference have already been announced. What are the results and trends of the Cairo Conference?

Answer: The Cairo Conference lasted five days and discussed three issues: first, military issues; second, the purpose of the war; and third, the issue of seizing Japanese colonies. However, the Cairo Conference also had the distinction between the Roosevelt-Chiang conference and the Roosevelt-Inonu (Turkish President Inonu) conference. The latter's discussion focused on the Pacific issue, while the former's discussion was entirely a method for Britain and the United States to prevent Chiang from "wavering" and to win him over. In fact, what Chiang Kai-shek got was only empty promises. He could not but admit the fact that the anti-Axis world strategy "continues to prioritize dealing with Germany". Therefore, what did Chiang Kai-shek bring back from this trip? This is indeed a big question.

Question: So, the Cairo Conference was actually just a new development of the United States and Britain's psychological warfare, and it doesn't seem to have any significance.

Answer: Indeed. But looking at the issues concerning the countries of Southeast Asia in the declaration, it guarantees that Malaya, Borneo, Burma, etc. will remain "British", the Dutch East Indies will remain "Dutch", and the Philippines will remain "American". These new countries in the South that have been liberated and made independent with the help of Japan, the Roosevelt-Churchill-Chiang conference actually attempted to make them fall back under the rule of the old imperialist order, which shows the true face of the Cairo Conference even more clearly.

Question: Standing on the position of the East Asian nations' struggle, we naturally only have hatred for the Cairo Conference declaration. But what about the Tehran Conference?

Answer: The Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin Conference had been publicized for a long time. The previous Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers seemed to be taken quite seriously by all parties. We had already pointed out that this was just a preparation for the Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin Conference. However, the result gave people the impression of just being a "big fanfare for nothing". From the perspective of the tasks of this conference, on the one hand, it was to continue the principles of the Moscow Conference and further determine the common strategic policy against Germany. On the other hand, it was for the three giants to personally discuss the postwar international countermeasures policy. Now, apart from declaring to "attack Germany jointly from the north, east, and south," only a declaration on the Iranian issue was issued. No wonder American public opinion almost unanimously expressed disappointment with the Tehran Conference, and the Soviet Union also believed that it was "absolutely necessary" to hold a second or third conference.

Question: In this case, the Cairo Conference and the Tehran Conference are just two interludes in the development of internal contradictions and the evolution of the international situation within the anti-Axis camp, and they are not worth paying attention to at all?

Answer: That's not entirely true. The holding of the Cairo to Tehran Conferences and their results have more or less shown the anti-Axis countries' emphasis on the current war situation, a certain degree of mutual understanding, and attempts to carry out new inducements and threats against neutral countries. Therefore, whether it is for Europe or for East Asia, we should recognize this fact, unite as one, strengthen our own combat power, to defend national liberation and the promotion of the new order.

### Japanese Air Force Continues to Bomb New Guinea Airfields, Britain Admits Difficulties in Central Pacific Operations

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – According to a South Pacific Japanese military base, on the New Guinea front, Japanese Army Air Force units, in formations of fighter-bombers, attacked the Marawasa airfield at 8:30 AM on the 12th. Japanese fighter squadrons engaged four to five enemy P-40 aircraft, shooting down two of them (one unconfirmed). The bomber squadrons heavily bombed more than ten enemy aircraft parked on the ground, four of which were hit and caught fire. Subsequently, two more facilities were hit and caught fire. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft was shot down by its own bombs. On the same day, another Japanese squadron bombed the Tebi airfield at 3 PM. Three locations within the airfield were hit and caught fire.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – A South Pacific military base reports that Japanese naval aircraft attacked enemy airfields and military facilities on Gedney Island and Trobriand Island at the eastern end of New Guinea Island on the night of the 13th. Two locations on Gedney Island and three locations on Trobriand Island were hit and caught fire. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – A South Pacific military base reports. The integrated battle results obtained by the Japanese army in the vicinity of Wau, New Guinea Island, from December 1st to the 10th are as follows: 562 enemy soldiers annihilated, 3 prisoners captured, 3 enemy vehicles destroyed, and 5 torpedo boats sunk. Captured items include 3 mortars, 6 heavy machine guns, 6 light machine guns, 5 automatic rifles, 25 rifles, and 3 hand grenades. In addition, other items were also seized in large quantities. The Japanese side suffered 86 battle deaths.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – A South Pacific base reports that on the 10th, more than twenty enemy unified B-24 aircraft came in several waves to attack Mili Island in the Marshall Islands. Japanese fighter squadrons immediately intercepted them, shooting down five of them. One Japanese aircraft was damaged.

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) – Since the Anti-Axis forces suffered unprecedented losses in the operation of American troops landing on the Gilbert Islands, the value of the offensive operation in the Central Pacific has been doubted, and this has become more and more obvious recently. The British Chronicle recently reported on the Battle of Tarawa, pointing out that an offensive operation in the Central Pacific is impossible. It is said that according to various news and photos of the Tarawa Island landing operation, it can be seen that the American troops have already exhausted their manpower and resources. Therefore, it is acknowledged that the offensive operation in the Central Pacific is actually somewhat difficult. According to the American Navy, when landing on Tarawa Island, it will send transport ships to advance to the coast of Tarawa Island. Because they were fiercely attacked by Japanese artillery fire, many were sunk or stopped, so they had to change the flavor to enemy boats with almost no armor. The fierce artillery fire of the Japanese army advanced to the coast, and it did not gain a foothold until late at night on the first day of the attack. British military experts have also pessimistically stated that in the Central Pacific, there are still countless coral island villages like Tarawa Island, and successively conquering these islands will require greater sacrifices than the battle of Tarawa Island.

### Japanese Army Defends Burma, Builds Solid Positions, Enemy Has No Intention to Fight, Many Flee

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a front line in Burma on the 14th reports that due to the repeated defeats, the Americans and British are frantically clamoring for a counter-offensive. In order to respond to the attacks of the Pacific war zones, they are now also spreading propaganda about recapturing Burma from the India-Burma border. However, the commander of the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces, Mountbatten, and Zhu have not made any remarks about this, but the commander of the British Indian Army, Auchinleck, has mentioned the difficulty of recapturing Burma. The Japanese army on the Burma border has already deployed solid positions along the Nu River line to approach the rear base of the Chongqing army. The Japanese army on the India-Burma border is also waiting for an opportunity to attack India. Therefore, it is difficult for the enemy's disorganized forces to shake the Japanese army's actions. Moreover, the desertion incidents of the British Indian Army have also made it difficult to suppress. If we observe the enemy's movements after the rainy season, we can know the future counter-offensive trend of the enemy army. The suffering of Britain in India is due to the birth of the Provisional Government of Free India. The food panic in India has deepened. The anti-British movement among the Indian people has also become increasingly fierce. The wavering of the Indian soldiers has become a public internal crisis. Therefore, the enemy recently replaced the first-line Indian troops with troops sent from Africa in the name of the "New Deal". Moreover, in the enemy camp, internal conflicts frequently arise due to the disunity of command. The truth is known from the mouths of prisoners. Moreover, the equipment and organization of the Chongqing army are purely American-style, and the commanders are almost all Americans. Therefore, when the Japanese army attacked the west bank of the Nu River, the Chongqing authorities stood by and watched, because they did not cooperate with the American officers. At the same time, they also deeply understand that the equipment and training of the military in the area have not reached a certain state, and it is not enough to confront the Japanese army. Furthermore, the enemy to the east, upon hearing the news of the Japanese army, is eagerly preparing for defense. According to recent news, about 200 soldiers have deserted from the enemy army in that area, indicating that the soldiers have no intention of fighting. However, the elite Japanese troops on the Burmese front are waiting to annihilate them with firm determination. Therefore, the iron wall of defense in Burma is becoming increasingly solid.

Japanese Army Attacks Chongqing Army in Burma

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – According to a certain front line in Burma, the Japanese army noticed that a large number of Indian and Chongqing troops were gathering on the northern border of India, with a posture of launching a counter-offensive operation from northern Burma.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – A certain base on the Burmese Japanese army front line reports that on the 10th, the Japanese army air squadron patrolled the air route of the Burmese army and engaged in an air battle with the intercepted enemy aircraft above Carlsborg, shooting down four enemy PC aircraft, one B25 aircraft, seven P40 aircraft (one unconfirmed), and one P25 aircraft, totaling thirteen aircraft. The Japanese side had four aircraft shot down by their own bombs or failed to return.

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Major General Davison, commander of the U.S. Tenth Air Force, recently stated that the Japanese air force in Burma is extremely strong, and the U.S. Air Force has encountered strong attacks after two seasons.

Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Army's main force, in a joint formation of dozens of fighters and bombers, once again bombed Guilin at noon on the 12th, fiercely attacking the enemy's barracks area and the ammunition depot. Large fires broke out in various places, destroying five Chongqing aircraft on the airfield. At the same time, it engaged in fierce battles with more than twenty Chongqing P/38, P/47, and P81 aircraft that intercepted them, shooting down and damaging eighteen P40 aircraft, six of which were unconfirmed, and two P38 aircraft, unconfirmed, totaling twenty aircraft. Seven Japanese aircraft also failed to return in this battle.

### War Results of the Japanese Army on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Line

The war results obtained are as follows: 168 bodies of the Chongqing Communist Army were abandoned, 135 prisoners were captured, and 9 automatic artillery pieces, 1098 rifles, and 106 hand grenades were seized.

### Calcutta Bombed, Barracks Extremely Shocked, Eastern India Falls into a State of Terror

Yangon, 14th (Central News Agency) – The joint squadron of Japanese Army and Navy fighters and bombers bombed the city of Calcutta on the 5th, giving the enemy a great shock. New Delhi Broadcasting also admitted that the damage was great. According to the information obtained by the authorities, the military facilities in Calcutta were severely damaged by the Japanese aircraft bombing, and the most severely affected were a group of Indians, who were actually personnel from the British Indian government and British and American military relations agencies. Because they had previously overestimated the security of Calcutta, thinking that there were a large number of anti-aircraft guns in the city, which was like a huge defensive fortress, the Japanese aircraft could not invade this time and were subjected to this fierce bombing, their beliefs turned into even more terror. The first to flee the city during the bombing were the British and Americans. The British and American shops on the city's famous bustling streets were closed, and the personnel went to safe places such as Bombay in the four parts of India to take refuge. The officials of the Calcutta government relations agencies and the workers of the docks and factories also took refuge in large numbers. As a result, trams and buses in the city were suspended, and the functions of the docks near the harbor and the military city were completely paralyzed, and order has not been restored to this day. The British Indian government was extremely embarrassed by the large number of workers fleeing the city to take refuge. Propaganda officer Ahmed tried his best to use newspapers and radio to appeal to the workers, but it was ineffective. The impact of the Japanese aircraft bombing has spread from Calcutta to various parts of eastern India. Now, Visakhapatnam, Coromandel, and Madagascar are all in a state of terror. It is especially noteworthy that after the bombing, the unstable atmosphere of the Indian soldiers became more intense, and incidents of British officers and Indian soldiers clashing and Indian soldiers fleeing in large numbers occurred from time to time. The Eastern District Command has recently frequently requested the New Delhi British Army Headquarters to request countermeasures against all Indian soldiers, hoping to send important personnel to go there.

### Chongqing Army Defeated Near Niutoushan

Hankou, 14th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the front line in Central China, a certain unit of the National Army is fighting side by side with the Japanese army on the southern front.

The surviving troops are about one division, and a mopping-up operation is currently underway.

### Key Points of Bose's Speech in Java

Jakarta, 14th (Central News Agency) – Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, arrived here the other day. On the 11th, he attended the Indian Congress held at the Jakarta Stadium and delivered a speech on the spot. The main points are as follows: I believe that Gandhi's policy of non-resistance since 1921 cannot realize the freedom of India, and life in prison cannot have any effect. Therefore, I left India. Now India is directly fighting in the Greater East Asia War to win India's independence. When I opened the report of the fall of Singapore, I deeply realized that Britain's national power was rapidly collapsing. The incompetence of the British army has increased our fighting spirit. Therefore, even if the United States provides assistance, the collapse of Britain is inevitable. Wavell and Mountbatten are also just puppets of the United States. The Indian government has been recognized by 19 countries and has obtained the Andaman and Nicobar Islands from Japan's protection. I have been imprisoned in the Burmese prison. I visited Burma the other day and was very happy to see that the British forces have been completely cleared out. India will also have such a day. We now have an army and are now receiving spiritual and material support from Japan and the one billion people of Greater East Asia. We are ready to march into our motherland, hoping that our compatriots will contribute our strength and financial resources to carry out this war and win the final victory.

### Malignant Malaria Epidemic in Northern Guangdong

Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency) – According to news from the Shaoguan Dagongbao, a malignant malaria epidemic has recently spread in the Zhuanbei area. Due to the lack of medicine, the situation is very serious. According to the Guangdong Provincial Government Health Department of Chongqing, by the end of November, more than 100,000 people have been infected in Shaoguan City alone, and the number is still increasing day by day. Because it is difficult to buy quinine cream, counterfeit drugs are rampant in the city, which has delayed many victims. The authorities are currently working hard to crack down on it. At the same time, smallpox has also occurred in the area. Moreover, the weather is getting colder day by day, and there is a lack of food and clothing, which has caused the people under the rule of Chongqing to live in a miserable situation.

### Ambassador Kui Hosts Banquet for Mayor of Nanjing and Party

### Japan to Submit Seven Draft Laws to the Parliament, Outlines Already Decided in Yesterday's Regular Cabinet Meeting

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government held a regular cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10 AM today. Prime Minister Tojo and all cabinet members attended. First, Chief Secretary Hoshino explained the outlines of the seven draft laws to be submitted to the 84th session of the Parliament, which were then decided. Then, Director-General Moriyama of the Legislative Bureau reported on the results of simplifying official affairs, saying: "The abolition of official administrative affairs or making them simpler, and the consolidation of permission and approval matters, etc., the transfer of authority from central government offices to local government officials reached as many as 1,938 cases." In addition, it was also decided to implement the second and third consolidation of the authority of government offices, and to transfer as much authority as possible to local government offices. The meeting adjourned after 11 AM.

### Japan's Total Budget for Next Year is 15.243 Billion Yen

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – The total amount of the general accounting revenue and expenditure budget of the Japanese government for Showa 19 (1944) has been decided by the cabinet meeting on the 10th to be 15.243 billion yen. This is an increase of 5.248 billion yen compared with the initial budget of 9.995 billion yen this year. Compared with the expenditure budget of 14.224 billion yen for this year, including the supplemental budgets of the 81st, 82nd, and 83rd sessions of the Parliament, it has also increased by 1.219 billion yen. This is truly a huge budget to respond to the decisive phase of the third year of the war. Moreover, in the future, the additional budget for the tax increase plan, the additional temporary military expenditure budget, and the expenses for subsidies for enterprise consolidation and the construction of buildings for population evacuation will all be included in the additional budget, which will also reach a considerable amount. Therefore, it is expected that the budget amount for next year will reach a huge amount of about 20 billion yen. The most noteworthy thing about this budget proposal is this astonishing huge amount, which is unprecedented. There are many things in its content that should be paid attention to. First, the priority budgeting of the ten important policies decided by the cabinet meeting with all its strength before this. The expenses for these ten items reached more than 1.5 billion yen, and the goal can be said to have been achieved first. Next year's budget, which focuses on enhancing combat power with aircraft as the center, enriching the domestic defense system, and ensuring the wartime food supply of the people, already has the essence of a wartime budget. Second, based on the established policy of strengthening the flexibility of the budget, the first reserve fund has been increased by 20 million yen compared with Showa 18 (1943), and the second reserve fund is 500 million yen, with a reserve fund of 2.1 billion yen. This 2.1 billion yen reserve fund accounts for 14 percent of the total expenditure, which is equivalent to the total expenditure of the Sino-Japanese War. Third, based on the policy of thoroughly simplifying the budget, the work of consolidating the budget items has been made more flexible, and the adaptability to the decisive stage has also been increased. In short, the budget for next year has been removed from the form and content of the budget, all non-wartime colors have been removed, and a pure wartime budget has been formed. Moreover, the political budget and the general accounting budget can only give a rough idea of the budget for next year, but the full picture can only be understood after the additional temporary military expenditure budget is decided. It is difficult to predict how huge the additional temporary military expenditure budget will be, but it is thought that it will never exceed 27 billion yen this year. Therefore, it can be known that the total budget for next year is a landmark decisive battle budget. The 100 million people of Japan will also gladly accept the government's policies, work hard to increase the production of military materials, and increase national savings to adapt to the implementation of this large budget.

### People of Chongqing in Dire Straits

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Chongqing's economy has been further ruined by the war, and the people's situation is even more dire. This winter, the lives of Chongqing residents are extremely bleak. According to the Chongqing Daily Telegraph's Chongqing Report, the current situation in Chongqing is as follows: Chongqing is currently inhabited by three types of people: local residents, officials, and foreigners. The number of local residents has greatly increased due to the influx of people from the surrounding countryside. They are mostly engaged in commerce. There are approximately 200,000 officials, including their families, mostly from Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. As for the number of foreigners, excluding Anti-Axis soldiers, there are less than 1,000, mostly British, about 200. The number of Americans has recently increased and may soon exceed the British, as the number of U.S. diplomats stationed in Chongqing is gradually increasing. In addition, the United States has sent representatives and experts to Chongqing to oversee the implementation of the Lend-Lease agreement. The greatest difficulties faced by people in Chongqing, both Chinese and foreign, are approximately four: the difficulty of finding housing, the high cost of living, the inconvenience of transportation, and cultural isolation.

(Note) 1. This table is based on the Japanese Navy's overall war results in Separate Table 2. Damage to naval vessels that cannot be attributed to the U.S., Britain, Holland, or are unknown are all attributed to the U.S. The ratio of ships sunk to ships destroyed is 9/10 for U.S. ships and 1/10 for British ships.

2. For human losses on naval vessels, for those sunk, it is calculated as 1/2 of the vessel's standard crew (1/5 for Pearl Harbor), and for those destroyed, it is 1/5 (1/10 for Pearl Harbor). When submarines are sunk, it is assumed that all crew members perished. Sinking also includes bombing.

3. The average size of each ship is 5,000 tons, with a sinking-to-destruction ratio of 1:2. The ratio of troop transports to supply ships is 1:3. Furthermore, 9/10 of the ships sunk belong to the U.S., and 1/10 belong to Britain.

4. In the case of troop transports and supply ships sunk, 1/2 of the standard crew is counted. In the case of destruction, the former is 1/5 and the latter is 1/10.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Announces Details of the Sinking of the Huatai; Bereaved Families Gather to Discuss and Demand Compensation

Central News Agency Report: Regarding the sinking of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Huatai ship in Xingang, the company's spokesperson made the following statement: After receiving news of the Huatai ship's disaster in Xingang on the afternoon of the 10th of this month, the company immediately established a Huatai Disaster Handling Committee to begin various activities. It also telegraphed its Tiensheng Port resident to rush to Xingang to assist. At the same time, the company's Shanghai branch sent six personnel, carrying rescue supplies, on the Xuchang ship, which departed directly for Xingang that night. The following is an account from one of the dispatched personnel and the Huatai ship's first mate who returned yesterday:

The Scene of the Tragic Sinking

The ship arrived in port slightly later than scheduled, reaching Xingang at 7:00 PM on the 9th. At that time, the local passengers boarded more than 30 sampans and civilian boats. Before the passengers inside the ship disembarked, they rushed to the ship's bow and crowded down, and the captain and crew members could not stop them. As a result, both disembarking and boarding passengers gathered on one side of the deck, and the ship lost its center of gravity. The ship became unstable and tilted sharply. Water poured in through the side doors, rushing in rapidly and uncontrollably, and the ship sank almost instantly. At that time, Japanese [omitted characters] and [omitted characters] anchored near Xingang immediately sailed to the scene of the accident to make every effort to rescue the escaping passengers. As a result, the work was very difficult in the darkness, and with the assistance of various sampans and civilian boats, about 250 people were rescued. The whereabouts of most of the others are still unknown. The company's agent immediately lit fires to warm the rescued victims, provided them with food, clothing, and supplies, and diligently cared for them. At the same time, they made every effort to search for those whose whereabouts were unknown. Subsequent developments have not yet been reported.

Deep Regret for the Incident

The occurrence of this incident, ultimately resulting in the loss of numerous lives, property, and the ship at the bottom of the sea, is deeply regretted. To prevent the recurrence of similar incidents in the future, the company's committee immediately telegraphed ships at sea and in port, sending people to issue serious warnings to all ships entering the port. Furthermore, when passengers board and disembark a ship, they must respect public morality and must not lose self-control. At the same time, they must obey the instructions of the ship's authorities, which is the company's sincere wish.

Accounts from Passengers Who Escaped

According to passengers who escaped the Huatai and bereaved families who spoke to Central News Agency reporters: The Huatai Shipping Company stated that the cause of this accident was entirely due to passengers rushing to board the ship, disobeying order, causing the ship to lose its center of gravity, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy. However, the crowded conditions of passengers and cargo on the ship sailing to Xingang have not been for a day. It is really irresponsible to avoid taking appropriate precautions and measures on weekdays, and to merely make empty words of excuse after the accident. At the same time, regarding the issues of post-mortem arrangements for the deceased and compensation for the families, the company has not yet made any clear statements or arrangements, which is particularly disappointing. The bereaved families are currently gathering to discuss ways to negotiate with the company based on reason.

Yesterday's News Release Time: 7:05 PM

Economic World

### Commentary: 500 Yuan Notes

In the past two weeks, the rising prices of goods have led to all kinds of unreasonable prosperity, all stemming from the rumors that the Central Reserve Bank would issue 500 yuan notes. Now, Finance Minister [omitted character] told Central News Agency reporters that "this matter is purely a groundless rumor, as the Central Reserve Bank's issuance is very sound and there is absolutely no need to issue 500 yuan notes." From now on, the public can rest assured and at least not strengthen the psychology of valuing goods higher and valuing currency lower.

Speaking of the rumor of 500 yuan notes, we cannot help but think about the future of Central Reserve Bank notes. Those who are not completely ignorant of economics all know that whether wartime prices can be stabilized depends on whether there is a way to control currency. Now that Central Reserve Bank notes are gradually becoming standardized, the public's trust in Central Reserve Bank notes should not be constantly doubted. The government's responsibility is to enable Central Reserve Bank notes to strengthen themselves through their own strength, making themselves the only reliable currency in circulation. At the same time, to the extent possible, the government should make the public aware of the amount of national currency issued, so that they have no reason to have the idea that the currency is constantly inflating. In a word, the actual strengthening of Central Reserve Bank notes is the only way to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. All other price policies are merely temporary solutions.

### Silver and Banking Industry Encourages Savings, Increases Deposit Interest Rates, Absorbs Idle Social Funds for Production

Under the leadership of the National Bank, various silver and banking firms are making every effort to encourage national savings in order to promote the inherent virtue of saving, absorb idle social funds for production, curb speculation and hoarding, and stabilize finance to ensure people's livelihood. In addition to holding thrift savings activities starting from the 8th of each month, they are jointly offering bonuses for fixed deposits as an incentive.

According to inquiries from reporters to the silver and banking industry, various firms have taken into account market conditions and have raised deposit interest rates (including savings trusts and ordinary deposits). It is reported that the weekly interest rate for ordinary current deposits has been raised to 4 to 6 li. The lowest weekly interest rate for fixed deposits is 1 fen, depending on the fixed term. The monthly interest rate for commercial current deposits at Qianzhuang has been raised to more than five yuan. The lending rate has also been raised separately, generally 3 fen per month, but is negotiated separately based on the credit of each transaction. It is also reported that current deposits in Shanghai banks are currently more than fixed deposits, and the average deposits of banks with a long history and established credit are over one hundred million yuan.

### Capital Increase for Banks, Extension Approved for Three Months

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Finance previously promulgated capital increase measures in order to consolidate the financial foundation of Shanghai. Starting from July 1st, all banks were ordered to complete the capital increase by the end of this month. Banks that fail to meet the Ministry's regulations by the deadline will be subject to penalties or ordered to suspend business. However, some older banks, seeking stability, plan to transfer profits into increased capital after the year-end closing this year. Therefore, at the beginning of this month, the Shanghai Banking Association submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for a six-month extension. A reporter learned from relevant sources that this request has been approved by the Ministry of Finance, and the deadline has been extended by three months to the end of March next year. Other capital increase regulations remain unchanged.

### Various Associations Eliminate Malpractices and Establish Trading Regulations

In view of the fact that some businesses in the city still engage in illegal trading, the various industry associations of this city believe that these malpractices should be thoroughly eliminated. Therefore, they have specially drafted detailed trading regulations and notified all businesses to strictly abide by them. The purposes of establishing these regulations are fourfold: to assist the government in implementing economic policies; to promote the public welfare of businesses; to correct malpractices in business operations; and for businesses to jointly obtain and distribute raw materials. Once a business is found to be in violation of the industry regulations and evidence is found, the board of directors of the association will decide on the method of sanction, and those with serious circumstances will be reported to the relevant authorities for punishment in accordance with the law. These industry regulations are divided into two parts: price and business operations.

### Commercial Situation Summary

Government Bonds: Yesterday's prices rebounded again, with Class C rising the most sharply. The rise in other varieties was less pronounced. This is just a temporary phenomenon due to short covering. Whether it can continue to rise depends on the sentiment of the market. Class A opened peacefully, then retreated slightly. After 10:30, the buying side suddenly gained the upper hand, rising sharply, with repeated high prices. The difference between high and low prices was seventeen or eighteen. The final price at noon was higher than the previous day. Because it has not been traded for a long time, it is roughly similar to the previous price. Class E was up by about a foot, and the trend seemed to be changing.

Call Loan Rate: The interbank call loan rate of the Banking Association was listed at 1 jiao and 8 fen, unchanged.

Daily Necessities: Amidst the calls for more supply and less demand, the price of candles soared. Baitishi set a new high price again. Matches and soap were still stable.

Cigarettes: Due to the scarcity of goods from the factories, Dingjin cigarettes were in good demand, and prices rose accordingly, especially the miscellaneous brands. The Yizhong factory's cigarettes also rose slightly.

Food: The market continued to rise yesterday. Exacerbated by rumors in recent days, the general public has added considerably, resulting in a surge in demand. Vendors took the opportunity to raise prices, and prices of both thick and thin rice were raised by several levels. Oil grains also rose by two or three levels. However, it was finally heard that the authorities will take measures to suppress it, and the upward trend in the future may be contained.

Rayon: Yesterday, it was weak first and then recovered, finally similar to the previous day. The closing price of 120 Denier Tianqiao was still 6 guan and 4 ban.

Industrial Raw Materials: It is still strong recently, especially caustic soda is more stable, white alkali is also strong, and Vaseline is close to the critical point.

Tea: The market is still becoming increasingly firm, mainly because the shipments of the trade associations are still not weak. However, the owners still intend to hold up, so buyers find it difficult to accept. The market situation is optimistic due to more demand and less supply. A total of 21 dan of green tea were handled by Shuntai Tea Firm, and 16 boxes of black tea and five of silk tea were handled by Ding Yuetai and other tea firms. According to people in the industry, the shipment of fried green tea and roasted green tea has not been weak in recent days, but the stock in the market is limited, so the selling price is expected to be good.

Woolen Cloth: Recently, affected by the fear of coal and electricity shortages, the cost of living has not been reduced. Raw materials are expensive and difficult to obtain. Due to various environmental factors, factory output has been reduced again, and manufacturing costs have increased. The stock in the market continues to be lacking, especially the shortage of non-rayon woolen cloth and bise, which is even more scarce and highly sought after, creating a situation where it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. Regardless of thick or thin, good or bad, all kinds of summer goods are rising or soaring. Silk and yarn fabrics, linings, etc., also have risen without falling.

### A Diligent and Hardworking Scholarship Founder

My uncle is a middle-aged businessman, and his words are essential and police. Those who listen to him are moved. Helping the poor is his nature, and he is praised for it and is happy to be close to people. He is the only person in his hometown who is enthusiastic about social services, and those who have benefited from him are countless. Later, due to the early death of his eldest son, he established a scholarship, one to commemorate the deceased and one to select good talents, so that some poor children could complete their studies. He also planned to expand it in order to reserve talents for the country and use them for the country. Unfortunately, due to the continuation of the war, he had to temporarily suspend it. Not long after, he co-founded another scholarship with others. Although the scope is small, his motives are deeply admirable. My uncle admires "Zeng Wenzhenggong Family Letters" very much, and often explains the meaning in the book to his children. My father is a person with both new and old ideas, often advising the elderly to refrain from stubbornness and despotism, and the young not to be extravagant and impetuous. He must often refer to ancient books and extract their essence to cultivate his character. There are often people from all walks of life visiting his door, some asking for advice, some sponsoring, and some requesting. In terms of material enjoyment, both he and his children still advocate simplicity. Plain clothes and simple meals are the family style. Zhu Zis family precepts are hung in the hall, not only for viewing, but also for practicing in every way. My uncle came from a poor background, starting from being a cargo receiver on a ship, and then to where he is today. He has experienced many hardships, but he encourages himself with diligence and frugality, strives to be self-disciplined, and treats others with forgiveness. His spirit of struggle and love is truly worthy of our imitation. (Zheng Dehong)

— Chen He

National vitality includes Shen Yuan's explanation; In other words: how can politics and economics be integrated into the wartime system? In terms of political issues: if the foundation of war depends entirely on the number of people; therefore, we must maintain the wartime situation, protect the security of the national life. In terms of economic issues: such as eliminating the evils of the strong and weak, which are naturally created by liberalism. Unifying all resources, increasing wartime production so that it can contribute to the country, and distributing it to the front and rear, are its highest goals. Now, if the country wants to achieve these two goals, the first important thing is to establish a wartime social mechanism, so that the people, regardless of men, women, old and young, rich and poor, noble and Lu, can join the organization specified by the network home according to their abilities. To avoid all kinds of malpractices and self-destruction, only in this way can the national vitality be developed and the national strength restored. It is related to the stability and health of the national life; therefore, the clothing, food, housing and transportation of each national must be properly arranged. The following various organs of farmers, workers, businessmen, students, officials, soldiers, and local people must at least be state-owned or publicly owned. That is, nurseries, schools, hospitals, cafeterias, entertainment venues, dormitories, sports fields, flower stalls, police stations, wedding and funeral halls, cleaning services, public utilities, personnel guidance centers, etc. All things needed for life should be included in it and supplied equally. Or exchange with each other with strength. The gains and losses of this facility, the advantages and disadvantages, are not fully explained by the short text here; but at least it is enough to prevent the liberalism, maintain the natural increase in the population rate, and can be decided and managed, so that they can concentrate on their duties and give play to their abilities. Otherwise, even if there is a good policy, it will not be effective. The result is that the national vitality will inevitably be swallowed up by liberalism, which should not be underestimated!

Wartime economy is the lifeblood of modern participating countries. In particular, the implementation of material resources is the source of cultivating combat power. However, if the notification policy is not supported by wartime politics; then the national life will inevitably be unstable, officials will cheat for private gain, regardless of the interests of the country and the nation, and moral conscience will be completely destroyed. Then production will stagnate and resources will be buried. Even if we seek the implementation of the ruling policy, we will be powerless. If there is wartime politics to support it, and can eliminate the inner concept of private property, and destroy the root of liberalism, so that all production departments are economic; then divide them into categories, step by step, with the power of 450 million people, and close the resources, there will definitely be a great plan for production. Production is rich, and hundreds of industries are mutually prosperous, all working together for the same goal; under the banner of national strength, working hard. Then, the resources will be abundant, the unified policy will be completed, and there will be no shortage of supply!

The implementation of wartime political economy has been completed. We can then have great expectations. Our country has vast land and abundant resources, and a large population. If we can make use of it and unite 450 million people, at the same time, with the same treatment, the same education, sitting, living, drinking, eating, entertaining, and working, in the same dormitory, canteen, entertainment venue, and factory. "Exhaust their wealth, the land must be exhausted for its benefits, and the goods must be distributed!" Resources are piled up like mountains! How can national vitality be under prosperity! How can national strength not be abundant! May those who have a heart, do it well.

That year's New Year was very silent. There were no pine trees planted in front of the door, and there were families who did not have New Year cakes.

In the family of Zhenren, there was an added layer of unfortunate dark clouds. The father, who had always been as strong as a bamboo pole in Jiangnan, suddenly fainted from dizziness. According to the doctor's diagnosis, it was a stroke, but Ruozi did not believe that Zhenji, who had just turned fifty-eight years old, would really be but, the progress of the disease, day by day, confirmed the doctor's diagnosis. There was only one living room in the house, and in that living room, Zhenji, a patient with hemiplegia, was lying down. His distracted pupils were fixedly staring at the ceiling.

"What on earth is going on?"

Seeing this form, Ruozi was stunned by the disaster that fell from the sky. The center of the whole family, the bearer of all undertakings, suddenly fell ill for no reason, what will happen in the future-

Soon, her spirit had recovered, and she took care of the guest in the store herself. Her husband's cloth skirt was worn on her waist. The rice noodles were white all over her hair, and she was also infinitely compliant, a hardworking worker.

"Child, we must not be discouraged..." In her, there was no reason, only to settle down again, and every morning she had to go to the Hachiman Shrine to pray for a speedy recovery. She entrusted Kawauchi Town's Xiangzhi to send and mail the local specialty carp, take its raw blood, and drink it with the patient.

However, Zhenji's condition did not change in any way, from the first month to the second month.

"A stroke is a long-term disease - maybe it will last for three, five, or seven years"

The people who came to visit the patient said this. Ruozi and the children were already determined.

In February, it snowed heavily. Although it is said to be both countries, it is not that it does not snow. When Saigo Takamori raised his army, there was also the matter of marching in the snow, which is recorded in history. In the Showa years, there was also unprecedented snow. With the falling of the snowflakes, the patient's sleep became even deeper. From broad daylight until the lights were turned on, the snoring never stopped. Soon the snoring stopped, turning into a strange sound, which, once seen, tended to change the disease and fatigue abruptly. The doctor said it was a fatal hemorrhage.

"Run to Zhenichiro and see him" Ruozi shouted loudly. The second son, Zhenichiro, was working as a substitute teacher in Taniyama Town, two ri (twelve Chinese li) away from home. Even in the Big Electricity Day, someone must be sent to tell him that his father's illness was critical.

"I'll go"

Zhenren was the first to respond. Unlike his usual gentle appearance, without waiting for his mother's consent, he quickly ran towards the snowy night Taniyama Street. (VII)
