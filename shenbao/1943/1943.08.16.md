### Construction of a New Shanghai and Rectification of Officialdom

At the time of the Shanghai Concession's takeover, the citizens' joy and excitement reached a peak. This was an expression of the citizens' boundless rejoicing at the birth of a new Shanghai. Subsequently, both officials and the public continuously expressed their opinions. Although their perspectives differed due to their respective positions, they all held limitless hopes for the future of the new Shanghai. Therefore, the construction of a new Shanghai deserves repeated discussion and tireless pursuit of details, ensuring that this newborn infant is nurtured and developed to meet the expectations of citizens and all parties. This newspaper has previously discussed the institutions of public opinion and the selection of talented individuals, taking the trouble to do so because of this reason. Now, we will further elaborate on the rectification of officialdom.

In the recent two centuries, the ethos of Chinese officialdom can be described as deteriorating day by day. Instances of harming the country and its people are too numerous to count. The facts are all there, undeniable. Moreover, the emergence of concessions stemmed from the corruption of officialdom. Afterward, who is to blame for tolerating their encroachment and defiance? The past lessons of nurturing evils and leaving behind future troubles serve as a warning. While this specifically addresses Shanghai, it can certainly be applied to other places. When the National Government initially returned to the capital, it was an opportunity to reform officialdom. However, the national leaders who were pioneering new ideas and managing the fragmented situation may have had no choice but to compromise and appease, failing to reach the ideal state. But now, with the birth of a new Shanghai, popular support, and well-established institutions, we can proceed calmly and methodically with a thorough and complete renewal, establishing a long-term plan. Shanghai, in any aspect of politics, economics, or society, has always had an influence on the entire country, so the goodness or badness of its officialdom not only affects the construction of the new Shanghai but will also affect the fate of the entire country. We wish to take this opportunity, at this new beginning with the people, to outline and explain the essential points and methods for rectifying officialdom below:

(A) Essential Points: "The people are the most important, the state comes next, and the ruler is the least important." This is an ancient proverb that may seem out of step with today. If translated into modern terms, it would be "The common people come first, the government comes second, and the officials are the least important." The meaning is very clear and irrefutable. Because the interests of a few officials are not necessarily the interests of the government, and even less so the interests of the common people. Conversely, what benefits the common people necessarily benefits the government, and the officials also receive its blessings. Take the general tax system as an example. On the surface, it advocates a contracted system, but in reality, it is still a monopolized nature. Government agencies may not have to expend the labor of collecting and auditing taxes, receiving the amount they are due on time, but those who contract are mostly motivated by profit. If there is a surplus after paying taxes, they report upwards at each level, pocketing the difference. As a result, they concoct various pretexts to impose exorbitant taxes and levies. This directly increases the burden on citizens and indirectly hinders the development of all industries. In the end, the people's livelihood declines, and the government treasury is not full. This is one example of valuing the ruler over the people. On the other hand, in countries with enlightened officialdom, the greater the determination to achieve affluence, the more difficulties arise at the beginning. The general public often lacks sufficient capital to undertake such arduous tasks, and they hesitate. Therefore, at the outset, the government must contribute capital and take the lead, using political power to overcome the initial difficulties. Once the foundation is solid, then the government can recover the corresponding costs and allow private operation, with proper supervision. With the income generated, other enterprises can be initiated in the same way, circulating and evolving, and all industries will flourish. The wealth of the country and the strength of the people are by no means accidental. This is an example of valuing the people over the ruler. When the people are prosperous, how can the ruler be lacking? When the whole world is in distress, the ruler's heavenly mandate will end. Taking "the people are the most important" as a creed, and renewing the spirit of officialdom, this is the first essential point. The relationship between officials and the people is like that between a father and his son. They should be loved with kindness and righteousness, and governed by a standard. Therefore, a family has family rules, and a country has national laws, encouraging good and punishing evil, maintaining order. However, wherever there is law, there is evasion. Cunning people will inevitably employ their devious tricks to achieve their illegal purposes. First, they deceive, then they seek favors. Once they grasp the weaknesses of officials, they can demand whatever they want and act with impunity. They may even collude with each other, protecting each other. They knowingly violate the law and act as if no one is watching. Those who steal a hook are punished, while those who steal a state become princes. Officials are allowed to set fires, while the common people are not allowed to light lamps. The imperial edicts are regarded as mere formalities by the government itself. When those at the top favor something, those below will do it even more excessively, leading to corruption and collusion between officials and merchants. Laws and regulations become tools for monopolizing and hoarding goods, and a protective talisman for competing with the people for profits. What else can be said? In the past, the concessions each governed themselves, and may have been somewhat disconnected from the local sentiments. Whenever an order for price controls was issued, prices would inevitably rise, a strange phenomenon indeed. Now that political power is complete, it is essential to adhere to the principle that "governance lies not in many words, but in ensuring that every word is acted upon," establishing the authority and credibility of officialdom. This is the second essential point.

(B) Methods: Although there are only two essential points, the methods for implementing the rectification of officialdom are numerous and complex. Without engaging in circuitous discussions, we will only address the essential points: All policies and programs must be carefully considered before a firm determination is made. Relying on momentary impulses and seeking temporary satisfaction will inevitably lead to difficulties in sustaining them. Thrift must begin with officials. Without frugality, there can be no integrity; without integrity, there is no shame; and those who are shameless are not fit to be human, let alone to govern others. Shanghai is a prosperous city, and frugality is especially important. In the past, the concessions were special areas, which were also breeding grounds for all kinds of evils. Now, the residents of the city are one, and officials should also be treated equally. Clearly defined objectives should be the standard for performance evaluation, without favoritism or partisanship, and rewards and punishments should be clear. Those who knowingly violate the law should be punished more severely, and those who are incompetent should be replaced immediately. Only with sound personnel can sound undertakings be managed. Shanghai has recently become a center for the offices of various regions and institutions. Whether each of them is necessary will not be discussed in detail here. However, they must be treated with sincerity and respect, and their powers and responsibilities must be clearly defined. The organization of Shanghai itself is already complex and intricate, and its effectiveness should not be reduced by unnecessary bureaucracy. Other aspects, such as how officials should lead by example, and how the salaries of public servants should be raised, will not be listed here.

With public opinion reaching upwards, talented individuals excelling, and officialdom rectified, these three being in place, Shanghai will be well-governed, the entire country will flourish, and the ethos will not only develop its power, but also jointly defend East Asia, enjoying the happiness of freedom and independence forever.

### Solomon Islands Area: Japanese Air Force Achieves Results, Three Enemy Transport Ships Sunk

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3 p.m. on the 15th: Japanese military air units attacked straits in the Longa area (north of Guadalcanal Island) and swept enemy aircraft in the Runumbu Island area, sinking three large transport ships. Japanese aircraft also dispatched another unit to attack enemy airfields, destroying and burning one airfield each. The Japanese fighter squadron attacking the Renterba area engaged ten enemy fighters over Munda, shooting down a total of six. In this battle, the Japanese lost one aircraft.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) – General MacArthur's headquarters announced today: A large formation of Japanese aircraft conducted an air raid on Kiriwina Island in the Solomon Islands on the night of the 13th. It was also stated that another large formation of Japanese aircraft heavily bombed enemy positions near Kilocco.

### Military and Civilian Food Supplies in Various Regions: The Ministry of Food Has Made Preparations; Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Food Issues a Statement

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Food issued the following statement to reporters:

The fluctuation of prices is inherently based on cost, demand, and supply. Now, in the era of the Greater East Asia War of National Liberation, prices cannot be compared with peacetime. Either costs increase due to labor and raw materials, or supply is not smooth due to quantity and transportation issues, causing prices to soar. This is unavoidable. However, the current rise in prices lacks any standard and is arbitrarily inflated. It is not uncommon for prices to increase by 40% or 50% in a single day. This is clearly not solely due to increased costs or the inability to balance supply and demand, but rather is caused by speculative hoarding by unscrupulous merchants. Controlling materials and stopping speculative hoarding are necessary measures to stabilize the people's livelihood during wartime. Food is essential for the people's lives and is more important than other materials. The government has recognized this and implemented controls for three years. Merchants and the public in the accumulated water areas can all understand the meaning and methods of compilation. Although speculative hoarding of food has not been completely eliminated, it is not as rampant or unrestrained as it could be. In addition, the Ministry provides widespread food rations to cities lacking food. Although there may be black markets in those areas, they are only fleeting and cannot last long. Therefore, during this time of wild rains and sudden rises and falls of abnormal price fluctuations, the fact that rice can remain relatively stable is indeed the most gratifying thing.

Now, the large-scale entry of new grains is imminent. The Ministry has made full preparations for the military and civilian food supplies needed in various regions during the lean season, so there is no need to worry. This can be reassuring to the people in various regions. We hope that the people will trust the government and not panic. Not only is hoarding and speculating illegal and not allowed by the government, and will be subject to legal sanctions, but individuals and families should also not hoard. In the past, because of price stimulation and fear that even a handful of rice would rise in price along with other goods, the general public rushed to buy and store private supplies. Although the amount purchased by each person was small, the large number of people purchasing and storing food meant that the quantity accumulated into a huge amount, causing an imbalance between supply and demand, and causing the price of rice to rise to the same level as other goods. It is hoped that the people will correct this situation themselves, so that the long-term stability of rice prices will not be a problem.

### Rome Declared a Non-Defended City: Anti-Axis Countries Propose Prerequisites; The City Must Not Have Any Military Function

Rome, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Stefani Agency announced today: The Italian government has, through the Vatican, notified the relevant countries that it has decided to declare Rome a non-defended city starting from July 31st, and wants to know under what circumstances this proposal can be accepted. Rome is the center of Catholicism, and because it has been repeatedly attacked, the Italian government no longer hesitates and officially announces that Rome is a non-defended city, and takes necessary measures to comply with international law.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters in London: Officials announced yesterday that the British government's attitude towards Italy's declaration of Rome as a non-defended city is unaffected. Italy's unilateral declaration cannot affect the freedom of action of the Supreme Commander of the Anti-Axis countries.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to Huitong News Agency: Informed sources in Quebec pointed out last night that the Anti-Axis countries have agreed in principle to the Italian government's declaration of Rome as a non-defended city, but the prerequisite is that the Italian government must provide absolute evidence to prove that Rome will no longer have any military purpose.

### Chongqing's Military Expenses in Dire Straits: Mandatory Payment

Guangdong, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from Chongqing, Chongqing's military expenses are in dire straits. They have appealed for a movement to comfort the troops and raise funds for soldiers, but without success. Finding no other solution, Chongqing plans to announce mandatory measures, assigning burdens to various provinces, and ordering payment. This has further aroused resentment and criticism from the public. This shows the poverty of Chongqing's finances, and that even military expenses cannot be maintained. At the same time, it also reflects the people's heartfelt disgust for the so-called "resistance war" under Chongqing's heavy taxation and extortion.

Japan and Germany must work closely together to fight against the common enemy."

### Outline of the New National Movement

— Wang Jingwei

The outline of the New National Movement was taught in the New National Movement Training Camp for Civil Servants and Youth During the Summer Vacation. The first and second sessions were taught in three lectures each, each lasting about one and a half hours. The main ideas of the lectures were the same, the only difference being the elaboration, extension, and repeated emphasis. Now, the redundancies have been removed, the essentials have been extracted, and this draft has been written for the students' review. — Self-awareness by Jingwei

Main Idea of the Second Lecture

The first lecture discussed the origin of the New National Movement. In detail, the initiation of the New National Movement lies in having us recognize the mission of the new era and cultivate the responsibility and ability to be able to take on the mission of the new era.

So, what will be the content of the New National Movement? In other words, what kind of ideology will the New National Movement be based on? The New National Movement does not create a new ideology. Because we already have the Three Principles of the People, what is needed is how to implement them.

Central Force of the Three Principles of the People

Students may ask why only one ideology is needed. Can't two or more ideologies coexist? My response is as follows:

Ideology guides the direction of our movement, and the party is a group of people who share the same ideology and use organized, trained, and disciplined action to implement that ideology. The politics of various countries in the world include multi-party politics, two-party politics, and one-party politics. The first type, for example, was France in the past. In politics and economics, there were multiple ideologies, and therefore multiple parties. Because there were too many parties, no one party could independently control the government, so various parties united to jointly control the government. However, this kind of union is not strong, and it is easy to unite and easy to dissolve. Therefore, in the parliament, there are cabinets that are established in the morning due to the union of several parties, and cabinets that are dissolved and terminated in the evening due to the dissolution of the same parties. This kind of country lacks a central force to exercise political power. In times of peace, it is already noisy and chaotic, and accidents occur from time to time. In times of crisis and survival, the flaws are even more obvious. The defeat of France in this war was largely due to this. Therefore, after the defeat, the current French government has resolutely overthrown this multi-party system. The second type, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, has one party in power. Although there are more than two parties in the United Kingdom now, the foundation is still like this, which is better than multi-party politics, because any one party can still barely grasp the central force. The third type, in order of sequence, the first is the Soviet Union. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, the Communist Party began its dictatorship until today. Regardless of whether the Communist Party is right or wrong, the fact is that it has created a central force. The second is Italy. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the Fascist Party began its dictatorship. Although there have been some fluctuations recently, the details are not yet known. In any case, it has created a central force for the past twenty years, which is seamless. What will happen in the future is still unknown. Then there is Germany. In the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the National Socialist Party began its dictatorship. The German people's organization and discipline have always been very strong. With the dictatorship of the National Socialist Party, the central force has become even stronger. In the past, Japan had many parties like Kong Ming, but Japan has long had a central force. Japanese scholars say: "Japanese politics is democratic politics with the Emperor as the center." This sentence is correct. Recently, the collection of various political parties in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has further melted the traces of multi-party politics. According to this, a country cannot be without a central force, otherwise any policy cannot be implemented. It is even more needed in times of national crisis and survival. Using one ideology and one party as the central force is based on this need. (To be continued)

### Turkey Adheres to Neutrality Policy

It is clear that the main force of the Anglo-American general offensive is aimed at Italy. The positions of the Atlantic coast and the Balkans, which were previously candidates for the second front, are no longer of secondary importance from a military point of view. Therefore, regarding the landing battle in the Balkans, Turkey has of course reduced its military importance as the first to bear the brunt. Anglo-American European operations use Italy as a base point, traversing the Balkans and directly attacking the side of the Eastern Front. Therefore, if the Anglo-Americans can succeed in the Italian campaign, their second step will be to directly target the Balkans, defeat the countries, and make them break away from the Axis front, isolating Germany. Therefore, the Anglo-Americans also began political activities while starting the Italian campaign. If the Anglo-American campaign against Italy can achieve the expected success, then even without military action against the Balkan countries, the possibility of achieving their goals by using political work alone exists.

However, in this case, Turkey is still used by the Anglo-Americans as a base for activities in the Balkans. Moreover, from this point of view, the Anglo-Americans believe that Turkey's utility is even greater than before. In other words, although Turkey's military situation seems to have relaxed since the Anglo-Americans began the Italian campaign, the political situation has taken its place and become more important. Around the time the Battle of Sicily began, local informed sources believed that the Anglo-Americans would definitely take advantage of their favorable situation to exert pressure on Turkey.

On the Anglo-American side, if there is an opportunity to make Turkey join the Anti-Axis front, it has always been their wish. Especially today, when the situation in the Balkans is becoming increasingly urgent, they feel the need to hold their base, Turkey. Therefore, we can imagine the new activities that the Anglo-Americans have recently carried out against Turkey. The Times of the 28th commented on the Turkish issue, saying:

"Today, when the war situation is unfolding extremely favorably for the Anti-Axis, we certainly hope that Turkey will approach the Anti-Axis countries. However, Turkey stubbornly maintains unnecessary neutrality, which is unexpected."

The newspaper outwardly criticized Turkey's state of maintaining neutrality in the current situation, and emphasized that it should abandon neutrality at this time and join the Anti-Axis front. This is a clear expression of the Anglo-American attempt on Turkey. From this, we cannot fail to see that the Anglo-Americans have opened a new chapter in their diplomatic policy towards Turkey.

In addition, British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's activities in Ankara are also a manifestation of a kind of covert warfare before the aforementioned diplomatic offensive. As for Turkey's reaction, according to local Axis diplomatic circles, Foreign Minister Numan Menemencioğlu recently told a certain Axis ambassador: "We have realized that the Anglo-Americans, who have recently been drunk with victory, are putting pressure on Turkey, but Turkey's neutrality policy will not change due to the recent new events. We believe that we will resist the Anglo-American pressure tenaciously."

This is a conversation with an Axis diplomat, and we cannot believe the true meaning of this Turkish statement, but at least we have sufficient grounds to speculate that Turkey will not rapidly change its attitude.

But if the Anglo-Americans decide to do something about Turkey, then Turkey's attitude will shift depending on the future Italian war situation. In other words, what determines Turkey's attitude is not the degree of Anglo-American pressure, but how Germany resolves the Italian war situation.

### After the General Chamber of Commerce Purchased Yarn and Cloth, Fixed Prices Were Stipulated

All Yarn and Cloth is Not Allowed to Move Before Purchases are Complete

The National Government authorities, seeing that it was essential to eliminate national stockpiles and thoroughly stabilize prices, were determined to gradually nationalize major materials and adopt effective wartime material controls in order to balance supply and demand, ensuring that military and civilian needs were met without annual shortages. Cotton yarn and cloth, which were sufficient to stimulate drastic price changes, had been approved for purchase by the Supreme National Defense Conference on the 9th, and temporary regulations and implementation outlines for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth were promulgated, ordering the National General Chamber of Commerce to handle the purchase of Shanghai's existing yarn and cloth. After receiving the order, the Chamber had already drafted detailed rules for the implementation of the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval and record, and today (the 16th), it will formally establish an office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth to start work and purchase according to the promulgated detailed rules for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. Before the purchase work is completely completed, all yarn and cloth existing in warehouses and factories in this city are not allowed to move. It is said that the purchased yarn and cloth will still be allocated by the General Chamber of Commerce at fixed prices.

### The Materials Investigation Committee Investigates Various Warehouses: Distinguishing Between Public and Private Warehouses

Since its establishment, the Materials Investigation Committee has decided to first investigate the stockpiling of cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai, according to the first meeting. The investigators of the committee, led by the Japanese investigation officer, divided the entire city into thirty groups to investigate public warehouses, totaling 233, and the investigation has been completely completed. The quantity of cotton yarn and cloth stored in each warehouse, the date of entry, and the names of all cargo owners or merchants were reviewed to see if there was any stockpiling, and whether they had registered with the authorities. If there were any doubts, or if the facts were unclear, further investigation would be required. This review work has been completed. As for the stockpiling of yarn and cloth in private warehouses, after conducting an investigation, it will be submitted for review for separate disposition.

### The Movement of Cotton Textiles to Other Ports is Limited to Actual Needs

If manufacturers in this city need to transport cotton textiles to other ports, they can first fill out an application for removal, have it stamped and certified by the cotton textile industry association and the cotton textile association, and then request permission from the Material Transfer Permit Office of the General Chamber of Commerce before they can leave the country. The materials to be moved are limited to actual needs.

### The First District Will Establish a Baojia Office

According to sources, the Baojia cadre structure of the unified municipal administration in this city has not changed. In the future, each Baojia district will strive to maintain mutual contact in order to obtain greater results in self-police work. The news that the First District Office will establish a Baojia Office has been confirmed by officials to reporters from Datong News Agency. It is expected that the staff responsible for this work will still be personnel from the old Baojia Guidance Department and other key personnel related to the promotion of Baojia affairs.

### Sugar Merchants' Business Office to be Reorganized

Since the implementation of sugar rationing in this city, the sugar supply in each district has gradually become stable. However, the sugar stocks of Chinese merchants have gradually been exhausted. However, the military distribution authorities have a large amount of Taiwanese sugar arriving in Shanghai, ready to continue to handle the sugar rationing and maintain the normal supply of sugar. However, the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office is no longer applicable. It is reported that it will be reorganized starting next month. All the huge profits of the Business Office have long been allocated. At that time, the name of the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office will be changed to the Sugar Merchants' Wholesale Operation Society.

### Sixth Phase Household Sugar: Purchase Certificates to be Collected Today and Tomorrow

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Promotion Office, with the approval of the Military Allocation Bureau, is handling the distribution of sugar based on household population for the sixth phase, as well as special allocations for various industries. Our Shanghai news reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday that the sugar allocation for the sixth phase is ready. All type A retailers must, within today and tomorrow, take the previously issued blank receipts, affix their seals, and go to the office to collect sugar purchase certificates, and pay for and pick up the goods at the designated sugar firms before the 18th. Sugar will be sold upon presentation of the sugar purchase certificate issued by the authorities, from August 21st to 31st. The quantity is half a catty per person. Special allocations for various industries will begin soon. All procedures will be expedited, and notices of when and how to collect the sugar purchase certificates and pick up the goods will be issued to each household.

### Director of the National Health Administration Came to Shanghai, Tea Party Yesterday

Lu Runzhi, Director of the National Health Administration, came to Shanghai on official business. A grand reception tea party was held yesterday (the 15th) at 5 p.m. in the auditorium of Aurora University. Around 400 people attended, including representatives from the local health authorities, the press, the medical and pharmaceutical fields, and various related authorities. Director Lu said in his speech that since the national government returned to Nanjing, the organization of the National Health Administration is still in its initial stages, having been established for less than two months. Shanghai is the largest city in the country, and all policies rely on this major city to take the lead. All suggestions are especially dependent on the contributions of advanced thinkers. At the beginning of his tenure as Director of the National Health Administration, Lu Runzhi considered the following points to be particularly important:  For national epidemic prevention, it is planned to prepare and manufacture sufficient quantities of vaccines to ensure the widespread implementation of epidemic prevention work.  For health insurance, a new organization should be formed, following the example of Germany, so that the general working people can have methods for disease prevention and treatment. It is planned to first pilot this in the Shanghai area.  Careful examination of the qualifications of doctors and pharmacists is needed. It is planned to draft a Doctors Law and a Pharmacists Law in the near future and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and approval.  Establishment of a National Health Association, which will be a consulting body, and more assistance from the medical and pharmaceutical fields is needed, as well as publicity and assistance from the press.

### Minister of Social Welfare Gave a Speech at the Summer Training Camp

Mo Decun, Minister of Social Welfare, gave a special lecture at the New Citizen Movement Civil Servants and Youth Training Camp the other day. The topic was "Social Policy in Wartime."

### French Association Seeks Chinese Members

The French Sports Association on Route Pichon (now Fuxing West Road) in this city (referred to as the French Association) has always been managed by French citizens and open to foreign residents in Shanghai as a club and for banquets after work. There have been no Chinese members. After the French Concession was taken over by the National Government, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, in order to emphasize amateur communication among Chinese people and correct past misunderstandings, discussed the methods for Chinese to join the association with French Ambassador Cosme. It was decided to establish an honorary board of directors consisting of both Chinese and French members in addition to the original board of directors. The honorary chairman of the Chinese side is Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, the vice chairman is Auditor General Xia Qifeng, and the directors are Shanghai Municipal Government Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue, Wu Kaisheng, Ambassador Zaisheng, and Director of the National Health Administration Lu Runzhi. The honorary chairman of the French side is French Ambassador Cosme, and the directors are French Consul General Majire, Counselor of the French Embassy Sadok, French Consul, President of the French Court Coubert, and Commander of the French Army Esha Dai (Major General). Furthermore, the Chinese honorary board of directors will select five people: Zhao Jinqing, Geng Jiaji, Gong Xiang, Wei Tingrong, and Nong Ruhui, etc. to be responsible for the review of Chinese membership applications. It is stipulated that meetings will be held twice a month to handle matters such as the review of Chinese membership applications. The first meeting is scheduled to be held at the end of this month. To show their sincerity in welcoming Chinese members, the French board of directors held a banquet at the association on the 11th to entertain the Chinese directors. Foreign Minister Chu, Xia, and all the directors were invited to attend, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. It was decided on the spot to start seeking Chinese members from the 16th of this month. Application forms and the association's charter can be obtained from the association's secretariat at any time. As for the membership procedures, regardless of gender, applicants must be introduced by two or more members of the association and be approved by the Chinese directors to obtain membership. All membership fees have also been separately set and listed in the membership rules.

### Lu Qi Broadcast

The Shanghai Propaganda Office broadcast last night (the 15th), presented by Lu Qi, head of the Shanghai Special Municipality Rural Area Political Work Group. He explained the importance of unifying the thinking of Shanghai citizens, practicing the New Citizen Movement, building a new Shanghai, and responding to the work of cleaning up the rural areas in the suburbs. The content was brief and to the point.

### Central China Tobacco Association: Preventing Distribution Malpractices
Eleventh Phase of Goods Distribution, Payment, and Pickup

The Central China Tobacco Allocation Association, after thoroughly eliminating the black market and preventing malpractices by distributors, has stipulated standards for wholesale and retail merchants. It also investigates each distributor to determine:  Whether the types and quantities of goods sold by the retailer's own stores exceed the limits set by the association.  Whether the goods are allocated disproportionately to the retailer's own stores, and whether the allocation to affiliated retailers is fair.  Whether tobacco is sold above the designated price, or whether there is hoarding or refusal to sell.  Whether the tobacco storage methods and the quantity of tobacco in stock are appropriate.

Eleventh Phase Distribution Method

According to our Shanghai reporter's inquiries with the association, the eleventh phase of goods distribution has already begun. Wholesale and retail merchants are required to pay and pick up their goods. It is expected that sales will be widespread around the 20th. There will be no changes in prices or methods. The goods will be allocated according to the A, B, C, and D system, and the quantities will be slightly less than in the previous phase. The value of grade A is approximately ten thousand yuan, and the values of grades B and C are reduced proportionally.

### Health Tips After Wading Through Water: Rickshaw Pullers Should Pay Attention

With excessive rainfall in recent days, vehicles cannot travel, and the only available means of transportation is the rickshaw. These rickshaw pullers wade through water all day long, and microbial erosion is a major hazard. To prevent diseases caused by microbes, after wading through water, wipe dry with a dry towel, do not eat raw, cold, fried, or greasy foods, do not accumulate food in the stomach, and do not overexert the body to aid digestion.

### Highest Authority Planned for Police Agencies in Two Districts

Its scope may extend to the western districts of Shanghai

The former two concessions are the two most important areas in Shanghai. Now that they have been taken over, the entire city's police system, under the leadership of the mayor, has been unified. A new page has been turned in the history of Shanghai's police force. Former Police Commissioner Watari Tadashi and former Nanjing Police Chief Su Chengde have both been appointed as deputy directors of the First and Third Police Bureaus. The two are busy planning to strengthen the police agencies in these two areas as much as possible in the near future. According to general opinion, in order to obtain the maximum effectiveness of the police force in the former two concessions, a centralized agency with supreme authority will be established to issue orders and commands at any time. Its scope will also extend to the former Shanghai Extra-Settlement Area and part of the urban area.

Medical Baojia System Becomes Connected

Regarding the preliminary rumors of the establishment of a centralized police authority, officials have not yet revealed any information. Although the police bureau in the old Police Department on Fuzhou Road may indeed become the ideal supreme police agency, on the other hand, the police bureau in the old French Police Department will implement training under its command. In addition to his responsibilities in the police force, Su is also the head of the Baojia self-defense system in the First and Eighth Districts. The Baojia is now an important organization for maintaining public order in the city, but the process of unifying it is simpler than unifying the police agencies.

### Applying for Reserve Discounts Should Not Be Used for Speculation

In order to stabilize finance and suppress prices, the Central Reserve Bank has decided to strictly handle applications for deposit reserve discounts from silver and money shops in order to prevent them from using the discounted funds for speculation.  The discount security for this reserve is limited to shops that have paid all their reserves in cash. This does not apply to those who use 40% cash and 60% substitute goods.  The maximum amount of the discount is 80% of the deposit reserve (that is, it must be within the 80% range, not calculated across the board at 80%).  The discount will be temporarily applied to the seven-day drafts of each shop.  The applications for discount from each shop must be for the purpose of meeting temporary financial needs and must not be used for other purposes such as hoarding or speculation.  When applying for a discount, the shop must clearly state the purpose in a letter to the guild, and then the guild must issue a letter to the Central Bank as proof before the discount can be obtained.

In addition, the Silver Association and Qianzhuang Bureau, in order to relieve the financial difficulties of small banks and qianzhuang and prevent them from closing down, will allow small banks and qianzhuang to use negotiable securities as collateral to apply for borrowing from the Silver Association and Qianzhuang Bureau. It is understood that the borrowing method is based on the average of the face value and the current purchase price.

Party affiliation.  Mailing address.  Remarks. It is also understood that recently, in order to take care of the business of their fellow traders and the convenience of citizens to purchase goods, all guilds have submitted requests to the authorities to grant them continuous allocation of materials and raw materials, so that they can distribute them to their member colleagues in grades and sell them in stores in accordance with regulations.

### Guiding Private Capital into the Right Track to Develop Productive Enterprises

Establishment of three companies, including pharmaceuticals

Since the authorities began managing finance and cracking down on speculation, much of the private capital in the market has shifted to normal uses.
