### Year-End Introspection

Time flies, and the year is coming to an end. Today is the eve of the thirty-second year [of the Republic]. On this last day of the year, it is the most appropriate time for us to reflect on everything that has passed. Throughout the year, we have pointed out and reflected on things as we saw them. Today, let's reflect in a more comprehensive way to provide direction for our efforts in the coming year:

First, how have individuals worked this year? Have they each been working hard in their respective positions? We hope that everyone will conduct a thorough self-reflection. We believe there are two types of unreasonableness on the individual level. One is a fundamental lack of effort. For example, producers who are lazy and neglectful, reducing efficiency; or students who are idle and playful, not diligent in their studies. The other is knowing to work hard, but only for personal gain, disregarding public interest. For example, engaging in speculation and hoarding, and various manipulations. It is regrettable that they only seek personal benefit and self-interest, and their sin is even greater than those who do not make an effort.

From now on, we hope that everyone will pay attention to their efforts in their respective positions. At the same time, break away from the interests of the small self and consider the interests of the greater self.

Second, what contributions have individuals made to society this year? What influence have social leaders had on the people? We hope that every individual and those responsible for social leadership will conduct a thorough self-reflection. What we feel is unreasonable is, taking Shanghai as an example, when holding a winter relief effort, social figures, except for a very few enthusiastic individuals, most of those with power are indifferent. Fundraising for relief has lasted for more than a month, and is still far from the target. However, the importance of winter relief is generally understood, but there is a lack of enthusiasm for it. As a result, those who solicit donations are not enthusiastic in their solicitation, and those who donate are not enthusiastic in their donations, which results in the slow progress of the winter relief. Moreover, wartime austerity in consumption should be universally implemented, but in fact, apart from the restrictions imposed by high prices, many wealthy people are still extremely extravagant, not knowing how to cherish material resources.

From now on, we hope that everyone will enthusiastically support social undertakings. Social leaders, in particular, should enthusiastically promote them.

Third, have the political and economic leadership of the government, etc., met the needs of the people this year? Do they coordinate with each other? Do they conform to the decisive battle posture of the Greater East Asia War? We hope that the government authorities will conduct a thorough self-reflection. The most important thing for all government policies and decrees is to coordinate with each other, and they should never be contradictory or conflicting. Especially in the current wartime, the implementation of policies and decrees should be in line with wartime needs. If this principle is violated, not only will the policies and decrees lose their effectiveness, and the government will lose its credibility, but also, it cannot cooperate with wartime needs, and the consequences will be even more serious. In the past year, there have been government measures that have failed to meet this principle. Not to mention the obvious, but as with the recent Shanghai Youth League's actions to ban smoking, gambling, and dancing, it can be seen that government policies are not coordinated. The Youth League is an organization led and organized by the government authorities, so the government is of course responsible for the actions of the Youth League. In principle, banning smoking, gambling, and dancing is, in essence, absolutely correct, and can be banned with just an order from the local government in charge. However, government policy on the one hand tacitly approves of it, while on the other hand, the Youth League is free to act, and afterwards the government is lenient. We will not discuss the nature of this incident for the time being, but this is already an example of the government's policies not being coordinated. For example, the government politically advocates increased production during wartime, but in the reality of the national economy, what is reflected is a decrease in production. At the same time, China has been participating in the war for nearly a year, and the decisive stage is approaching day by day, but the government's wartime system has not yet been completed, because the people still have no opportunity to participate in politics, and the cooperation between officials and the people cannot achieve the greatest effect.

From now on, we hope that the government will ensure that policies and decrees are coordinated with each other, especially to meet wartime needs.

"All past things are as if they died yesterday, all future things are as if they were born today." As we bid farewell to the old and welcome the new, we respectfully offer examples from all aspects, hoping that everyone will earnestly and thoroughly reflect on them, and have the courage to accept the "wrongs" of the past, so that we can reach the smooth path of the "rights" in the future.

### Japanese Army's War Achievements in the Lower Yangtze River Region This Year: Chongqing's Military Strength Declines Daily.

(Central News Agency) In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, since the National Government's participation in the war this year, the various units of the Japanese Army have reverted to their original form as field armies, advancing to destroy the enemy. In the cold regions of Suhuai in February, they launched strike and reduction operations against the 89th Army of the Chongqing Army and the New Fourth Army. At the beginning of November, they swept through the Chung-Hsi National Salvation Army near Guangde. Afterwards, they continuously launched strike and reduction operations against the Chongqing Army, the Communist Army, and other miscellaneous forces. At that time, the National Government's troops also cooperated with the Japanese Army in combat, achieving great results. Taking an overview of the war results of the various units of the Japanese Army in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River within a year, it can be said that Chongqing's supply routes have now been completely cut off, and Chongqing's military strength is declining daily. Chongqing's recent strategy is to try its best to avoid direct conflict with the elite Japanese forces, and strive to preserve its own military strength. Taking the Zhejiang-Anhui campaign as an example, the number of battles has increased by about 600 times compared to the previous year, while the anti-Japanese military strength has decreased by more than 100,000, and the number of casualties is the same. However, judging from the number of weapons seized by the Japanese army, a large number of mortars were seized by the Japanese army in the Suhuai campaign, while other heavy firearms were greatly reduced, especially the reduction in the number of rifles seized, which can prove the increasingly deteriorated equipment of the Chongqing Communist forces. The number of Japanese casualties is only 40% of last year's, and half of the previous year's. The total war results within this year are recorded as follows: Number of engagements: approximately 3,300 times. Chongqing Communist military strength engaged: approximately 530,000. Chongqing Communist military deaths: 28,799. Captures and surrenders: 15,321. Seized: 182 mortars, 13,226 shells, 4 anti-aircraft machine guns, 11 artillery pieces, 62 heavy machine guns, 58,305 bullets, 314 light machine guns, 60,526 bullets, 56 automatic rifles, 14,438 rifles, 1,644,097 bullets, 905 handguns, 80 grenade launchers, 93 grenade rifles, and other weapons and clothing not included. Japanese casualties: 82.

Hankou, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Central China Army authorities announced at 4 pm on the 30th: (1) In response to the Battle of Changde, the Japanese army launched a war of annihilation against the main forces of the Sixth and Ninth War Zones, "30 divisions." (2) At the beginning of the Battle of Changde, the Japanese army completed its offensive posture against the Chongqing army moving in front, annihilating the 73rd Army of the Chongqing army on the banks of the Lishui River, bringing Changde to the brink of crisis. In order to contain the Japanese army, the Fifth and Ninth War Zones of the Chongqing army have been active in Xinyang, Qianmen, Yibei, and various places along the Yuehan Line since mid-December, attempting a counteroffensive. The Japanese army took the initiative and crushed them. Since mid-December, the entire Chongqing army has been sealed off, which has greatly promoted the capture of Changde. The comprehensive war results of the various garrison battles are as follows: Chongqing military corpses: 6,369. Captured and surrendered: 643. Also seized: 4 artillery pieces, 69 heavy and light machine guns, and 631 rifles.

### Achievements of the Second Front Army in the Past Year.

Kaifeng, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Under the supervision of General Sun Liangcheng, the Second Front Army Headquarters launched clearing operations in various areas. The comprehensive results achieved by the army in the past year are substantial, and are recorded as follows: (1) Number of engagements: a total of 128 times. (2) Total number of Communist bandits mobilized: more than 84,500 people. (3) Communist bandit casualties: (9,087 people). (4) Communist bandits captured: 577 people. (5) Seized: 17 light machine guns, 2 mortars, 718 rifles, 51 light machine guns, 853 hand grenades, 4,857 bullets, 74 horses, and a large amount of other military supplies.

### Eighteen Chongqing Planes Shot Down by Japanese Planes

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from a certain base of the Japanese Army in Central China, the Japanese Army planes bombed the Chongqing airport in Suichuan, Jiangxi, on the 27th, and shot down 18 Chongqing planes. The Japanese aircraft fighter-bomber joint large formation arrived over Yun-Chuan at 2 pm on the same day, and engaged in a fierce air battle with more than 20 Chongqing aircraft that intercepted them. As a result, 8 Chongqing (P40) type aircraft (2 of which were not confirmed) and 2 (P51) type aircraft (1 of which was not confirmed) were shot down, for a total of 10 aircraft. In addition, 2 North American (B25) type aircraft and 1 (P40) type aircraft parked on the ground were bombed. Among them, 2 (B25) type aircraft and 1 (P40) type aircraft were set on fire, and 5 (B25) type aircraft were destroyed. In this battle, the Japanese aircraft lost 4 aircraft.

### "Review and Outlook on One Year of Wartime Diplomacy": Broadcast Speech by Japanese Minister Iguchi

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Information Bureau Director-General Iguchi gave a broadcast speech entitled "Review and Outlook on One Year of Wartime Diplomacy" at 7:20 pm on the 29th, the main points of which are as follows: War is a war of military, political, diplomatic, economic, and ideological forces working in parallel. Looking at these aspects comprehensively, it is by no means that the enemy is launching an offensive while we are adopting a defensive posture. There is no reason to say that our military is gradually intensifying its offensive. In particular, in the political and diplomatic aspects, the 18th year of Showa [1943] was actually the year in which our country launched the most intense offensive. In other words, our country's war objective, which is to drive the British and American forces out of East Asia, is only a prerequisite. For example, the establishment of the new China policy at the beginning of the year, the independence of Burma in August, the independence of the Philippines in October, the participation of native Indonesians in politics, and the annexation of vast territories by Thailand are all facts. Our government has recognized the Provisional Government of Free India, and has stated that it is preparing to transfer the Nicobar and Andaman Islands to that government. Furthermore, it has given strong assistance to its national army. All of these are expressions of the Japanese government's moral diplomacy of assisting Asian nations to restore their freedom and independence. At the same time, it is also a powerful political offensive against Britain and the United States. By November, this offensive had achieved a great result, which was the Greater East Asia Conference. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States have been unable to change their plans due to their desire for a quick victory and their missteps. Until recently, the enemy's embarrassment and anxiety have become more and more obvious. They have realized that a long-term war is unfavorable to them, and have changed their position to aim for a quick victory. Therefore, despite repeated defeats, they continue their stubborn counterattacks. The leaders of Britain and the United States have never given practical assistance to Chongqing's requests for help. However, when the Greater East Asia Declaration was issued, they were suddenly at a loss and felt the need to win over Chongqing. Therefore, there was the Cairo Conference the other day, which decided to discuss designating Japan as a third-rate country in order to please Chongqing. Following this was the Tehran Conference, which made a false show of strength, and gathered a large army in the Pacific to prepare for a crushing blow against the Japanese army, launching a strong attack. This was exchanged for the disastrous defeat on Bougainville Island. All of these are manifestations of the anxiety of Britain and the United States, which is evident to all who are aware of the situation. Also, Hopkins, a staff member of Byrnes, once said that after the end of this war, the United States will have the world's largest navy and merchant fleet, have the world's unparalleled air force, and become the richest country. He said that British numbers will reach 7 billion yuan per year in the years after the war. This extremely arrogant statement can represent the United States' insatiable war aims. In contrast to the United States' domination and exploitation, the war aims of British imperialism have also been explained by South African Prime Minister Smuts in his speech in London. Smuts said: The responsibility for maintaining the post-war world rests with the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Because a new giant, the Soviet Union, has appeared in Europe, in order to maintain the balance, Britain must place the countries of Western Europe under its leadership. This will not only contain the Soviet Union, but also ensure Britain's position in the European continent. This is to seek to maintain the existence of the so-called British Empire. When we observe their performance, we should know that their war aim is to seek to build or preserve the position of the American Empire. In the first year of the Greater East Asia War, Japan secured vast and inexhaustible resources with a major military offensive, and completed a posture of certain victory. In the second year of the war, it strengthened its political offensive and established a solid foundation in the political, economic, and cultural fields. This is also the historical significance of the 18th year of Showa [1943]. As we enter the third year of the war, Japan will base itself on this state of certain victory and invincibility, and make a comprehensive offensive, defeating the enemy's counteroffensive in the military field. At the same time, in the political, economic, and cultural fields, it will unite the East Asian nations and move forward, seeking to strengthen the mutual support and cooperation between the various nations, and completely remove the forces of Britain and the United States that attempt to control the world from Asia. Therefore, this year can be said to be the year in which we complete our glorious mission.

### Germany Confident of Winning European Continental Defense. US Troops Conduct Landing Exercises on British Soil.

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Berlin Financial News reported an enemy commentary, titled "The Danger of Invasion," stating that the British have reason to believe that the winning card is in the hands of the German defenders. The Germans will make the invasion of the European continent the most complex, difficult, and dangerous operation. Regarding the British contribution to this operation, they are still taking the approach of saving manpower as much as possible within the possible range, and letting others fight for them. The Germans have proven that they cannot be defeated from the air, and the possibility of being defeated on land seems even smaller. Therefore, the German army is calmly waiting for the offensive initiated by the Soviet Union. The Germans are confident that the landing battle will end in a major defeat for the anti-Axis forces.

Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to the Haitong News Agency, London officials announced: US troops stationed in Britain are currently conducting large-scale offensive exercises on the desolate coasts of England. The landing forces are conducting simulated battles with the defending forces on the shore with artillery and tanks. The landing forces are also attempting to establish bridgeheads on the shore with the assistance of warships and aircraft. Several coastal cities have been evacuated to prepare for General Eisenhower's army to perform the offensive exercises.

Huge Invasion Plan Approved by the Big Three

Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to the Haitong News Agency, London sources: A special correspondent of the British semi-official news agency stated that General Eisenhower and General Spaatz of the Allied Air Force had drafted a huge plan to invade Western Europe before the Tehran and Cairo Conferences. At the beginning of the Cairo Conference, Eisenhower and Spaatz secretly flew to Cairo and presented their plan for invading Europe to the military conference. Anti-Axis military generals considered this plan to be valuable, and it was later discussed by Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran with Stalin. As a result, Eisenhower and Spaatz were elected as the main generals for the invasion of Western Europe. When Roosevelt and Churchill went to Tehran, Eisenhower and Spaatz presented their detailed plan, which was also approved by Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, and others. Therefore, the Tehran Conference was able to decide on this matter in four days.

### Goebbels' New Year's Article: Optimistic about the War Situation

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The German New Agency reported that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in "Deutsche Wochenzeitung," discussing how the anti-Axis countries have failed in both military and political aspects in their operations against Germany over the past year. He compared the Germans to policemen, and the British and Americans to hooligans, and said that one should not retreat because of the evil of the hooligans. In conclusion, Goebbels encouraged the Germans to fight hard and win, so that they could turn weakness into strength and benefit future generations. The translation of the article is as follows: 1943 was our year of testing. In this year, Germany's task was to maintain the economic and military position it had gained in its previous major offensive. This position is closely related to Germany's security and is a prerequisite for the final victory. Therefore, it was expected that the enemy would fight to the death to seize this position, but the enemy did not succeed. Although the enemy launched a strong attack, it did not shake the foundation of the war situation. Goebbels went on to recall the objectives announced by the enemy in the past year, saying that London and Washington also admitted that they had failed to achieve their objectives. From this point of view, we can express satisfaction with the war situation in 1943. The enemy has been mistaken about the military efforts of 1943, and their political developments are inevitably shortsighted. Did the enemy not often predict that Germany would encounter a mental collapse? But what was the result? Today, when the Germans are shouldering the heavy responsibility of the fifth year of the war, they are still determined to fight and win as before, and their determination has never been stronger than it is today. This can be discerned without being an optimist. On the contrary, Britain and the United States have exaggerated their propaganda and created an atmosphere in most parts of the world, as if their victory is a fait accompli and not worth discussing further, especially the chapter on war criminals, which they relish. Goebbels said that the enemy has committed all kinds of crimes against humanity, culture, and scholarship in this war. The enemy has starved millions to death, forcing them to maintain political neutrality, and massacred women and children to make their male relatives lack the courage to fight. They have also bombed cultural buildings in Europe for two thousand years as if they were postcards. Who are the so-called war criminals, the enemy or us? Young Germany, fighting against financial groups and communists, is the spokesman for world culture. We must complete our historical mission, otherwise humanity and justice will decline. Our responsibility is truly indescribable, because this war is not an ordinary war, but a war of the whole world against the enemies of human society. Its survival depends on our actions. The enemy wants to demoralize us with base means and cruel acts of war, but the past year has proven that they will fail. Under the belief that God will bless us, we have begun to welcome the mysterious coming year. This year will be a dangerous year, and humanity will be closer to catastrophe. Millions of German soldiers will raise their guns at the end of the year and invigorate their spirits. Millions of German farmers and workers will be busy with the work of sickles and hammers, and even more millions of mothers and children will complete their beauty. This is Germany today. Our ancestors handed over to us a weak and humiliated Germany, but we will hand over to our descendants a strong and great Germany. This is the purpose for which we are fighting for victory in this war, and there will be things to prove it in every new year.

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: The German High Command announced today that German forces, attacking north of Kirovograd, made further progress on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, Soviet General Vatutin continued a concentrated attack on Korosten-Zhitomir-Berdichev on an unprecedented scale. Although pressure on Korosten has increased, the main focus remains on the southern wing, where Soviet forces, after their attack on Berdichev was repelled, are moving from Fastov towards Belaya Tserkov. The battle of Vitebsk is at its peak, with pressure and counter-pressure roughly equal. Northwest of the city, near the Polotsk railway, German counterattacks have been particularly successful.

### British Forces on Italian East Coast Halted in Advance; U.S. Forces in West Deploy Northeast

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – Havas News Agency reports: The vanguard of General Montgomery's forces, attacking German positions near Ortona, has been halted. The British hope of advancing directly to Pescara after the German withdrawal from the city has been dashed. The British advance along the Adriatic coast is affected by the German control of Majella. British progress towards Pescara will face even greater obstacles. General Montgomery may launch an offensive on the left flank south of Majella and cooperate with the main force in the center. Near Orsogna and Guardiagrele, British pressure has increased. Fierce fighting continues in the Apennines. The positions of the U.S. Fifth Army appear to have been deployed northeast. The U.S. forces have been observed near the left flank, held by the British Eighth Army, in the area of Venafro and Alfadena. There have been few changes in the main German lines near Cassino. U.S. forces in the west continue to attack various high ground. North of the highway from Mignano to Cassino, anti-Axis forces have increased their strength. The left flank of the U.S. Fifth Army in the Gulf of Gaeta remains relatively inactive.

### British and American Political Offensive in the Balkans

Foreign correspondents for Swiss newspapers have recently been reporting on the situation in Bulgaria, mainly concerning the dispatch of reinforcement troops to Bulgaria, the secret emergency cabinet meeting of the Bulgarian government held on the 1st of this month, and the particularly frequent diplomatic exchanges between Sofia and Moscow in recent days. German authorities deny the troop deployment claims, and the Bulgarian government also explicitly denies holding a secret cabinet meeting. However, after the Cairo and Tehran conferences, there is no doubt that Britain and America have launched a vigorous political offensive in the Balkans.

British and American Political Maneuvering

Churchill has been engaged in political work in Cairo, meeting with former Greek King George II on the 9th and former Yugoslav King Peter on the 10th. Furthermore, the British and American air forces have indiscriminately bombed Sofia, and U.S. Secretary of State Hull has threatened the Baltic states allied with Germany. Thus, Bulgaria seems to be becoming the center of attention. However, this political work will likely be meaningless because the Bulgarian military leadership, based on their traditionally pro-German stance, remains loyal to the German-Bulgarian alliance. Regarding British and American activities in the Balkans, the Soviet Union is taking advantage of the following: 1. special ethnic relations; 2. domestic and foreign local activities in Bulgaria; 3. its neutral relationship with Bulgaria, to make Bulgaria its protectorate. Therefore, the issue is becoming increasingly complex. From the perspective of Britain and America, the Balkan issue remains fraught with many difficulties.

For Britain and America, whether from the perspective of current strategy or future plans, the Balkan issue is the most urgent and concrete problem. If Britain wants to reach some agreement with the Soviet Union at the Tehran conference, there must be some compromise on the issue of the second front in the Balkans. According to an American officer, Stalin seized every opportunity during the conference to emphasize that the Red Army had suffered eight million casualties. From this fact, it can be inferred that Stalin intends to prevent British and American proposals regarding postwar issues, insisting that the war has not yet ended, so it is not the time to discuss postwar issues. It seems that Britain and America are not allowed to discuss basic issues.

Soviet Union Demands a First Front

If this inference is correct, then the content of the conference is naturally limited to current military issues, and the second front is obviously the target. From the Soviet point of view, the second front issue has recently changed its tendency somewhat. The Soviet demand remains for a true second front against the German western fortifications. If Britain and America are also busy opening a second front this year, then Britain and America must realize the possibility of losing the Balkans. Britain and America believe that attacking the Balkans is the most convenient operation because Britain and America already have bases in southern Italy, and the British Ninth and Tenth Armies and other forces are waiting in the Cairo and Syrian areas. However, from a political point of view, the future of the British and American advance into the Balkans is fraught with difficulties. First, because of the existence of Bulgaria, Bulgaria is completely different. Second, because of the existence of Yugoslavia. This is an extremely difficult issue to deal with. Because Yugoslavia currently has two regimes, one led by Tito and the other by the exiled King Peter in Cairo, the British government is currently at a crossroads in deciding its policy towards the exiled Yugoslav regime.

According to the Standard Evening News, Tito dispatched a delegation to see Yugoslav King Peter II, carrying a compromise plan to dismiss Defense Minister Mihailović as a condition to welcome the King as the commander-in-chief of the Yugoslav Liberation Army. The Daily Mail, which previously often criticized King Peter, has recently changed its tone. The Times seems to support the Tito regime and is again advising King Peter to accept the compromise plan. These facts indicate the progress of some kind of political maneuvering centered on Yugoslavia. If the Soviet Union makes some concessions on the Balkan issue for Britain and America, then the Soviet Union will demand that the premise be that a true second front be opened in Western Europe. At the same time, it will argue that the Balkan offensive must take the form of joint operations with the Soviet Union.

Soviet Union Intends Joint Operations

According to London intelligence, the Soviet Union intends to undertake one wing of joint operations, advancing south along the Black Sea coast. Therefore, this joint operation is possible. However, even if Britain and America can control the Dardanelles and win over Turkey as a friendly neutral country, it would be quite difficult to attack the Balkans through Turkey. Military experts are convinced that the German side can secure the Dardanelles. Therefore, the Soviet army's advance along the Black Sea and the simultaneous true invasion of the Balkans will be unlikely. However, British newspapers are speculating about Turkey's attitude, saying that something very important is about to happen in the Balkans. Even The Times is giving readers this impression. Because launching airstrikes on the Balkans from Turkish territory cannot be said to be "the big thing that is about to happen." Especially given that the Tehran conference was limited to discussing military issues, America seems to be forced to engage in the large-scale battle they least want to. If they hope to obtain pleasant results from the Tehran conference, then their attempt must be regarded as completely overturned. The Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran conferences held recently are like puzzles shrouded in black clouds. Behind those black clouds is what Britain and America are promoting, the "European peace theory." The results of the Tehran and Cairo conferences exposed the true situation behind the black clouds. The strategies and intentions of Britain and America have been completely revealed.

### Wartime Consumption Special Tax to be Levied from the 16th; Retail Tax Rate Set at Four Percent

Central News Agency: The Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance has been ordered to prepare the Wartime Consumption Special Tax. The draft tax law has been prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for submission to the Executive Yuan for presentation to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval and implementation. It was originally scheduled to be levied from January 1, 1944, but due to insufficient preparation and the fact that the measures have not been approved by the highest authorities, it has been ordered to be levied from January 16. It is reported that the retail tax rate in this special tax has been set at four percent.

### Electricity Restrictions Set for Flour Mills; Flour and Wheat Committee Agrees with Central China Water and Electricity Company

Central News Agency: The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Business Control Commission and the Central China Water and Electricity Company have agreed on regulations for the electricity needed by affiliated flour mills, which will be implemented by the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee. The details of the electricity agreement between the two parties are recorded below:

Required Electricity Should Be Regulated

Regarding the electricity used by the flour milling industry, the Central China Water and Electricity Company and the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, after joint research, believe that the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee should be responsible for reducing the electricity required by all flour mills. Therefore, the committee should regulate the electricity needed by these mills. As for the implementation method, it is proposed to first reduce the electricity required by mills that are currently outside the control circle and buy wheat at black market prices to make flour, which is then sold on the black market, and other small flour mills, so that their electricity consumption is calculated at 40% or 30% of the normal rate. It is also proposed to implement the temporary measures for the management of flour mills and other small flour mills, which were previously approved by the National Government, so that all flour mills are subject to these measures. In this way, the flour that has always been sold on the black market can be used for normal rationing, and it is estimated that the production volume can be increased by 15%.

Guiding Flour Mills Towards Rationality

Furthermore, it has been found that the electricity required for a bag of flour is at most 3.5 kilowatts and at least 1.5 kilowatts. Based on the electricity consumed, it is possible to determine the quality of the equipment and the skill of the factory management. In order to ensure that flour production is not affected and to achieve the effect of saving electricity, the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee plans to guide all affiliated flour mills to use electricity rationally and to increase the allocation of raw wheat to factories that have achieved outstanding results in saving electricity as an encouragement. Regarding the current measures, the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee plans to announce the flour production volume and the amount of electricity required for the next month by each factory under its jurisdiction, and then notify the Central China Water and Electricity Company to supply electricity accordingly. Therefore, this restriction of electricity will not only not hinder flour production, but will also ensure low costs and increased production, making a significant contribution to promoting control work. The Central China Water and Electricity Company has agreed to notify the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the electricity consumption of each flour mill every month to show full cooperation and prevent flour from flowing into the black market.

### President's New Year's Day Address to be Broadcast Nationwide

At 10:00 AM on the first day of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, a grand celebration ceremony will be held in the capital, and the President's address will be broadcast nationwide. All agencies, organizations, schools, shops, and residences in this city should open their radios and listen carefully.

### Shanghai Citizens' Thrift Association Reorganized Yesterday; Constitution and List of Directors Approved

Central News Agency: Since its establishment, the Shanghai Citizens' Thrift Movement has spared no effort in promoting thrift. Now, the Ministry of Social Welfare of the National Government has formulated the organizational rules for thrift associations to promote thrift universally. After being approved by the fourth joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the association, it was reorganized into the Shanghai Special City Thrift Association. The reorganization and establishment meeting was officially held at the Ningbo Guild Hall on Xizang Road at 11:00 AM yesterday. Ding Mocun, Minister of Social Welfare, personally attended and delivered instructions. Hundreds of member representatives of the association attended, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic.

Meeting Details

Officials attending included Cui Jingyu (representing the mayor), Yuan Jufan, Sun Mingqi, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Tianshen, and dozens of others. The meeting was held on time. The presidium included Zhang Yipeng, Pei Yunqing, Gu Nanling, Chen Dongbai, Lu Feng, Lu Guangjie, Ren Quopeng, Hu Shouqi, Chen Jiufeng, Cheng Zhiliang, Wan Xuefang, and others. After all attendees performed the necessary rituals, the chairman, Zhang Yipeng, delivered an opening speech, explaining the three aspects of the reorganization: 1. Organizational affiliation. 2. Relationship with higher authorities. 3. Key instructions before and after the reorganization, 4. Expansion of association affairs. He said that the enthusiastic participation of members today shows unlimited bright prospects for the future. Finally, he encouraged everyone to work hard to achieve the success of promoting thrift. Then, Minister of Social Welfare Ding delivered instructions, with many words of encouragement. Chen Jiufeng read out the constitution, which was unanimously approved with enthusiastic applause. The list of directors was also approved. Finally, temporary motions were submitted to the executive committee for handling, and the meeting was adjourned successfully.

Minister Ding's Speech

Minister Ding's speech briefly stated that the necessity of thrift is beyond discussion. However, the target of promotion should not be the majority of poor and impoverished people, who have already saved as much as possible, but rather the small number of extravagant and luxurious people. This is the first point to note. When promoting thrift, we should use theory to convince others, make them understand, and make them save automatically. Furthermore, we should advise or correct them. This is the second point. In all matters, we must not violate human nature, and especially not destroy government laws or hinder local security for the sake of promoting thrift. This is the third point. The Thrift Association is composed of adult citizens who have been tempered in society for a long time, can deeply understand human nature, and can certainly take into account government laws and local security.

### Wu Bojin and His Brothers Donate Birthday Gifts to Education; Donate 7,500 Yuan to This Newspaper's Scholarship Fund

This newspaper received a letter yesterday from Wu Bojin and Wu Boyu, stating that the 25th of this month is the 50th birthday of their mother. In view of the difficult times and wishing to avoid extravagance, they accepted the generous gifts from relatives and friends. Unable to refuse, they donated a portion of the birthday gifts, totaling 7,500 yuan, to this newspaper's scholarship fund to cultivate talent and benefit relatives and friends. The profound significance is deeply admired.

Zhendan Pharmaceutical Factory Medical Scholarship

This newspaper received a letter from Zhendan Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory stating: Our factory believes that our country has a vast territory and a large population, and the number of doctors in the country is not sufficient to meet the proportional needs. Compared with advanced countries, there is a great difference. In addition, there is a shortage of pharmaceutical technology talents. Both of these factors have a direct and indirect impact on the health of our people. Therefore, the cultivation of medical and pharmaceutical talents cannot be ignored. As a member of the pharmaceutical industry, our factory aims to fulfill its responsibilities. Coinciding with New Year's Day this year, which is the anniversary of our factory's founding, we have decided to dedicate a portion of the operating income for the 32nd year to the promotion of pharmaceutical talents, called the Zhendan Pharmaceutical Factory Founding Anniversary Medical Scholarship. (The details are in a separate charter.) In order to handle it properly, we dare to arrange all procedures. We hope to be of some use, even if it is not enough to popularize it to poor students who are interested in medicine and pharmacy. However, our factory's intention is simply to fulfill our duty to take from society and use it for society. The sum of 25,000 yuan will be used as the scholarship fund. The quota is set at 50 students, divided into 40 medical students and 10 pharmacy students, in order to supplement tuition and fees. Shen Bao and Xin Bao each belong to the department (20 medical students and 5 pharmacy students.)

Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday

The scholarship funds received by this newspaper yesterday are listed below: Wu Bojin and Wu Boyu (birthday gifts from relatives and friends for their mother's 50th birthday donated to education) 7,500 yuan, Colleagues of Tianlun Silk and Cotton Department Store 2,000 yuan, Shu Chengxi (birthday gifts from relatives and friends for his 50th birthday and saved funds) combined 2,000 yuan (Chen Liangji, Chen Liangyuan, Chen Liangbiao, Chen Zengliang, Bei Shishi, Luo Yuanchong, Liu Acai, 200 yuan each, and the donor himself 600 yuan), Xue Jun 1,000 yuan, All Chinese staff of the Northern Sichuan Road Police Sub-station 230 yuan, Tao Songhan 200 yuan, All students of the sixth grade of the private Tianhou Palace Primary School (funds saved from New Year's cards) 150 yuan, Zuo Genfa, Chen Bingzheng, Huang Qi, and Sun each 100 yuan, Zhejiang Grand Theater (contributed on behalf of others) 50 yuan, Mrs. Zhang 2,000 yuan, Shi Xichen (birthday gifts donated) 2,000 yuan, Shi Pingkuang 1,000 yuan, Tired Traveler from a Foreign Land (monetary value of donated Shaoxing wine from subordinates donated) 500 yuan, Chen Suzhen 500 yuan, Students of the fourth and fifth grades of Jiangxi Middle School (funds saved from candy and New Year's cards) 405 yuan, Xu Zai, Yuan Chengming (birthday blessings for Chen Jinxiang's 40th birthday donated) 400 yuan each, Shen Yuqin 375 yuan, Yang Zaiqing 200 yuan, Mr. Hang and Chen Zixian 100 yuan each, Zhejiang Grand Theater (contributed on behalf of others) 90 yuan, Ye Jingqi and Qing Ting (wishing relatives and friends a happy new year remotely) 10 yuan each.

### Kong Xiangxi's Cousin Cao Shoutian Escapes from Chongqing to Shanghai; Discusses the Reality of Chongqing's Financial Corruption

Central News Agency: Cao Shoutian, cousin of Kong Xiangxi, former confidential secretary of the Central Bank and director of the Eastern Sichuan Tax Bureau in the Sichuan-Kang region, having witnessed the reactionary acts of Chongqing and deeply felt the error of the war of resistance, traveled thousands of miles, recently escaped from Chongqing to Shanghai, and is participating in the peace movement. He is reporting everything to the relevant authorities. The number of private followers and others with surpluses of tens of millions of yuan is not small.

The U.S. loan was established after running by Song Ziwen, the "Foreign Minister" of Chongqing last year with a loan of 50 million U.S. dollars, mortgaging Chongqing's main materials such as steel, silver, oil, and wool. The U.S. side exchanged it for inferior weapons. Since the friendly Japanese army occupied Burma last year, the Yunnan-Burma Road has been cut off, and the transportation mechanism cannot be extended. Ten transport planes flying daily from Kolkata were used to transport goods to Kunming. On average, each plane only carried 20 cans of gasoline, a small number of light weapons, and private items needed by Chongqing. In addition to the four cans of gasoline required for the round trip, the remaining 16 cans could only maintain the current amount of gasoline used by Chongqing's aircraft and private use. The amount of military supplies transported was extremely small. Therefore, the so-called Chongqing-U.S. loan is actually a trick to deceive the public. At the same time, in order to strengthen its utilization, Chongqing issued so-called "National Construction Thrift U.S. Dollar Savings Bonds," promoting the convenience of studying in the United States, exchanging Chongqing currency for the bonds, replacing the purpose of the Chongqing-U.S. loan. On this point, the U.S. financial community is deeply dissatisfied with Chongqing's despicable plan.

Before leaving Chongqing at the end of October, I stayed in Kunming for two months. At this time, Chongqing was talking about dreams to supply and rebuild the army, preparing to open the Yunnan-Burma Road. Now the Chongqing troops stationed in India are all under the command of Lord Mountbatten, and Chongqing is indifferent. During my years of serving as the director of the Eastern Sichuan Tax Bureau, the annual tax revenue exceeded the fiscal revenue. I carefully eliminated malpractices and governed impartially. However, the Chongqing authorities were昏聵and blindly witnessed various reactionary acts. I deeply felt the harm of the war of resistance to the country, so I returned to Shanghai via an alternative route and joined the peace movement. From now on, under the leadership of President Wang, the highest leader, I will do my best to work for peace and national construction.

### The Racecourse Buildings Will Be Handed Over to the National Government

Central News Agency: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the enemy property racecourse buildings and all affiliated facilities under the management of the Japanese army will be handed over to the National Government soon. After careful research on the utilization policy of these facilities by the Chinese and Japanese authorities, it is now known that a sports and social organization not for profit - the Shanghai Sports Association - will be formed under the guidance of the authorities by Chinese and Japanese people of goodwill. It is said that the association will manage and operate all the facilities of the racecourse (and will also operate the Western Overseas Chinese Sports Association, which has already been transferred). The Shanghai Sports Association held its inauguration ceremony at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 30th) on the second floor of the Broadway Mansion.

Comments from the Economic Sector

### End of the General Clearing Period

Today is the end of the general clearing period for banks and money shops. The joint reserve of the banking industry and the joint reserve of the money shops have long been prepared to provide accommodation to the banks and shops, doing their best to facilitate circulation, but must be limited to the proper use of each bank and shop. During this general clearing period, the central authorities have also made every effort to adjust to facilitate the activity of cash on hand. Therefore, at the end of this year, the tightness of money in the market is not as severe as in previous years, and all industries, except for a few engaged in speculation, can safely get through the end of the year, which is a clear proof of the proper financial allocation during the war and is gratifying to our economic community.

It is heard that in the past one or two days, a small number of banks, shops, companies, and businesses engaged in speculation, because they are unable to struggle, will close down. What we hope is that some of the various abnormal speculative transactions in this city will be extinguished due to the end of the year, and that there will never be a chance for a resurgence, and the responsibility of preventing problems before they arise still lies with our financial community; this practical responsibility is extremely important, because the instability of people's lives over the past year is directly due to the stimulation of prices by all speculative businesses. We have said that restricting price disturbances from the perspective of currency and finance is ultimately a price policy of "drawing firewood from under the pot." Therefore, in the future, we must pay more attention to the management of bank lending, so that capital for operating all improper businesses will no longer be obtained, and then the entire production industry will have a bright future.

### Banks and Money Shops Will Change Office Hours from Next Year: 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM

In order to save electricity, the banks and money shops in this city have decided to change their office hours from January 1, 1944, as follows: 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM daily, and 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM on Saturdays. The Bankers Association has notified all members to comply.

Implementation of Unified Accounting Subjects

Regarding the unified accounting subjects for banks and money shops, a consensus has been reached after discussions between the Central Reserve Bank and various banks, money shops, and trust companies. According to reporters, banks and money shops have implemented unified accounting subjects since the 27th, divided into liability, asset, asset-liability joint, and profit and loss categories.

### The Firewood and Charcoal Association is Formally Established

The association organization for businesses dealing in firewood and charcoal in this city previously only had three trade associations, such as firewood and charcoal, and miscellaneous firewood, before the incident. After the incident, they were divided into trade associations for firewood and charcoal, firewood and charcoal shops, miscellaneous firewood, and tree firewood. This time, in order to adapt to the wartime system, the authorities in this city have allowed the organization of a firewood and charcoal industry association, which convened an inaugural meeting at Cang Xi Shuchang a few days ago.

### Off-Exchange Trading of Chinese Stocks Tends to Be Firm

### Cold Weather Clothing Donations to Close Today; Future Donations to Be Used for Other Assistance Funds

At the request of readers, this newspaper launched a cold weather clothing donation campaign, which, although temporary, has received enthusiastic support from all sectors, and the results have exceeded expectations. The warmth of social sympathy is evident here. It has been decided to close the campaign today. All manufactured cold weather clothing will be distributed successively until it is finished. Future donations from all sectors will be used for other assistance funds. In addition, Mr. Rong Boyun and Dharma Master Fan Cheng have put a lot of effort into the planning of clothing materials and sewing for this cold weather clothing donation campaign. On behalf of the poor people who have benefited, we express our gratitude.

Yesterday, we received a letter from the staff of the Xinfu Woolen Company, saying: "In recent years, the disasters have not subsided, and we often hear cries in the wilderness. The country is suffering from famine, and the rooms are empty. People are gaunt and emaciated, and even if we give them food, they are still in rags. The situation is like the Zheng Xia's map. Moreover, the weather is cold and the year is coming to an end, and the clothes are like tattered quail. Who does not have parents? Who can be without feelings? However, we are ashamed that we are not wealthy and cannot help the current difficulties. We are pleased to hear that your office is raising funds for cold weather clothing, so we will offer the 5,000 yuan collected by our colleagues. We know that the amount is small, like a drop in the bucket, but it is also a small gesture." The donations received yesterday are as follows: teachers and students of Yangjian Primary School jointly donated 1,028 yuan; Wu Xuan (son's full moon celebration donation) 1,000 yuan; Li Liang 40 yuan; Zheng Zhou's family 200 yuan; Pingji 300 yuan; Li Liang Xilu 500 yuan; staff of Xinfu Woolen Company 5,000 yuan.

A weary traveler in a foreign land wrote yesterday: "At the end of the year, I received a bottle of Shaoxing wine from my subordinates as a token of respect. After receiving it, I pondered for a long time. When I was fifteen years old, my family fell into decline. I carried firewood and fetched water, working hard, but still could not afford tuition. Fortunately, the principal took pity on me and allowed me to enroll at half price, and I began to learn something. Now that the world is in turmoil, there are countless people who aspire to learn but are struggling financially. I think that I am not a drunken old man, I have neither the talent of an immortal nor the elegance of Su Dongpo. I am ashamed to receive something that is not suitable for me, so I will sell it for cash and offer the 500 yuan to meet the needs of loaning for education, and to benefit my subordinates. If the dignitaries in Shanghai can be moved by this and transfer the funds for a prosperous year to support education, then the seeds will grow faster under the rain and dew. Who knows if it will not be the fortune of society and the blessing of the country?" (Note: The funds have been included in the scholarship fund.)

A Poor Teacher Begs for Robes: I am a poor scholar who makes a living by teaching. The income from teaching is far from enough to support my family. Recently, the cold wind has been whistling and the severe cold is approaching. My old clothes are already tattered and unbearable. I have no choice but to appeal to the kind people in society to donate the robes they no longer want to wear to help me. Peng Xiaozhi. (Note: The cold weather clothing issued by this office is only a cotton-padded jacket and trousers. If various sectors donate old robes, this office can deliver them on your behalf.)

Lost and Found: Mr. Zhang Ruoliang found a bunch of keys on Beijing Road. The owner is requested to come to this office to claim them.

### Navy

By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Youth (7)

Army Major Kikuchi had only been a teacher in the puppet school for three years, but the influence on him was extremely great. Major Kikuchi was from Kumamoto Prefecture and was already in his forties at the time. But because of his sturdy physique and thick mustache, he always looked energetic and young. Because of his old stomach problems, he was transferred to be an assigned officer. Originally, he should have been a warrior shouting orders in the field. He had a firm will, acted strangely, and did not make polite remarks to anyone. Only he sometimes reprimanded the resolute Principal Kawada in person.

"You seem too arrogant. As the saying goes, when in Rome, do as the Romans do."

"No, my doctrine is that when in Rome, the Romans do as I do."

Because of this temperament, he did not care about anything when he took office and started the student style reform movement. He started a trumpet section, a shooting section, a poetry recitation section, a national defense comfort society, etc. in the school. He did what he thought was right. He did not care about other people's criticisms. Regarding Major Kikuchi's self-confidence, the following story is still circulating:

When General Takahashi Sanekichi led the fleet into Kagoshima Bay, Major Kikuchi said to Principal Kawada: "This is a good opportunity, please invite Commander Takahashi to speak! Please gather the students to the sports field."

"That's great. Have you already received the general's permission?" the principal asked suspiciously.

"No, not yet."

"Then you're making a big fuss."

"Never mind, please gather the students to the sports field."

Without waiting for a reply, Major Kikuchi ran out of the school gate and hired a car on the road. An hour later, General Takahashi appeared on the podium set up in the sports field.

"It's really too rushed, and I can't say anything systematic for a while..." the general said with a chuckle, and began his speech.

Even so, Major Kikuchi was also very easy to impress people. He affectionately called the failing bad students to his home. Major Kikuchi only told him to get up early. From the next morning, he had breakfast at Major Kikuchi's house and then went to school. In less than a month, the bad student seemed to have changed, and there was no need to worry about failing.

"Decide and act, and even ghosts and gods will avoid you." This was Major Kikuchi's mantra. It was his creed. The author remembered these words deeply in his mind, and did not forget them even nine years later.

### Overview of the Work of the Shanghai Refugee Learning Institute

C. Skill Training: After the refugees enter the institute, they emphasize learning and production, so that they have the spirit of self-reliance and can become good citizens of society after leaving the institute. Therefore, the institute attaches equal importance to indoctrination education and vocational education for the labor and skill enhancement of refugees, according to the agreed plan, and specially established a Craft Promotion Committee to promote various technical training, and hired technicians to specialize in teaching. The training subjects are as follows: Horticulture; Crops; Animal husbandry; Knitting; Straw weaving; Sewing; Shoemaking; Carpentry; Bamboo work; Washing and dyeing; Food production (making bread and cooking, etc.); Other

D. Basic Knowledge Training: Among the refugees in the institute, there are many who have academic qualifications and skills, but the majority are illiterate and lack skills. Basic knowledge training is the most urgent task at present. The institute uses the dining hall as a lecture hall, schedules time, holds adult and children's education classes, and promotes this type of training. The prescribed subjects are as follows: Literacy; Writing; Abacus calculation (simple bookkeeping); Common sense (social and natural); Other

In addition to the teachers appointed by the Education Committee to be responsible for education, those with excellent academic qualifications among the refugees are selected to assist in their work. Books, stationery, and various supplies are issued by the institute.

E. Life Guidance: Public life emphasizes discipline. The refugees have a fixed schedule for work and rest, and a punctual schedule for daily life. The observance of creeds and the implementation of oaths are guided and promoted by the director and district chiefs at any time, and regulations on assessment, rewards, and punishments are formulated as the standard for supervision. The promoted items are as follows: Various life guidelines; Various factory rules; District self-government training; Other.

5. Promotion of Learning and Diligence

In order to promote learning and diligence among the refugees, the institute divides the refugees into three districts for management: 1. Special District; 2. Agricultural District; 3. Craft District. The work reports of each district are as follows:

A. Special District: After the refugees enter the institute, this district first provides them with indoctrination and training according to their abilities, and then assigns them to work in the agricultural and craft districts. If they cannot abide by the rules or are negligent in the agricultural and craft districts, they are still sent to this district for re-indoctrination, in order to completely change their psychology. Since its establishment, in addition to implementing various life guidelines, it has also vigorously implemented district self-government training to inspire their spirit of mutual assistance and love, and from time to time assigns temporary work to temper them.

B. Agricultural District: This district is divided into three departments: horticulture, crops, and animal husbandry, which are promoted simultaneously. Horticulture Department: This department started in July, and selected dozens of people who were familiar with horticulture to cultivate more than 20 mu of vacant land in the institute, and sowed dozens of kinds of vegetables on time. The harvest in July and August was only able to supply a part of the institute's needs. The harvest in September reached more than 3,000 yuan. It is now trying to gradually expand, and the harvest in the future will increase day by day.

C. Craft District: This district is divided into four departments: grass, sewing, knitting, and carpentry. Since its establishment, it has taken initial shape.

6. Overview of Expenses: The expenses of the institute were previously budgeted by the municipal and district authorities together with the council at 4,191,820 yuan in national currency, with the Shanghai Special Municipal Government responsible for 1,000,000 yuan, the Engineering Bureau (District 1) responsible for 1,500,000 yuan, the French Concession Bureau (District 8) responsible for 750,000 yuan, and the council responsible for 941,820 yuan. This was the situation in the winter of 1942. Subsequently, prices soared indefinitely, and the start-up costs alone exceeded the original budget by more than 1,356,000 yuan. The regular expenses have been paid at more than 3,530,000 yuan in the five, six, seven, eight, nine, and six months after the start-up, and the full year is estimated to require about 7,000,000 yuan. At that time, because the amount exceeding the budget was too large, the council had to raise funds as much as possible to cope with it, which amounted to more than 1,000,000 yuan. Now that rice prices are soaring and prices of various goods are increasing, the funds required for 1944 will inevitably continue to increase. Although the municipal and district authorities are now providing large amounts of donations, and the amount recognized by this council has also reached more than 1,000,000 yuan, the actual amount exceeding the original budget is very large due to the high prices. At this time of exhaustion, we still hope that people of goodwill from all walks of life will provide assistance, promote charitable deeds, and benefit the refugees. This is not a small matter.
