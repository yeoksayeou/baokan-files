### Consultation on Gauze Rationing Procedures

On the 21st of this month, we, under the title "What Happens After Gauze is Purchased?", will present some principles based on various opinions regarding gauze rationing methods, hoping that the authorities will carefully consider them when planning the methods. Among them, the third point concerns the rationing procedure. We advocate that, in principle, the layers of passage should be reduced, because more layers mean more complicated procedures, longer time, and greater costs, which will result in time and economic losses for the recipients. Under this principle, we believe that the "Federation" level can be omitted for quicker action, and the "Wholesaler" level is for profit-sharing, redundant, and unnecessary. Our position is based on the perspective of reducing the consumption burden and providing common benefits to the majority of recipients. Of course, the interests of a few wholesalers cannot be taken into account. If there is another way that does not significantly affect the burden on consumers, while taking into account the legitimate profits of legitimate wholesalers in the past, allowing them to continue to exist during the transition period and maintain the livelihood of their entire industry, a certain leader of the gauze industry has sent a letter expressing his opinion on this issue, which is summarized as follows:

"...However, the third item needs to be discussed. The original intention advocates that the fewer layers in the rationing process, the better. The theory is undoubtedly correct. However, the facts also need to be taken into account. The Federation is an organization jointly established by producers and consumers. When the Ministry of Industry and Commerce formulated regulations, adding such an organization aimed to allow trade associations of two, three, or four types to negotiate and decide on disputes over the supply and demand of one or more items through the council of the association. This type of situation is particularly necessary in other counties, but the Federation should not collect handling fees when distributing materials to avoid exploitation. It should be clearly stipulated in the regulations to prevent malpractices. Whether wholesalers should exist is equivalent to whether Japanese trading companies engaged in gauze business should exist. Currently, there are more than 600 members of the Yarn Merchant Trade Association and more than 2,600 members of the Cloth Merchant Trade Association. If all these merchants are eliminated, the trade associations will be virtually dissolved. The Ministry intends that wholesalers who were normally engaged in gauze business before the incident, who have always supplied goods to factories or retail stores, and who have account books and receipts to prove it, should be allowed to continue their business. Even newly established similar merchants after the incident should be allowed to exist. If they are merchants engaged in hoarding and speculation, they should be reported by the trade association and their licenses revoked. This is the only way to show fairness. Now, cotton yarn is purchased by the government at a fixed price of 10,000 yuan from the black market price of 30,000 yuan. After adding the legitimate profit of wholesalers, the burden on the general public can be said to be minimal. At the same time, allowing hundreds of thousands of people (taking Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces into account) to avoid freezing and starvation is also a good intention of the government to care for the hardships of the people."

Regarding the opinions in the letter, with the industry's experience and consideration of the facts, they are also sufficient for the authorities to consider. The center of our previous advocacy was to "save time" and "reduce the burden." Therefore, taking the facts into account must be based on the premise of not violating these two principles in order to be a reasonable "consideration."

### After Reading Minister Aoki's Interview

Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki previously came to our country to hold talks with the National Government authorities and to investigate the implementation of the new policy towards China, and returned to Japan via North China and Manchukuo. Later, he had an interview with reporters from the Japan News Agency on the issue of controlled economy and political strengthening in China (the translation is published on the second page of today's newspaper). After reading it, we would like to express some thoughts as follows:

Minister Aoki reiterated that the goal of the policy towards China is to assist China's independence and freedom, and taking the return of concessions as an opportunity to implement cooperation. He regretted that some Chinese people have not been able to understand its importance, and criticized that some people in Shanghai have been detached from the rule of the country for many years and have become completely accustomed to a life of individualistic values. We have repeatedly stated that, from the standpoint of friendly countries, the focus of promoting the new policy towards China should be on "steadfast implementation" and "not seeking quick success," because the general character of Chinese people is to hold a not easily trusting attitude towards "new" things, and they will not immediately believe it without experiencing it for a considerable period of time. However, after believing it, they do not easily change. From the standpoint of the Chinese people, the practical process of Japan's new policy must be clearly investigated, and an attitude of acceptance and recognition should be expressed at any time to gradually eliminate past misunderstandings and gradually approach each other. This is what Chinese and Japanese people should deeply recognize today, when the relationship between the two countries is moving further forward.

Minister Aoki's observation on the issue of commodity prices in China is that the biggest reason is the lack of material resources. Therefore, he repeatedly mentioned the issue of increasing agricultural and industrial production, and expressed Japan's willingness to cooperate in promoting the solution of this issue. Minister Aoki is an economic expert and has served as the highest economic advisor to the National Government. His opinions on China's economy naturally deserve our attention. However, the point of increasing production has not only been mentioned repeatedly by us, but has also been established as a national policy by the government. However, no effect has yet been seen in the implementation. We pointed out yesterday that small industries and handicrafts in urban and rural areas should be given special support at present, because small and medium-sized industries are more dominant in Chinese society, and the production of small and medium-sized industries is very important for increasing material resources. Therefore, the government should lead the financial community to vigorously support, lend funds, guide technology, and connect transportation and sales, so as to allow them to fully develop freely. Here, we hope that friendly countries will assist us in solving difficult problems in fact.

Regarding the purchase of gauze, it is praised as a great success of the National Government's political power. If the purchased gauze can be exchanged for agricultural products and other necessary materials, it will surely have a greater effect on purchasing materials and controlling commodity prices. From the standpoint of China, we are ashamed of Minister Aoki's praise of political success, because the work is just beginning, and the distance to "success" is still far away. As for exchanging gauze for agricultural products, especially exchanging it for rice to solve the food problem in Shanghai, it is extremely necessary. In recent years, farmers have attached importance to physical objects and are unwilling to exchange goods for money. Therefore, exchanging gauze for food is easier.

Finally, we deeply feel that people in the ruling and opposition parties of friendly countries are very concerned about China's political and economic issues. However, concern is not enough. It is necessary to see through the hardships of the Chinese people and understand the psychology of the Chinese people in order to determine a cooperation policy centered on the Chinese people. Strengthening the power of the National Government certainly depends on Japan's cooperation; and strengthening the power of the people is even more necessary. Chinese and Japanese people who advocate cooperation to strive for the victory of Greater East Asia must fully understand this profound meaning!

### Japanese Prime Minister Announces to the People Decision to Strengthen Defense Posture Necessary Measures Have Been Taken for Administrative Operations

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo broadcast to the entire Japanese nation from here on the 22nd via the Central Broadcasting Station, under the title "Announcement to Officials and Civilians," explaining the various measures taken by the government to strengthen the domestic situation under the decisive battle, and expecting Japanese officials and civilians to actively cooperate with this. The following is the general content of Prime Minister Tojo's speech: "Officials and civilians, since December 8th of the year before last, the 100 million Japanese people have paid tribute to the Great Edict and have risen up with great enthusiasm for self-preservation and self-defense. To date, whether in combat or construction, there has been tremendous progress. This is unprecedented in world history. Recalling that I have been ordered to form a cabinet for nearly two years, especially after the Greater East Asia War, I have devoted great efforts to strengthening the domestic situation in order to achieve the purpose of the Greater East Asia War. Recently, the United Kingdom and the United States have spared no sacrifice to try to reverse their decline in a short period of time, and have repeatedly launched counterattacks. The intensity of the war is deepening with each passing day. Now that we have entered a critical juncture, our 100 million people should renew their determination and concentrate their total strength on the completion of the war with resolute courage. At this critical time, unanimous uprising and loyalty are the source of our country's victory. The Japanese people have been able to eliminate all foreign enemies and maintain the glorious national polity for 3,000 years because of this unique characteristic. The government is now actively reforming the operation of national politics. In the future, the military and the cabinet will become more closely connected in order to vigorously wage war and promote external policies. Therefore, we are determined to thoroughly strengthen various aspects of the domestic situation and rapidly enhance combat power.

### Cooperation Between the Ruling and Opposition Parties Achieve the Goal

The goals of the government in strengthening the domestic situation are as follows: Exerting the strength of officials and civilians to thoroughly implement the concept of the long-standing national polity; with the belief in certain victory, exert the entire national strength to seek military production, especially the rapid enhancement of aviation combat power; establish self-sufficiency in food supply between Japan and Manchuria. In order to achieve these goals, the government has adopted the following main points of the policies adopted this time: (A) Seeking the decisive battle of administrative operations. Necessary administrative measures have been taken. The simplification of administration has been implemented on a large scale. In view of the current stage of the war situation, the government is further reorganizing government offices, abolishing unnecessary measures, and implementing personnel reductions to strengthen the appropriateness of administrative operations. (B) In order to thoroughly mobilize national power, the government has adopted thorough measures for national mobilization in order to strengthen combat power in response to the current war situation, meet the requirements of operations, and increase production. The government has decided on the policy of national mobilization this time, and after implementing various emergency countermeasures, it will allow students to participate in combat. As for the main science and engineering departments, the government has made full arrangements for education. (C) In order to thoroughly strengthen the domestic defense posture, defending the homeland is mainly based on air defense. In order to ensure the safety of the capital and important cities, the government has decided to organize and relocate unnecessary government offices and schools from the capital and important cities to other places, implement the organization of various foreign corridors, unified control of organizations, and consolidated companies, and thoroughly reform their businesses according to the measures of the organizing office in order to reduce personnel and strengthen the simplification of the sea and land transportation and price allocation system, so as to contribute to the strengthening of combat power. The above-mentioned measures should be resolutely implemented, and their disadvantages should be thoroughly eliminated. This is the government's determination. The counterattack of the United Kingdom and the United States is becoming increasingly fierce, and the future of the occupation is becoming more and more complicated. However, this war is to eliminate the root of the disaster in East Asia, establish permanent peace in East Asia, and preserve the glory of the empire. Its victory always belongs to Japan. Although France and other countries are far away in Europe, the empire has repeatedly achieved the glory of mutual assistance through close cooperation. I hereby pray for the blessings of all allied countries, and at the same time, I express my greatest respect and gratitude to China, Manchuria, Thailand, Myanmar, and other countries in Greater East Asia for their cooperation with Japan, and wish their countries prosperity.

Resolutely Eliminate All Difficulties Strive for Rapid Realization

According to the Japanese government, the domestic posture strengthening policy established this time has great significance for the determination of administrative operations, the strengthening of national mobilization, and the strengthening of the domestic defense posture. The Japanese government also has an extraordinary determination to specifically realize this policy, eliminate all difficulties, and strive for rapid realization, and will not be bound by existing laws and budgets and resolutely take this measure. Therefore, each province is currently preparing implementation plans for each province based on the domestic posture strengthening policy this time, and will submit the original plan to the cabinet before the 26th of this month. After the cabinet's four chief officials' meeting has discussed it, it can be drafted into a complete case at the end of this month and submitted to the cabinet meeting for deliberation at the beginning of next month, and it will be implemented immediately after it is decided. The implementation of this case still requires various legal and budgetary measures, so the Japanese government is currently considering it, and will request to convene a temporary parliament when necessary.

### Japanese Women's Organization Labor Volunteer Corps

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese government recently decided to restrict men from taking up simple occupations that women can handle, and at the same time, in order to promote women's labor mobilization, it implemented the organization of women's labor volunteer corps. This project was approved by the Japanese cabinet and was announced by the Ministry of Health and Welfare on the afternoon of the 21st. The strengthening of women's labor mobilization is inevitable as the war continues. Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union have also implemented it one after another. US Secretary of Labor Perkins said that of the 4.5 million new workers added in the United States this year, women accounted for nearly 3 million. British Secretary of Labor Bevin also stated that 8.67 million women are currently directly or indirectly engaged in military-related work, of which 3.5 million are married or widows with children under the age of four. Therefore, although Japan has not yet reached the stage of requisitioning women, it is predicted that the situation of needing women will become increasingly urgent as the war heats up. Therefore, the Japanese government's implementation of organizing women's volunteer corps is based on the premise of requisitioning women. However, because it is automatically formed out of the people's loyalty, it is hoped that they will participate automatically as soon as possible.

### Japanese Air Force War Results Kunming Airport Bombed

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2 p.m. on the 22nd that from September 10th to 20th, the Imperial Army Air Force in China bombed enemy air bases, ships, and military facilities in China for several consecutive days. The details are as follows: Four air raids on Jian'ou on September 10th, 11th, 12th, and 19th, Nanxiong on the 18th, Kunming South on the 20th, Bombing enemy aircraft fields, destroying their taxiways and military facilities, and fighting more than 20 enemy aircraft in the airspace over Kunming, destroying 18 of them (8 unconfirmed), and destroying more than 24 large aircraft parked in the field. Air raid on Badong, 80 kilometers northwest of Yichang on September 17th, near Wuzhou on the 19th, Bombing enemy ships, sinking and destroying 7 transport ships and many boats. Air raid on Ruyuan, 200 kilometers north of Guangzhou on September 18th, and Yunfu, about 120 kilometers northwest of Guangzhou on the 20th, Bombing enemy military facilities, and five places were set on fire in Yunfu. Our side suffered damage of 6 aircraft self-destructing during the attack on Kunming.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) The city of Kunming, which was severely bombed by the Japanese Army Air Force, is the base of the main force of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. The US Chennault Command is located there. There are two large aircraft repair shops on the outskirts of the city. With this as the center, there are also numerous aircraft fields in Mengzi, Yunnan, and Nanning. The enemy air force has repeatedly used these aircraft fields as the center and dispatched from Kunming. Attack Myanmar and even attack Vietnam. The target of the Japanese Air Force's attack this time was the aircraft field south of Kunming City. The repair shop is adjacent to the Chongqing Central Air Force Military Academy, with each side being 1,600 meters long and having four taxiways, the longest of which is 2,000 to several hundred meters long. The Japanese aircraft last bombed Kunming on April 29th. It is reported that on that day, because Commander Chennault was not present, the duties were represented by Brigadier General Bray, who was injured by Japanese aircraft.

Japanese Commander Talks About Kunming Air Combat

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) A certain base of the Japanese army, 22nd telegram, the commander of a certain fighter squadron led his aircraft to bomb Kunming on the 20th and engaged in a fierce battle with enemy fighters. The commander of the squadron shot down four enemy aircraft, giving the enemy air force a major blow. The commander of the squadron recently talked about the battle situation on that day, saying that when we reached the airspace over the enemy aircraft field, more than 20 enemy fighters had taken off to patrol. Three or four enemy aircraft formed a group and launched attacks from all around. The enemy took our bomber formation as the combat target, so we took the initiative to attack the enemy aircraft group at a high altitude. When the distance between the enemy and us was far, we never fired. If we were close, we would fire fiercely. Soon, four enemy aircraft wanted to take the opportunity to hinder our bomber formation from fighting, and I immediately soared into the sky and flew over the enemy aircraft. Shooting at the nose of the enemy aircraft, and then counterattacking downwards, repeatedly shooting at it, and in a short time the nose of the enemy aircraft tilted downwards at an angle of more than 40 degrees, spitting out sparks, and the body was surrounded by flames and fell down. At that time, the enemy aircraft was only 50 meters away from our aircraft, and the face of the enemy pilot could be faintly seen. Not long after, another enemy aircraft attacked. It was confirmed that the enemy aircraft was hit while the injured enemy aircraft was fleeing, or it was also shot down. At that time, an aircraft shot down several enemy aircraft near our aircraft, and the enemy aircraft still stubbornly resisted. Its attention was completely focused on our Nie bomber formation, regardless of our fighter squadron, which is enough to show the poor tactics and low quality of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing.

### Recent Trends of Chongqing US Air Force

Japanese Army A certain base, 22nd (Central News Agency) Since the end of July, the elite units of the Japanese Air Force in China have launched a clever and valiant offensive, and the US Air Force has also struggled to counterattack. The two armies have repeatedly engaged in fierce air battles. Since September, the rainy season has passed, and the fighting has become increasingly fierce. The recent situation and trends of the US Air Force are briefly described as follows: The US Air Force, after being severely hit by the Japanese army, has recently attempted to launch a counterattack. Before August, the enemy's tactics were mainly based on guerrilla warfare due to fear of the Japanese army's fierce attacks. However, since the end of August, the enemy has been accumulating supplies on one hand and gradually adopting a counterattack posture on the other, and has begun to attack Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other places. The number of attacks has increased even more since September, and the enemy's tactics are no longer comparable to guerrilla warfare. They are constantly taking advantage of the gaps in the Japanese army's defensive positions and attempting to inflict damage on the Japanese army, but the Japanese army has taken the opportunity to counterattack and inflict heavy damage on the enemy. Moreover, when the enemy air force drops bombs, it is only innocent civilians who are injured due to fear or poor skills. The destruction of Japanese facilities and all attempts have completely failed, and the enemy's anxious situation of attacking has gradually become passive, and the bravery of the past is difficult to see again. The sharp decline in its morale is worthy of attention. This is because the enemy air force headquarters is eager to recover its reputation, so it issues attack orders regardless of the other party. On the other hand, the enemy pilots have gradually recognized the excellence of the Japanese Air Force. The pilots are skilled and brave in combat, so they have gradually shrunk back. They are forced to attack after being ordered, so once they encounter a fierce attack by Japanese aircraft, they immediately abandon their original intentions and flee in embarrassment, especially the enemy's B/40 aircraft, once encountering a fierce attack by a Japanese fighter squadron, immediately escapes to the nearby cloud layer. This is a common ugly behavior recently. When Japanese enemy aircraft air raid the Guangzhou area, the enemy fighters, because they were pursued by Japanese aircraft, hid under the belly of the bombers. The enemy aircraft, due to the attacks and interceptions by Japanese aircraft, has not only suffered aircraft losses, but also lost many pilots. Because this is a confirmed fact. The enemy is facing serious problems due to the difficulty in replenishing aircraft and the shortage of pilots. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently maintained the level of a total of 1,000 fighters and bombers due to a slight replenishment, but the Japanese aircraft's attacks often come as a surprise to the enemy and have repeatedly made great achievements, and the large-scale offensive to destroy the US Air Force is becoming increasingly fierce.

It appears that the Allied forces are attacking Naples from the left flank because the Allied forces are being pressured by the British Eighth Army advancing north from Calabria and Apulia, so they are launching this action. A portion of General Montgomery's forces seems to have made contact with the Allied forces in the Eboli area, while its main force is still behind the front line. At the same time, according to an announcement from the Führer's headquarters on the 21st, German rear guard units are currently fighting east of Potenza and have repelled the British army, but the Allied forces are actively launching another large-scale offensive in that area, making a desperate advance. Therefore, the Allied forces are hastily reorganizing their units. At the same time, the German army has also been preparing its units and reinforcing reserve troops in the past few days, awaiting the enemy's attack in a well-defended position."

Details of the Great Battle in the Salerno Area

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Havas war correspondent Weber, who witnessed the battle on the Salerno front, provided a detailed report as follows: "On September 9th, the troops of the American Fifth Army, under General Clark, landed in the Salerno area. The battle is proceeding in the mountainous area along the coast, 1,000 meters above sea level. The intensity of the battle exceeds that of the ten-day defensive battle in the Catania area. Reports from the British 46th Infantry Division and British military commentators jointly declare that this is the most difficult operation. One day after the landing, Clark's troops were already in a dangerous state. German armored units launched a sudden counterattack, and the Allied line was extremely chaotic. Italian troops attempting to join the German army from the coast to reach the German line claimed that the Allied casualties were extremely heavy, stating that the entire area was covered with the corpses of British and American soldiers. This is the first time the British and Americans have used large-scale paratroopers, many of whom landed from the air in an attempt to occupy important mountain positions, hoping that they could emulate the bravery of the German paratroopers to disrupt the enemy and open up important transportation routes. A report from the 46th Division also acknowledged the Allied crisis, stating that many of the paratroopers who landed inland were annihilated by the newly equipped German army. In the twelve days of fighting in Salerno, two German divisions initially fought against two British and American divisions. After suffering heavy losses, the Allies immediately received reinforcements. Therefore, the enemy, with a force of seven divisions, fought against the two divisions of the German army. The German army, having learned of the contact with friendly forces from Calabria, achieved great success because the enemy originally wanted to cut them off. The enemy hoped for the fall of Naples eight days ago, but it is still firmly defended by the German army. The enemy's breakthroughs or flanking maneuvers have all failed. It is not yet possible to make a definitive statement as to whether the battle of Salerno is over, but the fact that the German army can evade the enemy's pursuit without being attacked has realized the German army's particularly ingenious tactical command in this area. However, it is highly possible that a further evacuation movement will be made on the Salerno front, centered on Naples, because its main purpose has now been completed: to re-establish contact with the main force from Calabria and inflict maximum losses on the enemy. The Allied losses in this area exceed 15,000."

### Berlin Unconcerned About Churchill's Speech

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Political circles in Berlin are not paying attention to the speech given by British Prime Minister Churchill in the House of Commons yesterday. According to German diplomatic sources, Churchill's speech studiously avoided discussing military issues, lest it arouse the suspicion of impartial observers. The description of the Italian betrayal has a historical significance and is sufficient to cause the call made by Badoglio yesterday for Italians to lay down their arms and cease combat operations. Because the conclusion of the armistice agreement has reached this point, its mask has been exposed by Prime Minister Churchill. Churchill revealed in his speech that Badoglio's representatives had assured the British ambassador that Badoglio's government was indeed preparing to join the British and American side to fight against Germany. Churchill's remarks about Mussolini's rescue conveyed that Badoglio's plan to hand over Mussolini had failed. This caused great disappointment on the Allied side.

Details of Badoglio's Surrender

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a London dispatch, British Prime Minister Churchill stated in a speech to the House of Commons yesterday: "After the Mussolini regime was overthrown, the Allied nations wanted to find a way to make the Italian authorities surrender unconditionally in the shortest possible time and reduce the Allied casualties to the minimum. Before long, the Badoglio government sent personnel to explore the situation in various ways, inquiring about the deficient conditions and explaining all the difficulties that surrender would entail. Although the Allied nations paid attention to the difficulties, they still insisted on unconditional surrender. On August 15, a certain general, an Italian diplomatic representative, visited the British Ambassador to Spain, Hoare, and presented credentials indicating that he had been fully authorized by Badoglio and informed him that the Badoglio government was prepared to join the British and American side after the Allied forces landed. At that time, Prime Minister Churchill was attending the Quebec Conference. After obtaining the consent of President Roosevelt and the British War Cabinet, it was decided that the Allied Mediterranean Command would dispatch British and American staff to Lisbon to meet with Badoglio's representative. On August 19, a meeting was held in Lisbon. One side stated that only unconditional surrender could be accepted, and the military conditions were also notified to the Italian representative. He did not object, but stated that the purpose of his visit was to discuss the issue of Italy joining the Allied side in combat. The Italian general took the conditions back to Rome and stated that he would return here on the 31st to submit the Badoglio government's reply to General Eisenhower. He was also informed that internal and political conditions would be raised. At the same time, another Italian general, accompanied by former British prisoner General Carton de Wiart, arrived, but this was not enough to affect the judgment of the situation. General Carton de Wiart also expressed his willingness to resume his status as a prisoner, but the Italian representative rejected this proposal. Thereupon, General Carton de Wiart was released with the British. On August 31, the Italian representative met again with Eisenhower's representative and stated that Badoglio was willing to accept the conditions without reservation. The declaration of peace was made at an appropriate time chosen by the Allied side, so as not to be taken advantage of by the Germans, that is, the armistice was declared only a moment before the Allied forces landed on Italian soil. The Allied nations, to the extent possible, will provide considerable assistance to this unfortunate government. Regarding the plan to hand over Mussolini, the British Prime Minister said: "This was one of the main conditions, but before the armistice or the Allied landing, it was impossible to implement the handover. The Allies had sufficient reason to believe that Mussolini was in a safe location and guarded by heavy troops. The handover of Mussolini seemed to be imminent one day, but the changes in the environment were beyond the control of the Allied nations. The Badoglio government's steps had originally been very careful. They did not use sufficient force to detain Mussolini, and they did not anticipate that German paratroopers would land at the location where Mussolini was being held. It is said that Italian soldiers had orders that if anyone tried to rescue him, Mussolini should be killed without pardon. The surrender conditions were signed on September 3. After studying the conditions, the Soviet Union authorized General Eisenhower to sign on behalf of the Soviet Union. Thus, the armistice agreement was agreed to by Britain, America, and the Soviet Union."

### Foreign Minister Eden Clarifies Relations with Spain

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – British relations with Spain was the subject of many questions put to Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons today. These relations included the recent meeting between British Ambassador to Spain Sir Samuel Hoare and General Franco. Eden replied that Hoare had urged Franco to note the British government's frequent complaints of dissatisfaction with actions that discriminated against British interests. While the Spanish government had dealt with a number of these incidents, some remained unresolved. When asked if the British government had considered appropriate measures in case General Franco's response was unfavorable, Eden replied, "The government has agreed to investigate these grievances, and I deeply hope that they will be able to address them."

### British and American Air Forces To Continue Bombing German Cities

Amsterdam, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to London reports, British Prime Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons on Tuesday that British and American air forces will continue to carry out organized destruction of German cities in the future.

### U.S. Production Board Chairman Nelson Visits Britain

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to London sources, U.S. Production Board Chairman Nelson arrived in London yesterday and immediately visited British Production Minister Lyttelton. This is Nelson's first visit to Britain since taking office, and it is at the invitation of the British Production Minister. In the past year, the British Production Minister has visited Washington twice.

### New Australian Cabinet Sworn In; Government Structure Unchanged

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to information received here, the second Curtin government of Australia was sworn in at Canberra on Monday. The structure of the government is the same as before the recent election, with only minor changes. After Foreign Minister Evatt refused to run for re-election, Army Minister Forde was elected Deputy Leader of the Labor Party and Deputy Prime Minister. The cabinet members are as follows: Prime Minister Curtin, Army Minister Forde, Treasurer Chifley, Attorney General and Foreign Minister Evatt, Supply Minister Beasley, Navy Minister Makin, Air Force and Civil Aviation Minister Drakeford, Minister of War Organization and Industry Dedman. The above individuals are all members of the War Cabinet. Other cabinet members include representatives from various factions of the Labor Party, most of whom support the workers. The Sydney Morning Herald commented on the new cabinet, stating: "The success of the first Curtin government, on the whole, cannot conceal the failures and weaknesses of individual appointments." Forde's appointment as deputy leader is a reward for his many years of loyal service, but he is not suitable to act as prime minister. The Sydney Morning Herald stated that several extremely mediocre cabinet members have made a comeback. The biggest weakness of the Labor Party is the positioning of unsuitable individuals. If Curtin wants to strengthen his government, he should appoint young and talented individuals as undersecretaries and assistant cabinet members.

### Staff of Italian Embassy in Germany Detained

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Staff of the Italian Embassy who did not join the new Fascist government are currently being held at a well-known resort in Bavaria. Staff of the embassy and most Italian civilians, many of whom were journalists, had already boarded a special train to return to Italy, but after Italy surrendered and Badoglio fled, Italian territory was either occupied by the Allies or under the jurisdiction of the Fascist Republic. Therefore, they could not return home. Italian journalists have been allowed to continue to Italy, but diplomatic personnel are being held in Bavaria.

Fierce Fighting in Smolensk Front; German Troops in South Adopt Evacuation Strategy

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Havas: Currently, the focus of the fighting on the Eastern Front remains in the Smolensk area. Soviet troops are using large quantities of artillery and tanks to launch fierce attacks on German defensive positions and attempting to use a pincer movement to encircle the city from the south. North of the Moscow-Smolensk highway, Soviet troops are advancing towards the northern defense line of the city, and German counterattacks have been successful. The weather in the southern part of the Eastern Front has improved, so Soviet troops are about to launch another offensive, with newly equipped reserve mechanized units participating. The pressure from Soviet troops along the northern coast of the Sea of Azov is particularly intense. The Soviet objective is clearly to reach the Dnieper River bend and Crimea. Through skillful operations, German troops have cut off the link between the advancing Soviet troops and their rear, and Soviet troops are currently trapped a few kilometers east of Melitopol and Zaporozhye. Soviet troops are concentrating their forces behind their positions, indicating that the Soviet command is about to resume the offensive. Further north, Soviet advances towards Dniepropetrovsk have achieved only minor successes, but German troops are adopting flexible strategies, so their losses are very small. The strong German defensive fortifications in the Poltava area have been able to resist for several weeks, and on Monday, the situation there was largely unchanged. Southeast of Nezhin, the Soviet pressure on the Kiev area seems to be weakening, but in the north, Soviet troops are increasing pressure in an attempt to approach Chernigov and reach the mountainous area in the middle of the Dnieper River. Fierce fighting is taking place in this area. West of Bryansk and east of Rostov, Soviet troops have made advances due to the German evacuation movement. In this area, Soviet troops have achieved only slight success.

### Strengthening Economic Control, Exerting the National Government's Political Power: Aoki's Talk to Japanese Journalists Regarding the Greater East Asia Sphere

The unconditional surrender of the Batlle Berres government is clearly a betrayal of morality and divine will, an act intolerable to both gods and humans. Fortunately, Commander Mussolini has been rescued. Now, Germany's European fortress is gradually becoming stronger, and Japan's certainty of victory and invincibility in East Asia is becoming increasingly consolidated. The Imperial Government has declared its attitude to both domestic and foreign audiences: "Cooperation with the nationals of European allies and the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia is becoming increasingly close. We are consistently seeking to defeat our old enemies, Britain and America." We can only unite our efforts, exert our maximum war effort, control the movements in the coveted north, overcome the fierce battles in the South Pacific, and shatter the enemy's attempt to counterattack Burma, in order to strive for final victory and advance shoulder to shoulder with the nations of Greater East Asia. Therefore, we cannot but be concerned about everything in Greater East Asia, especially the movements of allied China. In response to a request from our newspaper, Aoki, the Greater East Asia Minister, disclosed the current situation of the China issue as follows. The following is a question-and-answer session between our reporter and Minister Aoki:

Question: To complete the Greater East Asia War, the unity of Greater East Asia is even more important. Everyone believes that resolving the China issue is the central task at present. Please share your insights on this point.

Assisting China's Independence and Autonomy

Answer: Due to the so-called unity of Greater East Asia, the importance of resolving the China issue is even greater, and we must make even greater efforts in the future. The goal of the government's policy towards China, as clearly indicated by Prime Minister Tojo, is to assist the Republic of China in achieving independence and autonomy. During my recent visit to China to inspect the actual situation, I witnessed various measures.

One of them is the adjustment of government agencies, the most prominent of which is the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council. This seems to be an organization with the nature of a wartime cabinet. Important national policies can be quickly decided and strongly implemented in the National Defense Council, and representatives of the North China Political Affairs Commission also participate in it. Other economic measures, such as the National Economic Commission and the New People's Movement Promotion Association, as well as the agencies for national spiritual mobilization and their operations, have made significant progress compared to before. Another point that is significantly different from what I saw when I was in China is the strengthening of the National Government's position in economic control. In the past, many economic control matters were managed due to our military needs, but now most of them have been transferred to the National Government for its own handling, especially regarding the control of prices and materials. With the National General Chamber of Commerce as the center, the autonomous control of private sector operators is implemented, and the government stands in the position of supervision and guidance, carrying out the control in the form of official-private cooperation or Sino-Japanese cooperation. I believe that this can open a new path for exerting the National Government's political power in the future.

Question: It is said that the National Government's political power has penetrated deeply into the people in various places. Then, to what extent has it spread to Shanghai? In other words, has the National Government now grasped Shanghai? Is it possible to mobilize Shanghai's national capital and make it participate in China's economic construction?

Answer: Taking over the Shanghai concessions is one of the important policies towards China. Seeing the scene of the Kuomintang flag flying everywhere fills me with emotions about the past and the present. Therefore, the recovery of the concessions can be regarded as the realization of the national goal since Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution. As a result, most knowledgeable people can understand the significance of recovering the concessions for China's independence and autonomy. However, some people do not fully understand its importance to the country, which I find regrettable.

I believe that this is because the people of Shanghai have been detached from the rule of the country for many years and are completely accustomed to a life based on personal interests. Especially now, due to price issues, everyone is concerned about economic problems, shifting their focus to daily life issues, and inevitably neglecting the significance of important national issues.

However, economic problems will gradually stabilize. Moreover, in today's world, people in any part of the world cannot escape the control of the country. If they can understand this point, the people of Shanghai will naturally understand the true significance of resolving the concession issue.

Question: Regarding China's price issue, the fundamental cause may be currency instability or the Shanghai financial community's bystander attitude towards the war. I would like to hear your insightful views on this point.

The Root Cause of the Price Issue

Answer: China's price issue, on the one hand, is of course related to goods, and on the other hand, of course, it is related to transportation. The so-called Shanghai was once a concentration point for cheap foreign goods, that is, a region where goods from various countries in the East freely entered. However, the freezing of funds by Britain and the United States, followed by the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, has made the import and export of goods greatly different from the past. From the perspective of prices, this is the biggest reason for the high prices. As for domestic production, a part of it is due to the war, the security is unstable, and the productivity is hindered. Also, due to transportation and distribution, as well as various restrictions on sales and distribution, it cannot proceed smoothly. Due to various reasons unavoidable under wartime conditions, this is a major cause of the shortage of materials. The procurement of materials, especially the control of prices, cannot be as effective as in Japan, which is also a reason for the shortage of materials. Therefore, in any case, in addition to rationally allocating and utilizing existing materials, it is necessary to increase agricultural production, eliminate the anxiety about the food problem, and at the same time promote the production of daily necessities in Shanghai and other places, utilizing China's rich production capacity of raw materials, and cultivating the absolute quantity of material supply. Focusing on doing this, Japan will also cooperate in promoting the resolution of this issue, which is the most important thing. Of course, on the other hand, it is also necessary to encourage savings and strengthen economic control at any time, and it is necessary to fundamentally increase production and promote smooth sales. These must be placed at the center of attention.

Question: In Shanghai, the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has recently been implemented. Regarding this measure, from the perspective of materials or currency, people believe that it is a measure to suppress the rise in prices. I wonder if, subsequently, Shanghai prices will have a gradual downward trend?

Cooperating in Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth

Answer: The National Government implemented the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Shanghai in early August, and our country also cooperated with the Chinese policy and purchased cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Japan. This is a typical example of the National Government's vigorously implemented price policy and material countermeasures, as well as Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Regarding this point, not only Shanghai, but most of the people welcome the National Government's wise decision. This can be said to be a great success for the National Government in exerting its political power, and its impact on prices is particularly significant. Not only did the price of cotton yarn and cotton cloth fall to the purchase standard price, but other prices, except for a part, also fell. Recently, Shanghai prices have been rising almost step by step, but due to the measures taken, the rising trend stopped suddenly, and the reaction turned to a decline. This is unprecedented in Shanghai's economic circles.

The purchased cotton yarn and cotton cloth will be under the control of the National Government in the future. If it can be used to purchase agricultural products and other necessary materials, it will be able to exert a greater effect on procuring materials and controlling prices.

Question: From the perspective of stabilizing people's livelihood and grasping people's hearts, the most important thing is the food issue. The food supply in Central China can generally be self-sufficient, and the food supply in North China has always been regarded as difficult. Please talk about the food situation in North China, focusing on the food issue.

North China Striving to Increase Food Production

Answer: The food issue is indeed important from the political aspect of stabilizing people's hearts, the price issue, and the perspective of promoting various industrial plans. North China was originally a place where it was necessary to obtain food subsidies from other places. This is based on historical statistics that can be investigated. Therefore, the authorities of the North China Political Affairs Commission and the Japanese side are also doing everything possible to increase food production. They have engaged economic research institutions to fundamentally study the countermeasures for increasing food production in North China to cooperate with the Chinese policy. However, it is not easy to achieve self-sufficiency in the short term. On the one hand, it is still necessary to increase the production of cotton and other products. The current countermeasure is to supplement the shortage from various sources. The methods are left to the Chinese side to devise, and our country will provide full cooperation.

### Food Control Committee to Be Established Soon; Organization and Personnel Determined; Sino-Japanese Members to Cooperatively Promote Committee Affairs

Central News Agency report: The Rice and Grain Control Committee, which is being actively prepared, has held preparatory meetings and determined the entire plan for purchasing rice and grain. The internal organizational structure and important personnel will be officially announced within the next few days. The official establishment date is expected to be no later than October 1st. Sino-Japanese members of the committee will cooperatively promote committee affairs. According to reliable sources, the internal organization of the committee is divided into four sections under the Secretary-General: Confidential Section, Document Section, Foreign Affairs Section, and Planning Section. Under the sections, there are four departments: General Affairs Department, Finance Department, Purchasing Department, and Storage and Distribution Department. Under the four departments, there are three to four divisions, and under the divisions, there are groups, and under the groups, there are offices. It is heard that the plan stipulates that the purchase and storage of rice and grain in the domestic rice-producing areas will be mainly undertaken by the Rice and Grain Trade Association, and it is also necessary to restore the establishment of the Rice and Grain Trade Association in various places.

Establishment Date Still Under Discussion

Another report: The Rice and Grain Control Committee has become an event of great concern to all citizens since its preparation. According to a report by the Datong News Agency reporter, although the establishment date of the committee has not been determined, most of the personnel have been appointed. Since yesterday, a paper sign "Rice and Grain Control Committee Preparatory Office" has been posted on the first floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the offices of each department have also been set up. The main hall on the first floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been decided to be converted into the general office of the Rice and Grain Control Committee. Because the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a membership meeting in the main hall on the 26th, the layout of the office will not be able to start until after the 26th.

Most Important Personnel Determined

According to inquiries from responsible parties in the committee, most of the internal personnel have been determined. The head of the Finance Department is Zai [blank], the head of the General Affairs Department is Wu Huanru concurrently, the head of the Purchasing Department is Yan Jiyun, and two deputy heads, one Chinese and one Japanese, have been added. The Chinese side is Shen Linqing, and the Japanese side is Ueda [blank] Jiro (specialist of the Japanese Embassy). The head of the Storage and Distribution Department is Chen Ziyi, and two deputy heads, one Chinese and one Japanese, have been added. The Chinese side is Gu Jiren, and the Japanese name has not yet been announced. Only one deputy director is set up under the director (not one Chinese and one Japanese), and the candidate has already been nominated as Hirono Toichi (Chairman of the Sino-Japanese Rice Grain Cooperative Association). As for the position of Secretary-General, a suitable candidate must be found.

Second Batch of Allotted Rice in Contact for Shipment

The Ministry of Food has allocated 150,000 bags of rice for civilian consumption in this city in the second batch. Among them, except for 50,000 bags in the Jingyang area and 18,790 bags in the first batch of Huzhou area that have not been transported, totaling more than 68,000 bags, the Japanese Huazhong Rice and Grain Distribution Association is entrusted to transport them. The remaining 100,000 bags in the Su-Song-Chang-Jia area are designated to be transported from the production area to Shanghai by the Chinese agency in charge of procurement and distribution in order to maintain people's food supply. According to what the Shanghai News Agency reporter learned, the shipment certificate for the second batch of food rice has been issued by the Ministry. As soon as the representative sent by the responsible transportation agency and the local grain administration personnel in charge of production and sales negotiate the procedures, transportation can begin.

### Application for Retaining Cotton Yarn and Cloth Deadline This Afternoon; Yarn and Cloth Tax Rates to Be Changed

The National General Chamber of Commerce's Office for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth previously announced to all manufacturers that, in accordance with Article 30 of the Provisional Regulations for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth, factories and retailers should be allowed to retain an average quantity of one month's total sales or consumption in the first half of this year. Factories and retailers who have not yet come to the office to collect the application form for the retention of factories and stores and have not indicated the desired retention amount on the back can bring the temporary receipt from the office to collect it. It is known that the acceptance of this application form will be closed at 6:00 PM today, and those who are overdue will be regarded as having waived their rights. Also, when submitting the application, a sample of the goods must be attached.

In the past, the Ministry of Finance used a standard price of 5,500 yuan per bale of 20-count cotton yarn as the standard for levying 4% or 5% on cotton yarn and cloth, but at that time, the market price was actually 7 or 8 times higher than the standard price. This time, the government purchased cotton yarn and cotton cloth and stipulated that 10,000 yuan per bale of 20-count yarn is the standard price for yarn and cloth. The Ministry of Finance has decided to change the old tax rate. It is heard that the new tax rate in the future will also use 10,000 yuan per bale of 20-count as the standard, and all kinds of yarn and cloth will be uniformly levied at 5%.

Investigation Committee Established Yesterday

The National General Chamber of Commerce's Office for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth has established a Manufacturing and Processing Industry Investigation Committee and a Retailer Actual Quantity Investigation Committee to investigate and review the actual consumption of cotton yarn and cotton cloth by processing and manufacturing businesses and the actual sales of retailers. The committee members have been nominated and the organization is ready. The inaugural meeting was held simultaneously at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 22nd). Chairman Nie Lusheng presided over the meeting, reporting on the preparatory process and the significance of organizing the two committees. The regulations and the steps for investigating and reviewing yarn and cloth in the future were approved, and the work began immediately.

### Treatment of Foreign Prisoners Should Be the Same as Chinese Prisoners

In the past, the treatment of foreign prisoners in this city's prisons was different from that of Chinese prisoners due to treaty relations. This kind of unequal treatment should be corrected urgently. Since the National Government implemented the takeover of the concessions, this city's judicial institutions, under the guidance of the Ministry of Justice, have swept away the past abnormal state and gradually moved towards unification. All prisoners in prison should be treated equally regardless of their nationality. It is known that the Shanghai Prison plans to provide foreign prisoners with bread daily, and the rest should be treated the same as Chinese prisoners, thoroughly eradicating unequal treaties. After the Shanghai Local Procuratorate submitted the report, it has forwarded it to the Ministry of Justice for review and approval.

The local authorities in this city have now completed the plan for implementing planned distribution of three major commodities: salt, matches, and soap.

Yesterday's Newspaper Publication Time: 7:30 PM

Economic News

### Commentary: New Merchant Morality

"Commercial ethics" is a term that we have long heard of. In these times of wartime economic hardship, commercial ethics is especially a pathway to upholding social welfare and fulfilling the lives of the masses. Therefore, it is called "New Merchant Morality." Any price gouging, heavy interest, false weights and measures, as well as tricks to make profit, monopolies, and receiving commissions, are all the opposite of the new merchant morality and should be especially avoided by wartime merchants.

Because we cannot help but constantly suspect whether the rice shops are accurate in their measurements of rice sold, whether the restrictions placed by coal briquette merchants on citizens' purchase limits are necessary, whether the large quantities of sugar distributed to sugar shops are mostly supplied to the black market, whether the prices of the sugary foods they sell are reasonable, whether the weights and measures used in stores and vegetable markets are up to standard, and whether the lack of goods available in general stores is intentional. Because we have seen that all of these things are tied to merchant morality and are closely related to the lives of the people, we vigorously advocate for the promotion of the new merchant morality in wartime.

The basic elements that constitute the new merchant morality are: prioritizing the public good over private interests as its ideal, being loyal to one's position as its responsibility, and managing rationally as its principle. Prioritizing the public good over private interests will prevent harming others for one's own benefit (for example, supplying allocated goods to the black market); being loyal to one's position will prevent benefiting oneself at public expense (for example, pretending to open a store but actually hoarding goods); and rational management will prevent failing to exercise one's economic and social functions, namely, the ability to produce and allocate (for example, having materials but not producing, having goods but not selling).

In a word, money is a merchant's material capital, and morality is a merchant's spiritual capital; if merchants' moral concepts are not blinded by monetary concepts, then the problem of social welfare and the problem of the lives of the masses will be more than half solved, especially in wartime.

### Various Businesses Request Associations to Apply for Raw Material Allocation to Discuss Effective Ways to Maintain Operations

Various trade associations in this city have recently submitted requests from their member businesses stating that they lack raw materials for production, making it difficult to manufacture goods. In order to maintain normal operations and enable citizens to purchase goods, they are resorting to using the black market to supplement their supplies for sale. However, this practice only increases costs and is not a long-term solution. Therefore, they are requesting that the authorities be promptly informed of the current situation of their member businesses and that they be allowed to allocate the raw materials that were previously approved, such as sugar, oil, edible oil, sesame, red beans, vegetable beans, and soybeans, in order to maintain normal production and facilitate sales, thereby sustaining business operations. Recognizing that the matters stated by the member businesses are factual and in order to seek the welfare of the trade, the responsible persons of the various trade associations have promptly submitted the requests to the relevant authorities, requesting prompt allocation of raw materials; otherwise, not only will member businesses be unable to operate, but the citizens will also be affected. It is heard that some progress has been made. It is also learned that trade associations in the local confectionery, snack food, and strong-flower industries have recently convened meetings of their directors and supervisors to discuss matters related to improving the welfare of their members. They are also urging member businesses to strictly comply with sales regulations and to maintain close contact with the association in order to take unified steps to promote welfare.

China Stock Trends

Yesterday, the China stock market was unusually sharp, continuing the upward momentum of the previous day. Major players had already initiated the rally, and new and old investors further fueled the rise, causing sellers to raise prices continuously. In the afternoon, sellers disappeared, and prices continued to advance higher. The market sentiment was still pushing stocks in the new industry and department stores the most sharply. The details are as follows:

Financials: In the financial sector, stocks of Continental, Zhejiang Xingye, and Jin Cheng saw high prices emerge one after another. Salt shares showed a breakthrough. Other stocks were relatively flat.

Pharmaceuticals: New Asia Pharmaceutical saw a huge surge under heavy buying pressure, breaking through previous highs. The opportunity to step up another level was more than remarkable. China Medicine flew high under the absolute advantage of major players. Only China-England Dispensary remained at its original price. Stocks of New Star, Five Continents, China-West, and Star Perfumery all opened above the previous day's price. Suddenly, a buyer was found searching for Scientific Chemical, and it also rose sharply.

Department Stores: Wing On saw particularly rapid progress, rising two levels in both the morning and afternoon. Sincere also rose, exceeding previous highs in the afternoon. Stockpiled goods and Lane Crawford were both trending higher without looking back.

Textiles: The textile sector saw robust buying interest. Wing On Textile rose another level, with the afternoon buying price exceeding previous highs. Da Sheng Factories 1, 2, and 3 remained stagnant. Guangqin and Rongfeng Textile saw buyers push them up. China Textile, Sincere, and Meyer saw even stronger gains. Hongsheng, Wuhe, Hongxing, and Great China Weaving remained firm. American Wool also rose. China Underwear saw a sudden sharp increase, and in the afternoon, it also knocked on the door. Rumors of Jingfu dyeing and weaving's increased capital were even more prevalent, rising two levels again. Jinglun continued to see prices raised.

Real Estate: Stocks of New Yick, Union, Wing Hing, and other real estate companies continued to rise due to high demand and limited supply.

Utilities: Zhabei Water & Electricity and China Electricity saw flat performance in the morning but rose sharply in the afternoon.

Industrials: Jiu An Industrial rose above previous highs in the morning, and flew even higher in the afternoon. Great China, pulled out by buyers, surpassed previous highs in the afternoon. The price increase of Great China Matches was even more unexpected. However, Hua Cheng, Dian Nan Yang were more stable.

China and China Merchants Cement jointly rose above previous highs. Han-Yeh-Ping had buyers only after reaching previous highs. Great China Miscellany saw someone seeking to buy at high prices. Standard Mei Fen and Amoy Canning also saw strong gains. Many transactions of Baoan Glass, Great China Recordings, China Enameled Ware and China Brick & Tile also occurred outside previous highs.

Summary of Business Conditions

The bond black market was firm. Types A, D, C, and E all saw increases. Only Type B remained unchanged. Transactions were not sparse.

Call Loan Rate: Yesterday morning, the Call Loan Rate posted by the Money Industry Association was 1.8 cents per day.

Daily Necessities: The market for daily necessities showed mixed trends. Soap prices declined due to new Xiang Mao goods flooding the market. Match sales were still strong, and candles remained stable. The market saw more gains than losses. The market for pharmaceuticals has been weak recently, perhaps because the season has passed, sales channels are narrow, and speculators are afraid to act. Therefore, prices are generally weak. Among them, only Jiu Gutang Cai saw increases without retracement. Other products, such as Bagua Dan, Headache Powder, and Wanjin You, have stopped falling, but lack the strength to rise. Compared with the multiple times of price increase of other goods in the market, this is a world of difference.

### Searches Become Increasingly Strict

In order to ensure the normal supply of goods and to eliminate illegal manipulation, the authorities have taken decisive measures. Anyone carrying major or important goods must be subject to strict searches and must present a removal permit issued by the relevant authorities; otherwise, it will be considered illegal smuggling, and the goods will be confiscated, and the persons involved will be taken into custody for investigation. According to the Shanghai News reporter's investigation yesterday, the authorities have recently been increasingly strict in their search efforts. In addition to dispatching a large number of detectives near various land and water terminals to check the luggage of incoming and outgoing passengers, they are also deploying detectives at important intersections to pay attention to pedestrians carrying heavy packages and goods. At the same time, they are strictly prohibiting people from carrying heavy objects on trams or buses to prevent the smuggling of goods out of the area. Therefore, when citizens purchase items from stores, they should request an invoice to prove it when questioned by military police along the way.

### The Budding Era of the Nursery School Movement (Continued)

YWCA Nursery School

Located at 638 Weihaiwei Road (near Moore Road 4), the Chinese Christian Women's Youth Association has an affiliated "Working Women's Nursery School." It and the Shanghai Nursery School are sister organizations. Originally, when Ms. Bian and others initiated the establishment of a nursery school in Shanghai in the 29th year, there were two different opinions among the initiators. One side believed that serving the laboring masses was of the utmost importance and necessity, so they advocated for running a completely free nursery school that only accepted the children of laborers. The other side believed that the most urgent need for nursery schools at present was among general working women, not necessarily female workers, who worked in industry and commerce, and even served social organizations, and urgently needed to reduce their burden on their children. As a result, the authorities of the YWCA believed that the two could cooperate on a trial basis. Later, Ms. Bian Xusun took charge of the Shanghai Nursery School, while Ms. Chen Shanming, an official of the association, took charge of the Working Women's Nursery School. Its purpose is: 1. To seek the happiness of the children themselves, 2. To adapt to the needs of working women, 3. To instill in parents common knowledge of childcare, 4. To cultivate childcare talents, 5. To promote the nursery school movement. When it was first established, the quota was set at 50 children. The qualifications for admission were: 1. Aged two to four, able to walk freely, 2. Mothers with a job or career and no time to care for their children, 3. No infectious diseases after a medical examination. The procedures for admission were: 1. Introduced by someone, fill in the application form in detail, 2. Medical examination, 3. Fill out a guarantee form after admission. At that time, only day students were accepted, with admission at 8:30 am and departure at 5:00 pm. It was not until the autumn of the 30th year that boarding students were accepted at the request of general parents. Later, a kindergarten was added, and the business became increasingly developed. However, due to the limitations of housing and funding, they have not been able to realize their original ideals. There are now a total of 30 kindergarten students, including 14 aged four to six, and 16 aged one to four, and a total of 42 boarding students, including 20 aged four to six, and 22 aged two to four.

At 9:00 am, head teacher Dai Zizhen was already teaching the children to sing in the classroom on the second floor. This is the senior kindergarten class, and dozens of children are sitting in a circle, all happy. In several other classrooms, the children are being guided by teachers such as Gao Changming. In addition to the teachers, there are nine enthusiastic nannies caring for them. The daily menu is written on the blackboard next to the desk: Breakfast: Tofu salad, white porridge; Lunch: Stir-fried green vegetables, pig liver and mashed potatoes, green beans, potato soup; Afternoon snack: Pears; Dinner: Pig liver and vegetable porridge. The concern for economy, cleanliness, and nutritional value is truly painstaking!

The third floor is the children's dormitory, rest room, and playground. Although the room is not large, almost every square foot of the floor is well utilized, but it is arranged in a way that does not feel too crowded. Each low wooden bed has white, clean bedding. The washroom, bathroom, and medical equipment, although small and practical, are generally complete. The children of the vocational nursery school are the happiest generation. Just like the large slogan on the wall of the school: "Facing the sun! Facing the light! We grow up in collective life!"

Today and Tomorrow

Now in Shanghai, there are only two nursery schools run by the YWCA. Among them, the vocational nursery school charges the most fees. Starting from August of this year, the total monthly fee, including education fee, childcare fee, meal fee, snack fee, accommodation fee, medical fee, stationery and toy fee, and miscellaneous fee, is 130 yuan for a full-day student, 250 yuan for a full-day student including lunch, and 450 yuan for a boarding student. In reality, however, because the income of general working women and salaried workers is too low, few can pay the fee. Therefore, it is still a service, and the YWCA subsidizes it every month, at least more than 10,000 yuan. There is a risk of increasing difficulties in the future. As for the Shanghai Nursery School, since it does not charge any fees, the original annual budget for this year was 230,000 yuan, with 70,000 yuan allocated by the YWCA. However, the actual price increase is alarming, and the budget is far from sufficient. It relies entirely on donations from all sectors of society. Fundraising began last winter, and the results of fundraising this spring were about 100,000 yuan. In January, a request was made to the Shanghai Poverty and Sickness Relief Association for subsidies, and Commissioner Yao Huixiang went to investigate. He believed that the children accepted by the school were mostly the children of poor workers and orphans without guardians, and was a philanthropic organization with continuous activity, suitable for subsidies. Later, the association decided to subsidize 4,000 yuan per month from February to October, totaling 24,000 yuan. In August, another subsidy of 24,000 yuan was given. It played a role in promoting the nursery school movement.

In addition to funding, housing and talent are the two major difficulties currently facing nursery schools. The housing of the Shanghai Nursery School is indeed quite ideal, and there is also the possibility of expanding the number of students. Although the monthly rent is as high as 1,000 yuan, it cannot be said to be unusually high. However, the landlord has long had the intention of taking it back. Fortunately, the heart of those who understand the philanthropic meaning of helping the nursery school in a tactful manner, and the landlord also understands it, temporarily allowing it to be rented at double the price. If there are no further rent increases or forced evictions, it will be of great help to the future of the nursery school business. The housing of the working women's nursery school is still too narrow. If larger housing is available, it will definitely help the development of the business.

The nursery school is a new social enterprise. It requires people with vision, enthusiasm, valley power and specialized skills who can endure hardships, persevere, and work hard to serve. Such talents are still not easy to find today, especially because the light cost is too tight and the salary is too thin. The service providers themselves have come with the determination to sacrifice their service, and most of them are Christians who absolutely do not plan on material rewards, but if there is a family burden, and even their own lives are not enough to sustain, then it is not surprising that the mobility of the school's nannies and workers is too great.

The two nursery schools run by the Shanghai YWCA have opened a way for the Shanghai nursery school movement, and have proved the urgent need of society for nursery schools, and proved that as long as they are willing to run it seriously, it will definitely run well. However, after all, due to the lack of funds and talents, the scope of its business is still greatly limited, and there are still many obstacles in the future of the business. Their cause can only satisfy a small part of society's needs. In order to reform the early childhood education system and cultivate healthy children, in order to liberate women so that they can work hard for the social and national causes, China's nursery school movement must be widely developed, and Shanghai should be the base point of the national nursery school movement.

Review and Discussion

### Implementation of Taxation Rights

After the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, the implementation of taxation rights is an important part of the　New China Policy. The transfer of taxation rights has been moved forward　and is now scheduled to be implemented on October 1st. This matter is based on the Treaty on the Transfer of Taxation Rights concluded on July 31st of this year. The National Government made its first notification to the Japanese side on September 10th, and the official gazettes of China and Japan announced it on September 20th. We believe that the transfer of taxation rights is a natural measure. Looking back at Japan's new policy towards China at the beginning of this year, or tracing back to the earliest policy revealed in the Konoe Statement, we can see that this is an established national policy; now, the realization of the abolition of extraterritoriality is, needless to say, an expression of a lofty moral spirit.

According to the first notification on September 10th, the scope of taxation to be implemented includes most of the central taxes (except income tax) and part of the local taxes. Since August 1st, these have been paid to the National Government in the form of donations, so the burden on Japanese residents has hardly changed. It is feared that in the future, the Chinese and Japanese authorities will negotiate to avoid the sacrifice of double taxation and ensure　that Japanese residents do not feel an unexpected shock. Although Japanese residents in China can rest assured on this point, it is hoped that they will fully understand the true meaning of the moral policy towards China so that the national policy can be thoroughly implemented. The new policy towards China is not only a treaty or statement between the government and the Vatican, but also depends on the practice of the people. From this point of view, the task of overseas Chinese compatriots is of utmost importance.

With the current political power of the National Government, it is certainly impossible to expect taxation like that of Japan. Since strengthening the National Government is a fundamental national policy, it is better to transfer taxation rights as soon as possible than to　wait for a sound　tax system and taxation methods. This is the best way to strengthen the National Government. Following the second and third notifications that will be implemented soon for full taxation, unexpected misunderstandings and conflicts may arise, or the defects of the Chinese system's machinery and authority may be exposed. However, if such things　should occur, it would be difficult to implement, which would not be the manner of a great nation's people. We must always advise and urge reflection and improvement in a spirit of tolerance. Only in this way can we have a positive attitude to help correct China's shortcomings.

At the same time, we have to hope that the National Government will take this opportunity to adjust the tax system and taxation methods to make them rational. This is an indispensable prerequisite for a modern country. Overseas Chinese compatriots have no objection to the transfer of taxation rights and are fully aware of future changes in burden. What is hoped is a fair burden, and that the National Government can use this burden reasonably and appropriately. Whether the National Government authorities can fully fulfill other obligations arising from the transfer of taxation rights will have a great impact on the abolition of other extraterritorial rights. We have to look forward to the efforts of the National Government authorities in this regard. (Ki Ching: Translated from the Continental New Daily, September 21st)

### Registration of Financial Institutions - Submission Procedures

The Silver and Money Industry Association conveys the Ministry of Finance's instruction: Upon investigation, in accordance with the revised Banking Registration Regulations promulgated by the Ministry on June 8th of the 29th year, applications for registration of financial institutions can be submitted directly to the Ministry or to the local government for forwarding to the Ministry for handling. However, if the application is submitted by the local government, there are no explicit provisions on which department or bureau should forward it. This matter has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Hereafter, when financial　institutions apply for registration and submit it through the local government to the Ministry, it should be forwarded by the Provincial Government's Department of Finance　or the Special Municipal Government's Bureau of Finance to clarify the system. Except for branch offices, all associations are hereby ordered to notify their members accordingly.

### Abundant Stock of Matches

According to news from the match industry, the stock of matches in this city is quite abundant, estimated at more than 10,000 boxes, which can meet the needs of the entire city for two years. The rumors spread by speculators in recent weeks are unfounded. Generally, facts can only be proven after the implementation of the allocation system.

### Badoglio's Surrender - The Japan-Germany Axis Remains Unshaken

— Toshio Shiratori

The Italian Badoglio regime concluded an armistice with the British and Americans, betraying the Japan-Germany-Italy Tripartite Alliance　and the anti-military　pact, and surrendering unconditionally to the enemy forces.　The state of affairs since the regime’s formation to this day has been within our expectations. We are not at all surprised; the Japan-Germany axis will not　be shaken in the slightest. —Former Ambassador to Italy, who was directly in charge of diplomacy when the Tripartite Alliance was concluded, and a member of the Taisei Yokusankai with many friends in the top echelons of the Japanese and Italian governments, Mr. Toshio Shiratori, spoke on the morning of the 9th about "Italy's withdrawal from the front lines" as follows, asking us to　firm our beliefs in order to cope.

The Solid Defense of Northern Italy

Italy is now disregarding the Tripartite Pact and violating the separate peace treaty. On the German side, because of the alliance relationship, they have been fighting alongside Italy and sending troops at Italy's request, so they will never withdraw their troops from Italy on the grounds of the armistice. Moreover, they will not accept this withdrawal request. The German army believes that in any case, they must take the necessary military measures. In short, the defense of northern Italy is as solid as a city with walls of metal and a moat of boiling water, so from a practical point of view, Italy's withdrawal is not a big problem. The German side has often said this in the past six months.

From a purely military point of view, Germany would rather cut off the new stumbling block　, and Mussolini's resignation has already decided this matter.

Mussolini has stepped down, and the twenty-year Fascist regime has been ousted. How can they continue the war? The Tripartite Alliance was Mussolini's policy, the Fascist policy. After this policy was liquidated, today's withdrawal from the front lines is a natural occurrence.

German-French Relations Will Be Closer

As mentioned above, from a purely military point of view, it is not a big deal. Italy's national power, in Churchill's words, is not even one-tenth of Germany's. In order to help Italy, which lacks war materials and has insufficient national power, Germany has previously taken on a very heavy burden, lending them elite weapons and having to send a million tons of coal by truck every month, which is a very laborious assistance.

Now that they have broken away, on the German side, the effect of shortening the front lines is of great significance not only on the front lines but also in the following respects. Below, from a political point of view　, the enemy is spreading the impression throughout the world that the Axis is in danger.　I do not think so. Italy may be lost from now on, but it can be asserted　that German-French relations will therefore improve further. German-French relations are already quite harmonious today, and what hinders them is the existence of Italy. In my opinion, the harmony and closeness between Germany and France can progress more rapidly in the future. Moreover, Germany is also focusing on this. Losing Italy while Germany and France become closer, so politically speaking, Germany is not as disadvantaged as the anti-Axis countries say. The attitudes of Turkey and Spain, or the attitudes of the Balkan　small countries, may waver slightly, but　this depends on Germany's military strength and its ability to control them. In this regard, I believe there is no problem.

Looking at the various situations in Spain, Turkey, and Japan over the past three or four years, the attitude they are taking today is the only possible attitude, so there will not be major changes in the future.

Therefore, from a political point of view, there is no major impact as the enemy thinks.

Germany and Italy Have Different National Conditions

On the part of our country's people, seeing Italy's withdrawal, they think it is unfavorable to the Axis. This is because they do not know the national conditions of Germany and Italy at all. The people, national power, materials, history, and everything else of these two countries are completely different. There are many pro-British and American Italians in the country, and eliminating the Fascist Party's military power is also the enemy's strategy.

Germany, as history has shown, is a very great country. Comparing the previous wars with today's war, the conditions of the previous wars were very bad, but they still confronted for four years, fighting stubbornly, and finally collapsed internally and politically. Today, internal dissenters have been swept away, and in terms of materials, they are not troubled by food shortages. Moreover, the German people know that if they fail this time, everything will be over. So, it would be a big mistake to examine Italy and Germany in the same way.

If Germany were to be defeated, then the Soviet Union and Britain would also be exhausted and collapse together! I absolutely do not think Germany has failed. Even if it fails, I believe Britain and the United States will also fail together. Finally, when it comes to Japan, it is currently necessary for Japan to be in the leading position and fight with its own strength. If Japan and Germany fight shoulder to shoulder to the end, we will have an invincible attitude, and victory will surely be ours.

No Need for Pessimism About the European Front

There is no need to be pessimistic about Badoglio's separate peace, and the　judgment of final victory is still as reliable as ever. However, at this time, the center of the war will be in Japan. We should not forget this. This point is that Japan and Germany are really very resilient and reliable. This year and next year will be the most intense and critical times for the evolution of the situation. If we can overcome this difficulty, then we will be invincible.

### Appealing for the General Small-Scale Cotton Yarn and Cloth Businesses

— Chen Feifei

Since the government implemented the policy of comprehensively purchasing cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai, it has been four weeks. The impact has been felt across all sectors. Applying this comprehensive purchase to those who specialize in hoarding and speculation for high profits is not excessive. However, applying it to those who rely on regular cotton yarn and cloth businesses for a living is too harsh. They should be treated differently, and not regarded as the same. It should be known that there are many who hoard cotton yarn and cloth for speculation, but there are also many who run cotton yarn and cloth businesses to make a living. Imposing a comprehensive purchase on all of them is unfair and may affect the entire financial and social order. It is hoped that the wise government authorities, under the principle of implementing the purchase and without hindering the wartime economy of the Greater East Asia War, will do their best to rescue the small-scale merchants who run cotton yarn and cloth businesses. Here, I will try to describe the simplest side-by-side war support method:

The biggest targets of general speculative hoarders are cotton yarn, plain white cloth (such as Longtou fine cloth), processed popular goods (such as Sijunzi serge, Shilin blue cloth...), factory orders, and warehouse receipts, because they are large in quantity and easy to handle. As for the various types of original factory cotton cloth (i.e., improved native cloth) among the processed cotton cloth, the quality varies, and they have not been noticed by hoarders. The scope of business is also far less extensive than the above-mentioned goods. Those who engage in these businesses are all small-scale operators who usually buy and sell according to regulations, and the price fluctuations are　small, so there is no speculation or hoarding to speak of. Therefore, they should be treated differently in this comprehensive purchase.

The government authorities should also provide relief to general small-scale operators in the payment clauses, because most of the funds of the above-mentioned small businesses are short of funds, or they borrow from silver and money businesses, or they use goods as collateral for loans to make ends meet. Now, generally, after the purchase, one-quarter of the bid price is given in three months. Asking when the deadline for the general conclusion is no more than four months, how will the external loans and mortgages be repaid? All the cotton yarn and cloth have already been applied for sale to the government, not only is there no property to break; but also there is no money for living expenses, and even the silver and money businesses will be stranded due to the纱布业's failure to repay the debts. The entire finance will be shaken, the future will be unimaginable, and it will also have an adverse impact on the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the government authorities are requested to help the general cotton yarn and cloth retailers and the gold and vice industries within the principle of avoiding currency inflation; for example, the government orders all cotton yarn and cloth merchants and silver and money businesses to report the loans and mortgages owed by the yarn and cloth merchants to the silver and money businesses within three days, and send personnel to inspect them once after comparing them. If the report is not false, they shall be allowed to change the amount of debt owed to an immediate remittance order issued by the reserve bank, so that the debts can be cleared, and the　balance of the funds will still be returned according to the statutory period; in this way, the general retailers will not be able to revive, but they will die without burden; that is, the financial industry will also rely on it to maintain, and it will not hinder the government's currency policy, which is a perfect solution in one fell swoop.

As the saying goes: the people are the foundation of the country, and when the foundation is solid, the country will be stable. It is hoped that the government will follow this principle, take into account the difficulties of the general retailers, and consider their side-by-side relief measures. This is a great fortune.

### A Serious Problem

— Zhang Mengzhao

Since the government implemented the policy of purchasing yarn and cloth in Shanghai, the general hoarders who truly hoard large quantities of yarn and cloth are on the verge of despair. Of course, they are reaping what they sowed! The wheels of heaven grind slowly, but they grind fine, and their sins cannot be forgiven. However, the general legitimate yarn and cloth merchants (in other words, not the real troublemakers) who adjust the supply and demand, sell to cloth factories, dyeing and weaving factories, towel factories, sock factories, as manufacturing raw materials, and directly sell to retail consumers, are unfortunately also implicated and heading towards the same end! This can be said to be: "When a city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat are affected!" Although: under a clear and resolute, unshakeable national　, no one　can avoid it, and no one can be biased! Is there any distinction between right and wrong, jade and stone? The most pitiful are the tens of thousands of employees in the yarn and cloth industry (quasi-proletarian wage earners) who have no free capital to engage in reckless speculation and are under the high pressure of living expenses and have no surplus at home. How will they live in the future? Under the banner of "selling inventory, applying for registration, and suspending business," they are frowning and sighing! No plan (and no plan) can be found. Many bosses may even arrange "throwing stones down a well" and carry out a "bold" layoff policy, and the employees will feel the tragic fate of the skin! What cannot be denied is, what should be sympathized with, what should be properly handled, and especially what is serious is: they all have the burden of parents, wives, and children. Even when they are employed and have a job, they still feel stretched, and they are worried that their　bodies cannot be fed, and that they cannot support their wives and children! What they can rely on to make ends meet is only the year-end distribution. If they encounter serious unemployment, then "they cannot carry burdens, and their hands cannot carry baskets." And behind them (father:) helpless to produce old father) mothers, wives, and children are crying and calling for cold! It is truly unbearable to speak of and unthinkable.) How many can raise funds to do small businesses?) Recently, many small yarn and cloth factories have also heard of closing down and dismissing their employees. (Is this something that could have been expected at the beginning? In that case, the increasingly serious problem of unemployment! The iron-like facts are in front of us, and we cannot deny that under the policy of pre-planning, managing funds, and striving to increase the production of yarn, cloth, and other industries, there are still such phenomena! The writer dares to appeal to the ruling authorities with sincerity to quickly improve the situation.

The most important thing for a government is to "grasp the hearts of the people." Being able to practice "what the people love, love; what the people hate, hate," and being able to grasp "the hearts of the people," the people will　be sincerely happy and obedient! What do you want the people to be happy and sincere　? At a minimum, everyone must be "settled and happy." Everyone must have a "stable life." Then they can cooperate with the new order. New　　. May my　clear and clever police be vigilant.

### The Current Situation of the Youyou Educational Institution for Nurturing Refugee Children

— Doctor Wan

Youyou Educational Institution is a vibrant educational organization. It originated five years ago when homeless refugee children were sent from refugee shelters. The work within the institution is divided into three sections: general affairs, education, and production, which are executed separately. The general affairs section is further divided into document, accounting, supply, medical affairs, and storage departments. The production department is currently divided into rattan work and net knitting departments. Education　adopts a work-study system, and moral education starts with personal touching.

The institution has very strict plans for the personality development and livelihood skills of the children, and it has achieved good results. Children who have picked up bad habits in the lower levels of society in the streets and alleys are corrected one by one in the institution. On the other hand, in addition to teaching ordinary textbooks, more attention is paid to the children's personalities and interests, and correct guidance is given according to their respective instincts.

In order to take into account the livelihood problems of the children after they leave the institution, a vocational training course is specially added to the academic subjects, so that the employment skills of each graduate have a foundation. Enthusiastic people in society can also often promote students to enter certain advanced institutions and serve in the industrial and commercial sectors.

The institution has reading　rooms, writing rooms, chess rooms, and billiard rooms, etc. Children" automatically read books, write, or play games, all in a very orderly and disciplined manner. This is by no means something that can be achieved by a day or two of education.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to the suffering of rising prices and the great shortage of food, the institution had the idea of moving to the countryside. Later, it found a suitable location in the rural area of Xu Gongqiao Town, Kunshan, and changed the general development　address. Because it was spacious and clean, suitable for farming and　, in January of this year, three teachers led more than 100 children to move to the countryside and establish the "Xu Gongqiao Youyou Branch". Here, one cannot help but recall the famous Xin'an Travel Group's alma mater, Xin'an Primary School. These children will never be bookworms who cannot distinguish between the five grains.

The Jing Nong of Youyou Education　Institution, which includes the expenses of both the main and branch institutions, requires more than 40,000 yuan per month. In view of the rising prices, this number is also constantly increasing. We know that the educational institution relies entirely on solicited donations and is extremely difficult. We hope that people with lofty ideals will not bear to see this good educational　institution stop midway, and can pool their efforts to support it together. The country will also thank you for nurturing the children.

### Dr. Zhu - Free Physical Examinations

Lung disease specialist Dr. Zhu, whose clinic is located at 331 Avenue Albert, has the latest X-ray machine for tuberculosis screening. He can also bring the X-ray machine to patients' homes for fluoroscopy or photography at a low cost. He has donated ten X-ray fluoroscopy certificates. Poor and sick people can receive free fluoroscopy examinations through the introduction of this newspaper. If tuberculosis is found, artificial pneumothorax can also be performed for free. Dr. Zhu's service to society is commendable.

### Free Schools and Aid

Zhongxin Primary School, located at 56 Yongkang Lane, Alabaste Road, North Block, New Garbage Bridge in this city, has been cooperating with the Baojia in the area to establish a free night school since the fall of last year. It does not charge tuition fees and teaches poor students, most of whom are child laborers in factories and children of peddlers. In the past year, there have been more than 400 students in the school. Since the beginning of this semester, due to lack of funds, classes have not yet started, but the school's former students have come to the school one after another to request that it continue to be opened. The school's budget for this semester is at least 5,000 yuan. The school hopes that public-spirited people in society will donate generously so that poor students can continue their studies and not drop out halfway.

In order to save　poor students, Nansu Middle School has specially added free places, a total of three classes in junior high school and three to five places in senior high school. It is heard that the school has started classes on September 7th, with the address at the intersection of Hartung Road and Fuxu Road.

### Birth Control Guidance

The Chinese Health Association has recently set up a birth control guidance department, which is presided over by expert doctors. It uses the latest invented safe methods, without surgery, and without any pain. Moreover, it can restore fertility at any time, solving a difficult problem for those who suffer from having too many children. The association's address is at 996 Jing'an Temple Road, Magi Building, and the time is from 3 pm to 5 pm.

Job Seeker - Zhu Jielu, a poor scholar from northern Jiangsu, is 39 years old and has worked in commerce, politics, law, and newspaper circles for 15 years. He is a devout Buddhist. He is now unemployed due to his old parents and poverty. He earnestly requests help from enthusiastic people in society. The jobs he is seeking are:　document clerk in a business or firm　, scribe of Buddhist scriptures　, chanting Buddhist scriptures　, small-scale industrial and commercial business, requiring low capital and small profits. Contact address: Wuwei Yinxin, c/o Zhu Weiyin, Zhen Taifeng Main Branch, Zhuan Nong Bridge, Wuxi.

### The Street Children Adoption Problem

— Meng Liu

The adoption of street vagrant children should be organized quickly in various social charity projects. This will not only make the city cleaner and tidier, but also have great significance in health protection, agricultural production increase, unemployment relief, crime prevention, and public education. Here are some points I have seen:

Organization　Establish a joint government-civilian charity group to undertake the matter, so that we can gather the opinions of the sufferers, which can be used for appeal.

Funds　The funds should not be donated solely by the people, and should be borne entirely by the city, in order to strengthen the citizens' belief in the government. If it is insufficient due to the large scale, we can then raise funds from public-spirited people.

Location　They should all be accommodated in the countryside, so that they can help with farm work, get used to rural life, and learn agricultural skills. If we are worried that there are currently no houses in the rural areas near Shanghai that can accommodate a large number of children, we may as well temporarily build thatched huts, roughly like the way Shanghai accommodated refugees during the incident.

Provisions　All their clothing, housing, and residence should not be better than those of rural children. For example, shoes and socks are rarely used in Chinese farmhouses, so the children we take in do not need to use cinnamon socks often. Food can also be mainly made of mixed grains. In short, within the scope of not writing healthy development, the provisions for the children we take in should be saved as much as possible, so that the children can get used to a frugal rural life.

Discipline　The accommodation of children should be divided into two types, one is the management of adopted children, who can be taken back by their relatives after the expiration of the period; the other is the management of street vagrant children. The methods of discipline should also be divided into two types. For the latter, special moral education should be implemented to vigorously change their wandering habits, to love production work, and in addition to appropriate labor, education should also be carried out from labor to gradually cultivate specialized talents in agriculture and other fields.

Hygiene　Farmers often suffer from dysentery, red eyes, and other diseases. This is the evil of lacking hygiene conditions. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases is also what the children's accommodation organization in the countryside should pay attention to.
