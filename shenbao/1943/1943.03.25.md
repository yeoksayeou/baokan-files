### Strengthening the East Asia Total War System

In order to establish a foolproof economy and perfect administrative operations, Japan announced the "Special Exceptions to Wartime Administrative Authority" on the 18th of this month, specifically establishing three organizations: a "Cabinet Advisor," a "Wartime Economic Council," and an "Administrative Inspection" agency. (See today's special translation in this newspaper for details.) The so-called "Special Exceptions to Wartime Administrative Authority" are entirely for the purpose of carrying out the Greater East Asia War, expanding the production of military supplies, and increasing the power of the Prime Minister and relevant ministers over labor, materials, power, and capital. The establishment of a "Cabinet Advisor" is also to assist the Prime Minister in expanding the production of important wartime military supplies and the flexible operation of other wartime economies. The "Wartime Economic Council" is an advisory body to the Prime Minister and has the same important mission. As for the "Administrative Inspection" agency, its purpose is to promote local administrative performance, especially the expansion of productivity and the thorough implementation of important policies. All these extraordinary measures are taken in view of the prolonged nature of the previous world war and the need to quickly and effectively advance preparations for a decisive victory. Given the perfection of Japan's peacetime political organization and the meticulousness of its wartime system, it still adapts to necessity and takes temporary measures at any time. Looking back at our country, the people are accustomed to disorganization, society lacks organization, and although the government is eager to govern, the power to concentrate national strength is limited. Since participating in the war, due to Japan's change in policy towards China, our country's international status and government prestige have been greatly improved. However, at the same time, it should be known that in this new era, the mission undertaken by our country has also become doubly difficult, and it is absolutely impossible to let Japan support it unilaterally. Therefore, the strengthening of our country's wartime institutions, the increase of national productivity, the expansion of the production of important military supplies and people's daily necessities, and the thorough implementation of all wartime policies and laws all depend on the efforts of the authorities. Whether the current institutions are sufficient to accomplish these tasks, we dare not say lightly. However, the establishment of Japan's three wartime organizations can indeed serve as a reference for our country.

The establishment of a "Wartime Cabinet Advisor" is certainly not an Anglo-American parliamentary-style institution. However, let us look at the advisors internally appointed by Japan, such as Toyota, Yui, Okouchi, Fujiwara, Suzuki, Yamashita, and Kyogoku Kiyoshi, all of whom are contemporary talents and heavyweights in the financial and business sectors, which shows their intentions. Today, our country is suffering from a scarcity of talent, and yet there are many outstanding talents who are idly placed and have not received important responsibilities. It seems that we should observe the establishment of Japan's Cabinet Advisor system and further consider how to attract genuine talents from all sides to enhance the strength of the government. As for the establishment of the "Economic Council," our country seems to have a similar institution. However, the implementation of economic policies and the execution of production expansion are all related to the people. What we hope for is not the name of the institution or the regulations, but to do some concrete work. Therefore, first of all, it is necessary to effectively concentrate specialized talents. It should be known that talents are by no means entirely within the scope of the government. There is no shortage of capable people in the private sector who can contribute to the country. As for "Administrative Inspection," this system has a long history in our country and has left a deep impression on the people. It seems that the Control Yuan in the current government should take on this task, not limited to passive impeachment, but to actively supervise and guide, so that all the good policies of the government can be implemented among the people and achieve practical results, especially in increasing production and mobilizing manpower and material resources. It should take on a major mission.

Strengthening wartime institutions and actively preparing for a decisive victory is the current global task. Germany is promoting the European Total War system, and China and Japan must complete the East Asia Total War system together and strive for a new world order. The great significance of Japan's newly established three wartime organizations lies in this, and this is what we hope the government will pay attention to and strive for. In the task facilities of the total war system, what we repeatedly present is that the strength of the people should not be ignored. Any system or any measure, if it is to achieve the most perfect results and thorough realization, must obtain the support of the broad masses of the people. Especially in China, where the people are accustomed to disorganization and society has never been organized, to achieve the greatest effect of total war participation, special attention should be paid to this.

Translated Commentary

### Eden's Futile Effort

The British Foreign Secretary Eden, who visited Washington, once said, "It is planned to invite the Soviet Union and Chongqing to jointly exchange opinions and information."

The result of the talks between U.S. Vice President Wallace and Secretary of State Hull was merely that "an understanding has been reached between Britain and the United States on wartime and post-war issues." Naturally, we do not know the detailed content. However, regarding the purpose of adjusting relations between anti-Axis countries, it is not difficult to imagine this from the recent trends in the anti-Axis camp.

Although Britain and the United States recognize that forming a common front is an unavoidable necessity in order to accomplish their current war aims, the fact that they have fundamentally conflicting interests means that their cooperation often tends to split apart, which is already well known. Since the outbreak of the European war, the predatory hand of American imperialism, under the guise of aiding Britain, has stretched from the West Indies across the Caribbean to the North African continent. British imperial interests are being encroached upon and threatened by the United States everywhere. This development has naturally irritated Britain and made it feel uneasy. The "wartime and post-war issues between Britain and the United States" discussed during Eden's visit to Washington were in fact incidents arising from this antagonism between British and American imperialism. Since the beginning of the war, British and American authorities, especially British authorities, have often been annoyed and frustrated by this.

The state of the anti-Axis camp is further aggravated by the constant vacillation of relations between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union. The recent gaffe by U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt has deepened the rift between the United States and the Soviet Union, causing a great uproar. Since the conclusion of the military alliance, have Britain and the United States faithfully fulfilled their promises of aid to the Soviet Union? Steinhardt pointed out that "Soviet newspapers do not mention a single word about American aid to the Soviet Union, concealing the truth and giving the impression at home and abroad that the Soviet Union is resisting the war on its own," criticizing the attitude of the Soviet Union. On the European continent, the Soviet Union is solely bearing the heavy burden of the war against Germany, and no one will deny this fact! The United States repeatedly publishes the amount of materials it has aided to the Soviet Union, boasting of its aid to the Soviet Union. However, the materials it has aided that have contributed to the Soviet Union's war against Germany are extremely meager. Not only that, but British and American aid to the Soviet Union is limited to the supply of materials, driving the Soviet Union to engage in arduous battles, causing the Soviet Union to pay an immeasurable price in bloodshed. Whenever the Soviet Union thinks of this attempt by Britain and the United States, it cannot help but be strictly wary of the attitude of Britain and the United States!

The United States was one of the last major powers in the world to recognize the Soviet Union, and this is enough to reveal that there is a deeply ingrained anti-Soviet tendency within the United States. The Alaska Highway, built by the United States under the guise of the Greater East Asia War, is also a sign of American hostility towards the Soviet Union. As for Britain, it has consistently used means of intervention and intimidation against the Soviet Union since 1918. The MacDonald government once brought Anglo-Soviet relations back on track, but it was overthrown in the autumn of 1924 by the Baldwin government, and the Baldwin government was the most anti-Soviet cabinet within the British Conservative Party. One of the spearheads of the anti-Soviet policy at the time was Winston Churchill, who is now the Prime Minister of the British government. Even based on this fact, it is self-evident what the nature of the current British government is.

Recently, the independence of Poland has become an issue of conflict between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. The opposing attitude taken by Poland towards the recovery of Soviet territory has become a fundamental question for Britain and the United States as to what qualifications Poland has to exist in the world. We can say that Poland is the vanguard of the anti-Soviet policy built by Britain. Does the so-called Atlantic Charter really not have such anti-Soviet policy intentions lurking behind it? From the standpoint of the Soviet Union, of course, this fact is worth careful vigilance.

Eden's so-called consultation with Chongqing is merely empty talk of British and American aid, and no practical effect can be expected from it. It is only to appease the complaining Chongqing regime. Even this will inevitably end in futility. Why do we say this? Because Britain and the United States, which are currently gasping for breath in defeat, clearly do not have the leisure or energy to aid Chongqing. The growth of the National Government, causing the resentment of the increasingly declining Chongqing regime to erupt into a backlash against British and American deceptive policies, can perhaps be said to be a gift from Eden. Eden's visit to Washington and consultations with anti-Axis countries, hoping "to reach a complete understanding, will ultimately be just a fantasy!

### Military Scrip to Cease Issuance of New Notes - Effective April 1st - Simultaneously Implemented in Central and Southern China - Circulating Military Scrip Temporarily Not to Be Recalled

(Nanjing, 24th Central News Agency Telegram) Since the National Government participated in the war, our friendly nation Japan, in order to cooperate with the National Government in strengthening the wartime system, has provided various forms of assistance in the hope of enhancing our country's national strength, improving politics, and becoming a powerful member of East Asia, so as to jointly complete the great mission of building East Asia. The Japanese authorities, in order to assist the promotion of our country's wartime economic policies, have decided to abolish the new issuance of military scrip from April 1st, and the expenditure of such scrip in the National Treasury of China, as well as its payment for bank deposits, loans, and remittances, will no longer use military scrip. As for the linkage between Central Reserve Bank notes and the Japanese yen, the ratio of 100 yuan to 18 yen will still be maintained. This decision will be of great benefit to the promotion of our country's wartime economic policies. According to reports, since the incident, the currency in circulation in various parts of Central China has been extremely complex. In order to thoroughly unify it, the Reorganized National Government granted the Central Reserve Bank the privilege of issuance. Over the past three years, other currency systems have been gradually eliminated. Now, the Japanese authorities have taken this measure, which will further establish the unified function of the Central Reserve Bank notes. It can be seen that the stability of finance and the suppression of prices will be perfected as a result. This will be a milestone for the development of the national economy and the establishment of the wartime economy.

Minister of Finance Zhou Announces Statement - Nanjing, 24th Central News Agency Telegram - After our friendly nation Japan decided to cease the issuance of new military scrip notes, Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai specifically issued the following statement: "Since the incident, the currency in circulation in various parts of Central China has included old legal tender, Hua Xing notes, and military scrip issued by our friendly nation. The types were inconsistent and the values were different, which greatly affected finance. Since the National Government returned to the capital, it first prepared to establish the Central Reserve Bank and grant it the privilege of issuance in order to unify the currency system and lay the foundation for finance. Over the past three years, it first abolished the issuance of Hua Xing notes, then abolished the equal circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes and old legal tender, and then abolished the legal tender status of old legal tender, making Central Reserve Bank notes the only currency. Our government has worked hard, and the authorities of our friendly nation have also provided as much assistance as possible. When reorganizing the old currency in May of the 31st year of the Republic of China, both China and Japan consulted and decided on the exchange rate between military scrip and Central Reserve Bank notes, with 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes exchanging for 18 yuan of military scrip. From September 15th of the same year, the Hongkou District of Shanghai also adopted a system of parallel circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes and military scrip. By October 1st, all Japanese merchants in Nanjing City had also successively implemented the system of parallel use of Central Reserve Bank notes and military scrip, with remarkable results and universal convenience. From then on, we further sought cooperation. Therefore, from December 1st of last year, our friendly nation also changed to using 30% or more of Central Reserve Bank notes, or paying the full amount, for the salaries and shopping expenses of its people in China. Recently, our government announced its participation in the war. In order to strengthen our wartime economic policies, our friendly nation has again sought thorough and comprehensive cooperation on the issue of our country's national products. Therefore, it has been decided to resolutely abolish the new issuance of military scrip from April 1st of this year, and the expenditure of such scrip in the National Treasury of China, as well as its payment for bank deposits, loans, and remittances, will no longer use military scrip, but will be gradually recovered. In the future, the linkage between Central Reserve Bank notes and the Japanese yen, and the exchange rate will still maintain the ratio of 100 to 18 yuan. Our government should take the same step, divide the actual implementation, and except that after April 1st, all national expenditures, where military scrip is used, should be changed to Central Reserve Bank notes. The various banking and money industry associations should not use military scrip for payments for deposits, loans, and remittances. This matter is related to the implementation of the unified currency policy. All our merchants and people, and all government entities, should understand this purpose, assist the government in earnestly complying with it, so as to secure finance and stabilize people's livelihoods, and to repay the friendly nation's generous assistance.

Japanese Ministry of Finance Issues Statement - Tokyo, 24th Central News Agency Telegram - The Director of the Ministry of Finance issued a statement at 4 p.m. today regarding the cessation of the new issuance of military scrip in Central and Southern China after April of this year, stating in essence that since the National Government of the Republic of China established the Central Reserve Bank on the 1st day of the 12th year of Showa (1937), it has strived to strengthen the bank and expand the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes. The Japanese side has also continuously provided comprehensive cooperation, so the foundation of the bank has become increasingly consolidated and substantial. Now, it has been decided to provide further cooperation for the development of the bank, and to abolish the new issuance of military scrip in Central and Southern China. In principle, the expenditure of national treasury funds and bank payments, deposits, loans, and remittances will not use military scrip, but will use Central Reserve Bank notes as the standard. Although the new issuance of military scrip has been abolished, measures such as recalling military scrip or converting the price of military scrip debts and credits into the price of Central Reserve Bank notes will not be taken, and the circulation of military scrip and the existence of military scrip price debts and credits will continue to be recognized, in order to smoothly transition to the state of using Central Reserve Bank notes. In addition, regarding the supply of various required funds, there will be no obstacles due to the cooperation of the Chinese side, and there will definitely be no inconvenience due to the abolition of the new issuance of military scrip. In addition, the conversion rate between Central Reserve Bank notes and the Japanese yen has been determined to be a ratio of 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes to 18 yen of Japanese currency. As for the past method of using a special conversion rate for remittances imported from Central and Southern China to adjust price differences due to different commodities, this will also be abolished, and the operation of a special accounting for adjusting exchange transactions will be used to facilitate smooth imports.

Statement by Japanese Authorities in China - Nanjing, 24th Central News Agency Telegram - Regarding the cessation of the issuance of new military scrip notes, the Japanese Army Headquarters, the Japanese Fleet Headquarters, and the Japanese Embassy in China jointly issued the following statement: From April 1st, the issuance of new military scrip notes will be ceased, and the expenditure of Japanese national treasury funds, as well as the payment of deposits, loans, and remittances by various banks, will in principle all use Central Reserve Bank notes, and the use of military scrip will be stopped. In the past, both Chinese and Japanese citizens deeply trusted and happily used military scrip. Since the end of May last year, the ratio of military scrip to Reserve Bank notes was set at 100 yuan of Reserve Bank notes exchanging for 18 yuan of military scrip. Since that time, military scrip and Reserve Bank notes have been integrated, and their value has been stable at the above-mentioned ratio. The circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes has made extremely smooth progress until today. In the meantime, we have always provided full cooperation to help it succeed. Now, it has been decided to stop the issuance of new notes, and the work of unifying the currency of all of China with Central Reserve Bank notes has been completed. Both we and the National Government are deeply pleased with this fact. It is expected that the political power of the National Government will therefore increase its penetration, and the economic revival of China will be easier to promote. However, although the issuance of new military scrip notes has been stopped, the circulation of existing military scrip on the market and the debt administrations and debts denominated in military scrip will still be allowed to continue to exist. For the time being, measures will not be taken to immediately recall military scrip on the market or to order the conversion of military scrip units of debts and credits. It is hoped that the military scrip economy will smoothly change to a Central Reserve Bank note economy. After the cessation of the issuance of new military scrip notes, the exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank notes and the Japanese yen will be set at 100 yuan of Reserve Bank notes exchanging for 18 yen of Japanese currency. The authorities of both China and Japan have taken thorough measures to maintain the ratio, so the value of Central Reserve Bank notes will become more stable in the future. The exchange of funds between China and Japan, and the liquidation of remittances, will develop more favorably. We firmly believe that this move will make a great contribution to the economic development of both China and Japan.

Opinions from Tokyo Economic Circles - Tokyo, 24th Central News Agency Telegram - According to sources in economic circles here, the Japanese side's decision to abolish the new issuance of military scrip notes in Central and Southern China is the same in nature as the agreement to return detailed items of the exclusive concession to the National Government, respecting the completeness of the sovereignty of the new China politically, and providing economic cooperation and assistance in order to realize the new relationship between China and Japan. This measure, together with the transfer of enemy assets in China to the National Government for management by General Oda on February 8th of this year, will have a truly great impact on the National Government's economic administration, especially on the stability of the people's livelihood and the expansion of productivity in China. After the establishment of the Central Reserve Bank of China, the Japanese government provided a loan of 100 million yuan from the Bank of Japan in July of Showa 17 (1942) to stabilize the currency and finance and develop the economy of the new China. On March 10th of this year, a loan of 200 million yuan was similarly provided to the United Reserve Bank of North China, so the Japanese side's policy of economic cooperation with China has become more concrete due to the above two loans. Also, regarding the exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes and Japanese yen, on the United Reserve Bank side, the relationship of maintaining the same price of one yen of Japanese currency has been maintained. On the Central Reserve Bank side, Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry stated in this parliament that the current ratio of 18 yen of Japanese currency to 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes will be maintained. Therefore, the foundation of United Reserve Bank notes and Central Reserve Bank notes is extremely stable and is gradually strengthening. After China's participation in the war, the heavy responsibility borne by the Chinese economy under the Greater East Asia War has become more and more important. In order to adapt to the new situation, Japan has changed and strengthened the National Economic Commission and established the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association, and is steadily implementing various measures to improve the material procurement and energy supply mechanisms, in order to rapidly increase the productivity of the new China. The results are truly worth looking forward to. The decision to abolish the issuance of new military scrip notes this time is sufficient to prove that the unification of currency in Central and Southern China with Central Reserve Bank notes has been fully achieved. At the same time, it has opened a new era in the development of China's currency system, and the new Chinese economy will therefore develop further.

### Japanese Government Establishes Three New Wartime Agencies - Cabinet Advisor, Economic Council, Administrative Inspection

In order to adapt to the current profound war situation and promote the enhancement of war power, the Japanese government submitted the Special Exceptions to Wartime Administrative Authority bill and the Temporary Measures Law concerning Permissions and Approvals to this parliament, and simultaneously requested the formulation of Special Exceptions to Wartime Administrative Authority to be promulgated by imperial edict. The two legal bills have been deliberated by the parliament, and the edict proposal has also been consulted by the Privy Council. All procedures for promulgation have been completed, and they were promulgated in the official gazette on the 18th and implemented from that day. When the Japanese government uses epoch-making measures of emergency ordinances to enhance war power, in view of the discussions in the parliament, it has recently conducted detailed research, and there has been this new decision to abolish the former cabinet councilor system and establish a cabinet advisor system, with prominent figures from the private industrial and economic sectors as advisors, to become the Prime Minister's advisory and auxiliary body. At the same time, a Wartime Economic Council will be newly established, with the Prime Minister as chairman, assisted by economic ministers in the cabinet, to become the Prime Minister's advisory body when implementing the above-mentioned ordinances concerning the operation of the wartime economy. In addition to the above two agencies, in order to review the implementation of important national policies and investigate the performance of administration, the government has created a new institution for administrative inspection, selecting personnel from relevant cabinet ministers and cabinet advisors, attaching necessary staff, and dispatching them to various places as roving envoys at any time, in order to ensure perfection. The above-mentioned necessary imperial edicts, namely the Cabinet Advisor Establishment System, the Administrative Inspection Regulations, and the Wartime Economic Council Regulations, have been resolved by the regular cabinet meeting on the 9th. The temporary establishment system for cabinet advisors, which needs to be consulted by the Privy Council, was also passed at the Privy Council meeting on the 17th. All necessary procedures for each case have been completed, and the government simultaneously promulgated and implemented each regulation and the above-mentioned administrative special relationship ordinances in the official gazette on the 18th.

The Japanese Empire has a firm grasp on the ability to win and not be defeated in the important southern regions during the war period. It is now exerting all its strength to advance towards the destruction of Britain and the United States. At this time, the National Government resolutely announced its declaration of war against Britain and the United States on January 9. The will of the people of China and Japan is to move forward towards one goal, to eradicate the forces of Britain and the United States from the earth. We should work closely together, with the spirit of living and dying together, overcome all difficulties, and strive to achieve our goals. At the same time, the Chongqing regime, which uses resistance against Japan as a slogan and makes China, and even the entire East Asia, a British and American colony, must be completely destroyed. China is now advancing towards this great goal under the leadership of Chairman Wang, and the gradual attainment of war results is truly gratifying. In particular, Guangdong Province is Chairman Wang's hometown and the birthplace of the Chinese revolution. At the same time, because it is building a strong rear base for China, it is showing significant progress in politics, military affairs, and other aspects, which is sufficient to be a model for China's development and is truly gratifying. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere wishes and express my deep respect for the efforts of Governor Chen and everyone in the provincial government. As for the Japanese army stationed in the local area, they must maintain close contact with the provincial government authorities and make their best efforts to move towards the common goal."

### Jin Waterproofing Project Commences Implementation

Taiyuan, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Shanxi Waterproofing Ten-Year Plan, after years of planning by the relevant authorities, will be commenced this year, with a total estimated cost of 150 million yuan. The main projects are the construction of dikes, the promotion of afforestation, and the establishment of meteorological observatories. Among them, the construction of dikes started on the 10th of this month and is scheduled to be completed by the end of June. The following is a summary of the dike construction plan for this year: (1) Between Qu County and Lan County, 8 kilometers, with a total cost of 1.2 million yuan. After the completion of the project, it can irrigate 750 hectares of dry land and 1,650 hectares of paddy fields. (2) Jinci Town is 16 kilometers long, with a cost of 4 million yuan.

### Yellow River Diversion Project to Be Completed on Schedule

Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency) - There are approximately 20,000 hectares of paddy fields near Tianjin, and their irrigation water has always been taken from the Yellow River and the Grand Canal. However, since the emergence of the New Yellow River, the water volume of these two rivers has gradually decreased, especially the Grand Canal, which has made irrigation water increasingly difficult in various places. The North China Reconstruction General Office, in view of this, previously planned emergency measures to block the Baiyangdian Lake to store water, and then let it flow into the Daqing River during the irrigation season. At the same time, it also planned an emergency water control project to divert the Yellow River water into the Grand Canal. The project to block Baiyangdian Lake was completed as early as the end of February this year. However, the Yellow River water control project, in view of the need to increase the water volume of the Yellow River diverted to the various canals in North China, decided to change the original plan and temporarily introduce the water into the Yongding River silt area between Tianjin and Yangcun as an emergency measure for this year. The Yellow River diversion project will connect the Grand Canal near Xinxiang with the Yellow River north of Zhengzhou, so it is necessary to excavate a water diversion route of up to 500 kilometers. The amount of water introduced will also be increased from the initially planned 20 cubic meters per second to 40 cubic meters per second. The number of workers mobilized will also be increased from 1.8 million to 6 million. The original plan was to complete it in May this year, but it has now been postponed to May next year and completely changed to a large-scale water diversion project. Once the project is completed, the suffering caused by the emergence of the New Yellow River in the vicinity of Tianjin will be relieved, and the boat transportation of the various canals will also be greatly facilitated.

### Behind the Mareth Line, the British Lateral Offensive Fails; German Troops Drive the Enemy Back to Their Original Positions

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency) - The Allied forces in the offensive in southern Tunisia still did not achieve significant achievements yesterday. The counterattack of the German mechanized units has driven the enemy back to their original positions. The offensive launched by the British Eighth Army completely failed. At the same time, the British mobile units launched a lateral offensive from Gafsa in an attempt to encircle the rear of the Mareth Line, which also failed. The German Air Force attacked the retreating British troops, further increasing their panic. According to the central Tunisian front, the threat of the American Fifth Army from Gafsa along the railway towards the coast has been blocked at the Makenasser salient. Another unit of the American army advanced eastward and approached the north of Grand Ksar, but was also blocked by the mobile units of the Axis forces. The Axis air force assisted in the defensive operations of the ground forces and contributed to the victory. German aircraft destroyed 23 American tanks east of Makenasser, and an American supply team, including more than 100 vehicles, was bombed west of the city and almost completely destroyed.

Lisbon, 24th (Allied News Agency) - According to the German side's review of the recent Anglo-American offensive in North Africa, as of Monday night, the Allied attempt to break through the main Axis position along the Mareth Line or the flanking plan in southeastern Tunisia had been thwarted. The American Fifth Army's offensive from Gafsa with the aim of eastern Tunisia has been blocked in the mountain pass east of Makenasser. As a result, the Allied attempt to mobilize a large amount of manpower and material resources to break through the Mareth Line has become a pie in the sky. Due to the Allied forces' superiority in manpower and material resources in the area, continued offensives are inevitable. At present, the positions in southeastern Tunisia are still in the hands of the Axis forces. According to British sources, the Axis resistance is quite strong due to the crisscrossing trenches and the abundance of landmines. General Rommel not only resisted, but also launched a counterattack on Monday afternoon. According to a Reuters reporter's report last night, the battle is still raging. According to information obtained from Rome, the British Eighth Army continues to fight between the coast and the Matmata Mountains, while the British First Army is attacking in central and southern Tunisia in response to the various sides, and the Allied actions are coordinated.

### Between the Donets and Dnieper Rivers, the Germans Deploy River Crossing Preparations

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency) - On the Eastern Front, except for the German army continuing its offensive west of Kursk, the situation elsewhere is quiet. Forty days have passed since the German army began its counteroffensive on February 12 in the Donets River basin and the Dnieper River bend. The tank units and mechanized units must rest for a while and wait for the infantry to take over in order to continue the offensive. The Soviet offensive in the central and northern parts of the Eastern Front is intended to contain the German forces and prevent them from concentrating their offensive elsewhere. General Timoshenko's offensive is also a containment strategy.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 24th (Havas News Agency) - After six weeks of the German counteroffensive in the southern part of the Eastern Front, occupying Kharkov and reaching the west bank of the upper reaches of the Donets River, they are still deploying, preparing to cross the river and attack. At present, the focus of the battle is on the Kursk area. The battle in the Orel area is still quiet. The Red Army's full-scale attempt to break through the German defenses has failed, and it is now waiting for an opportunity. At present, there are only local conflicts. The German offensive southwest and northwest of Kursk is becoming increasingly strong, but the Red Army's resistance is also not weak. The German attack is aimed at Kursk, which is the Red Army's last stronghold on the Orel-Kharkov railway. As for the Red Army in the central part of the Eastern Front, the offensive towards Smolensk has made little progress. According to news from British sources, the German army launched an offensive northeast of Bryansk on the 19th of this month to encircle the Red Army in an attempt to contain the Red Army's offensive towards Smolensk. After four days of fierce fighting, it has now failed.

### Prospects for the North African War: Tunisia Approaching the Decisive Stage

(Special Correspondent from Rome Eina, dispatched on the 14th) - The fourth spring of the World War has arrived, and the battle for Tunisia is approaching the decisive stage. According to recent war reports, the American forces, which once swept across the central front, were forced back into Algerian territory by the Axis forces, achieving the goal of defeating the American forces. In order to prepare for future battles, the Axis forces are reorganizing the front, ensuring the connection between the north and south Axis forces, and still controlling all of Tunisia and important coastal areas. On the northern front, the Axis forces have fortified the areas of Mateur, Bizerte, Medjez el Bab, and the El Bours hills, forming a copper wall and iron barrier defense line in front of Tunis and Bizerte. The British First Army is also waiting in readiness, and to counter the latest German large tank "Tiger," the British also have super-heavy iron cows "Churchill." But the results are not satisfactory, and recently they have repeatedly suffered defeats. According to London broadcasts, the German and Italian forces in this area have already completed their deployment. In the south, the aerial reconnaissance battle has temporarily ended, and the British Eighth Army seems to be progressing with the Mareth Line fortress as its target. In mid-March in the spring, the battle situation on the entire Tunisian front, central, southern, and northern, is gradually maturing. Regarding the prediction of future battles, various parties are making propaganda favorable to their own side. The North African war can be regarded as a part of the European war and a link in the World War.

After the Soviet Union's winter offensive stalled, the German army immediately began a fierce counteroffensive. Since January, the European war has faced a new stage. At least, regarding the Mediterranean situation, the Casablanca operation plan decided by Britain and the United States in January this year has failed. The Anglo-American attack on Tunisia was originally intended to contain powerful units of the German Air Force stationed in North Africa to protect Soviet operations, but this plan ultimately failed.

The Dream of a Second Front

Last year, Britain and the United States planned to lure out ten divisions of the German Air Force from the Soviet front, but this, like the Anglo-American landing operation in North Africa, was a major miscalculation in operations. The Soviet Union's vociferous calls for the opening of a second front have also been heard in the Anglo-American camp. The British Air Force has been bombing German submarine bases on the French coast for days, and it is rumored to be a prelude to the landing operation in Europe, but the so-called second front, throughout last year, remained only an air offensive. Although Britain and the United States decided to land in Europe, in view of the experience of invading the French port of Dieppe last year, they obtained the absolute superiority of the air cover force in the landing operation as a necessary condition for technical lessons. Therefore, the most important thing for Britain and the United States is first the selection of the landing time, and the best opportunity should be when the Axis air force is holding a fierce battle on other fronts. The Soviet Union's launch of the spring offensive until today is an excellent opportunity. After this period, in the summer, the Soviet battlefield will enter the avalanche period. In the spring months of April and May, because the ground is muddy, ground combat will come to a halt. During this period, the German Air Force will be free to soar in the European sky, threatening Britain and the United States. Therefore, even if Britain and the United States really want to realize the European second front, it is impossible before June. Based on the same reason, in these two or three months, the current situation of the Axis forces defending Tunisia is also in an absolutely safe position.

The British Eighth Army Shows Signs of Fatigue

According to the results obtained by the German and Italian air forces in reconnaissance over the Mareth Line on the 6th of this month, the Eighth Army under the command of Montgomery, which is currently gathering in this area, is composed of two divisions of British infantry and the New Zealand Army. There are only two armored divisions, one infantry division, and other units transferred from Libya have not yet fully arrived.

Of the troops planned to be used in the entire operation plan, one is two divisions of the American army and a part of the British army that had fought in central and southern Tunisia, and the other, and more important, is the Montgomery army, which chased from Egypt to Tunisia, tens of thousands of miles, last winter. Supplies are difficult, and both men and horses are exhausted.

However, Tunisia has long been regarded by the Axis side as a part of the new Europe, and the last base point for defending the Mediterranean. Moreover, it is the only point of contact between Britain and the United States and the Axis forces that face each other with military force. The opportunity for a decisive battle may occur at any time. And Britain and the United States, especially the United States, not only regard Tunisia as having military importance, but also as an important location for the United States to promote its work in North Africa from a political and economic ambition.

Due to the strengthening of Italy's total war posture, persisting in the Tunisian front, politically and militarily, and promoting its firm African policy is also highly noteworthy. At the end of January this year, under the commander-in-chief of the three services, General Ambrosio, the fascist land, sea, and air forces have been prepared for a positive decisive battle. This can be regarded as an important countermeasure taken by Prime Minister Mussolini in his determination to advance the war. If we make a concrete analysis of the recent war attitude, then:

(1) Defensive measures are taken to deal with the danger of the Anglo-American landing on the Italian mainland, including defending the entire coastline and defending against air raids.

(2) The implementation of the Mediterranean policy, that is, strengthening and expanding the offensive and defensive front in North Africa.

The psychology of all 50 million people in Italy is now like being attracted by gravity, and focusing on Africa.

Tripoli has been ravaged by the enemy, and the center of gravity of the North African war has shifted to Tunisia. In the beginning, Prime Minister Mussolini claimed to the fascist volunteers that Italy would surely make a comeback in Africa, and North Africa would not be easily abandoned. Since the Great War, Abyssinia has been lost, and Tripoli since the Italo-Turkish War of 1911 has also been seized. This Italian tragedy will never cause Italy to abandon its Mediterranean policy, nor will it change its Mediterranean policy. The far-reaching goal of Italy's Mediterranean policy, from Eritrea to Somaliland, and then to Abyssinia, is that "the key to the Mediterranean is the Merch of the Red Sea," and now the starting point of the Mediterranean policy is "the key to the Mediterranean is Tunisia."

### World-Attracting Roman Political Activities

(Special Dispatch from Rome, 13th, by Special Correspondent Ono) The visit of Archbishop Spellman of New York to the Vatican from February 20th to March 3rd, and the visit of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Prime Minister Mussolini from February 24th to 28th. Since the unfolding of these two political activities, Rome's movements have drawn worldwide attention. These two visits, coincidentally aligned in time but completely different in nature and motive, if connected without reason and viewed with suspicion to draw conclusions, then the upheaval in Rome at the end of February may be a significant moment of drastic change in the current war situation. However, after a calm examination of this realistic issue, Spellman's and the German Foreign Minister's visits have opposing natures, with no connection between them.

During Spellman's eleven-day stay, he met with the Pope a total of seven times, totaling over eighteen hours. What exactly did they discuss? According to well-informed sources in the Vatican, the discussions were limited to:

(1) Addressing the threat posed by the Soviet offensive to Christian civilization and Catholic humanitarianism throughout Europe, and studying countermeasures to be taken by the Vatican and Christian nations.

(2) The inhumane bombing of Italian cities by the U.S. Air Force.

(3) Improving the treatment of remaining German and Italian expatriates in various countries of the Americas.

As for political discussions, similar to the previous visit by Myron Taylor, they did not go beyond the scope of abstract idealism, thus preventing any concrete conclusions. However, the sensitivity of today's world refuses to gloss over this, and various unreasonable doubts still linger. The rumors circulated during his stay, regardless of their veracity, are quite intriguing when listed one by one. Spellman's position in these rumors is not that of a figure yearned for by devout men and women, but rather an international conspirator with a Rasputin-like expression.

German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Italy from February 23rd to 28th aimed to adapt to the current new situation, strengthen and enrich the political, military, and economic institutions of the entire European Axis camp, and to engage in concrete consultations regarding the new European order after the completion of the war. The direction of the talks:

(1) To seek complete understanding between Germany and Italy regarding the mobilization capabilities of all European countries in preparation for the anti-Communist front, the Mediterranean front, and a hypothetical third front.

(2) To rationalize the transfer of Germany's abundant human resources, especially labor, and the cooperation of essential resources between the Axis powers and their allies.

(3) To allocate the benefits that each nation should enjoy in the post-war European new order, proportional to the sacrifices and cooperation they paid in this war. Under this principle, to establish a system of selfless dedication to the public good for all European countries.

(4) To defend against the threat of communism spreading from the Eastern Front and encroaching upon all of Europe, the Axis powers' war claims to uphold the Vatican's traditional humanitarianism and Christian civilization, to unite anti-communism and anti-Semitism, and to seek the Vatican's understanding and cooperation in spirit and thought. To study joint measures to counter the theoretical weaknesses of the Anglo-American alliance with the Soviet Union. From this perspective, Ciano's appointment as Vatican ambassador has significant and positive implications.

(5) To strengthen friendly relations with Turkey and Spain as part of the exploratory diplomacy launched to counter the Anglo-Americans after the Casablanca Conference. This can be discerned from the appointment of Borgese in the new Italian diplomatic personnel.

(6) To discuss military measures to deal with the European third front launched by the Anglo-Americans.

Thus, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit shattered Spellman's clandestine activities. The European countries, regardless of good or bad, regardless of whether they feel tired, will unite as firmly as an iron barrel in the war against the Soviet Union and the Anglo-Americans. The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere centered on Japan is based on the Imperial Way. In contrast, the new European order, even if it cannot be called hegemony, is ultimately built with power. However, in such a complex and intricate area as the Balkans, where numerous ethnic minorities each cling to their own history, bloodlines, and rights, and repeatedly replay the story of war, there is no other method than to use this as an emergency measure. In any case, there is no time to play with idealistic arguments. Using the power of complete unity to defend the European mainland, the stubbornness of the Tunisian front overturned the enemy's optimistic expectations. The opening of a third front is out of the question, and the trend of the Mediterranean situation is still unknown. Directly attacking Sicily and Sardinia in the Italian peninsula is no easy matter, as difficult as landing on the British mainland across the Strait of Dover, and is therefore constantly hesitant and delayed in time. The attacking forces have their limits, and they are well aware of the damage they have suffered. The Soviet Union continues to add a significant number of troops to the Eastern Front, which stretches for two thousand kilometers, so the main front will of course still be the Eastern Front. On the Italian front, the Anglo-American attacks will be concentrated here. The opening of a second Italian front, not to mention the bombing of various cities, may also involve surprise attacks from the sea. However, the morale of the Italian people is very high. No matter what hardships they endure, the tenacity of the Italian people will certainly not be inferior to that of the Eastern Front. As for the final victory or defeat, it will depend on Germany using submarine tactics to destroy the enemy's maritime transportation capacity, causing famine in Britain and a shortage of supplies for the forces dispatched to North Africa and West Africa. At that time, the situation of the war will change rapidly, and it is worth watching. The German-Italian counterattack is now focused on this. Before this final moment arrives, Europe will be sealed in a strong defense, conserving strength and awaiting the arrival of this moment for a major offensive. All diplomatic strategies can be regarded as a unification of defensive policies and preparation for a counterattack. Therefore, the movements in Rome are consistently carried out in an extremely cautious atmosphere. (翔: Translated from the March 15th Western Daily News)

### Measures to be Taken During Air Raid Alerts - Promulgated by the Head of Chengdu Road Police Station

Nakahara Kenyu, the head of the Chengdu Road Police Station in the Public Concession, recently promulgated various measures for citizens to take during air raids. The methods are as follows:

Lighting Control (1) Entrances and exits should be equipped with thickened blackout curtains. (2) Skylights and all other places should be quickly blacked out according to the rules of lighting control. (3) Lights in front of shops and entrances and exits should be extinguished. Various doors and windows should also have curtains to block light from escaping.

Alert Transmission (1) During air raids, each bao should set up a medical and defense team office. (2) Five alert personnel and three traffic team members should be stationed at the police station to facilitate communication during alert times. (3) Each bao should send two self-defense team members to the police station to relay various orders (rotating every three hours). (4) Alert signs should be prepared at the offices of bao and jia heads and in front of shops. After each alert is issued, it should be written and hung at the entrance to inform passersby and residents to pay attention.

Traffic and Rescue (1) Traffic team members should actively assist in directing traffic during alert times. (2) Pedestrians should walk on the left side. (3) All vehicles must park on the side of the road. Passengers should also get off the vehicle and walk on the left side. (4) Rescue team and stretcher bearers should prepare at the rescue station and the offices of each bao chief.

Fire Prevention and Evacuation (1) Each jia fire prevention team should report to the team leader's office for instructions after receiving an alert. (2) Fire prevention personnel should regularly inspect the interiors and exteriors. Fire prevention equipment prepared in the jia should be regularly inspected and replaced. (3) After an incendiary bomb is discovered, the fire prevention team leader should guide and organize order. Team members should immediately find ways to extinguish the fire (one person per household). (4) Each bao should designate schools, factories, workshops, and other buildings as shelters. The words "Shelter" should be written in front of the shelter. In the event of an accident, residents can enter the shelter. The above methods are intended as a precautionary measure. Bao and jia personnel should be prepared to handle them at any time.

### Increased Rice Rationing in the City - Methods for Receiving Rice from Public Rice Shops Have Been Changed Gradually

The Municipal Food Bureau found that each designated public rice shop in the city had a large amount of rice unpaid in the past, causing the Food Bureau to bear the burden of informal advances. If no measures were taken to improve this, it would inevitably hinder the progress of the entire food policy and the turnover of funds. Therefore, the bureau repeatedly convened representatives from the joint offices of public rice shops in various districts to discuss the matter. In addition to listening to the difficulties stated by the public rice merchants, it was decided that starting this month, the accumulated habit of issuing rice before payment would be abolished, and the method of paying before issuing rice would be adopted to alleviate the bureau's financial stagnation. It was also stipulated that payments and rice issuance would be made three times a month. If there was any delay under any pretext, the allocation would be stopped, and the qualification for public rice distribution would be revoked. Since its implementation, public rice merchants in various districts of the city have been able to strictly comply with the bureau's regulations, so that the bureau's funds have been freed from advances this month, and the operation has become active.

Increase Supply, Eliminate Black Market

Since the implementation of grain distribution based on population in the city, the amount of rations in each district has often been temporarily reduced in the past due to the source of rice. In the future, the quantity of grain issued by each public rice shop will be fixed as much as possible to avoid repeating the fluctuations in quantity. In the past, the monthly rice ration was estimated to be about 40,000 bags. Although it has now increased to more than 70,000 bags, the Food Bureau is doing its best to promote an increase so that the people's food supply in the city can be enriched. With a smooth food supply for the people, the black market rice can be eliminated. The correct weight of each bag is set at one shi and two dou and five sheng. The Food Bureau and relevant parties are earnestly discussing matters of underweighting.

Rice Sacks Must be Returned Within a Time Limit

Regarding the sack for holding rice, the public rice shops in the past failed to return them on time and did not pay the deposit in advance. Instead, the Food Bureau paid on their behalf, which was a huge amount each month and directly and indirectly hindered the progress of food administration. Therefore, the method for recovering the sacks in the future will be that the Nanshi Joint Office of Public Rice Shops will be responsible for collecting them in Nanshi, and the Joint Offices of Public Rice Shops in other districts will be responsible for accumulating them. From the date of receiving the rice, the sacks of each public rice shop must be returned within one week. The sacks of various groups, institutions, and factories must also be returned within one week. If the deadline is exceeded, penalties will be imposed separately according to the separately established penalty rules to rectify the situation.

### Tram Company Dispatches Plainclothes Ticket Inspectors - Trial Period Ends at the End of the Month

The company's measure is to prevent ticket sellers from cheating and increase the company's revenue. The trial period is set to end at the end of this month to determine whether the plainclothes ticket inspection system will continue.

### Kamata, Head of the Press Department, Explains the Situation of Naval Battles in the Pacific

Kamata, head of the press department at the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, explained the Pacific war situation at a reception for newspaper reporters yesterday, stating, "Before the start of the Greater East Asia War, Britain misjudged Japan's power, believing that Japan had no hope of victory in the Greater East Asia War. Looking back at the British navy, two years before the start of the war, it declared that the British fleet, with Singapore (now known as Syonan Island) as its center, was sufficient to deal with Japan. However, it strongly advocated avoiding war with Japan, truly because if the entire fleet were to sail to East Asia, there would be deep concern about repeating the mistakes of the Russian navy during the Russo-Japanese War. Therefore, Britain and the United States only used propaganda to try to prevent Japan from launching operations in the Pacific. Later, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill held talks on the Prince of Wales, and the decision to engage in direct combat was made. The United States was responsible for operations in the Pacific, and Britain was responsible for operations in Europe. Although British naval experts still strongly advocated avoiding war with Japan, some military figures still harbored the delusion that victory could be achieved once war broke out. Until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War,

Japan Takes the Initiative and Achieves Unprecedented Victory

With great results, Britain lost two main battleships, including the Prince of Wales, immediately after the start of the war. The British Parliament was in an uproar and held discussions, resulting in the determination that sending warships to the Far East to protect Singapore was hopeless. However, some British military figures still deliberately concealed Britain's defeat, and there were even more bizarre statements from Churchill. However, facts speak louder than words. Japan soon occupied Singapore, Java, and the Philippines in succession. Looking at the British naval power distribution in East Asia, it can be seen that Britain had already realized that it had no hope of fighting in East Asia, so it recently transferred its main fleet to the Indian Ocean. Truly because the British fleet needed to cope with the Mediterranean war on the European side, and after suffering huge losses in the Far East war, there were no suitable warships to be transferred to East Asia. Based on this, Britain could only use tricks in the war against East Asia, so it made the United States stand at the forefront in the Pacific war, while Britain retreated in fear. Based on the results of the Washington Conference, the ratio of naval power between Japan and the United States was four to six. The United States has always had the active construction of the East Asia Fleet, and established its strategy for war against Japan, which is to adopt the central attack and southern attack routes. In particular, the central attack route is most valued. However, after the war against Japan, the so-called American

Central Attack Route Completely Failed

Now it relies only on the southern route to take the offensive. Its strategy is to use Australia as a base for attacking Japan. It has successively dispatched a large number of air forces in an attempt to establish its base for counter-attacking East Asia. Although it has suffered repeated defeats in the Solomon Islands, it is still trying to recover its declining trend. The reason for this is nothing more than an attempt to recover its increasingly depressed public sentiment. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the U.S. Navy has suffered a fierce bombardment by Japan in Hawaii, and many warships were damaged and sunk, resulting in heavy losses. Although the United States is still making false propaganda to the domestic public, the American public is unanimously expressing deep doubts. Eventually, the U.S. lost more and more warships in the South Pacific war, and the public became even more depressed. The U.S. has launched a guerrilla war in the islands near the Solomon Islands and attempted to counterattack the Solomon Islands again to address this crisis. Continuing, the air force occupies an important position in naval operations, and it is expected that the air force strength of the Japanese navy will be very large, and it is still being actively built.

### The Director of the Municipal Police Bureau Inspects Watchtowers - Instructs on Service Guidelines

Various materials that were previously controlled by friendly authorities have been transferred to the management of the National Government since the 16th of this month. In the Shanghai area, that is, the area around the suburbs of Shanghai, the economic crackdown watchtowers were originally set up by the Japanese side, and military police were dispatched to monitor and prevent the escape of materials. After the Municipal Material Movement Permit was reviewed and issued by the National Commercial Control Association, the area of the city's material control watchtowers has been formally handed over by the Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, Lu Ying, who dispatched personnel to handle the handover procedures. The sub-bureau chiefs of each bureau, in accordance with the service guidelines for the watchtowers and the regulations for cracking down on material movement, supervised their subordinates to carry out the tasks separately.

It is said that Mr. Lu was quite satisfied with the inspection of the watchtowers.

### The Tax Investigation Department of the Ministry of Finance Sets a Time Limit to Identify Counterfeit Stamps

Since the discovery of counterfeit stamps in Shanghai, the Tax Investigation Department of the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly issued notices from the competent authorities and posted the true and false styles in the newspaper for public knowledge. Recently, it was found that some unscrupulous people occasionally sell counterfeit stamps, and merchants and people cannot distinguish the true from the false and are fooled by them. Once discovered, they cannot avoid suffering losses. Although this situation is legally unforgivable, it is not unreasonable. Now, in order to sympathize with the difficulties of merchants, it is hoped that all merchants and people will quickly identify all the stamps they have purchased and stored. If there is any doubt, they should be sent to the investigation department at 200 Jiujiang Road or the seventh inspection department at 838 Fuxu Road within ten days to request identification in order to avoid negligence. Those who do not request identification before the deadline and still use counterfeit stamps will be considered intentional use and will be dealt with according to the law without leniency.

### Children's Welfare Association Fundraising Campaign - Target of 500,000 Yuan - Used to Support Refugee Children

### Spokesman for the Japanese Embassy Talks About Churchill's Prophecy

Arita, the spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in this port, made a statement to the Domei News Agency yesterday morning, stating, "On Sunday night, Prime Minister Churchill revised his 1941 prophecy of conquering Germany and Italy, saying that it would take until 1944, or even until 1945, and said that by that time, the Allied forces would be facing Japan and the Far East. Mr. Chiu's speech gave the current situation a

Proper understanding, this situation was previously obscured by Allied leaders and spokesmen, because the anti-Axis countries regarded the European and African wars as the main ones and the East Asian war as the decisive one, at least for the time being. The British Prime Minister's Europe First doctrine has dealt a serious blow to Chongqing and Australia. In the past, President Roosevelt's words about the United States' aid to these two governments were deliberately vague, only saying that the United States would jointly aid them with Britain and the Soviet Union. His cleverly disguised words were the reason for causing concern and dissatisfaction in Chongqing and Australia. Today, Prime Minister Churchill has frankly stated the scope of aid to them, and for the first time formally revealed the principles followed by the political and military policies of the anti-Axis countries. This implication of the situation has been around since the Casablanca Conference. The Prime Minister's words relieved

Mr. Dou, the second most important point in the speech, is that the Prime Minister attaches importance to the difficulties of the North African and Soviet

Operations, London and Washington had previously recklessly predicted that Germany would be defeated in 1942 and Japan would be defeated in 1943. Now it is 1943, Germany still exists, and the Prime Minister has extended the deadline to 1944, or even 1945. As for defeating Japan, it will be later. It can be seen that Mr. Chiu's past prophecy was just intimidation. What is even more important is that the North African and Soviet wars have not been going smoothly. Reckless prophecies, reckless corrections, are quite laughable. By 1944, whether Britain can exist is still a question. This matter is worth careful consideration by the Chongqing side. In view of the failure of Britain and the United States to establish the League of Nations, who can believe Mr. Chiu's plan for post-war handling of Europe and Asia?" Finally, Mr. Hirota pointed out that the British Prime Minister's post-war economic structure was developed to help Mr. Eden's talks in the United States. His cautious language is not intended to rekindle the ashes of the political differences that already exist in the anti-Axis countries. In his words, we can see the seriousness of the differences of opinion between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union after the war.

### Economic Sector

Call Loan Rate Yesterday morning, the Money Trade Association's call loan rate was still quoted at 16%, and military scrip was at $5.5456.

### Commentary On the Control of Market Interest Rates

The money trade in Shanghai began after the opening of trade ports, with the large firms evolving from ancient draft banks. The money trade has a close relationship with ordinary commerce and industry, and naturally possesses a kind of latent power sufficient to establish itself as an independent force. In major cities around the world, the rise and fall of borrowing rates are controlled by the central bank. Ordinary bills can be discounted at banks, and banks can further rediscount them at the central bank. The central bank's rediscount rate is the standard for commercial interest rates. However, Shanghai, China, is different. The money trade has its own association. Merchants obtain loans from money shops, and the money shops calculate call loan rates, with the Money Trade Association's listed rate as the standard. Therefore, the Shanghai commercial interest rate is still based on the Money Trade Association's call loan rate. Now that the Central Reserve Bank has become the leader of Chinese banks in Shanghai, controlling market interest rates is the Central Reserve Bank's responsibility. If financial conditions become tight and call loan rates rise sharply, the bank can absorb commercial bills and release loans to maintain market stability and reassure the public. Moreover, the Central Reserve Bank must also handle the buying and selling of all securities, which is also greatly related to the adjustment of interest rates. When securities are expensive and credit is relatively loose, the Central Reserve Bank may purchase securities and moderately increase interest rates; when securities are low and credit is relatively tight, the bank may sell securities and lower interest rates. This would not only adjust interest rates but also maintain the stability of the entire financial market.

### New Manager of Central Reserve Bank Shanghai Branch, Dai Ailu, Scheduled to Take Office

(Central News Agency Shanghai) The manager of the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank was originally concurrently held by Qian Da, vice president of the bank's head office. Now, because the bank's operations have expanded and its business has become more complex, Qian is unable to serve concurrently. He has been approved to resign from his concurrent position as manager of the Shanghai branch. The vacant position of Shanghai branch manager has been filled by Dai Ailu, supervisor of the bank and standing director of Hua Xing Bank, appointed by President Zhou. After receiving the order, Dai is scheduled to assume office on April 1.

It is also learned that the directors and assistant managers of Hua Xing Bank, as Dai is about to leave, held a farewell banquet at the Broadway Mansions yesterday (24th) at 6:00 PM.

### Materials Transfer Permit Office Holds Talks with Chinese and Japanese Trade Associations

(Central News Agency Shanghai) The Materials Transfer Permit Office of the National Commercial Control Association held talks with responsible persons from relevant Chinese and Japanese trade associations at the Hamilton House yesterday (24th) at 4:00 PM. Those in attendance included Keno Komuro, representative of the Japanese Industrial Pharmaceutical Trade Association, Kenji Takashima, Jukichi Mukai of the Shanghai Dye Trade Association, Kawaharada Sachi of the Japanese-Chinese Rubber Industry Association, Li Shudu of the Western Dye Industry Association, Ge Baohua of the Shanghai Special Municipality Rubber Association, Tetsuo Oyama of the Japanese Cotton Industry Federation, Xu Chengxun of the Shanghai Special Municipality Paint and Sundries Association, Hideo Yamaguchi of the Central China Flour Milling Federation, Tang Daozhang of the Shanghai Special Municipality Woodworking Machinery Association, Chen Jiesan representing Xie Xiaochu of the Industrial Raw Materials Manufacturing Association, Fu Zhiyang representing the Industrial Raw Materials Association, and Zhang Yiping of the Shanghai Special Municipality Yarn and Cloth Association. Director Zhang of the Special Commodities Transportation and Sales Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industry attended and explained the main points of the talks, stating that according to Article 6 of the Temporary Regulations on Wartime Materials Transfer Control promulgated by the government, when applying to the association for permission to move various materials, it is necessary to have proof from the relevant Chinese and Japanese trade associations. In the future, when members of each trade association submit application forms for proof, they must be fair, honest, and prudent in handling them, adhering to the principles of not being excessive or obstructive. He also explained in detail how to fill out the application form and the location of the seal to avoid discrepancies and errors. He also distributed blank seal paper to the responsible persons of the trade associations present today, instructing them to affix their seals and send them to the office for record-keeping. If there are any unclear points, they can inquire at the office at any time.

Over One Hundred Permits Issued

It is also learned that since the Materials Transfer Permit Office began handling applications for materials transfer permits, a large number of Chinese and Japanese merchants in the city have applied for transfers within the past week. After careful investigation and review by the office, over one hundred permits have been issued. The permitted materials for transfer in and out are mostly "rice, miscellaneous grains, silk fabrics, and pharmaceuticals." It is said that the office considers the responsibility for handling materials transfer permit applications to be very important. Therefore, the proof procedures for applicants must be completed in order to achieve the goal of controlling materials.

Inspection of Permit Application Work

Xiong Shutao, director of the Review Department of the National Commercial Control Association, and Secretary Sun Liyu, led more than ten key members of the association to the office for inspection yesterday (24th) morning. Director Zhang of the Special Commodities Transportation and Sales Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industry accompanied them to inspect the application work of each department. They were quite satisfied and impressed with the work ethic of the staff.

### China Central Cigarette Company Distributes Rationed Cigarettes

Since the price of cigarettes was announced and implemented by the Public Works Bureau yesterday, it is said that all cigarette shops in the city must sell according to this price and must not exceed it, under penalty of law. It has also been learned that the company originally planned to ration cigarettes yesterday, but due to the rush to complete the procedures, it will be delayed slightly and will be distributed within three days. Yesterday, the company divided the distribution into four locations for the convenience of cigarette dealers to collect the rationed cigarettes. The addresses are:

Cigarette Distribution Divided into Four Locations Number 84) Second Distribution Center (571 Hankou Road) Third Distribution Center (25 Guizhou Road) Fourth Distribution Center (293 Broadway Road) The above distribution centers are responsible for the distribution to cigarette dealers throughout the city, and cigarette shops in this port can collect the rationed cigarettes from these locations. It is also learned that the company is also working hard to distribute rationed cigarettes to other cities in Central China. The Suzhou branch has been established, and the persons in charge of the Ningbo and Hangzhou branches have been internally determined yesterday. The persons in charge of other ports will also be resolved within days.

### Defatted Soybean Flour, 4,000 to 5,000 Dan Already Produced, Will be Sold with Miscellaneous Grain Certificates

Defatted soybean flour, a supplementary food for the people, is currently being processed and rushed to production by various oil pressing factories. It is reported that 4,000 to 5,000 dan have already been produced. Once there is a sufficient quantity, it will be sold by the authorities with miscellaneous grain certificates.

### Authorities Striving to Suppress Prices, Restoration of General Trade Association Hopeless

Regarding the restoration of the General Trade Association, expectations have been high recently. However, the authorities believe that if the General Trade Association is restored, it will affect the market, revive the spirit of speculation, and promote price increases. The speculative nature of the exchange cannot be separated from price funds. Therefore, after consideration by the authorities, it is believed that it is not possible to restore it for the time being.

### Increased Egg Production in Central China, 10,000 Baskets Shipped to Shanghai Daily

The annual egg production in Central China is estimated at 20 million eggs. In addition to supplying residents of Shanghai and other places, most of them are purchased by egg factories and shipped overseas. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, export routes have been cut off. However, since this year, after the Japanese merchants took control of the purchase of eggs in various parts of Central China, the number of eggs shipped to Shanghai daily has reached as many as 10,000 baskets (previously only 2,000 per month). As a result, the Japanese-owned Yangtze Egg Factory and the Jardine Egg Factory under military management in this port have recently resumed their original operations.

### Current Situation of the Soap Industry in This City

The largest soap factory in Shanghai is the China Soap Company. The company is a British-owned enterprise, so after the outbreak of the Pacific War in the winter of the previous year, it was taken over by military management. Now it is a commissioned factory of the Japan Oil and Fat Company. The factory's equipment and production capacity account for 40% of the total soap production capacity in Shanghai. In addition, there are five Japanese-owned soap factories: Japan Oil and Fat Industry, First Industrial Manufacturing Rong, Maeda Yoko, and Kyuwa Yoko. On the Chinese side, there are more than 30 factories, including Wuzhou, China Chemical, and Yuhua. The total production capacity of the Japanese factories is 100,000 boxes of laundry soap and 120,000 to 130,000 dozen of toilet soap per month. In addition to the three factories listed above, the production capacity of the Chinese factories is relatively large, while the rest are small-scale handicrafts, and their production capacity is truly insignificant. The operating status of each factory varies. On average, it should be between 30% and 40%. The fundamental weakness of the Chinese soap industry is that the necessary raw materials must be imported from overseas. Although butter, lard, and vegetable oil are quite abundant domestically, caustic soda cannot be self-sufficient at all. After December 8th, the source of caustic soda from the United Kingdom and the United States was cut off, and it was changed to import from Japan and Manchuria.

### Enterprise Weekly Published

The first issue of the eleventh volume of Enterprise Weekly, published yesterday, contains Zhu Shihuang's "On the Promotion of Bill Acceptance and Discount Business," Wang Wei's "On Adjusting the Relationship Between Commodity Supply and Demand in the Future," Cai Chimo's "A Brief Discussion on the Silk Factory Industry," as well as factory investigations, industrial and commercial news, and other columns. The publication is the only periodical in the business community. Contributions from all parties are welcome. The subscription address is Enterprise Weekly, 996 Jing'an Temple Road.

### Dynamics of Daily Necessities

Matches

There are ten major match factories in Shanghai under the supervision of the military distribution association. Meiguang Factory (commissioned by China Central Zhenyu Company), Hongsheng Factory, China Factory, Guanghua Factory, Tongsui Factory, Daming Factory, Dahua Factory, China Factory, Zhongnan Factory, and Shanghai Match Factory. The total production capacity of the above ten factories is close to 1,000 tons per day. Meiguang Factory is China's first-class modern factory. The match industry in Central China developed relatively early. The average annual demand in Central China is about 100,000 tons. The total output of the ten factories is surplus, and there is sufficient capacity for export. However, the match industry also has its weaknesses, that is, its raw materials must depend on overseas.

The military distribution association has supervised these ten major factories since May of the 30th year, managing their business and supplying raw materials. Because matches are a daily necessity, the past joint venture organization was dissolved, and the military distribution association took control of the distribution of matches.

The lower-level distribution agencies do not adopt strict methods. The Chinese side is the Match Trade Association, and the Japanese side is a designated sales system. A slow control method is used. Prices are based on military scrip, and a fixed price system is adopted. The retail price is four cents (Japanese money) per box, and each person is limited to three packages (ten boxes per package).

Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the production cost of Cheng Factory was expensive, so the retail price was changed to five cents (Japanese money). There were not many black market incidents. The distribution control was relatively smooth. After the Greater East Asia War, the situation changed. From December 8th of the 30th year to February of the 31st year, the market situation was still stable, because there were many stocks on the market, so there were no extreme phenomena. But from March of the same year, because the credit of the French currency had plummeted, everyone competed to purchase materials, and matches were also regarded as a kind of thing that could be hoarded, thus creating a skyrocketing situation.

The military authorities, seeing this endless rise, believed that it would affect the people's livelihood, so in April of the same year, they prepared to reform the distribution agency and solicited opinions from all parties to study specific measures.

Soon, the Military Distribution Match Distribution Association was established, directly contacting the Chinese and Japanese match trade associations, reducing the intermediate layer of exploitation, and at the same time preventing the black market. But we still hope that it can directly relate to retailers and consumers.

Regarding the distribution matters in the interior, it is also prepared to set up distribution associations under the military distribution branches or offices in various places. Although the plan is already in place, no place has yet been established. Now Hankou and Jiujiang have been entrusted by the military distribution branch to the Match Trade Association to supply various retail shops. Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Bengbu, Wuhu, Nantong, and Hangzhou are all issued by the local military distribution offices to the distributors or transferred by the cooperative to the retail outlets. The price is still five cents (Japanese money) per box. (March 20th, Continental New Daily)

### On Martial Arts and Literature

— Ding Xin

If we assume that the ancients said what was in their hearts - if this statement is correct, then a certain kind of literary creation and the environmental background of a certain era must be mutually related. Why do I say this? Before we answer this question, let's ask when was the most flourishing period of Chinese literature and art?

I know everyone will answer the Tang Dynasty; you must know that the flourishing of Tang Dynasty literature and art was closely related to martial arts. If we scientifically analyze the works of many literary and artistic writers from the prosperous Tang Dynasty to the late Tang Dynasty, then, apart from eulogizing military achievements, describing the heroic feelings of the border, and rendering the heroic spirit of warriors and knights, what remains are just some dregs with extremely few components such as romance and leisure.

From this point of view, it can be seen that the most sublime era of literature and art - such as the Tang Dynasty, was also the era of the most prosperous martial arts. The vivid pens of poets were specially used to describe the national revival enthusiasm; they were specially used to arouse the national martial enthusiasm. If the elements of poetry do not permeate national enthusiasm, and if the nouns used lack nouns such as swords, horses, strong bows, and powerful arrows, then it will not be enough to add color: the poets are praising the warriors for engraving their names on Y然 Mountain, and hope that the generals will write their portraits in the Kirin Pavilion.

Of course, we do not need decadent literature that specializes in describing the private feelings of men and women. We should discard the groaning without illness that describes personal trivia. We are working hard to create a new China. We want to use our own pens to arouse enthusiasm, boil blood, and complete our mission.

We want to recover the inherent courage, righteousness, and self-sacrifice spirit of our East Asian nation from the feelings of thinking about the past, and to invigorate the uniqueness of our East Asian nation!

### Ode to White

— Shui Ning

I often wonder why we use white at funerals, while foreigners prefer to use white at weddings. The associations we have with white are cries, widows, orphans, and desolate empty houses; the associations they have with white are happy laughter and chimes, and rooms full of elegant clothes and beautiful hairstyles. The same white color evokes completely different emotions. You must say that this is a psychological effect, but if you try other colors, red and green will make you happy and cheerful, but will never make you depressed; gray and black will make you serious and depressed, but will never make you happy. White is different. It is solemn yet serene. It has its own brilliance and charm. It is expansive, but does not make people ecstatic.

Sunlight does not look white, but when refracted through a prism, it has seven colors. These are so dazzling that you can't believe they come from this pale and simple color. We usually say, "This is white, it has no color," which is illogical. White is clearly a synthesis of all colors, so why say it is colorless? Saying it is colorless is a heavy depreciation. Colorless is without feeling, without expression, without life.

Elegant blue, striking green, and bright red are extremely dazzling, and can immediately attract your attention and elicit your praise. However, few people have ever said, "Look, that white is so beautiful," because white always stands behind other colors, not rushing forward to be seen. However, many places rely entirely on the contrast of white to show their beauty. The white clouds floating in the sky and the white sails floating on the water are not beautiful in themselves, but they can set off the blue of the sky and the green of the water, adding artistic interest to both the sky and the sea.

When we wear a white dress, hold a white book, or wear white shoes, we feel that we can't be too casual, because white is not resistant to dirt. A touch leaves a dark shadow, and a rub leaves a layer of dirty light. You can't help but shake your head. At the same time, you hate white because it covers up your shortcomings. You make a good friend, he is pure and spotless. There is no place for blemishes to hide on him. When you stand next to him, you feel ashamed. You see his strengths, but you don't feel that he is flaunting them. He makes you see your own shortcomings, but is not pedantic. Even so, you often feel uncomfortable and uneasy in his presence!

Don't say that white has no variation. The white of white porcelain is dazzling. The white of white stone is stiff. The white of snow is pure. The white of clouds is blurry. The white of jade is translucent with opacity, and has a pale, sickly green glow. The white of feathers is soft and fluffy, yet glossy. A child's hand is fat, white, moist, and clear... close your eyes and daydream, and when you open your eyes, you are suddenly blinded by the bright light. You only feel that the white light of the sun is shining on everything, and everything becomes bright and white.

Awu also walked among them. Like many other young people, he wore a black cloth short coat, unbuttoned at the chest to make walking easier. He wore a pair of green cloth trousers, as new as the shoes on his feet. The shoes were made of black cloth, and were already covered in mud up to the ankles. Like the other young people, he was also very happy. Although the scenery of this field was very familiar to him, today it had many new features and new meanings, bringing him infinite new joy.

Wheat, that piece after piece of wheat, barley, wheat, even rye and oats, had all formed ears, neatly swaying gently in the breeze. To Awu, they seemed to be welcoming him. And yet they were still very green, just like a young woman who, although she had given birth to children, still had green hair and red cheeks, with no signs of aging. They were in a state of fullness and roundness, ready to burst with water, and not yet mature. Their loveliness made Awu have to raise his hand as he walked and press it on their heads, stroking them gently. When they touched his hand, they seemed a little shy, and immediately lowered their heads to avoid him, and only straightened up and wagged their heads at him from behind after he had passed by. The broad beans on the edge of the field, with their tender green pods hanging all over their bodies, also lined up in two long rows, watching Awu walk past. Awu's proud and condescending attitude was like a giant walking in front of dwarves, or like a prince walking in front of commoners. Although there were many other people walking in front of and behind him, he felt that they were all arranged so neatly just for him. (19)

### Reasonable Stubbornness

— Cheng Da

We often hear the word stubborn and immediately think of the many unpleasant things that happen because of obstinacy. However, if we think about it carefully, we will find that our understanding is not enough. The stubbornness we see is only one side of stubbornness - unreasonable stubbornness. This is a bad temper that not only destroys oneself, but also hinders the progress of others.

Reasonable stubbornness is the other side of stubbornness. The achievement of all undertakings, scientific inventions and creations, and even the birth of a new era, are based on the appropriate use of this precious character. Edison was particularly clear about this. Once he said, "To invent something, the most important character is stubbornness. Almost everyone who is developing a new ideal, works to a certain point, sees that it is impossible, and then their spirits are discouraged. That is where discouragement arises, that is where interest arises. Hard work and permanent persistence to the end are essential main conditions for an inventor." If Edison lacked this kind of stubbornness, then not only would his efforts have fallen short, and the electric light would have been impossible to invent, we would probably still be lingering in the age of candles and gas lamps; and all his efforts would have been in vain.

It is extremely unfortunate for a person to suffer from unreasonable stubbornness. If he continues to be unreasonably stubborn to the end and cannot receive the advice of others, the result is that he goes further and further down the wrong path. Needless to say, it is of no benefit to himself, but often harms those who live or work with him, causing them unwarranted mental pain. It is truly a deep sin! If he does not have enough knowledge and cannot discover his mistakes himself, but can be open-minded, accept criticism, consider it, compare it, and wait until he realizes his past mistakes, abandons his prejudices, and changes direction to embark on the right path, then he can still be considered an enlightened person.

Unreasonable stubbornness is a poison that harms both oneself and others. We must stay away from it and abandon it. Only reasonable stubbornness is the fine wine of self-confidence, the nemesis of inconstancy, and the great force that drives the wheel of the times. We must persevere in it.

In this world, I respect those with broad shoulders. Frank, straightforward, heroic, not playing tricks, not hypocritical. I praise them as heroes. A tall and imposing figure is always worth admiring to me.

When Wu Zetian became emperor, her first major task was to have Di Renjie recommend heroes for her to employ, but heroes were hard to find, and treacherous officials were too numerous. As a result, it was recorded in history, giving later generations the satisfaction of cursing and complaining.

Heroes, who wouldn't want to be one? A bandit on the verge of execution straightens his body, laughs loudly, and says: "Give it another twenty years, and there will be another hero!"

In the Water Margin, Li Kui said to Zhang Shun: "Don't meet me on the shore." Zhang Shun said: "I'll wait for you in the water." Honestly and straightforwardly stating that he has abilities, and not denying that others don't. Only a hero would have this kind of tone.

If people have a psychology of admiring heroes, wouldn't they also have the desire to be called a hero and take pride in it?

Therefore, there are even more heroes now.

In the past, heroes dared to act, leaving their names after stabbing hypocrites and providing relief to the poor with silver. Modern heroes are smarter; a good hero doesn't suffer immediate losses, and this is the most reasonable amulet.

A true man has courage and integrity. If he suffers a loss, he doesn't hide it or blame himself, but swallows his broken teeth and gets back up to try again.

I wonder if today's heroes can understand this meaning!

### An Appeal on Behalf of Christian Orphans and the Elderly by a Seventy-Five-Year-Old

— Zhao Ximing

I read the appeal made the other day on behalf of Catholic orphans and the elderly, and I deeply sympathize. That church is mostly run by people from France and Italy, and its expansion is such, and its concern for relief work is truly admirable. Thinking of the orphans and the elderly in the church fills one with reverence. I believe that Christianity and Catholicism originally came from the same root with two branches. Today, the Catholics deeply care for the suffering of others, organize committees, and handle charitable affairs, which is very meaningful. Christian orphans, the elderly, the poor, and the sick are in urgent need of relief, and I sincerely hope that all sectors of society will provide strong assistance. I am an elderly believer and would like to initiate a committee similar to the Catholic one, starting with the work of caring for the elderly and children. According to investigations, there are currently (1) Jiangwan Rende Mingde, (2) Nanxiang Nursing Home, (3) Beiqiao Mercy Garden, (4) Longhua Fulao Garden, (5) City Lai'an Place, (6) Nanshi Nursing Home, (7) Jinzhuang Old People's Hall, (8) Hongkou Jilao Hall, (9) Huaiyou Orphanage, (10) Puyi Society. The above ten places used to rely solely on American wheat relief, but now they are facing increasingly difficult situations. The newly established four or five orphanages are not unified or mutually supportive, and are not as consistent and uniform as the Catholic churches. Therefore, I especially appeal to respected elders in the church such as Kuang Jinqing, Yuan Ludeng, Li Denghui, and Gao Fengchi, to gather with elderly believers in the church and restore the organization of the "Elderly Association," to centrally manage the charitable cause of caring for the elderly. I am willing to dedicate my remaining years and do my best to benefit both the rich and the poor, the noble and the humble among Christian brothers and sisters, to help ourselves and others, and together receive the grace of God.
