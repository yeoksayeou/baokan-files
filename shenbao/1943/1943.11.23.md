### Central Idea

Thought itself is invisible and silent. When contained, it can be hidden within an inch of the heart, but when released, it fills the universe and generates majestic power. For the individual, the magnificence or despondency of one's spirit and attitude are invariably governed by thought, and the actions of a sage or a robber are invariably driven by thought. A nation and its people are originally an organic whole formed by individuals. People's minds naturally differ like their faces, but there must be some thoughts shared by the majority, which constitute the thoughts of the nation and its people. Among these, the one that occupies the absolute majority is the central idea of the nation and its people. The power of the central idea is sufficient to establish the nation's position and solidify its intentions. It cannot be shifted by force, let alone changed in a short period.

The meaning of the term "center" is mostly applicable to shapes and planes, while the interpretation of the term "center of gravity" is accurate in mechanics and physics. Knowing the location of an object's center of gravity allows one to know how to keep it balanced; otherwise, it will inevitably fall. The components of a nation and its people are individuals, just as the components of an object are point masses. To control an object, one must first explore its center of gravity; to grasp a nation and its people, one must first cultivate their central idea. Therefore, the central idea of a nation and its people can be regarded as the center of gravity of the nation and its people.

The higher an object's center of gravity, the easier it is to change its position and cause the object to overturn. The lower it is, the more it can maintain its position and keep the object stable. This is a natural law that applies to objects and everything else. Therefore, the more a central idea penetrates downward, the greater the power it exerts, and the more stable and resolute the position and intentions of the nation and its people become. An object's center of gravity has no good or evil, but a central idea can be correct or erroneous. The more a correct central idea is confined to the upper classes, the more insignificant its effect; the more an erroneous central idea penetrates the people, the greater its danger.

The two major nations of China and Japan coexist in Asia and should be loving and supportive of each other. However, in recent centuries, due to various factual provocations, their feelings have become increasingly hateful and contemptuous. Coupled with external instigation and alienation, they have gone in opposite directions, gradually forming an unshakable erroneous central idea. Even if there are insightful people in both countries who run around and appeal in an attempt to change the situation, and even if Dr. Sun Yat-sen created and advocated Pan-Asianism to enlighten us, there is still the occurrence of this Sino-Japanese Incident. Whose fault is this? It is due to the erroneous central idea!

Now that the National Government has returned to its capital, it has made restoring peace its mission, and its negotiations are aimed at realizing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will. At the same time, enlightened political leaders in Japan, with righteousness in mind, are promoting a new policy towards China based on the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, followed by the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. Recently, they abolished all past unequal treaties and established a Sino-Japanese alliance of mutual benefit and respect. Therefore, the terms used between the two major nations have changed from enemies to friendly nations to show goodwill. Now they call each other allies, and there must be even more brotherly affection. The obstacles that have existed between them for many years have been swept away, and the suspicions and jealousies between them naturally no longer exist. The authorities of both countries treat each other with sincerity and frankness, creating a new era in the history of Sino-Japanese diplomacy and opening a new path for the future of East Asia. We are truly delighted and overjoyed.

From now on, the erroneous central idea seems to have been eliminated, but the correct central idea still needs to be built with effort, and it must be made to penetrate from top to bottom to the lowest levels. The effectiveness of slogans and catchphrases is minimal for this penetration work. Only the facts experienced by women and children can achieve satisfactory results. It is hoped that the gains already made will crystallize into the center of gravity of the nation and its people, and that it will continue to move downward so that the entire group of the nation and its people cannot be tilted by any external force. Then, we can move forward to achieve the three major goals of overall peace, the revival of China, and the protection of Greater Asia.

Passage of the General Resolution

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The original text of the general resolution passed by the Second National Propaganda Conference is as follows: "The focus of ideological struggle lies in propaganda, and the foundation of national construction depends on culture. Since the start of the peace movement, our comrades on the Fourth Front, under the guidance of the supreme leader, have been fighting with a clear and resolute spirit to establish thought, not shying away from sacrifice and striving to be pioneers. They have strived for the expansion of peace and the realization of unity with efforts in their respective positions. In the year following the return of the government to the capital, the first National Propaganda Conference was convened in the capital. Since then, the internal and external situations have undergone tremendous changes. The signing of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty laid a solid foundation for peace, followed by the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, which sounded the alarm for East Asian freedom and liberation. This year, the National Government's participation in the war further completed its long-cherished wish for independence and autonomy. Recently, China and Japan revised their treaties, establishing an alliance of justice with a spirit of morality, and further united with various East Asian countries to issue the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, which is precisely realizing our founding father's will and embarking on the road to co-prosperity in East Asia, a good opportunity in a thousand years. Looking at the domestic situation, although there are still those who are stubbornly unenlightened, obstructing peace, and hindering unity, and even sacrificing compatriots and destroying the seeds of independence in Burma and India, it is heartbreaking to speak of. However, the trend is that the end of Anglo-American imperialism has arrived, and the completion of China's independence and autonomy and the realization of East Asian co-existence and co-prosperity cannot be stopped by any force. We can only persevere in our original intentions and encourage ourselves. This year, the Supreme National Defense Council passed the Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy, and the correction of thought already has the highest standards. The greatest theme of this National Propaganda Conference is to establish a wartime cultural propaganda system, mobilize the total force of cultural propaganda, and promote unification to complete the war. It happens to be after the signing of the Sino-Japanese alliance and the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration, so its mission is undoubtedly of great importance. This conference reviews the past, looks forward to the future, and vows to follow the instructions of the Supreme Leader, not shying away from difficulties or dangers. That is our gun. With sincerity and unity, we will strive and fight. Even if we die on the battlefield, we will not hesitate. We will strictly follow the Basic Outline of the Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy and the resolutions of the conference, strengthen the work of various departments, plan to establish a news and publishing association, literary writing construction, and complete the wartime cultural propaganda system. Internally, we will arouse the people, eliminate obstacles to peace, and complete the construction of unity. Externally, we will stimulate the national war fighting mood, follow the allied countries, aid India, and eliminate the United States and Britain to win the victory in the Greater East Asia War and seek the liberation of the East Asian nations. This is the resolution."

### Japan Decides to Provide Full Assistance to Manchuria's Agricultural Land Reclamation Plan. Implementation is Scheduled for Next Year and Expected to be Completed Within Two Years

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - During this war, Manchuria not only cooperated with Japan with various materials, but also contributed greatly to Japan directly and indirectly in terms of food and other aspects. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and the public and private sectors have expressed deep gratitude for this, and the inseparable relationship between Japan and Manchuria has become even more consolidated. Manchuria bears the mission of being a food base, and the current situation has further increased its task. In view of this situation, Manchuria has established a new emergency plan to reclaim vast agricultural land, and at the same time plans to implement existing agricultural land reclamation plans in advance. The two plans have been combined to draft an emergency agricultural land reclamation plan, which was submitted to the Japanese government a few days ago for cooperation in order to achieve it. The Japanese government, with the Greater East Asia Ministry as the center, reviewed the case and, after summarizing opinions from all sides, decided to accept the proposal. The basic policy of Japan's cooperation and assistance to the case has also been drafted and passed at the regular cabinet meeting on the 22nd. The enemy purpose of the cooperative assistance plan has been announced by the Japanese Information Bureau. At the same time, Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki made a statement clarifying the outline of the implementation plan. The details are recorded below:

The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 22nd: Manchuria believes that the mission of the food base under the current situation is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, it has further proposed an emergency agricultural land reclamation plan. The Imperial Government also gladly accepted it and passed it at today's cabinet meeting. Regarding the assistance plan, the Japanese side will provide comprehensive cooperation and assistance in materials, funds, and technology for the implementation of the plan, so as to jointly move towards strengthening the food self-sufficiency posture.

### Active Food Production Increase is a Major Contribution to Japan

Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki said in a statement that Manchuria is currently making every effort to increase food production and is planning to supply it to Japan, which is something we are sincerely grateful for. Now, in view of the food supply and demand relationship, Manchuria's mission as a food base has become even more important, and we very much expect Manchuria to actively increase food production in the future. In order to rapidly adapt to this demand, the Manchurian government will thoroughly strengthen all past measures and establish a groundbreaking agricultural land reclamation plan. In order to implement the plan, General Manager Takebe was sent to Tokyo to submit the proposal to our country. Our government, based on the proposal, reviewed it with the relevant administrative authorities and reached a consensus. At today's cabinet meeting, it was passed and a basic policy for cooperation and assistance to the plan was decided. This emergency agricultural land reclamation plan is scheduled to be implemented next year and completed in Showa 20 (1945), opening up new paddy fields in the Second Songhua River area and the East Liao River area in a short period of only two years, and implementing the existing land reclamation plan in advance. Once completed, the food produced will be supplied to our country, contributing to the adjustment of our food supply and demand relationship. As far as the Imperial Government is concerned, in order to complete the plan, it will actively participate and cooperate in all aspects of funding, materials, and technology. There will inevitably be many difficulties in promoting this project in the future, so it is hoped that Japan and Manchuria will further cooperate closely, and the relationship between the two countries should be more sincerely cooperative and deeply understood. After the implementation of this plan, the food self-sufficiency posture of Japan and Manchuria will be further strengthened. This is truly worthy of celebration during the war. Here, I express my deep gratitude to Manchuria's kindness.

It is said that the 19th Army Group of the Chongqing army is already on the verge of collapse, and the offensive of the Japanese army in various directions is becoming more and more smooth.

The Japanese Air Force Fiercely Bombs the Mountains South of Cili

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Central China front, the Japanese air force fiercely bombed the mountainous area south of Cili twice on the 21st in order to cooperate with the Japanese army in advancing, encircling, and annihilating in the south of Nuli, inflicting heavy damage on the main forces of the 51st and 58th Divisions of the 74th Army of the Chongqing army.

### Famine in Bengal, India, Followed by Epidemic

Stanford, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A New Delhi correspondent for the Daily Telegraph recently reported on the famine situation throughout the Indian province of Bengal, stating: The famine in Bengal has not yet been alleviated, and it is now followed by major epidemics in many areas. At least one million people are now suffering from insufficient food, leading to a loss of resistance to disease. Cholera, dysentery, malaria, pneumonia, and influenza were originally common ailments among the Indian people in Bengal, but now cholera has spread to Calcutta and other areas, while dysentery and malignant malaria are also commonly prevalent. As winter approaches, the starving people are poorly clothed, greatly increasing the risk of pneumonia, and influenza will likely seize the opportunity to spread throughout the province. There are very few doctors and nurses in India, and even fewer hospitals, so there is no way to prevent the rampaging epidemic. I am not saying this to create alarm, nor as a critic, but from the perspective of an observer. Although the Governor-General of India and the Bengal provincial government have adopted all methods to try to avoid this crisis, their efforts have been ineffective.

### Minister Matsushima's Speech at the Propaganda Conference

(Continued from yesterday) On the evening of the 5th, our naval air forces discovered an enemy mobile force composed of two aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and two destroyers in the sea south of Bougainville Island. Thereupon, using only a small number of 18 aircraft, they attacked, and in the blink of an eye, sank one large aircraft carrier, one medium-sized aircraft carrier, two large cruisers, and two cruisers or large destroyers. As a result, the enemy was almost completely destroyed by us. However, our losses were only three aircraft. This battle is called the First Air Battle of Bougainville Island. But following this battle, another great victory that astonished the world unfolded in the southern seas.

This can truly be called the Second Air Battle of Bougainville Island. From the morning of November 8th, our naval air forces began a fierce attack on the attacking enemy transport convoy and escort fleet. As a result, we achieved a great victory second only to the Battle of Hawaii, destroying four battleships, sinking two cruisers, heavily damaging three or more large cruisers, sinking three destroyers, setting fire to and heavily damaging three cruisers or large destroyers, sinking four transport ships, heavily damaging one large transport ship, and shooting down more than twelve aircraft. Our losses this time were only 15 aircraft that did not return.

This at once annihilated the enemy's large transport convoy, and during operations in the Solomon Islands, approximately a week before, when the Bougainville Island counterattack began, MacArthur convened a conference with Halsey, commander of the fleet, Harmon, commander of the land forces, and Kryder, commander of the Marine Corps. At that time, boasting with an attitude of absolute confidence, he said, "We will capture Bougainville Island within a week and then establish a combined battle and bomber airbase." But this statement resulted in a very tragic outcome and was truly an indirect irony.

Regarding the results of the Second Air Battle of Bougainville Island, His Majesty the Emperor bestowed gracious words upon the Combined Fleet, and the morale of the fleet soared even higher. On November 11th, braving hazardous weather day and night, they caught the enemy mobile force on the sea south of Bougainville Island and attacked. As a result, one cruiser or large destroyer was sunk, one battleship was moderately damaged, two large aircraft carriers and one large cruiser were slightly damaged, three large cruisers or large destroyers were heavily damaged and set on fire, and one destroyer was heavily damaged and set on fire, and two aircraft were shot down. Our suicide and non-returning aircraft also accounted for a loss of thirty aircraft. It is thought that the enemy must also have defended to the death. This was the Third Air Battle of Bougainville Island.

But the enemy did not change their ways and attacked again. So on the 13th, the Fourth Air Battle of Bougainville Island unfolded again in the sea south of that island. As a result, one large cruiser and one cruiser were sunk, one destroyer was sunk, and one battleship and one medium aircraft carrier were heavily damaged. We also lost two aircraft. Then, at dawn on the 17th, the Fifth Air Battle unfolded in the same battlefield, trapping the enemy's mobile forces between the two wings of our naval forces. One large aircraft carrier was sunk, two medium-sized aircraft carriers, three cruisers, and one battleship were sunk (ship type unknown). We achieved a truly overwhelming victory, but we only lost five aircraft.

Despite such consecutive battles, the enemy's persistence and their enthusiasm for operations around Bougainville Island and Rabaul did not change. From this, we can infer that we are drawing the enemy to this sea area for this reason, successively shattering them into the seaweed beneath the sea. This kind of operation is truly extremely gratifying.

I believe that what the American forces are trying to do is on one hand to seize our bases in the Solomon Islands, and on the other hand to advance into northern New Guinea, pincer and take the Bismarck area, in order to secure a foothold in the southwestern Pacific. They aim to break through the Philippines or our inner South Seas strongholds in one fell swoop, separating the Japanese mainland from important resource production areas, and thoroughly striking our war power. The enemy's efforts to reverse the advantageous war situation from this perspective are truly fierce to the extreme. They are recklessly sacrificing in their anxiety to achieve their goals at once, and at the same time, this anxiety is on the other hand revealing that their domestic situation has become extremely difficult due to repeated defeats and huge losses of human resources. The more anxious the enemy becomes, the greater their losses, and the result they consider most desirable is the result of our best-prepared naval warfare.

Next is the enemy's resistance from the Burma front. Since Lord Mountbatten became commander-in-chief, preparations seem to be underway by land, sea, and air. According to a Washington dispatch from the 5th, a tripartite military guidance conference was held in Chongqing to deliberate on future strategies. But this kind of conference is truly a common tactic of the enemy, just like what military strategists have said since ancient times, "Be cautious in warfare, do not rush into battle." They have been clamoring for a large-scale beginning as soon as the rainy season is over, but to this day, their resistance operations have not yet materialized.

However, aerial warfare on this front is gradually becoming more intense. On October 10th in the past, they launched a large-scale attack on Rangoon with over a hundred aircraft. And since September, they have increased from 1,000 aircraft to 1,600. The main purpose is to disrupt our rear or supply lines with all their strength, or to repeatedly blindly bomb undefended cities. Apart from killing innocent civilians, it does no damage to our military.

In the operations on this front, our elite army air forces are always on duty in Burma, French Indochina, Thailand, and Malaya, covering this vast area, constantly providing air defense, preemptively striking, destroying the enemy air force, or thwarting the enemy's plans.

As for large-scale enemy resistance, it is believed that it is difficult for the enemy as well. Firstly, the terrain is complex, and secondly, supplies are difficult. Especially the most important problem is the command of the three countries, England, America, and China, which are completely different in nature. In this war, the position of Chen Cheng's Chongqing army is most noteworthy.

On the 10th of last month, Chongqing held the first send-off party for Indian conscripts, sending 400 conscripts over 158 cm tall and weighing over 84 kg to India for training. This event was heavily publicized. Like this, for the sake of destroying the eternal peace of Greater East Asia and freeing themselves from the everlasting suffering of the loss of their own land and people, what kind of feelings should those conscripts who have especially rushed to distant India have in their hearts?

As you all know, India has a population of over 400 million. If England and America want to, they might still have a chance if they appeal to these people to some extent. But a large portion of the Indian people are suffering from irremediable hunger and hardship; it can be said that they are starving everywhere. It is truly because of Britain's evil policies that they have turned the birthplace of Buddhism into a hell of suffering. On the one hand, the conscientious people of India are wholeheartedly following the grand declaration issued by Chandra Bose's Provisional Government of India, but under the oppression of the Americans and British before their eyes, even if their hearts do not comply, they can only superficially submit. At this time, the Americans and British are not making their own citizens shed a single drop of blood, but instead, from the standpoint of local supply, they are using the people of India and Chongqing to create a blast shield in front, while they themselves, well-fed and warmly clothed, are smoking, drinking, and plotting to advance toward seizing China's concessions. Those conscripts selected in Chongqing are all extremely excellent in intelligence and physical strength. We truly do not know the true intentions of Chongqing in having them carry out the destruction of Greater East Asia. We especially cannot help but sympathize with the parents, siblings, and relatives of these truly honest young people.

Since ancient times, it has been said that "do not start an army without a justifiable cause for the great righteousness of China." It is truly unnecessary to say more about the incomprehensible act of causing innocent young people to shed blood for a war without a cause. The preemptive attacks by the forces in the India-Burma area were repelled to the east bank of the Nu River, and their boasted cooperation with England and America has also collapsed. (The following continues in the fourth section.)

### Director of the Press Department, Mr. Mishina's Speech at the National Propaganda Conference: Two Great Victories and the Fate of the Greater East Asia Ethnic Group

Central News Agency – Mr. Mishina, Director of the Press Department of the Japanese Dispatch Army Headquarters in China, delivered a speech at the Second National Propaganda Conference, the main points of which are as follows:

In the past twenty days, we have recorded two great victories in history in both spiritual and material aspects. One is the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and the other is the results of the several naval air battles of Bougainville Island. Two years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Under this great war of Greater East Asia, the ten million people of Greater East Asia, in order to break free from the shackles of England and America, and seeking to build a unified ideal in the ideals and wills of Asia, have revealed to the world in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The five major principles contained therein clearly indicate the path for all of humanity to advance to a new civilization and peace. We know clearly that there is no point in comparing the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration with the countless deceptive and fraudulent declarations and statements issued by the Anglo-American camp. However, we feel regret that as a member of Greater East Asia, someone who should bear the responsibility and glory of building Greater East Asia actually flattered the Anglo-American hypocritical and empty declarations and deliberately defamed the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. We find this attitude of that party regrettable in terms of Asian morality.

Looking at the first article of the Joint Declaration regarding the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity in East Asia, it states that "Greater East Asian countries jointly ensure the stability of Greater East Asia, and based on morality, establish an order of coexistence and co-prosperity." Sun Yat-sen, the Father of China, also said, "To realize Pan-Asianism, we must base ourselves on our country's inherent culture, which is morality, which is benevolence and righteousness." This principle of coexistence and co-prosperity coincides with the thought of Sun Yat-sen, the Father of China. This solemn fact cannot be denied by anyone.

Furthermore, the second article regarding the principle of autonomy, independence, and amity states that "Greater East Asian countries mutually respect their autonomy and independence, seek mutual assistance and harmony, and establish amity in Greater East Asia." This is what is said in "China's Destiny": "The freedom of Asian nations and the equality of countries are the guarantee of world peace forever (omitted). The principles of national freedom and national equality should apply to the peaceful international organization after the war. The League of Nations established after the First World War failed mainly because it obliterated this principle. The concepts of so-called 'world powers' or 'spheres of influence' and the systems formed by these concepts should no longer be seen in the equal international organization after the Second World War." This genuine desire for national freedom and equality is the principle of mutual respect and amity among Greater East Asian countries, and it cannot be concealed.

Furthermore, the third article regarding the principle of promoting East Asian culture states that "Greater East Asian countries mutually respect their traditions, develop the creativity of each nation, and illuminate the culture of Greater East Asia." How should we observe the principle of mutual respect for traditions and promoting culture? "China's Destiny" said that "the freedom and independence of national states in world culture takes the freedom and independence of culture as an essential element." Therefore, should we seek the ideal of national culture from the democratic civilization of England and America, or should we seek it from the inherent Kingly Way of the East's principles of governance and peace?

Next, the fourth article regarding the principle of economic cooperation and prosperity states that "Greater East Asian countries, under mutual benefit, closely cooperate, develop their common economy, and increase the prosperity of Greater East Asia." This is the principle of developing the economy and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia.

Furthermore, the fifth article regarding the principle of contributing to the progress of the world states that "Greater East Asian countries increase friendship among nations, eliminate racial discrimination, universally communicate culture, and further develop resources, in order to contribute to the development of the world." This is the principle of contributing to the development of the world. Comparing this with the principles of "equal rights for all countries to trade and access world resources" and "achieving a free world" in the so-called Atlantic Charter of England and America, what is the difference between their ideals and reality?

Think about which country erected high tariff barriers, hindered and oppressed Japan's peaceful trade, and dared to carry out economic severance. Which country used conspiracies to monopolize the colonial resources of countries in the Western Hemisphere. Looking at the elimination of racial discrimination, England and America loudly chant freedom and peace, and claim to guarantee the healthy and peaceful lives of all nations, but look at the cruel and blatant discriminatory treatment of black people, and their unbreakable discriminatory views and contempt for colored people in Asia. Even without Lin Yutang's warning, it is clear. Therefore, hoping that England and America will have a change of heart, abolish unequal treaties, and abolish the laws prohibiting Chinese immigration is a pathetic delusion. The utilitarian worldview of the Anglo-Saxon people is an incurable flaw that can never be removed, and their multi-faceted treacherous diplomacy is a well-known fact. Their conspiracy to dominate Asia again and control China has shed the old guise and is using a unique and cunning new means, namely, "forming an American mixed air force" and "completely controlling the air force of that party" and "lending money to that party to dominate its financial economy as a semi-colony." Comparing this with the fundamental ideas and honest and decisive construction and practice of our Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and even the fact that the Papuan people are participating in politics, the difference is like heaven and earth.

From this perspective, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is the way of the King, fair and just. It is an immortal international charter that will change the history of the world, and it is something that everyone's conscience cannot help but affirm. Now, let us turn to the results of the several naval air battles of Bougainville Island. We have the right to demand accurate observation and judgment from the world.

We have warned that before the counterattacks of the anti-Axis forces reach a certain line, they will encounter the defense line of our mighty Greater East Asia. The larger and more intense the scale of their counterattacks, the more certain they will suffer a tragic fate of enormous consumption and annihilation. Their so-called counterattack on Burma, counterattack on the Pacific, and even the widely publicized East Asia offensive are an excellent opportunity for us to encircle and annihilate the enemy that we have been seeking. What fate will the great war power and material power boasted by England and America meet in East Asia? They themselves will experience it, and this has already been foretold. And the several naval air battles of Bougainville Island are truly a painful experience for the American side.

In addition to sinking or destroying their six battleships and eight aircraft carriers, by the fifth air battle, the enemy had lost over one hundred and thirty ships, over five hundred and thirty aircraft, and no fewer than 20,000 troops, showing that they have paid a high price. Indeed, the East Asia counterattack of England and America cannot be considered to have been thwarted at this point. Their reckless counterattack will still rely on their sole advantage of "quantity" and continue to unfold. However, what do the results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters sufficiently prove? That is, the victory or defeat of modern warfare is by no means a matter of luck, but is determined by the gathering of the total power of the nation. The announcement of these results directly demonstrates the superiority of Japan's war power and human resources, and proves the victory of Japan's domestic aviation technology, the establishment of planned production, and the ability to adapt to the enemy's quantitative counterattacks and complete the domestic wartime system. The observation that Japan's war power is declining and its national strength will develop flaws is a misunderstanding of the essence of the Japanese national polity and the vitality of the Japanese people. To still cling to their prejudice, to observe with a slant eye, is truly to be called "intellectual and personality bankrupts" who are not worthy of speaking about the Greater East Asian national renaissance. Therefore, it is foolish and pitiable to rely on "a joint war with England and America," "a counterattack on Burma," and "a four-nation joint declaration" to dream of winning the war and entrust themselves to postwar construction. A nation's revolution can only be completed with complete autonomy and independence and the unification of the nation within the country. This is the unchangeable truth of ancient and modern times. At this current stage of human history, in this environment of national survival, the one who can control fate without chaos is the one who has a clear understanding of ancient and modern times and a steadfast, unwavering faith.

The above is said to commemorate two great common victories sent to the East Asia War, sufficient to enable the Greater East Asian countries and peoples, and the leading pioneers, to gain a victory in the overall war for their future joint construction. We firmly believe that the fate of the Greater East Asia ethnic group will be able to obtain the glory of victory.

### The German Army in Zhitomir Advances Sixty Li; Soviet Army Launches Diversionary Offensive

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Huitong News Agency, the Soviet army launched a vigorous attack from both the north and south yesterday, attempting to cut off the German forces in the bend of the Dnieper River. With the assistance of aircraft, the German army crushed two Soviet tank units and eight to ten infantry divisions. When the Soviet army attacked the German bridgeheads in Nikopol and northwest and north of Krivoy Rog, they pushed southwest toward Dnepropetrovsk with tank units. On the broad front, the Soviet army only broke through the German lines east of Vasilyevka and is currently being encircled. To the west, fierce fighting is taking place for the road between Zhitomir and Kiev. After heavy rain, the road is almost impassable. Although the Soviet army laid mines, the German army continues to advance. According to military sources, with the efforts of engineers, they have advanced to about 60 kilometers east of Zhitomir. Southwest of the confluence of the Pripyat and Dnieper rivers, fierce battles continue despite the adverse weather. The Korosten area is particularly intense.

Stockholm and Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The German army's counter-offensive on the Eastern Front has improved the situation in the Kiev sector. Fighting there remains fierce. At the same time, the Soviet army launched a major offensive in the Dnieper River bend area, attempting to break through the German lines at Krivoy Rog, Dnepropetrovsk, and Nikopol in one fell swoop. However, the German army immediately launched a fierce counterattack, resulting in fierce fighting. The German army destroyed 247 Soviet tanks, completely halting the Soviet advance. In the Zaporozhye area, the Soviet army is conducting a river crossing operation on the Dnieper River and is continuously reinforcing the west bank. The aim of this Soviet move is clearly to divert the German army's counter-offensive in Zhitomir.

Soviet Army's Landing Attempt in Kosh Failed

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Military sources report that the Soviet army attempted a landing from the Eltyngen bridgehead south of Kerch the night before last. This was the first landing attempt by the Soviet army in several days, with the aim of reinforcing the Soviet forces there with troops and equipment. That night and the next day, under the protection of gunboats, the Soviet army used 20 transport ships to attempt a landing, but they were repulsed by the German army. Three Soviet ships were sunk, and only three reached their destination.

### Lebanese President Reinstated; Arrested Cabinet Members Released; French High Commissioner Recalled

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from Algiers: The French rebel party held a special meeting in North Africa yesterday and decided to reinstate Lebanese President Bechara El Khoury and release the cabinet members detained by the Petain authorities. This decision was advocated by the French rebel party's commissioner for Lebanon, Catroux. The Petain authorities took this step because of British intervention and the possibility of avoiding an outbreak of conflict. The Arabs in the Middle East and the British are extremely incompatible, which is brewing a revolutionary trend, and King Farouk of Egypt and Prime Minister Nahas are both sympathetic to the Arabs.

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency, Algiers issued a communiqué yesterday stating that the Algiers Committee has ordered the recall of the French High Commissioner for Lebanon, Helleu.

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: Petain's Information Commissioner Peyrouton, after the special meeting of the Algiers Committee yesterday, declared to reporters that the first step in resolving the Lebanese issue will surely satisfy Britain. The Algiers Committee was not subjected to external pressure! All resolutions! are made voluntarily by the committee. The restoration of the Lebanese constitution will be a prerequisite for future agreements, but elections will not be held.

### Members of European Commission from Britain and the Soviet Union Determined

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a Huitong News Agency report from London: The British Soviet expert Sir David Kelly will be appointed as the British representative to the European Commission and will be awarded the title of ambassador.

Ankara, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: The Supreme Soviet has appointed the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Gusev, as the Soviet representative to the Allied Special Advisory Committee in London.

### Turkish Government Informs Britain of its Position

Istanbul, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: Turkey's response to the British note has been delivered to the British government by Ambassador Ruşen Eşref Ünaydın. The note elaborates on Turkey's attitude towards the various issues discussed by Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu and British Foreign Secretary Eden in Cairo, detailing the Turkish official attitude as explained during the Turkish People's Party meeting debates and the Turkish Foreign Minister's report.

### Italian Army Reorganized; Blackshirt Legion Established; Diamanti Appointed Commander

Rome, 22nd (Central News Agency) - A report from the German News Agency: After the reorganization of the army under the Italian Republican Fascist government, the Fascist militia was merged with other units, such as the gendarmerie, to become the National Guard of the Republic, which is placed under the command of Lieutenant General Risi, the former militia commander. Among them, a portion of the militia has been integrated into the Republican army, while another Blackshirt legion has been organized. Mussolini intends to make this legion the elite of the entire army, recruiting the best elements from all over Italy. Therefore, this legion will be the backbone of the Italian Republican National Guard. Mussolini has appointed General Diamanti as the commander of the legion. It is noted that Diamanti participated in World War I and the Abyssinian War and commanded the Blackshirts in that campaign. In this war, he fought in Greece and on the Eastern Front. In addition to the Iron Cross, Diamanti has also received three other gallantry awards.

### Bulgarian Military Mission Visits Ankara

Istanbul, 22nd (Central News Agency) - A Bulgarian military mission, invited by the Turkish government, arrived in Ankara on the 20th.

### Lithuania Rises Up Against the Soviets

Kaunas, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: The Chairman of the Lithuanian Defense Committee, Kubiliūnas, delivered a speech to the workers yesterday, emphasizing that the Lithuanian people will resolutely fight to the death rather than become people of the Soviet Union again. The pain of the Soviet invasion of Lithuania in 1939 is still fresh in the people's memory, and they will never allow the Soviet army to occupy Lithuania again.

### General Göring Inspects the Ruhr

Essen, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: German General Göring inspected the Ruhr area and gave a speech to the workers, saying: The day of our revenge on the enemy is approaching, so we can guarantee that there will be a day when we can remove the burden of air raids. Labor strikes occur frequently in enemy countries, but German workers can all remain loyal to their posts and serve the country, regardless of the difficulties caused by air raids.

### German Forces in Eastern Italy Conduct Defensive Warfare, Firmly Defending the Left Bank of the Sangro River

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The German Führer's headquarters announced the situation in the Southern Theater at noon on the 21st as follows: There is only activity of artillery and reconnaissance units between the German army and the anti-Axis forces, and the battle situation is still stable. The anti-Axis forces attempted to capture a German position in a certain location in the Eastern Theater and launched an offensive. On the Sangro River front, the German army inflicted heavy damage on the repeatedly attacking superior anti-Axis forces, after which they withdrew to the rear of the Sangro River.

### Winter Relief Fundraising Committee Holds First Meeting; Fundraising Goal Initially Set at 10 Million Yuan

Central News Agency Report - The winter relief effort in this city this year, since the Winter Relief Fundraising Committee's active efforts, has set its fundraising goal at 10 million yuan as a standard. With the onset of the cold winter, in order to complete the winter relief mission, the fundraising work needs to be expanded. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Winter Relief Fundraising Committee held its first meeting of fundraising committee members and team leaders at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. The meeting was presided over by Chen Gongbo, the concurrent chief captain, and Ding Mocun and Zhao Xunyue, the concurrent deputy chief captains. More than 300 team leaders attended, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Details are recorded as follows:

More Than 300 Team Leaders Attended

In addition to the attendance of Chief Captain Chen, Deputy Chief Captains Ding and Zhao, the standing committee members and staff members Li Sihao, Shao Shijun, Wu Yunzhai, Wu Songgao, Lin Kanghou, Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, Sun Mingqi, Sun Lifu, Ling Xianwen, Geng Jiaji, Sheng Youyi, Huang Jinrong (represented by Long Tianjian), Wen Lantin, Pei Yunqing, Zhao Jinqing, Qian Dade, etc., and the committee members and team leaders Ding Fangyuan, Ding Houqing, Wang Boyuan, Wang Jingxian, Wang Yongkang, Wang Weiguan, Wang Shuxian, Ba Lingyun, Gan Dounan, Shi Yongsai, Zhu Senlin, Jiang Shangda, Zhu Chuanquan, Zhu Shunlin, Zhu Yinjiang, Shen Siliang, Shen Weiting, Shen Jinzhou, Shen Weiya, Li Zulie, Li Wenjie, Li Tianzhen, Wang Zhenhuan, He Wuliang, He Zhuoxian, Han Zhongfu, Wu Chenxiu, Du Huafang, Zhou Youchang, Zhou Bangjun, Jin Zongcheng, Lin Zhaopin, Song Jingze, Hu Zhonggeng, Xia Shikui, Xu Tieshan, Xu Maotang, Xu Langxi, Chen Fukang, Chen Shaofu, Chen Zhongnan, Chen Shui Li, Qin Runchang, Lu Wenshao, Guo Shun, Ku Linshuang, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Guanqun, Xu Jianhong, Zhang Rongchu, Zhang Yipeng, Zhang Deqin, Huang Jiangquan, Huang Zhensheng, Xiang Kangyuan, Ye Juexiao, Pan Yangyao, Pan Xusheng, Liu Yangshan, Zan Yanfang, Qian Zongfan, Xie Xiaochu, Feng Wenguang, Yan Chuntang, and more than 300 others attended.

Focusing Efforts on Promoting Relief

The meeting was chaired by Chief Captain Chen, with Hu Shiqi and Si Manyue recording. First, Chairman Chen reported on the purpose of convening the meeting today and the intention to unify the fundraising of charitable funds in the future. Starting today with winter relief, the initial fundraising goal for this year is set at 10 million yuan. If there are surplus funds raised, they will be designated for next year's winter relief expenses. He hoped that influential figures in this city would take more responsibility and enthusiastically support the effort. Next, Deputy Chief Captain Ding reported that raising funds for winter relief is part of social welfare undertakings. In the past, fundraising was often done independently, with each entity acting on its own, which often led to difficulties. After the establishment of the Social Welfare Funding Committee this time, this year's winter relief fundraising, under the initiation of the municipal government and the committee, established a Winter Relief Fundraising Committee to concentrate efforts, enabling unification and specialized handling. Cooperation is also relied upon in terms of work, and it is hoped that influential figures in this city will provide more assistance. Subsequently, Deputy Chief Captain Zhao reported that the relief work in the future has been prepared and will be carried out with a focused spirit to achieve satisfactory results, and he hoped for guidance and assistance at any time. Finally, team leader representatives Wen Lantin, Li Sihao, and Zhang Yipeng successively delivered speeches, deeply hoping that everyone present would work hard and take responsibility for fundraising. 369 donation booklets were distributed, with each team's fundraising goal set at 50,000 yuan as a standard, with more being better. The fundraising period is limited to the end of December of this year. The meeting adjourned with refreshments at 4:30 PM.

### From Cultivating Technical Talents to the Question of Apprentices' Education

— Xu Jialing

Amidst this clamor of cultivating technical talents, we have pointed out that the reasons for our technical backwardness are: first, upper-level technical personnel do not seek progress; second, lower-level workers are content with the status quo. But why are lower-level workers content with the status quo? Of course, there are many reasons, but the employer's aversion to workers seeking education is also a major reason.

Of course, it is impossible to seek education during the day because of work. Then, what about at night? Workers should be allowed to study on their own or attend night school, but factories and stores still dislike it. This does not have much impact on workers who can be self-reliant and have more freedom of action. However, it has made it difficult for a group of apprentices who have not yet completed their apprenticeships and a group of trainees who live in the store. But what are the reasons for factories and stores to interfere with apprentices' education?

Let us try to summarize the employer's reasons:

Apprentices who study at night do not get enough sleep, which will inevitably lead to listlessness during the day, or even dozing off, affecting work efficiency.

Apprentices who read and study on their own at night will inevitably consume more electricity.

Apprentices who return to the store after 10:00 PM will disturb the sleep of others.

Apprentices who go out frequently are prone to cheating.

Apprentices may use the excuse of studying to go out at will for improper entertainment.

We do not deny their reasons, but let us think about it.

Returning to the factory at 10:00 PM and studying for one hour, waking up at 6:00 AM the next morning, totals seven hours of sleep, only one hour short of the standard sleep time. For those who are physically strong, it will often have no impact. Even if the factory believes that eight hours of sleep is necessary, then it can allow them to sleep immediately after returning, so there is no need to worry about insufficient sleep. Moreover, due to the increase in apprentices' knowledge, it is beneficial to the progress of affairs, so will the efficiency of work not increase instead?

As for the electricity bill, I think that for a factory or store of this size, it should not be too calculating about the small cost of one or two hours of electricity. Even if the factory believes that it must be calculated, then it can simply require the apprentices to sleep as soon as they return, or the apprentices can get up early to study on their own. Otherwise, the apprentices can be asked to reimburse the electricity bill on a monthly basis. But how can there be such a store owner in the world? I think.

The store owner's reasons are too selfish, so he uses the safety of the entire dormitory's workers as an excuse. But what is the truth? Because the workers have the same unfortunate experiences, they have a deep understanding of each other, so the feelings are very good. They will never interfere with a colleague studying (unless there are a few jealous people with ulterior motives). This is a kind of human nature - compassion. Moreover, doing homework is not fooling around and must make a lot of noise. The most obvious thing is that the library is much quieter than the hotel. Even if the store is still worried, then it can just let them sleep as soon as they return.

As for cheating, this is a question of the apprentice's character. The store owner should of course look at the apprentice's character before taking in an apprentice. Who would want to take in a bad apprentice? Cheating is a crime. Why would a good, free person want to commit a crime? What kind of person commits a crime? Is it those who seek to improve themselves who are willing to commit crimes? Moreover, school is a place to cultivate good character!

As for apprentices using the excuse of studying to engage in improper entertainment, this point is more likely. The apprentice says to the factory that he is studying, and to the school, he says that he is busy with factory affairs. So, after arranging everything on both sides, he lives a debauched life. However, this point is not unavoidable. As long as the factory and the school have close contact, the school can often send people to visit the factory, and at the same time, the factory can often inquire with the school. In this way, not only can the students complete good character and academics under the cooperation of the school and the factory, but also promote direct contact and cooperation between the school and the business community.

In our country, the number of apprentices is quite astonishing. Among this group of pitiful comrades, perhaps there are many buried geniuses. I hope that employers can try their best to change their past attitudes and encourage self-study and education, so that this group of gold in the mud can be unearthed. Then, in the near future, the technical talents of the Republic of China will not have to worry about being few and inferior.

Due to the employer's encouragement of education, I think that the lower-level workers' contentment with the status quo will definitely be quickly eliminated. At the same time, because of the lower-level personnel's increased skills, they will force the upper-level personnel to seek further progress. With the promotion at each level, who says our country has no hope?

Review of Improving the Child Labor System

The issue of child labor is an economic problem that economists in various countries pay close attention to, but in our country, very few people pay attention to this problem. Our country's child labor system is prevalent in society, and its malpractices are more severe than in other countries in the world. Under the current "production first" wartime situation, the prevalence of child labor directly hinders production, so we have the inevitability of bringing it up for review.

Child labor originated very early, and its main cause is poverty. The earliest child laborers only helped with simple tasks in the family, learning and being taught at the same time, accompanied by their parents, so the harm was relatively small. Since the Industrial Revolution, child laborers have been sent from home to society. These underage laborers are favored by employers with lower standards. Because child laborers have no labor unions to back them, they will not strike, and their wages can be suppressed to be lower than those of adults. The above two reasons have caused the extreme development of the child labor system.

The development of child labor is harmful and unhelpful to production, children, society, the country, and so on. Its main drawbacks are five: Child laborers engage in monotonous work for more than ten hours a day, and their physical and mental strength is damaged. Illiteracy accounts for nine out of ten, and in the future, they are very likely to commit crimes and engage in behaviors that are detrimental to society. The increase in child laborers increases labor competition, and capitalists use this point to reduce wages, making the lives of laborers more difficult. Laborers cannot satisfy their basic needs, and their work efficiency will inevitably decrease. It destroys children's physical and mental health, thus hindering their development and easily producing bad citizens. Child laborers are "cheap labor" rather than "economic labor." Because child laborers often lack skills, they easily waste materials and machines. Child laborers lose both school education and family education, which easily leads to moral decline, weak will, and a lack of equal concepts.

Due to economic poverty in our country, the possibility of completely abolishing child labor is extremely small. Now, the main points of improving child labor are proposed for reference by those who care about the welfare of child labor: The authorities should prohibit children under the age of fourteen from working, and the work of children over the age of fourteen should not exceed half that of adults. Children who are physically weak or have diseases should not be allowed to work. The working hours should not exceed six hours. Implement factory inspections, and business owners who violate the provisions of the law should be severely punished. Establish charitable education, widely establish compulsory schools, so that the general poor children can enjoy the right to education. Establish children's libraries and other children's welfare undertakings, such as student loans, children's free hospitals, etc. Socially knowledgeable people should spread the weakness of the child labor system, so that capitalists will not harm the progress of the entire society because of petty greed, and employers should be made to cooperate with society.

In short, the improvement of the child labor system requires the voluntary promotion of capitalists. Otherwise, the future masters of the country will be forever cruelly destroyed!

### "Gentleman on the Beam" Premieres Early; "Gone With the Wind" Last Three Days

The Kuguan Theater Troupe, with its strong strength and grand momentum, is holding a long-term charity performance for the student aid fund of this newspaper at the Paris Grand Theater. The first hit, "Gone With the Wind" ( "Gone With the Wind"), has achieved satisfactory results and will be discontinued on the 24th. Until today, there are only the last three days left.

The third charity performance of Kuguan, "Gentleman on the Beam," written and directed by Zuo Lin, consists of three acts and is a great farce. It is now scheduled to premiere nationwide on the night of the 26th of this month (Friday). These days, the backstage of the Paris Grand Theater is extremely tense due to the preparation of the new play, and this new play ("Gentleman on the Beam") is an extremely large scene that requires a lot of effort.

Mr. Zuo Lin is a specialist in directing who studied in England (in the Chinese theater industry, he can be called an expert director, but there are only two or three people). Several plays he directed in Shanghai in the past, such as "Metamorphosis," "Robinson Crusoe," "The Big Circus," and "The Trap," were all sensational for a while. Not only were they admired by the audience, but especially admired by experts. The success of "Gentleman on the Beam" can be imagined. Moreover, the lineup of actors this time is extremely neat. Ms. Danny, who has not appeared in "Gone With the Wind," plays an extremely important role in this play. Shi Yuan, Lin Bin, Bai Mu, etc., have few roles in "Gone With the Wind," and will all show their talents in "Gentleman on the Beam." Shi Hui plays a lawyer who loves to brag, and his personality is undoubtedly more suitable. They are well-matched, creating countless jokes scene after scene, which will give the audience a most pleasant laugh.

The cast of "Gentleman on the Beam" is as follows:

Actor Character Tu, Deputy Patrol Captain Qi Luo

Wang Rui Bai Mu Bao San Shi Yuan

Bai Menglan Wang Jun Mother Zhuang Yan

Ma Luxi Lin Zhen Police Officer A Tian Li

Ai Lan Lin Bin Police Officer B Le

Xia Pingkang Shi Hui Professor Chen Ping

Ai Mei Danny Zhang, Principal English

Economic Commentary

### The Problem of "Convenient Delivery"

Since the resumption of business of the China Merchants Securities Exchange under the order of the Ministry of Finance and Industry, our expectations for the Securities Exchange! Although we have not been able to say everything we want to say, we have said it many times. We have always said: "At this time of social and economic instability, the psychology of the people is mostly inclined to speculation: to seek that securities transactions are not the object of speculation at all may be impossible, but we hope that the government will strengthen its supervision, such as prohibiting futures transactions, such as restricting banks from using stocks as collateral, such as levying securities exchange taxes, all of which are remedies to prevent excessive speculation."

Regarding the "prohibition of futures transactions," at the beginning of the China Merchants Securities Exchange, it was stipulated that only spot transactions were allowed, and no futures trading was allowed at all. In other words, buyers would pay cash for goods, and sellers would take cash for stocks. If brokers engaged in speculative activities such as buying long and selling short, they would be sanctioned in accordance with the regulations once discovered. The original intention of preventing speculation has been clearly revealed. Now, the China Merchants Securities Exchange, in order to seek so-called convenience, has opened a seven-day "convenient delivery" transaction. This method, in order to use securities to make them flexible, may not be criticized, but what the securities market needs to prevent and avoid most is speculative trading of buying long and selling short. In the past, there were many speculators in physical transactions, causing trouble. Now that there are seven days of convenient delivery transactions, it is inevitable that those who short will use the seven days to move time to repeat their profitable tricks, causing the securities market to easily experience unstable fluctuations again. This must be paid close attention to. Based on the saying "preventing problems before they arise", it is best for the Securities Exchange not to "open the door to convenience" and implement the "convenient delivery" new system in an environment where the market is prone to fluctuations. Otherwise, it is necessary to refer to the successful methods of various countries in advance, formulate detailed rules, and not allow those who short to use this activity to shake the position of the securities market, which would be a greater loss than gain!

### "Spot Convenient Delivery" is Still Difficult to Achieve at Present, All Sectors Hope to Announce Market Conditions

Regarding the previous rumor that the China Merchants Securities Exchange planned to "deliver in one week" for futures starting yesterday (22nd), all parties are paying close attention to it. It is recently learned that although the Securities Exchange authorities call this matter "spot convenient delivery", it is actually equivalent to opening a one-week delivery of futures. If they are not careful at the time of opening, they are easily manipulated by speculators, and the phenomenon of buying long and selling short occurs, which affects the entire stock market significantly. Therefore, they have to carefully plan before the trial shooting. Therefore, the statement that it will start yesterday is impossible.

The Municipal Economic Bureau Recovers Licenses Regarding the crackdown on off-exchange transactions of Chinese stocks, the reporter learned that some stock companies still act independently after the opening of the Securities Exchange and engage in off-exchange transactions. This is because these stock companies had previously obtained licenses issued by the Economic Bureau, allowing them to engage in transactions. Although the brokers have been re-verified after the resumption of the Securities Exchange, the licenses of the Municipal Economic Bureau have not been revoked. Therefore, those who hold licenses can continue their independent operations. It is recently learned that the Standing Committee of the Securities Exchange has contacted the Municipal Economic Bureau several times in order to achieve the crackdown on off-exchange transactions. As a result, the Economic Bureau has begun to recover the previously issued licenses. Therefore, off-exchange transactions can be eliminated within days.

Stock Market Conditions Must Be Announced

Regarding the issue of announcing stock market conditions, all parties are also extremely concerned about it. Currently, the market conditions within the Securities Exchange cannot be publicly published in the newspapers. Only a few brokers who can enter the market for transactions can know. All those with a little commercial knowledge will understand the disadvantages of this. Therefore, the Securities Exchange authorities and various industrial and commercial sectors hope that the relevant authorities can reconsider this issue and open it up as soon as possible so that those who buy and sell stocks can know the prices of each stock in detail in the newspapers so that stock brokers cannot easily manipulate them. This will be of great benefit to the stability of the stock market and the proper transaction.

### Uniform Endorsement Checks for All Banks and Firms

Removing the words "or bearer"

For endorsement checks from banks and firms, if the words "or bearer" or "or holder" are formally crossed out, the receiving bank or firm must endorse and guarantee the check according to past practice. However, if the strokes of the name of the person to be paid are partially covered or the words "or bearer" are partially crossed out, it cannot be considered as crossed out. The Bankers Association has notified all banks and firms of this matter. Recently, some member banks believe that if the drawer covers the words "or bearer" with ink when issuing the check, it is considered crossed out by the drawer, but the banks regard it as not crossed out, which is contrary to the drawer's intention. It is difficult to distinguish whether the drawer did it intentionally or unintentionally. Therefore, a letter was sent to the Bankers Association for clarification. The association submitted it to the chairman's meeting for discussion. The main point is whether the numbers "or bearer" are completely crossed out or only partially covered. It is difficult to distinguish between intentional and unintentional. In order to unify the standards, it has been decided that for all endorsement checks, except for those that have completely formally crossed out the words "or bearer", those that have partially covered any one or two of them will not be considered as crossed out. All banks and firms should add a clause in their check regulations for future use, so that drawers know what to pay attention to.

### Candle Industry Group Refines Substitute Raw Materials

The raw materials for candle manufacturing in this city have always been imported from overseas. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source has been cut off. In order to achieve local self-sufficiency, the relevant parties have been trying to refine substitute raw materials from vegetable oil, animal oil, and mineral oil so that the candle manufacturing industry can continue normally. It is recently learned that the Japanese Candle Industry Group, with Fuchang as the center, is massively purchasing and refining this kind of substitute raw material in various regions near the area. Ten thousand dan has been collected, so the supply of candle raw materials is expected to be partially resolved.

### Trends in Chinese Stocks

The China Merchants Securities Exchange has approved the request of various brokers to temporarily postpone the opening of convenient delivery transactions. However, people's hearts are still excited. Yesterday, stocks with small denominations continued to rise in the buying spree. Large denomination old stocks showed a trend of rising first and then falling back. This is because the seven-day convenient delivery was postponed, and buyers were less interested and instead sold off. According to the feelings of various parties, the trend is still mostly upward. The volume of transactions throughout the day was large. The movements of various stocks are recorded below.

Department Stores: Wing On Company opened quite high, then declined slightly, and then stabilized in the afternoon. Sincere was the most sluggish. National Goods rose by about one yuan.

The wind of Baoan Glass also rose, and the buying price has been raised to 25% of the face value. Most of the remaining stocks are tighter than last week.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Public Bonds: Yesterday, it turned weak again and continued to fluctuate. The rise and fall of public prices has almost been confined to a certain range. The previous highest price has not been broken through, and the previous lowest price has not been hit. Therefore, those engaged in this industry are gradually feeling bored. Only a small part of those who still have many long and short positions have settled. Yesterday, the market for Type C opened well, and then gradually declined. There were few twists and turns, and buyers were rare. The final price at noon fell significantly compared with last weekend. Types A, B, D, and E all saw declines. The market for miscellaneous brands has been fluctuating inside and outside the pass.

Call Loan Interest Rate: Yesterday, the Bankers Association's call loan interest rate was 1.7%, which has not changed.

Daily Necessities: Match soap, because both domestic and foreign sales are sluggish, the market is stable and there is no change from last Saturday. The stock of foreign soap is increasingly scarce, and transactions have stagnated.

Cigarettes: The cigarette market was generally sluggish compared to last weekend. Today, because there are inquiries from customers, the price has continued to rise. Yizhong Da Ying, Qianmen, and Lao Dao are still stable. The national cigarette brand Meili is exceptionally beautiful; the Japanese cigarette brand Quanlu, Jinqiang, is not needed in the market, and the price has fallen.

Food: Retail is still good, and all parties are quite optimistic about the future of people's food. There are few aggressive buyers, and most retail investors are selling off at discounted prices. Oil traders have all retreated into the pass and have fallen several levels compared to before. Oilseed trading is as idle as before, and the market is sluggish.

Southern Goods: Dried longan, lychee, and other miscellaneous goods mostly rely on drums. In the past, transportation between Zhangzhou and drums was intermittent, and there was no arrival for a long time. According to customer information, the freight rate at the source has increased by several hundred yuan, and the exchange rate has also shrunk, and the cost is still rising. However, the Shanghai market is weakening due to reduced inventory. In addition, the mooncakes have been lacking in arrival for a long time, and most of the inventory is of poor quality. Yesterday, it was heard that hundreds of pieces have arrived, and according to information, the goods are good and should meet the standards.

### Speech by Department Chief Matsushima (Translated from the Second Edition)

In the meantime, Chongqing repeatedly sought help from the British forces in eastern India, but they remained coldly indifferent, which gradually aroused great resentment among the Chongqing troops. Based on this fact alone, one can clearly understand the true intentions of the British and Americans. They only use East Asian peoples when it suits them. Once it's disadvantageous, they ignore them. This is very obvious. No, they are like this even among allies. Just like during the Dunkirk defeat, the British army sacrificed the allied Dutch and Belgian forces to quickly escape back to their home country. Furthermore, officers and above were even rewarded for their skillful retreat. No, furthermore, even within the same country's armed forces, the navy and the army or air force are constantly fighting. This is also something that cannot be forgotten. The Chongqing army disregards past history and the nature of the British and Americans, stubbornly cooperating with them, stubbornly digging their own grave. It is truly pathetic. Resistance in the direction of Burma faces the many difficulties mentioned above. On land, our elite army units continue their undefeated deployment. At the same time, when necessary, the elite of the navy can cover the sea and air to annihilate attacking forces. Therefore, their attacks will ultimately hasten the early demise of the British and Americans themselves. It is even easier to judge that the Chongqing army, in particular, will be placed in the most miserable fate.

Of course, based on the progression of the war, some of the British and American fleets or part of the troops in North Africa will move towards India. But this is not worth worrying about at all. We believe that the enemy sees the Mediterranean and the seas of Greater East Asia as being in completely different environments. This will soon become clear. Even if the British and American forces' maneuvers in the Mediterranean, which is practically devoid of naval power, may be very easy, it should be understood that the terrain of India and Burma and the existence of our navy are completely different from their situation. Moreover, just like the recent naval air battle off Bougainville Island, we can easily shatter the enemy's battleships and aircraft carriers into layers on the seabed with just a few naval aircraft. Judging from this, no matter what kind of fleet they send, we should actually celebrate.

Secondly, our forces in the New Guinea area, after transferring from some bases to strategic key points, the enemy attacked the Finschhafen area from the north. A fierce land battle unfolded, echoing the air war. Remarkable results are developing. We believe that the enemy's plan is probably to break through the Philippine Islands from the center of New Guinea, or our important resource production areas in the East Indies. However, as soon as the British and Americans approach us, the outcome of their fate can be immediately determined.

In the Banda Sea area, enemy planes often come to invade, but each time they fail to achieve any results and suffer great losses before retreating.

Next, regarding the China front, recently the American air force in China (the Fourteenth Air Force) has often appeared over the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and in South China, conducting blind bombing or machine-gun strafing. However, the damage they inflict on innocent Chinese civilians is dozens of times greater than the damage suffered by our military facilities. This has been repeatedly reported in newspapers. Recently, Chongqing senators Zhang Zhongren and Leng [blank] and others contacted influential figures in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces regarding the actions of the American air force against Chinese civilians, and submitted a petition to Chongqing. There are facts about Chongqing detaining this petition.

According to the British government's announcement on the 5th, Wyatt was recently appointed as a special military representative stationed in Chongqing, and Churchill and the Supreme Commander of Southeast Asia, Mountbatten. Regardless of who they appoint, in short, we cannot allow the existence of the British and American forces who indiscriminately oppress the territory and people of China without reason.

Next, let's talk about the propaganda of the British and Americans. The propaganda of the British and Americans is always absurd. Compared to Chongqing's exaggeration of "three thousand feet of white hair," it is even more skillful. You all know this very clearly because you are in charge of this kind of thing. In particular, in order to deceive their own people regarding the recent war situation in the Pacific, they have reported many shockingly fictitious facts. Ever since the results of our navy's victory in the air battle of Bougainville Island were announced, the world has been shocked by the power of our naval aircraft. After receiving this report, US Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters that this was completely fictitious. But in fact, since the naval battle of Mono Island on October 27, in just fourteen days, we have established a record of sinking or destroying 77 ships or more, from battleships and aircraft carriers to large cruisers, and shooting down or destroying more than 530 aircraft. Yet the US Navy continues to make small-scale announcements as usual, saying that they have lost three destroyers in the South Pacific.

It is very doubtful how long this kind of deception of the people can continue. In this war, at least 10,000 American soldiers have fallen. If things are like this, there is simply no possibility of success. We feel great sympathy for the families of these soldiers.

However, the event that can clearly demonstrate the facts is that after our headquarters announced it, President Roosevelt immediately summoned Joint Fleet Commander King and Chief of Staff Marshall and Air Force Commander Arnold to the White House. We don't know why they held an emergency summit. Their agitation is truly difficult to conceal. People in the American government and public are monitoring this unclear secret of the White House, waiting for it to be exposed in broad daylight. At the same time, it is said that the American officers' families are also urging the authorities to release the truth.

The British and Americans, while heartlessly doing untruthful things, extend their unreasonable desires. After all, their true intention is to control the world based on individualistic ideas. No justice or humanity can be found anywhere in their actions. They have used deception and co-option for a long time to monopolize the world's wealth and prosperity. They are about to have their masks torn off and exposed in the broad daylight. To tear this apart, to crush this, to enable the world to practice the justice of heaven and earth, this is the true spirit of building Greater East Asia. All of this is included in the five articles of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration announced to the world at this Greater East Asia Conference. From any point of view, these five principles are not as self-serving, monopolistic, and exclusive as the Monroe Doctrine. They respect themselves, and at the same time, with family-like kinship, they are building a paradise ruled by benevolence and righteousness in Greater East Asia.

This great spirit has been condensed from the sincerity of Japan since its founding. It has been accomplished in this era and has been embodied. This is a point recognized by the representatives of all countries participating in the Greater East Asia Conference. In order to carry out this spirit, the Greater East Asia War was launched. For a long time, under the shackles of the British and Americans, ignoring God-given freedom and independence, we have walked a path of obscurity. All our friendly nations can rise up suddenly and fight for the liberation of Asia and for the independence of Asia. What a noble war this is. The spirits of our ancestors in heaven are pleased. Heaven is watching us. Our descendants have entrusted the fate of our rise and fall to us now, and are waiting for the outcome of the war. When the war is successful, what will be realized in Greater East Asia will be the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss where heavenly flowers shine in the three thousand great thousand worlds. When the war is defeated, what will be left is the desolate East Asian landscape that has already died.

Will the British and Americans, who intend to conquer and oppress the peoples of Greater East Asia and turn them into colonies, win, or will the war for Greater East Asia, where all nations coexist and prosper, win? The advantage of heaven has already been illuminated by the gods. To combine the advantage of location and the harmony of people to win the final victory is the responsibility of the Greater East Asian people from now on. The Greater East Asia War is the war of the Greater East Asian people. Countries other than Japan and China must not be considered third parties.

Just as I was starting this article, the good news of the fourth naval battle of Bougainville Island arrived. No, no matter how many wars there are in the future, our victory must be carried through to the end. Victory is not only the responsibility of Japan. It must become the responsibility and belief of China and the other countries of Greater East Asia. You, every time we hear the battle situation from the front lines, we feel painfully that the enemy is also continuing to wage desperate battles. The brave and valiant battles of Germany in Western Europe will surely echo the victories in the Pacific and achieve their final goal.

Why are we still talking about how, during the Three-Power Conference, we responded to the Four-Power Declaration? It is because our inevitable iron fire and the raging fire of the Greater East Asian national spirit will burn everything to ashes. This flame of justice is now burning fiercely in the hearts of a billion Asian people. This flame of the soul obscures the sky, and the day of the British and American allied forces descending [blank] is gradually approaching.

At this time, the Kuomintang government held a propaganda conference to convey this great righteousness to the world's nations, which is truly of great significance.

In order to establish justice that shines on the world, Japan and China must not regard any suffering as suffering, but must move forward on the path of selfless progress as the center of Greater East Asia. Thank you for listening. (The End)

Health Association Responds to Teachers' Medical Aid Fund

The Shanghai Health Association wrote: "Recently, the medical problem has become increasingly serious. If wage earners unfortunately fall ill, they feel overwhelmed by the burden.

For valuable medicines, a loan system is used to serve the public, so that the aid funds can flow continuously and inexhaustibly.

Ding Fu Lao Benefits Teachers

Your newspaper spares no effort in helping primary school teachers get free medical treatment. I, Fu Bao, was also weak and ill 40 years ago. Later, I used various natural therapies to become healthy and strong. I know a little about conditioning, and now, in order to serve society, any primary school teacher who suffers from malnutrition, anemia, qi deficiency, or neurasthenia, or has internal organ problems, or does not respond to injections or medication, please go to the Shen Bao office to obtain a medical examination voucher and come to my clinic. Perhaps they can be cured without medicine, using my health and longevity method. If they are determined and persevering, they will surely achieve the goal of preventing illness and staying healthy, without a doubt. Ding Yi Fu Bao respectfully
