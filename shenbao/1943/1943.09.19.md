### On Chinese Cuisine

— Yoshida Toyosuke

In Japan, there is a strange group of "China experts" who believe, with the absolute certainty of Japanese psychology, that the character and habits of the Chinese are incomprehensible. They say that Chinese people are the kind of people who want to eat anything that grows or lives on the ground. The evidence they cite: for example, cat meat and dog meat, which Japanese people find repulsive, are considered "home-cooked meals" by Chinese people. Even more terrifying, they say, is the practice of holding a live monkey and drinking its brains, or coating live baby mice with honey and eating them whole, head to tail, without hesitation. Before I came to Shanghai, I somewhat believed what these "China experts" said. However, after actually coming to Shanghai, I found that this was not the case. The food eaten by most Chinese people is not particularly different from that of the Japanese. Seeing cats and dogs jumping around on the streets, it was clear that they had not been eaten up, so I felt a slight discrepancy with what I had heard in the past.

However, what is still surprising is the large quantity and variety of dishes served at banquets. The saying "Humans are omnivorous animals" can only be fully expressed without regret in Chinese cuisine. Of course, the characteristic of being omnivorous is not unique to humans, but also to pigs, bears, ducks, etc., but they are far behind humans in terms of the variety of foods they consume. Even among humans, those who reach the level of the Chinese are still very few. Therefore, the Chinese boast that the variety and deliciousness of Chinese cuisine is the best in the world. However, among the Chinese, many people have noticed that intertwined with the great variety of Chinese cuisine is China's five thousand-year history of famine. Lin Yutang once said: "China is overpopulated, and famine is extremely common, so of course we eat anything that is close to us! Therefore, through all our experience with this kind of food, we occasionally make all kinds of important discoveries, and this is a natural result." The Chinese have long been forced by famine to try everything on the planet, and have discovered that some of it is suitable for human food. In certain situations, they have even discovered antidotes for food poisoning. As a result, as early as 5 AD, there were already special natural history books about "materia medica" foods and dietary therapy.

In other countries, the food that the people discover in famine years is easily forgotten in times of plenty. However, the reason why the variety of Chinese cuisine has been formed and preserved in China may lie in the long-lasting feudal monarchical system. There are very few feudal monarchs in China with stomachs like Bismarck, who ate seventy eggs for breakfast every day. No matter how big their stomachs were, they could never actually exhaust the "ponds of wine and forests of meat." However, those who were constantly satisfied in quantity had to seek satisfaction in quality. Therefore, the chefs of the feudal monarchs had to satisfy their jaded tastes and constantly discover new and delicious foods. The food discovered by the people in times of famine was immediately studied and prepared, and offered to the monarch as food. For a tired appetite, they must have liked foods with strange flavors! If the taste was not good, the chefs would make excuses that the monarch liked to hear. For example, they would say that although this food does not taste very good, it strengthens the yang and nourishes the kidneys. Therefore, the feudal monarch, whose daily main projects were picking flowers and hunting for beauty, would happily eat this unpalatable food. Thus, deer antlers, male silkworms, and sparrow eggs became foods to be eaten heartily. In particular, foods that serve both sexual and gustatory purposes, such as shark fin and bird's nest, have become indispensable in Chinese cuisine. Even now, the free people of the Republic of China, in order to show their loyalty to the feudal system, continue to regard bird's nest as an indispensable dish, even though they discover that it is not found on coastal cliffs, but in the sea (in cold weather).

The food of the feudal monarch not only needed to satisfy the taste buds, but also to strengthen the yang and nourish the kidneys, and even more so to prolong life, so they constantly tried new foods. This phenomenon is not necessarily limited to China. It is said that King Solomon employed twelve head chefs. Eleven of them were constantly on the road, searching for unknown wines from all over the world, as well as reformed foods. I believe that Qin Shi Huang's order to the Qi people Xu Shi to go to Penglai to seek the elixir of immortality and King Solomon's pursuit of nutritious and exotic foods are one and the same. Feudal monarchs always wanted to live longer and enjoy life more than their fellow feudal lords, so they treated their chefs well, enabling them to constantly study rare preparation methods. Due to the consciousness of competing with others, it was prevalent among the feudal aristocracy to discuss that it was more effective to eat live monkey brains than bear paws, and that it was more nourishing to eat phoenix liver than elephant trunks. This is just like the era when someone in Rome made a cake with flamingo brains and offered it to Emperor Marcus Antonius, and as a result, he obtained a large city with a population of 35,000; and someone fed sea eels with the raw flesh of slaves, took their livers, and made a dish to offer to Emperor Heliogabalus (218-222), hoping to get a city. It was a complete era of dietary abnormality. Therefore, the variety of Chinese cuisine was researched and developed due to the support of the feudal aristocracy, and soon became a convention, to the extent that it produced a menu like the one we have today, with four cold dishes, four hot dishes, ten main dishes, dim sum, and a soup, regardless of the capacity of the stomach.

However, even in that era, such extravagant cooking would have made people of conscience speechless. Confucius said: "Food should be finely milled, and meat should be finely chopped," and also said: "I do not eat wine bought from the market, or dried meat," meaning that it is better to eat simple "home-cooked meals" than to eat abundant and sumptuous dishes. Moreover, the majority of the people at that time had no access to precious Chinese cuisine, and only ate stir-fried green vegetables and rice every day. If they ate a piece of pork once every ten days, they were already very fortunate. This is not much different from the present. In the past, the Japanese "China experts" only saw the upper class of China, and then concluded that this was a universal phenomenon throughout China, which was wrong.

The Chinese cuisine menu, no matter how much it disregards the size of the human stomach, is ultimately produced according to the needs of the Chinese social structure. In this country where there are few middle-class people, there is a class that specializes in eating Chinese cuisine, and at the same time, there is a beggar class that lives on their leftovers. There are more of these people than in any other country. While the Chinese boast that Chinese cuisine is the best in the world in terms of quantity and variety, the number of beggars who survive on leftovers cannot be ignored as the best in the world either. The class that specializes in eating Chinese cuisine and the class that survives on its leftovers are worlds apart in terms of status, but they have a mutually dependent relationship in politics. The former uses increased amounts of leftovers to buy off the beggar class, using them as a reactionary brake against the democratic movement of the middle class (perhaps it would be more appropriate to call them the productive class). Lao She, who fell into the beggar class, wrote in "Rickshaw Boy": "What movement, what petition... anything is fine, as long as you give me two or three mao." The warlords and the usurious capitalists who support them take the reactionary beggar class, who will do anything for such a small amount of money, as supporters of their interests. One of the goals of the national revolution should be to transform this reactionary beggar class into a productive class, teaching them to get rid of eating the leftovers of Chinese cuisine, and to earn pancakes and fried dough sticks with their own blood and sweat. I think this would be better. On the one hand, the quantity and variety of Chinese cuisine should be changed to be more realistic, and at the same time, the food of the general public should also be changed to be more realistic in another sense. This must be regarded as one of the goals of the revolution.

Only in the sense of "hunger makes no choice," the Chinese people, who can eat anything, are truly unique in the world. Therefore, there is no need to continue to claim that Chinese cuisine is the most delicious and varied in the world. The question for the future is how to fully give the people's stomachs realistic food. In this regard, how should politics be handled? This is the core of the problem. (Translated from the Japanese)

### Solomon Islands Waters: Japanese Air Force Bombs Enemy Ships; Onslow on the West Coast of Australia Also Heavily Bombed

South Pacific Base, 18th (Central News Agency) – A Japanese naval seaplane squadron, while patrolling in the Solomon Islands area late on the 16th, discovered enemy transport ships and torpedo boats in the following locations. They immediately bombed them, achieving great results:

*   Two enemy torpedo boats were discovered east of Kieta Island and were immediately repelled.
*   Two enemy medium and small transport ships were discovered in the waters off Munda (New Georgia Island). They were immediately attacked and forced to flee.
*   A concentrated bombing raid was carried out on enemy positions near Munda, with heavy bombs dropped. However, due to the darkness of the night, the results are not yet clear.
*   Two enemy torpedo boats were discovered north of Vella Lavella Island and were immediately attacked, forcing them to flee.
*   Three enemy torpedo boats were also discovered in the waters off Visuvisu on the northern tip of New Georgia Island. One was immediately sunk, and the others were repelled.

### Japanese Military Authorities Announce New Aircraft Names and Announce Features of Three Aircraft Types

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The 20th of this month is Japan's Fourth Aviation Day. The Japanese Army authorities specifically announced the names of three new Japanese Air Force aircraft on the 18th, in order to announce them to the air forces of the great powers. The three new aircraft are the "Shoki" fighter, the "Ryusei" bomber, and the "Si Tei" reconnaissance aircraft. These are all worthy of boasting to the world. The main features are as follows:

*   The "Shoki" has been responsible for annihilation missions since the Greater East Asia War, and has established a glorious posture following the "Hayabusa" fighter. It is the newest fighter in the aerial battlefield of the Greater East Asia War, surpassing the capabilities of the "Hayabusa" fighter.
*   The "Shoki" fighter has particularly high performance, with powerful climbing ability, maneuverability, and reinforcements that are better than the "Hayabusa" fighter.
*   The "Ryusei" is Japan's giant heavy bomber. It has flown in formations without the need for fighter escorts, crossing the rugged Arakan Mountains or penetrating deep into enemy territory, attacking enemy troops or breaking into New Guinea Island and Solomon Islands, which are infested with enemy fighters, dropping heavy bombs and repeatedly bombing enemy troops. Even when pursued by enemy fighters, this bomber can prevent their attacks and prevent them from getting close. In contrast, British and American bombers often rely on fighter escorts.
*   The "Si Tei" reconnaissance aircraft demonstrated its amazing reconnaissance power in the Malayan campaign and at landing sites such as Singapore and Sumatra. Although it was attacked by enemy Buffalo aircraft, its speed far exceeded that of enemy aircraft. In the Greater East Asia War, it provided a wealth of information for photographing enemy positions and other operations.

### US Aircraft Heavily Damaged in Blind Bombing of Northern Kuril Islands

Argentine City, 18th (Central News Agency) – One hundred and twenty enemy aircraft participated in the U.S. Air Force's recent blind bombing of the Northern Kuril Islands, and the whereabouts of ten of them are unknown. According to a news report from the U.S. military front, most of the ten U.S. aircraft that returned were heavily damaged, and many pilots were also killed or injured. According to one of the U.S. Air Force personnel who survived, after experiencing many difficulties, they were able to return. One pilot talked about the situation of this air battle, saying that the U.S. Air Force engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese Air Force during the attack on the Northern Kuril Islands, and the U.S. Air Force suffered extremely heavy losses. Also, the Japanese military's anti-aircraft artillery fire was quite intense and accurate. According to another officer, this attack was unsuccessful like the air raids in Europe because there was no fighter assistance and the number of bombers was small.

### Fourth Session of Japanese Police Officers to Travel East Soon

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – The third session of police officers studying in Japan under the Ministry of Interior, after undergoing short-term training at the police academy earlier this month, has now been completed. They will depart for Japan soon, with a study period set at one year.

### Hankou Police Bureau Strengthens Air Raid Relief Work

Hankou, 18th (Central News Agency) – In order to strengthen relief work after air raids, the Police Bureau has divided the city into eight districts, with the chiefs of each branch bureau as the general commander and bureau members or inspectors as the deputy general commander. All detailed methods and matters needing attention are currently being actively planned and are under review. Once completed and approved, they will be implemented immediately.

Hankou, 18th (Central News Agency) – The City Education Bureau has recently ordered all schools to strengthen their air defense equipment and protect students, as the urban area has been repeatedly blindly bombed by U.S. aircraft. They have also purchased a large number of first aid and medical supplies, which will be distributed to various primary and secondary schools for application starting on the 17th.

### Rice and Grain Blockade Implemented in the Reclaimed Areas of the Lower Yangtze River; Rice and Grain Organization Becomes More Streamlined

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – In order to ensure military needs and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government is actively working on increasing food production and conserving consumption. In order to make the system reasonable and the allocation smooth, a Rice and Grain Control Committee has been formed to specialize in this matter. At the recent temporary meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council, the “Measures for Implementing Rice and Grain Blockade in the Reclaimed Areas of the Yangtze River” were approved. For those transporting rice and grain products out of the reclaimed areas across the blockade line, the transport certificate must be certified by the Rice and Grain Control Committee and issued by the provincial or municipal government blockade management office, and co-signed by the relevant liaison officer in the area. After the promulgation of these measures, the control of rice will definitely be greatly effective. Because the transport of various rice and grains must be certified by the Rice and Grain Control Committee, the control committee will obtain accurate and clear information on the quantity and status of the rice and grain being transported, thus achieving the effect of control in allocation and utilization. The rice and grain transport certificates are issued by local governments and relevant agencies, so local governments are responsible for monitoring and ensuring rice and grain, so that grain cannot flow into bandit areas. The interim measures also stipulate penalty regulations for violators, so that workers and merchants in the reclaimed areas can jointly and earnestly follow the regulations and dare not violate the criminal laws, thus preventing corruption and other situations from occurring. Taken together, it can be seen that the promulgation of these measures will greatly benefit the National Government's two major policies of ensuring military needs and stabilizing people's livelihoods. In the future, our country's rice and grain control will definitely become more streamlined.

### US Navy Secretary Knox Suddenly Visits London to Discuss Fleet Allocation

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to reliable sources, U.S. Navy Secretary Knox arrived in England by plane on the 17th. His visit to London is extremely secret, and military circles are paying close attention to it. It is said that this visit may be due to the end of the Mediterranean war, and is intended to discuss with the British side the cooperation between the British and American fleets for a new strategy.

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to sources in the anti-Axis countries, U.S. Chief of Staff Knox has arrived in London and is undertaking his first visit to London since the war. This visit may foreshadow important naval military decisions. Colonel Knox has held several meetings with Admiral Cunningham. How Britain and the United States will allocate their fleets to cope with the European war and the Pacific war will be decided at this meeting. There is no doubt that General Mountbatten, who was recently appointed Commander of Southeast Asia, will participate in the upcoming meeting.

### Salerno Area Battles Enter Second Phase; Germany Controls Important Strongholds

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Berlin military, observing the Salerno area battles after the first week, commented that Marshal Kesselring has secured the initial victory of contact, and General Clark has experienced a severe defeat. In the Salerno area battles, the anti-Axis forces have lost a large portion of their landed troops and a massive amount of supplies. At this critical juncture, from a military and political standpoint, they are exhausting every available resource to maintain the Salerno beachhead, which the anti-Axis forces deem of great significance and are making great efforts to preserve. Berlin points out that the second phase of the Salerno battles is now beginning, with both sides reinforcing with large armies. The anti-Axis forces, reinforced by a portion of General Montgomery’s troops landing in the area to assist in the fighting, proves that the enemy is already in a desperate situation and has no choice but to rescue them with a large army. According to recent observation reports, the anti-Axis forces landing in the southern Gulf of Salerno have a real strength of one division. The battle in this area has become a triangular situation, with Salerno, Eboli, Gastertriebe, and Rigosa as its vertices. The most important strongholds on the front line are all occupied by German forces, and the German side has expanded to control the cities of Eboli, Alte Villa, and Albanira to the east of Salerno.

Fierce Battles Unfold at Two Bridgeheads

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – American troops south of Eboli and British troops at the Salerno bridgehead are both rushing to reinforce their positions. A British tank battalion has also landed in the Salerno area. According to reliable sources, three out of the six American divisions that landed have been annihilated, and the remaining three divisions have also lost half of their soldiers and equipment. Without the cover of intense naval artillery fire, they would also be completely wiped out. The anti-Axis forces are sparing no expense in attempting to hold these two bridgeheads. In the past forty-eight hours, fierce battles have been constantly reported. The bridgehead in the Gulf of Salerno is being constantly reinforced. It was previously reported that three large convoys of anti-Axis escorts, totaling about sixty ships, sailed into the Gulf of Salerno on Thursday, which has been confirmed. There are currently ninety ships in the bay, totaling more than four hundred thousand tons. This indicates the development of the landing in the area. Montgomery's British Eighth Army has accelerated its march in the past twenty-four hours, evidently seeking to quickly establish contact with the American troops in Eboli.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Berle, the German News Agency correspondent stationed in Italy, reported that the situation in the southern area of Eboli remains unchanged, except that General Montgomery's reinforcements landed there on the night before September 17 to replace the American troops who suffered heavy casualties. On Thursday, General Clark's American Fifth Army, with the assistance of British reinforcements, launched a fierce attack on the wedge-shaped German forces. These wedge-shaped forces separated the bridgehead from the British and American landing groups in Salerno. German tank grenadiers are holding their ground everywhere in extremely fierce combat, preventing the enemy from establishing contact between the various bridgeheads. The estimated size of General Montgomery's troops, tank formations, and mechanized units landing at the American bridgehead is about one and a half divisions, which shows the severity of the American losses. It is expected that the American bridgehead will be reinforced by sea, as General Montgomery seems to understand that land travel is very slow because the German rearguard has made the nearby roads almost impassable.

### Mussolini to Deliver a Speech; Announced by Pavolini

Rome, 18th (Central News Agency) – Pavolini, Secretary of the Italian Republican Fascist Party, announced last night that he, representing Commander Mussolini, declared that Commander Mussolini is in good health and will soon address the Italian people.

The departure procedures were handled by the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Spanish Embassy, as the Spanish Embassy is the agent for the interests of the Japanese in Brazil. The Japanese who boarded the ship previously lived in the Brazilian interior and arrived in the Brazilian capital in early March to await evacuation. Another seventy-five Japanese immigrants are scheduled to arrive in the Argentinian capital this afternoon from Chile. The Argentinian authorities will accommodate them in three major hotels until Tuesday. On Tuesday evening, they will depart for Montevideo to board the Gripsholm there.

The secretary of the Swedish Embassy in Argentina will accompany them to the capital of Uruguay. It is reported that the exchange of German immigrants in Chile will take place in Lisbon within a week.

### Anti-Axis Offensive in Burma Faces Difficulties

Bern, Switzerland, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the New York office of the Swiss Daily, American military sources believe that the anti-Axis forces will launch a counter-offensive operation in Burma from December this year to May next year, after the Burmese rainy season has passed. The appointment of Yate-Barton as commander of the Southeast Asian Army does not imply that preparations for operations in that region are already complete, but can only be regarded as the beginning of formal preparations. Before the anti-Axis forces can launch a large-scale offensive, they must find ways to solve major problems such as military supplies, medical facilities, and transportation. Other military experts believe that the above-mentioned difficulties can only be addressed after the Burmese rainy season, so the anti-Axis forces will have no choice but to carry out only small-scale operations this winter.

P>Three-Nation Foreign Minister Conference Still Under Preparation; Soviet Attitude Towards Balkans Clear

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – A London dispatch: The location and date of the proposed conference of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have not yet been determined. The foreign ministries of the three countries are currently responsible for preparing the agenda for the conference.

Berlin, 18th, Central News Agency – The Soviet Union is politically attempting to overwhelm Britain and the United States by using the Second Front issue. It has now obtained the right to speak on the Mediterranean Committee and has cultivated considerable influence in North Africa. German political circles believe that the Soviet Union also harbors great ambitions in the Balkans. In general, the Soviet Union's ambitions in the Balkans are becoming increasingly evident. The former Secretary-General of the Comintern, Dimitrov, once said that the anti-Axis side will soon cause Bulgaria to fall into the same trap as Italy. The Kremlin believes that the time has come for the Soviet Union to implement its claims in the Balkans. According to Yotong, Soviet generals have led guerrilla units into the territory of the former Yugoslavia, where they have been active in various places. Therefore, the Soviet Union's political activity in Eastern Europe is becoming more active. These facts prove the Soviet Union's intentions in Europe.

The committee is now urging continued investigation into the inventory of yarn and cloth in dyeing and weaving factories and yarn and cloth stores in the city. According to reporters' inquiries to the committee, the yarn and cloth previously investigated were whether they had been registered with the Commercial Control Committee or were hoarded goods. Now that the yarn and cloth have been purchased by the National Government, and the deadline for applications for sale by yarn and cloth manufacturers and holders has passed, the investigation work must investigate whether the yarn and cloth stored by each yarn and cloth manufacturer has been declared for sale. If it is found that yarn and cloth have not been declared for sale, they will be sent to the judicial authorities for punishment in accordance with the law, and the smuggled goods will be confiscated by the Commercial Control Committee.

Also, the outside world is paying close attention to how to deal with the purchased yarn and cloth. Central News Agency reporters learned from the Commercial Control Committee yesterday that the government authorities are carefully drafting methods for handling the purchased yarn and cloth.

### Citizens Express Approval After Cooking Oil Price Reduction; Distribution Already Widespread in 18 Districts

In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the authorities have reduced the allocation price of cooking oil. The general public has expressed great approval for this decisive measure. As a result, the prices of other commodities will be unable to increase and will gradually decline. It is also reported that the cooking oil industry wholesale office yesterday earnestly urged retail stores to reduce prices. In addition to the 8th District, which has already started distribution, the 1st District also started distribution yesterday. As for Nanshi, Pudong, and other places, sales can be started next week.

Adulterated Oil Abounds

Due to material policies, the amount of cooking oil supplied to households in the city is limited, and most people feel that it is not enough, so they mostly buy more on the market. As a result, adulterated oils are abundant in the market, which is detrimental to health. It is heard that oil factories, aware of this situation, have specially dispatched key personnel to various production areas to find ways to purchase pure, high-quality, fragrant soybean oil and transport it to Shanghai for sale at reasonable prices in retail stores.

Difficult to Purchase Salt

In the next few days, 100,000 dan of edible salt will be shipped to Shanghai, which should cause the price of salt on the black market to fall. At the same time, a large amount of salt will continue to arrive here, which will be sufficient to supply the needs of the residents of the city. The firm steps taken by the salt allocation authorities in this port have reduced black market activity in salt. The Yù Mào official salt store has been approved by the authorities to sell official salt in designated salt stores in each district. Residents can go to purchase with their household registration certificate. This temporary salt allocation system, which is intended to supplement the lack of salt for residents and prevent hoarding and profiteering, will continue to be implemented until formal per capita salt distribution is realized. The official realization date is approximately at the beginning of next month. However, in recent days, it has still been difficult for the general public to purchase salt, and the amount is also insufficient. It is hoped that the official salt distribution methods can be improved.

### Increase Cigarette Rationing

After adjusting the price of cigarettes, the China Tobacco Rationing Association has appropriately increased the profits of the various wholesale and retail merchants, but absolutely prohibits price increases and hoarding. Violators will be punished for participating in the black market. In order to fully supply cigarettes to the market, the 13th distribution of goods has been notified for payment and delivery. According to Shanghai press reporters, the price of Class D goods in this distribution is 5,122.57 yuan. The other classes C, B, and A are increased in increments of 1, 2, 4, and 8. The goods distributed include the following brands from the Junying, Liyi, and China Tobacco companies: Da Ying, Lao Dao, Pinhai, Xiannv, Wuhua; Shuangfu, Quanlu, Jinqiang, Jin Dàlóu, Libaitang, Changshou from the Japanese-owned China Tobacco Company; and Huangjinlong, Meili, Jinshu, Gaoerfu, and Da Xiangcan from various Chinese factories. The amount of each of the above distributions has been slightly increased compared to the previous period. Regarding the cigarette distribution in other parts of China, it has already been completed and designated wholesalers and retailers are implementing it.

### Model of Sun Yat-sen Statue Not Yet Completed

Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Special Municipal Government established the Committee for Building a Statue of Sun Yat-sen two years ago and obtained the support of Japan. The budget at that time was 60,000 yuan, with half raised by the country and the rest borne by the Japanese side. Japanese art expert Mr. Bunsitsu was in charge of the model design. The copper material for the statue was purchased by the municipal government two years ago, but more than a year has passed, and the model design has not yet been completed. It is learned that the committee sent a letter to Tokyo last month urging completion, but no reply has been received so far, so the progress cannot be determined at this time. As for the location of the statue, it is said that it is still under consideration.

### New Movement Branches Established in Districts One and Eight

### Land Survey in Qingxiang Areas Taken Over by City Government; Previous Regulations Have Been Revised and Application Period Set for Two Months

The former Shanghai Qingxiang Sub-Committee wanted to understand the current land situation in the Qingxiang areas of Nanhui, Fengxian, Beiqiao, Jiading, Baoshan, Chongming, and six districts in order to organize land administration. It was to hold a land survey. It is now learned that after the sub-committee ended, the task of this survey was ordered to be transferred to the city government for direct handling, and the Fourth Section was designated to be in charge. All files were transferred on August 6. After receiving them, the city government actively adjusted them and revised the various regulations previously formulated, promulgated them, and implemented them. In order to strengthen work efficiency, a discussion meeting of the heads of the land survey offices in each district was convened on September 4. Xu Kewei, head of the Fourth Section, presided over the entire meeting and listened to the opinions of the heads of each office. It was resolved to promote the policy in the future. It is now stipulated that the application period is from September 15 to November 15. Those who fail to report within the deadline or who report negligently will be deemed to have abandoned their ownership of the unreported or underreported land, which will be managed by the Temporary Public Property Management Committee. It is hoped that all owners will go to the land survey office in their respective townships to complete the application procedures within the specified period. As this matter concerns the rights and interests of owners, please do not wait and see, and do not delay.

### The Budding Era of Nursery School Movement

The green route 26 public bus travels along the Western-style Great West Road. If you get off at Wangjia Lane before reaching Yidingpan Road, you can see a three-story garden house on your right, and beside the iron gate, in addition to the door number "66," there is a glorious sign that reads "Shanghai Nursery School, Organized by the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA)." Don't underestimate this small group; it's actually piloting a great new era undertaking of liberating women and cultivating talent!

The Undertaking of the Era

The term "nursery school" has only recently come to people's attention. In Shanghai, it's still a brand new endeavor, but it holds extremely significant meaning for society and the nation.

The most important factors in the advancement of world civilization are, first, to ensure that children receive scientific education and upbringing, so that they develop soundly in terms of morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and social skills from an early age, laying the foundation for future contributions to society and the nation; and second, to liberate women and men from the confines of seclusion and the old system, allowing them to shoulder the responsibilities to society and the nation equally with men.

However, the vast majority of children in our country grow up in dirty, dark, confused, and uneducated families, lacking modern education from an early age, and are unhealthy in both mind and body. At the same time, the vast majority of women in our country are suppressed by feudalism and patriarchal values, and even many who have received new education have not been able to completely break free. Especially after marrying and having children, although they have obtained the same civil rights as men and have the ambition to serve society and the nation, they are held back by family burdens and the children. These two phenomena are important factors in the lack of social progress.

Nursery schools are a new endeavor to eliminate these factors that hinder the progress of civilization. With the organization of nursery schools, many talented and ambitious women can rest assured and dedicate themselves to serving society and the nation, knowing that their children are well cared for. At the same time, infants or young children receive scientific nurturing in nursery schools, and both their bodies and minds are cultivated in a healthy manner, laying a foundation for national education.

The Industrial Revolution advanced human culture to a new level and also gave birth to the nursery school system. In recent times, the nursery school movement has flourished in civilized and powerful countries, especially in the Soviet Union and Germany. In our country, some forward-thinking places have been actively piloting the program and have achieved considerable success. In recent years, all people with ideas and ambition have felt interest and hope in the nursery school undertaking. The Shanghai YWCA Nursery School was born out of the needs of this new era.

Birth and Development

This was Shanghai in 1940, three years after the start of the war. The lives of ordinary people were becoming more and more difficult. The number of abandoned children along the roads was increasing day by day. "Who doesn't have children? How can they bear to see them abandoned on the roadside?" Moreover, the calamity of abandoning children is a loss for the future society! At that time, although charitable organizations such as the Catholic Orphanage, Renji Infants' Home, and Xinpu Nursery were working hard to provide relief to abandoned children, in reality, there were still many parents who could not afford to raise their children but were unwilling to abandon them, thus affecting their careers and futures. Tragedies were playing out on every street and in every alley. Some executives of the Shanghai YWCA, such as Ms. Bian Xusun and others, deeply felt that these tragedies must be stopped. Therefore, they studied the establishment of nursery schools to relieve these parents of the burden of their children, so they could boldly engage in undertakings that would benefit the society and the masses, without having to suffer guilt for abandoning their children, and without having to worry about their children not being educated. Moreover, they could still be reunited with their families in the future! What an ideal thing!

The Shanghai Nursery School Preparatory Committee was established under this noble ideal. After discussions, planning, fundraising, and four months of tireless efforts, preliminary success was achieved. On March 1, 1941, Shanghai's first nursery school, the "Shanghai Nursery School, Organized by the YWCA," was born in Tongren Hospital on Bailinan Road.

The Shanghai Nursery School, born in an era of hardship, lacked both funds and personnel. Furthermore, because the building was small, the scope of the undertaking could not be too large. The nursery school was a pioneering industry in Shanghai, and in order to gain understanding and trust from all sectors of society, it had to be run particularly well in order to make the nursery school movement widespread. The first priority was to maintain the health of the young children and avoid deaths. Therefore, the physical examination at the time of admission had to be particularly strict. The service was also limited to the children of the poorest workers. According to Ms. Bian, when she went to investigate and register the families of children requesting admission, she witnessed many tragedies. Some parents would lock their children in dirty, sweltering, and rat-infested rooms before going to work. She personally witnessed infants suffering from starvation and suffocation! During physical examinations, in addition to skin diseases being the most common, three or forty out of every hundred children had lung disease. These pitiful situations strengthened their determination to work hard for the nursery school undertaking.

Due to their efforts, the "Shanghai Nursery School" undertaking gradually attracted attention from all walks of life. On the one hand, the number of people sympathizing and providing assistance was increasing day by day. On the other hand, the need for nursery schools from all sectors of society was also increasing. Many middle-class families and young parents preparing to go far away to make a living began to try various methods to send their children to the nursery school. Although they were rejected after strict investigations, the actual needs of society also showed that the nursery school needed to be expanded urgently. But in December 1941, the Tongren Hospital site was requisitioned by the authorities, so they moved hastily and temporarily stayed at the YWCA headquarters on Gordon Road. It was not until March of last year that they found a more ideal location for the school at 66 Great West Road, with well-equipped buildings, gardens, lawns, air, light, and a surrounding environment that was conducive to the mental and physical development of young children.

Procedures and Rules

The Shanghai Nursery School started as a pioneering endeavor, especially adapted to the special conditions of Shanghai in recent times. They stipulated that the service goals were: to nurture children so that they would develop a healthy foundation in terms of physical and moral character from an early age, so that they could become useful talents for society and the nation when they grew up. At the same time, their direct goal was to help economically disadvantaged parents reduce their burden and help them obtain sufficient time and energy to develop their careers.

Due to limitations in manpower, material resources, and location during the start-up period, the following five conditions were stipulated for accepting children: 1. They must be the children of laborers whose parents' income cannot afford proper nurturing for the children; 2. They must be free from tuberculosis, venereal disease, and serious skin diseases as confirmed by a doctor's examination; 3. They must pass an intelligence test; 4. They must be introduced and guaranteed by a proper organization or impartial citizen and pass an investigation; 5. Those who must be entrusted due to special circumstances and who are confirmed to be in need of assistance through investigation. These are several basic conditions. The length of stay is limited to one year, and procedures must be completed to continue. Relatives of the children can visit on the 1st and 16th of each month in accordance with the school's rules.

The number of children accepted was initially limited to 30, from newborns to three years old, both boys and girls. At that time, the start-up cost was only 10,000 yuan, and the monthly expenditure was limited to 1,000 yuan. Everything was done with caution, in an attempt to achieve some success, not seeking too large a scale. As more and more people came to know about it, sympathetic and supportive people came one after another, and the social needs also increased day by day. Therefore, in June 1941, the quota was expanded to 50. After moving to the new location on Great West Road, the place was larger, there was a possibility of expansion, and with the assistance of enthusiastic people, the quota was expanded to 100 in July 1942, in response to the requests of those who registered. Although there have been some fluctuations since then, the fixed number has generally been maintained. There are now 68 boys and 38 girls, of whom 80% are half-orphans, and the remaining 20% ​​have parents but cannot afford to raise them, and even their older siblings are in other children's homes! Most of these children are directly entrusted through referrals, and some are sent by the former H. All children's protection departments. Although some children have been investigated before admission, fraud has still been found in practice, and those whose parents are still found to be capable of raising them are immediately sent back. Of course, it can also be seen from this how urgent the need for custody centers is in society! (To be continued)

### This Month's Rationed Sugar to be Available for General Sale Within the Month

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative has been continuously requesting the allocation of rationed sugar for September from the military distribution authorities. It is expected that general sales will be implemented within this month. As for the price issue, according to information obtained by our reporter from relevant authorities, there will be no changes. Rumors that the cooperative requested an increase are not consistent with the facts. Currently, the rationed sugar in this city is distributed by the military distribution combination, so the price should be reviewed and determined by the military distribution authorities in conjunction with relevant organizations. As for the reason for the delay in distributing this month's rationed sugar, it is because the current sugar industry association is responsible for distributing sugar to three provinces and two cities, and the prices must be the same everywhere, which has caused delays in the adjustment process. In short, with the efforts of the relevant authorities, the supply of sugar in this city can be smoothly continued and distributed on schedule.

Economic Circle: Commentary

### Retaining the Average Amount of Yarn and Cloth

Buying and selling yarn and cotton cloth, buying rice, and revising the Special Criminal Law during Wartime are all the paths that must be taken to solve wartime economic problems. There is no doubt about victory. Even if there are ups and downs on the chosen path, they must be regarded as inevitable in the journey of economic recovery. Appropriate adjustments can be made from the side to achieve the goal of national economic recovery.

The government's purchase of cotton yarn and cloth should be an economic measure to benefit the people, not to strike at them. Therefore, we expect that the government will announce the implementation of the rationing of yarn and cloth and the start date. However, looking at it more broadly, our expectations may not stop there. Because the large amount of yarn and cloth purchased cannot be "inexhaustible." In addition to the prompt rationing of yarn and cloth after the purchase, it is also necessary to actively promote production increase plans to ensure that the supply of materials is never in short supply. Therefore, the raw material problem in all key production areas has become the core of the production increase problem.

Taking cotton textile production as an example, according to Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth, each factory and retailer should be allowed to retain an average amount equivalent to one month's total sales or consumption in the first half of this year. It is certainly an appropriate remedy to ensure that yarn and cloth manufacturers retain the average amount of yarn and cloth. It should be noted that an excessive amount of raw materials will prevent production from proceeding, because raw materials are more expensive than finished products, so manufacturers will hold on to raw materials, and production will decrease further. However, an insufficient amount of raw materials will also prevent production from proceeding, because manufacturers, although unable to engage in large-scale hoarding, can excuse themselves by the lack of raw materials and not engage in production. Therefore, retaining the average amount of yarn and cloth is the most reasonable method. The only question is how to thoroughly support the method.

### Shanghai Market Overview After the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth: Most Merchants are Selling Goods at Reduced Prices; Speculators are in Dire Straits

Since the government authorities implemented the strict measure of purchasing cotton yarn and cotton cloth, the situation in the local market has changed dramatically, and the abnormal prosperity caused by speculation and hoarding in the past has been completely swept away. According to our reporter's investigation, the details are as follows:

Banking Industry: Although the purchase of yarn and cloth has not had any apparent impact on the banking industry, the actual impact is unknown to outsiders. It is no exaggeration to say that a portion of the local financial industry has been built on merchants' speculation and hoarding in the past. The number of banks that can use funds for legitimate production investment is very rare. Before the yarn had been purchased, some banks accepted yarn and cloth mortgages from speculators, which was a considerable amount. Once the yarn and cloth were purchased by the government, the speculators went bankrupt, and they were unable to repay the loans they had mortgaged. Therefore, the banks suffered losses. Although the financial community has been trying to find ways to make up for the losses in recent days, it is difficult to predict the extent to which they can make up for them. In addition, due to the authorities' suppression of prices, speculators have suffered huge losses, and the market is extremely tight. Sales have stalled, and the business of various banks and money houses has become sluggish. As a result, many small banks have been in a state of outwardly strong but inwardly weak. In the past, the number of small banks in the local area sprang up like mushrooms after rain, but now no one is willing to establish new banks anymore.

Retailers:

Retailers in all industries, whether they are department stores or cigarette paper shops, have been hoarding materials during the past era of soaring prices. Customers who came to the door to shop were often met with the contempt of the shop assistants. Because in the vortex of rising prices day and night, customers who went to buy an item were equal to depriving the shop of the profits from the price increase. Therefore, the shop owners would rather store the goods than sell them to customers, and would not provide any convenience. However, after the purchase of yarn and cloth, various department stores have either been affected by the extreme tightness of money or fear that they will follow in the footsteps of yarn and cloth. They have all changed their styles and started selling at reduced prices, even calling for sales with large discounts and large gifts. The price cuts are often lower than the price limits set by the authorities. All kinds of fabrics and other foreign groceries have this phenomenon. Therefore, the situation is so miserable that it is difficult for outsiders to understand.

Speculators:

There are many speculators in Shanghai. Our country's industry is backward, and it has never been able to get on the right track. Merchants make profits by speculation as the only shortcut. No one is willing to invest their funds in production. This trend has become even more pronounced since the war. Therefore, the funds in the market have actually become the main force in the speculative market, and most of them are unwilling to participate in production. The speculative methods can be roughly divided into two major categories: one is that individuals use their funds to engage in kicking the ball transactions, and the other is to set up a nest-word question to conduct speculative transactions, with varying scales, but their methods are the same regardless of size. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, individual kicking the ball transactions had basically stopped. After the festival, the writing questions that specialized in speculative purchases were also in a dire situation where there was no opportunity to speculate. Therefore, the market in Shanghai today is not as active as it used to be.

### The First District Government Considers Daily Necessities Rationing Method, Starting with Salt, Soap, and Matches

The First District Government of this city, in view of the fact that the prices of various daily necessities in this city have not decreased due to the government's strict crackdown on hoarding and price suppression, has decided to implement the rationing of daily necessities to households in the short term for the sake of stabilizing people's livelihoods. The rationing plan is being carefully planned and is expected to be drafted and announced before the end of this month and implemented starting in October. It is reported that the first batch of daily necessities to be rationed will be temporarily set as "salt, soap, and matches." The rationing method will be to issue purchase coupons according to the baojia household registration, so that citizens can use the coupons to purchase a certain amount of goods from designated stores within a certain period of time. After the rationing system for these three daily necessities is established and implemented, the relevant authorities will gradually expand the scope of rationing. It is reported that the current Materials Investigation Committee is stepping up its investigation of hoarded materials in all public and private warehouses in Shanghai. After the entire investigation is completed, the government authorities can expand the scope of material purchases and use the materials purchased as rationing.

### Analysis of Germany's War Power

— Tadataka Ikezaki

(1)

It cannot be said that there are absolutely no people who are uneasy about the recent European war situation and its future, especially among the intellectuals in Japan. Their knowledge of military affairs and war may not be abundant, but starting from the nervous sensitivity unique to the intellectual class, when judging the general trend of the war, they do not study its final shift, but rather focus on the results of local battles, thus rashly forming a comprehensive view of the war. Because of this tendency, they become even more skeptical about the European war situation and its future.

The European war situation is not optimistic. Frankly speaking, since the major retreat of the German army on the Eastern Front, the Axis banner in Europe cannot be something we cheer for. In particular, the situation in the Mediterranean theater after the retreat of the Axis forces from North Africa, since the Anglo-American forces occupied Pantelleria and Lampedusa, and then occupied Sicily, and soon developed into the recent landings on mainland Italy, this situation is naturally becoming increasingly dangerous for the Axis.

In addition, on the Eastern Front, the Soviet army, having recovered Orel, Kharkov, and Belgorod, is still actively continuing its offensive. The situation thereafter cannot be decisively said to be unfavorable to the Soviet army. Therefore, if one focuses on the results of local battles every day, and wants to form a comprehensive view of the war situation based on this, then it cannot be said that those who are anxious about the recent European war situation and its future are necessarily caused by nervous sensitivity.

Victory or defeat is not determined by local battles. However, the outcome of modern warfare is definitely not determined by the results of local battles. The European war, which has lasted for four years, is becoming increasingly complex in nature. The trend of the war has long since escaped the realm of being determined by the capture of a single city or pool, or by the victory or defeat of sporadic battles. Therefore, when observing, one must broaden one's horizons and deeply understand the true nature of the war.

The current European war situation can be roughly divided into two situations. One is the Eastern Front, which stretches for two thousand li, and the other is the Mediterranean Front, which has recently unfolded at the southern end of the Italian peninsula. These two fronts have no direct connection in themselves. The main forces facing each other on their fronts are the German army against the Soviet army on one side, and the German army against the Anglo-American forces on the other. Therefore, when forming a so-called comprehensive view of the European war situation, it is necessary to distinguish between the two and observe them separately.

Here, I would like to first investigate the German-Soviet front in the east. When investigating its trend, the existence of Britain and the United States will be temporarily ignored. Simply treating this as a war between Germany and the Soviet Union, not being bound by the various details that make up the current war situation, examining the matter from a more fundamental and essential point of view, avoiding all subjectivity, and calmly examining the positions of the two sides, we will examine which of the two countries, Germany and the Soviet Union, maintains a more favorable position.

Comprehensive war power can lead to victory. As I see it, the current stage of the German-Soviet war has lost the characteristics of the first and second phases of the war, and has reached a stage where the final victory or defeat is determined solely by the superiority or inferiority of their comprehensive war power. The things that can be regarded as their comprehensive war power are, first, military strength; second, military supplies production capacity; third, food self-sufficiency; and fourth, the national spiritual strength that can endure war and fear.

As for the current strength of the German army, I am afraid no one knows the exact number. Hanson Baldwin estimates it to be 350 to 360 divisions, while Soviet intelligence claims there are 302 divisions. But no matter what the actual number is, the strength of the German army exceeds that of the Soviet Union, and there is no room for doubt.

The population of the Soviet Union is about twice that of Germany. The consumption since the start of the war has been enormous, and the Soviet Union itself is the only source of military strength. On the other hand, Germany has consumed very little since the start of the war, and has many satellite countries around it. There is reason to speculate that the military strength provided by these countries is quite large, and compared to the Soviet Union, Germany occupies a very favorable position.

The current Axis forces, in addition to the main German and Italian forces, also have troops from Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Hungary, and Slovakia. Hanson Baldwin estimates the total strength of these countries to be about 30 divisions, but based on the reality of the previous World War, this estimate seems too small. I believe that the total strength of the Axis forces in Europe is currently close to 10 million, while the opposing Soviet army is about 9 million.

Germany has the advantage in military supplies production. As for the production capacity of military supplies, Germany certainly has the advantage. Germany itself has a large production organization, plus the steel industry of Luxembourg, the precision industry of Belgium, and the military industry of Czechoslovakia, and can also mobilize the industrial power of France. The main purpose of the Anglo-American bombing of the Ruhr area and Hamburg is to reduce their production capacity. This has not yet had a fatal effect on Germany.

Due to the relocation of factories to the interior, the mobilization of the old and young, and the extraordinary production methods of the Stakhanov movement, the Soviet Union seems to have maintained more production capacity than imagined. But no matter what, not only did it lose the major industrial areas in the Donbas soon after the start of the war, but also when compared with Germany, which has 7 million foreign laborers, the source of its labor force is also extremely scarce, and it is ultimately no match for Germany. Of course, it can obtain some materials through the Iranian route, the Arctic route, and the Siberian Railway, but to say that this can make up for the Soviet Union's disadvantage in production capacity, I am afraid no one would think so.

In short, the Soviet Union's military strength resources, as Dr. Harding said, are exhausted to the point where it has to conscript Outer Mongolians on the border. The Soviet Union's military supplies production capacity, as Willkie pointed out, is like Skoda, New Hsinneki, Kenez, and Swiertierfsk, all kinds of styles being displayed together. Therefore, judging from these aspects, the superiority or inferiority of Germany and the Soviet Union is clear at a glance. (Excerpt from the Tokyo Yomiuri Report of September 8)

### Starting with the Treatment of Elementary School Teachers

— Yang Jinzhao

What is the noblest and most sacred profession in society? It is teaching. What is the lowest-paid profession in society? It is teaching. These two contradictory phenomena exist universally throughout the country. With the deepening of the contradiction, China's education has already reached a serious crisis. We often hear many parents complaining, "My child's level is poor!" "The teacher is often absent!"... Our education practitioners also admit that the level of children is getting worse year by year, partly because teachers are "double-minded" and cannot fully take responsibility: the main reason is that the teachers are of poor quality. I dare to say boldly that many low-level class teachers in Shanghai are only junior high school students in terms of academic qualifications. As the saying goes, "A good teacher produces excellent students." If the teacher is not good, how can the student be excellent? In the final analysis, it is entirely because the treatment is too poor, and even personal life cannot be maintained, not to mention anything else.

Before the war, the treatment of Shanghai municipal elementary school teachers was better. A high school normal school graduate received a monthly salary of 50 yuan. Every three years of service at the original school, the rank was promoted once, and the salary was increased by 5 yuan, which was an excellent system. After this incident, the initial teacher's monthly salary was 30 yuan, the head teacher's was 40 yuan, and the principal's was 50 yuan, which was already meager. At that time, 6 yuan a month was enough for food. A salary of 30 yuan could barely maintain a small family life. As the level of living increased, the salary gradually increased, but as of July of this year, the salary of municipal elementary school teachers was only 220 yuan. There was news of a salary increase in August, but it has not yet been realized. Looking at this amount of money, calculated as 30 days a month, the hard work earned each day is less than 7.4 yuan, which is only enough to buy seven pancakes, not enough for two bowls of Yangchun noodles. Of course, there are many altruists in the education sector who can obtain life security from their families, but there are more elementary school comrades who have been struggling in the vortex of life, without a chance to catch their breath. If the income is not enough to keep warm and fed, how can they concentrate on cultivating the future masters of the country? In recent years, I have seen teachers who have received normal school training leave one after another, either to study, or to enter politics, or to wear leather belts, or to become street vendors. I truly have a feeling of "a mixture of emotions, not knowing whether to laugh or cry." According to what I know now, the average salary of private elementary schools in Shanghai is better than that of public schools, generally around 500 yuan, but I don't know how far away it is from maintaining a family life. Therefore, teachers in public and private elementary schools throughout the city feel the urgent need to increase their treatment:

Regarding the standard of teacher treatment, I remember reading in Educational Theory that "The treatment of elementary school teachers should be based on twice the cost of living for food, clothing, housing, and transportation in the local area!" If the cost of living for an individual in this city is 500 yuan, then the monthly salary of an elementary school teacher should be at least 1,000 yuan. Maintaining a small family with 1,000 yuan is already a frugal life.

According to last year's statistics, there are a total of 113 schools, 1,144 teachers and staff in the city's private elementary schools and public elementary schools. These more than 1,000 elementary school teachers are distributed in every corner of the city, and bear a very important cultural mission. Their monthly income is not enough to keep warm and fed, and society's treatment of elementary school teachers can be described as alarming. Now, taking 1,000 yuan as the standard, each person needs an increase of about 770 yuan. The monthly expenditure of the municipal education bureau on primary education must increase by 880,000 yuan. The source of funds is a problem worth studying.

Generally, people have a misconception that the Finance Bureau is a production agency, while the Education Bureau is a consumption agency. In fact, to enrich the country and strengthen the military, the people must have abundant knowledge. Otherwise, they will lag behind everywhere, and how can they compete in modern border disputes and win? In the past, the political system was not on track, and the call for independent education funding was very loud. However, "education" and "finance" have clear boundaries, and we cannot allow them to be confused. After the war, education funding was insufficient, and with the help of Mayor Yu, a feast donation was established, extracting 10%. Initially, merchants contracted for 30,000 yuan per month. Later, it was run independently, with a revenue of about 200,000 yuan, all of which was used to subsidize education expenses. Now that the concession has been taken over and the local administration has been unified, the feast donation can be extended to the First and Eighth Districts. If the total daily turnover of the city is 1 million yuan (probably more), a donation of 100,000 yuan can be extracted, totaling 3 million yuan per month. In addition to increasing the salaries of municipal elementary school teachers, it will definitely promote education throughout the city. We can see a fresh look in Shanghai's education sector.

In addition to increasing treatment, we also hope that the Municipal Education Bureau will care about the poverty of colleagues in the education sector, understand their difficulties, and consult with the relevant authorities to comprehensively provide daily necessities such as rice, coal, cloth, sugar, and salt, so that everyone serving in the education sector will recognize education as a lifelong career, and sound teachers will not leave. Indirectly, the national cultural level will also gradually improve. It is said that the establishment of education associations in famous districts throughout the city has been very competitive. I hope that the elected executives will truly do something, seek welfare for colleagues in the education sector, and make a reasonable struggle for the treatment of elementary schools!

The third session of the Zeng De Commercial Obligation Night School has begun to enroll students. The school is scheduled to start on September 25. Tuition is free, and a deposit of 30 yuan is collected (to be returned at the end of the semester). Registration time is every night from 7:00 to 9:00 pm. The school address is Guangshi Middle School, 270 Chengdu Road. The Zhengying Elementary School at 287 Route Dollfus, in order to raise funds to assist poor students, has specially invited Professor Wei Zhongle, a famous domestic national musician, and his Chinese Grand Orchestra to perform at the auditorium of Aurora University on September 12. All the programs are extremely profound and precious.

### Nanyang Hospital Gives Preferential Treatment to Teachers

The Nanyang Hospital in Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, is well aware of the hardship of living for salaried classes, and especially the poor teachers. Therefore, it has specially stipulated that poor teachers can receive free examinations. The method is to send patients for consultation every day (except for holidays) from 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm. Poor female teachers who are giving birth, holding a certificate from this newspaper, will only be charged a registration fee of 50 yuan, and all other hospitalization expenses will be free, to show special preferential treatment.

### Charity Schools and Scholarships

Pei Pei Academy at 70 Min Village, Route Minety in the Eighth District, in order to cultivate poor children and prevent them from dropping out of school, has specially increased the number of half-fee students by 30. There are still places available. Families in poor circumstances can apply as soon as possible.

### Youyou Nursery Holds Regular Fundraising

The Shanghai Youyou Nursery, due to financial difficulties, held a fundraising committee at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant a few days ago. More than 20 people attended, including directors of the nursery Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Ding Fubao, Zhang Wenkui, and Chen Chunhua. The discussion on fundraising and the improvement of children's education was very detailed. It was also decided that the president Lin Kanghou and Zhang Jusheng would invite the press for a tea party at 2:00 pm on the 18th, and it was decided to start fundraising on October 1, with a target of 800,000 yuan. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate generously.

Lost Child Notice: The Nanyang Hospital in Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, took in a lost Wu girl the night before last. She is about eight years old, wearing a blue short shirt and white shorts. It is hoped that the girl's parents will come to claim her.
