### Editorial: Advocating National Salvation Through Science

Modern industry originated after the Meiji Restoration in Japan, around the same time that Zuo Zongtang and Li Hongzhang advocated for modern industry in our country. In terms of resources, Japan at that time was far inferior to China. In terms of intelligence and skill, the Chinese were initially no less capable than the Japanese. However, one nation made rapid progress, quickly joining the ranks of industrialized nations, while the other remained infantile, still in its early stages. What was the reason for this?

There are four reasons why Chinese industry has failed to develop. First, the Chinese people regard their own culture as very high and are unwilling to humbly accept foreign cultures. As a result, although enlightened individuals diligently promote progress from above, the shortsighted criticize it from below, leading to policies being implemented only while the advocate lives, and abandoned after they die. For example, the Gansu Woolen Mill was painstakingly managed by Zuo Zongtang and seen as the pioneer of China's wool spinning industry. However, it was shut down soon after Zuo left office. Similar cases are too numerous to list. Second, the scholar-official class clings to the mentality of "transforming barbarians with Chinese culture" and considers it shameful to discuss foreign affairs and new learning. For example, Wo Ren, when ordered to head the Tongwen Guan (School of Combined Learning), although not daring to openly defy the imperial decree, intentionally fell off his horse and injured his foot when taking office, feigning illness to resign. The so-called "pure stream" (moralistic officials) at the time unanimously praised him for not abandoning his principles. Third, political corruption is rampant, the law offers no protection, and corrupt officials, local bullies, and evil gentry collude to treat new enterprises as objects of exploitation, causing those not yet established to be stifled in their infancy and those already established to be cut short in their early stages. Fourth, scientific research is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Domestic schools lack adequate facilities, and graduates find it difficult to find employment. As a result, the number of people studying natural sciences is decreasing daily, while the number studying social sciences is increasing. The lack of both enterprises and talent is mutually reinforcing. Due to these factors, the development of Chinese industry has lagged behind by decades.

Since the late Qing Dynasty, social ideology has changed, and the first two reasons no longer exist. However, the lack of legal protection and the underdevelopment of science education have not yet been fundamentally changed. Therefore, investors still view enterprises as a long shot, and those who genuinely want to run enterprises lament the difficulty of finding talent. To correct this, it is necessary for politics to get on the right track as soon as possible, and cultivating talent is the most urgent task. Cultivating talent is certainly not a matter of a day or two, but precisely because of this, we must start as soon as possible. Japan's science education is a hundred times more developed than our country's, and it has cultivated no less than tens of thousands of technical personnel at all levels. However, its cabinet recently passed educational policies that still seek to reorganize the system from primary schools to universities, increasing the number of students in science and engineering. Observing them and observing ourselves, our country, from the government to the people, should better understand the direction we should take in running education in the future.

In the past, among the universities in Shanghai that were famous for their mechanical engineering departments and had the most complete equipment were Tongji University and Jiaotong University. Their graduates have made outstanding contributions in the domestic engineering field. Since the incident, the former has moved to the interior, and the latter, due to the school buildings and equipment, no longer has opportunities for students to conduct experiments. Among the other universities in Shanghai that have science and engineering departments, only Datong and St. John's Universities exist. Judging by the future needs of the country and the number of people that each school can currently train, the difference is too great.

Since cultivating technical talent is currently an urgent task, expanding the enrollment of science and engineering departments in universities and strengthening the basic science and engineering courses in middle schools are both urgent measures. Here, we propose the following for the government and society to pay attention to:

The government should issue a clear decree stipulating the ratio of science and engineering enrollment to other departments in universities and provide financial subsidies to expand experimental equipment and negotiate the return of the Jiaotong University campus.

The government should order the educational authorities in each province and city to strictly supervise the courses taught in middle schools, especially those related to the foundations of science and engineering.

Public-spirited educators should advocate for establishing more science and engineering lectures and providing excellent teachers to supplement the insufficient strength of schools.

The public should value the future needs of the country and send their children to study natural sciences.

The publishing industry should translate and compile a large number of science books and provide them to students at low prices. With the power of the country and society, working together to save the nation through science, the development of science and the strength of the nation will surely be achieved one day.

### ### Organize a National Envoy Delegation to Question Japan

The Chinese National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association held a board meeting yesterday. One of the motions was to organize a national envoy delegation to visit friendly Japan. At the same time, Minister Chu gave an explanation on the spot regarding the significance and reasons for organizing the delegation. We have long advocated for organizing an envoy delegation to visit friendly Japan from a non-governmental standpoint.

In July of this year, the economic community of friendly Japan organized an economic envoy delegation to visit China, exchanging opinions with official and non-governmental economic figures in our country, which has been helpful to economic cooperation between the two countries. In order to further strengthen ties, we should also organize an envoy delegation to reciprocate the visit to Japan. Therefore, it is a very timely move for the National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association to initiate the organization of an envoy delegation to visit.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the National Government's declaration of war on Britain and the United States, the relationship between China and Japan should objectively be one of shared weal and woe, of being closely related. However, upon calm observation, it seems that words of goodwill and cooperation still exceed the facts of goodwill and cooperation. Goodwill and cooperation between the two governments are certainly important, but the sincere mutual engagement of the people of the two countries is equally important. National diplomacy aims to promote the sincere mutual engagement of the people of the two countries, and the visit of a national envoy delegation is one aspect of practicing national diplomacy. Therefore, the mission of the national envoy delegation is to communicate the opinions of the people of the two countries and promote sincere cooperation.

In view of the needs of the aforementioned objective environment, we earnestly hope that the national envoy delegation will be established as soon as possible and visit as early as possible. Before its organization, it should fully prepare the procedures for the visit, first discussing how to benefit the cooperation between the people of the two countries? How to communicate the opinions of the people of the two countries? How to resolve the estrangement between the people of the two countries? And how to learn from their strengths to compensate for our weaknesses? Problems should be put forward practically and made into an outline as a basis for the visit. It is firmly believed that friendly Japan's government and people are eagerly awaiting the sincere cooperation between the two countries and will certainly give enthusiastic guidance and discuss in good faith to answer our questions regarding the visit of our national envoy delegation. Here, we take the lead in providing several matters as topics for the envoy delegation's visit.

Economic affairs are most directly related to the people, therefore, economic cooperation is the precursor to all cooperation, and also the precursor to connecting emotions and communicating opinions between the people of the two countries. How to eliminate obstacles and strengthen economic cooperation? This should be studied first.

Culture is an expression of a country's character and uniqueness, cultural exchanges are very helpful in the mutual understanding and understanding between the people of the two countries, and the effect is significant, so special attention should also be paid to it.

Japan's domestic politics, economy, society, education, culture, etc., all dynamics are in the process of preparing for a decisive battle, and they are all worth our borrowing and reference. During the visit, we must humbly explore, observe the key points, and record them in detail. After returning to the country, we will contribute to the implementation of the authorities and complete the wartime system.

### Four Northern Malay States to be Administered by Thailand from Today

Zhao Nan, 18th, Central News Agency Dispatch: It has been one and a half years since the Japanese army implemented administration in the four northern Malay states. Now that these areas have been incorporated into Thailand, it has been decided to terminate the administrative matters from the 18th. The Malay Military Administration Department recently issued a statement on this matter as follows: Regarding the incorporation of the four northern Malay states into Thai territory, since the treaty was signed on August 20th, personnel from China, Japan, and Thailand have been in close consultation. They have been handling the demarcation of borders, the handover of enemy property, and other matters in a concentrated manner. The transfer was completed on the 18th, and as of 12:00 midnight today, the Japanese side will cease all administration. The administration of the four states will be under the jurisdiction of Thailand from the 19th. However, matters such as railways, postal services, telecommunications, and currency will be jointly managed by Japan and Thailand, according to the regulations of the two countries, so as to avoid obstacles. In addition, liaison agencies will continue to be stationed in each state to handle the remaining Japanese affairs and all matters related to the Japanese. Regarding the welfare of the incorporated residents and the treatment of local leaders, we believe that the Thai side will handle it properly. At this time of termination of military administration, we express this intention and pray for its development.

The two senators, Hatta and Wanita, proposed a resolution to complete the war, which was unanimously passed by the entire assembly. The meeting adjourned at 3:40 PM. General Affairs Minister Yamamoto paid a visit to the Chung Ling Tower.

Ulla's Remarks

Jakarta, 18th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The newly appointed Vice Chairman of the Java Central Senate, Ulla (approximately 65 years old), was a member of the former National Senate and served as its Vice Chairman. He is the oldest member of the current Senate. Ulla made a statement on the 17th, describing the similarities and differences between the old and new Senates, saying: "The spirit of the former National Senate, which was based on democracy, and the current Central Senate, which is based on a shared ideal, is vastly different. For example, the oath-taking form of the former National Senate was that each senator took an oath to the Governor-General separately. Now, the oldest of the senators takes an oath on behalf of all the senators to the Supreme Commander. This is an expression of the solidarity and unity of all members of the Central Senate, who pledge to cooperate with the military administration, and is completely different from the individualism of democracy. Moreover, the various factions of the old Senate were hostile to each other. The members of the current Central Senate are all loving and supportive of each other, full of the spirit of unity. This is certainly not what existed in the old Dutch East Indies era. Also, regarding the selection of the Chairman, in the old Dutch East Indies era, it was appointed by the King of the Netherlands, but now it is elected by the senators. This is extremely gratifying. Because I have a deep feeling for this, I am willing to use this remaining body to fully cooperate with the development of the military administration."

### Katma-Bound Japanese Troops Cross the Nu River Branch, Haiphong Middle and Primary Schools Relocate to Hanoi

According to another report, the Japanese artillery on the west bank of the Nu River began to fiercely bombard the Chongqing military positions on the east bank several days ago.

Hanoi, 18th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has repeatedly intruded into Vietnam and blindly bombed the Haiphong area, causing great harm to the Vietnamese people. This behavior is extremely despicable because they fear the counterattack of the Japanese air defense forces and dare not fly close to military facilities, instead, they specifically bomb non-military facilities. For example, the bombing of Zhongzhai Street on the 8th of this month, the bombing of the French store street and the French children's elementary school in the residential street on the 10th, destroying the school building and the Peace Memorial Tower in the nearby square, are all inhumane acts. On the morning of the 16th and 17th, they came again and dropped many bombs on the Jiatai Street in Haiphong, causing the Vietnamese residents to be extremely angry. The local authorities have decided to move the municipal co-educational middle school in Haiphong to Hanoi, and the elementary schools are also being evacuated to other landlords to prevent bombing. The schools began to move on the 17th.

The "Newspaper" editorial on the 16th, also entitled "On the Eve of the Talks," explained the Soviet Union's position in the talks and demanded the formation of a second front. The gist of it was: The German army has turned from offensive to defensive, adopting a long-term war. On the contrary, there are various oppositions in the Allied camp. Under this state, "time" will favor the German side. Therefore, the deployment of a second front in Western Europe is a matter of urgency. If the most important issues in the course of the war can be resolved, other issues can be resolved satisfactorily.

### Japanese Provide Reasonable Treatment to British Prisoners of War

### Celebrating Philippine Independence, Bose's Speech

Shonan, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Indian Independence League held a celebration for Philippine independence at Harrer Public Garden here on the evening of the 17th. Many Indian nationals attended, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. During the gathering, the League's supreme commander, Subhas Chandra Bose, delivered a speech. In addition to congratulating the Philippines on its independence, he also urged Indian nationals to strive for the glorious independence of India. The gist of his speech is as follows: The Philippines has now achieved its long-held aspirations and become independent. The Indian Independence League is holding this celebration to offer our congratulations. When we celebrated the independence of Burma last time, we did not expect that the Philippines would achieve independence in such a short period. This is truly a "pleasant surprise" for us Indians. Therefore, while offering congratulations on the independence of the Philippines, all of you present should continue to fight for the freedom and independence of our motherland and to defeat our enemies. You must know that the opportunity for independence is extremely rare. If we miss the opportunity today, we will regret it for eternity. Therefore, the independence of the motherland and the pursuit of freedom should be realized as soon as possible. The enemy is no longer able to defend India alone. Currently, there are American, Yu, and non-military forces stationed in India. However, our permanent independence and freedom cannot be obtained solely through the assistance of allied nations. Therefore, we must sacrifice everything to fight and exchange blood for light. Now, the Indian National Army is marching towards the motherland, and the time for India's restoration is approaching. At that time, we will demonstrate our bravery and strength and drive the British out of our motherland. At the same time, when we launch our offensive, the Indian army will become our comrades, providing us with internal support. Today, I dare to say that if Indian nationals residing in Asia can unite and each fulfill their duties, we will surely achieve independence.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German authorities announced on the 16th that German forces engaged in close combat south and north of Kyiv on the 15th and launched a counterattack, repelling Soviet forces and destroying 59 Soviet tanks.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Havas report: large-scale battles took place on the Eastern Front on Saturday. Soviet forces, along the line from Krivoy Rog to the Sea of Azov, continued their attempts to break through German lines, but did not achieve significant victories. The points that were broken through were quickly filled by German forces, and German forces launched counterattacks, repelling the enemy. Since the German withdrawal from Zaporozhye, the center of the fighting has shifted to Dnipropetrovsk to the northwest. Soviet forces are currently concentrating fresh troops in Dnipro, including 15 infantry divisions, 250 tanks, 200 artillery pieces, and a large number of fighter planes, launching an offensive from the bridgehead. Although Soviet forces have a numerical advantage, they were ultimately repelled by German artillery fire. The Soviet commander was forced to order a retreat to the rear for redeployment due to losses in that area alone. The German forces also paid a considerable price in this victory.

German Defensive Battles Continue to Achieve Victory

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A German News Agency report: In the central Dnieper River region, Soviet forces, with powerful tanks and infantry units, attempted to expand their bridgehead at the Dnieper River bend near Beryslav, but were blocked by German forces, suffering heavy losses. The Soviet tank formations, followed by infantry, advanced under intense rapid artillery fire. At that time, German forces urgently deployed heavy artillery to the front lines, launching fierce attacks on the enemy flanks and cutting them off. Within half an hour, 18 Soviet tanks were ablaze and unable to move. Soviet infantry attempted to hide behind the remaining tanks, but failed and were annihilated by German direct-fire artillery units. By noon, 38 enemy tanks were unable to move, and the infantry, with the exception of small, insignificant groups, was also annihilated. Thus, the enemy's offensive came to a halt. Northwest of Kyiv, Soviet forces, with powerful infantry and tank units, attempted to penetrate the German rear lines within the city. At that time, extremely fierce fighting broke out in the depressions of the rugged forest area. The enemy's offensive made some temporary progress, but was soon blocked by reserve troops. These reserve troops immediately launched a counterattack and recovered the crossroads that had previously fallen into Soviet hands. At the mouth of the Prypiat River, Soviet forces, in order to recover the territory they had lost in recent days, attempted to penetrate German lines simultaneously at various points with several powerful units, including tanks and motorized detachments. One of these units was encircled by a clever German flanking maneuver and annihilated. At the same time, another enemy detachment was repelled to its original positions and forced to abandon all of its equipment and heavy weaponry.

Detachment Operations Particularly Successful

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The German High Command announced in a communiqué at noon on Sunday that the withdrawal of German forces from the Zaporozhye bridgehead reported on October 15 was carried out according to the original plan in a large-scale detachment operation on the Eastern Front. The leaders of the detachment units and the troops themselves achieved particular success in carrying out this operation. All weapons, equipment, supplies, and tools were transported across the Dnieper River bridges under the threat of enemy air and land forces.

### German Forces in Italy Employing Clever Defensive Tactics to Halt Allied Advance

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A German News Agency report: Allied forces fiercely attacked German positions in the Volturno and Apennine Mountains regions on the 14th. In this battle, Allied forces suffered heavy damage, and the US Fifth Army under General Clark retreated towards the coastal area. A combined US tank and infantry unit also launched an offensive west of Volturno. Although the forces were quite strong, they were unable to break through the first line of German defenses, and the attempt to advance northward ultimately failed. Furthermore, Allied reinforcements, possessing 50 tanks, landed north of Volturno on the 15th, but failed to approach German positions. German forces have withdrawn from some positions in the Capua area and moved to the high ground north of Volturno, and are halting the Allied advance everywhere with excellent defensive operations. The fighting between the two sides is gradually becoming intense. At the same time, along the road from Caserta through the Apennine Mountains to Rome, Allied forces have continuously concentrated powerful infantry and tank units over the past two or three days. The British and Canadian forces in the Campobasso area suddenly launched an offensive against German mountain positions on the 16th. In order to avoid being surrounded by Allied forces, German forces destroyed all military facilities and withdrew to rear positions. German forces in the Venafro area also withdrew due to Allied interference. The Allied forces currently have a tendency to advance slowly northward along the road. However, because the German forces cut off the advance routes, their progress was blocked. In addition, the German artillery units launched fierce bombardments, further throwing the enemy forces into a state of confusion.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A German headquarters announced on the 16th that two strong German units defending the Campania Plain on the Southern Italian front had repelled the British and American forces that were attacking with numerically superior forces.

### The Arduous Solomon Islands Campaign: Bombarding the Enemy in a Rain of Fire

American forces, having landed on Rendova Island, further invaded New Georgia Island, engaging in relentless and brutal battles with the Imperial Army, leaving behind piles of corpses and rivers of blood. Two days before the enemy landed on Rendova Island, on June 28th, this reporter arrived at New Georgia Island, passing through Munda and Bairoko amidst a hail of bullets, reaching Kolombangara Island, and deeply experienced the various profound aspects of war. What follows is what I continued to write under the smoke and fire of battle.

Annoying Pitfalls Along the Way

We arrived at Munda at 3:00 AM on June 28th, two days before the enemy landed on Rendova Island, during a rainy period. The bottom of the boat suddenly screeched as it was caught on a reef. Jumping ashore from the bow, I felt the cold morning air assaulting my skin. The Solomon Islands are now in winter, with a climate similar to autumn in Japan. The road was riddled with large pitfalls, some ten to twenty feet in diameter, which were truly annoying. These were the remnants of indiscriminate bombings by enemy bombers, day and night.

Climbing through the jungle, we reached the 〇〇 Marine Corps camp. It was a continuous and rugged path, a mixture of red mud and coral reefs. The daily meals were just bland soup, but this morning, we were given a little extra oversized cabbage. At 〇:00 AM, we heard a rumbling sound in the southeast. Moments later, a group of 〇〇 aircraft appeared over the jungle. They turned out to be our own aircraft. They were probably heading to attack enemy bases on Guadalcanal or Tulagi Island. The soldiers all ran out of the camp, offering cheers.

At around 3:00 PM, another rumbling sound arose from the northwest. The sound gradually approached. It was a large formation of over fifty enemy aircraft. Behind 〇〇, they suddenly split into two groups, preparing to bomb. The shoreline became a complete hell of smoke and earth. A strong, dry wind whipped against us. As the enemy was being shot down at 〇:00 PM within fifteen minutes, a radio report came in, announcing "A large enemy fleet is heading north." When I ran to the telephone room in the cave, the commander was already sitting on a folding chair. Seeing the reporter's silhouette, he smiled and said, "You've finally arrived." From the 〇〇 observation post, a report stated that the enemy fleet was entering Rendova. The enemy fleet consisted of five destroyers, six transport ships, and a dozen or so torpedo boats and high-speed boats. They were unloading landing craft from the transport ships. The enemy was starting to land. Fully armed soldiers were biting into dry bread and drinking water from thermos flasks. The soldiers seemed excited. However, they were not flustered at all. A sense of boundless tenacity surged from their hearts. From the 〇〇 observation post, the island of Rendova, partially obscured by clouds, was very clear. Looking through binoculars, I immediately saw the enemy on landing craft, continuing to land at full speed. Unnoticed, six Douglas aircraft hovered above them, and the number gradually increased. Not long after, a burst of smoke suddenly erupted from the 〇〇 side, followed by a devastating bombardment of the fortress positions buried on 〇〇 Island. Enemy destroyers sailed towards Cape Munda. Enemy bullets smacked against the coastline, stirring up thick dust. At 〇:00 PM, the sound of our fighter planes soaring in the sky came from the east, and the sound of machine guns firing could be clearly heard. The approaching aircraft were engaged in a magnificent aerial battle. "An enemy fighter plane has been shot down, and the pilot has parachuted out," "Two Curtiss fighter planes have been shot down, one of which disintegrated in the air," the observers reported, which was enough to prove our absolute advantage. The enemy fleet set up a smokescreen and began to retreat. Abandoned landing craft were moving back and forth on Rendova. In an instant, a loud roar rose in the sky again, hovering over Rendova Harbor. The enemy was flexing its muscles and showing off its strength with its numerical superiority, which was truly hateful. At 〇:00 PM, the enemy fleet began to flee again, because our planes had returned.

The reporter hurriedly ran to the observers' side to see. In the sky near Rendova Island, our planes were freely performing aerial combat in the clouds. One against two, or one against four, our fighter planes, despite being outnumbered, still bravely spurted out dark smoke, and in that instant, white parachutes opened, slowly falling to the ground. Enemy planes were shot down one by one. The observers were shouting: "Two enemy destroyers hit!", "One transport ship is on fire!". The enemy fleet hid in the shadows of the islands, and in the blink of an eye, a hazy black smoke spread everywhere. Our aircraft formation returned in triumph. The sound of the enemy could no longer be heard. A temporary silence after the fierce battle finally descended, but it did not last for ten minutes.

The Enemy Ships' Tenacious Assault

The sound of new aircraft rose from behind 〇〇 Mountain. Thirty-seven enemy bombers rushed towards the defensive positions along the coast of Munda. After ten minutes of aerial combat, they were repelled. The enemy lost six aircraft, while we suffered no losses. At 3:00 PM, enemy bombers attacked again from the north, bombing the coastline. One enemy destroyer appeared on the sea south of Danan, and ten torpedo boats passed through the waters near Wanga U. These were all reported by the 〇〇 observation post. On this day, the number of enemy aircraft intruding on the adjacent area totaled 391, with intrusions occurring 35 to 40 times. Sixty were attack aircraft, and the rest were reconnaissance aircraft.

A Fleet Attempting to Land

July 1st was also a cloudy day with no sun. At 4:30 AM, an enemy fleet, covered by destroyers and fighter planes, appeared near Rendova Island. Observers reported that this time it appeared to be cargo ships. At 〇:00 PM, our planes took off, carrying out a fierce bombardment of Rendova Harbor, where the enemy was landing. A fierce and magnificent aerial battle was raging in the sky. Before long, as our aircraft formation returned to its original defense area, the enemy's high-speed boats began to falter. Perhaps they were rescuing downed airmen. At this time, a large number of enemy troops began landing like a rising tide. By nightfall, a part of their landing force had advanced to Ambanpa Island, in front of Munda. The sound of enemy reconnaissance planes still swirled in the sky. At midnight, the rumbling of cannons could be clearly heard on Rendova Island. This was the sound of our main destroyer〇ships beginning to bombard Rendova, resulting in the sinking and damaging of two torpedo boats.

July 2nd was an exceptionally clear day. Six enemy destroyers and four transport ships entered Tulagi Harbor again. At 7:00 AM, the enemy on Rendova began shelling Munda. This was because the cannons had already been placed in position. 〇〇 Staff 〇〇 Battery called, asking, "Are the enemy not using poison gas?" The enemy is very despicable and capable of anything. Today, army heavy bombers started aerial combat with enemy fighter planes. The bombers dived on Rendova Island. Enemy anti-aircraft guns had already been set up. Soon after, black smoke rose in Rendova Harbor. An observer said: "It looks like a gunpowder depot has caught fire."

At 8:00 PM, our 〇〇 battery all began to bombard. This was because a fleet of enemies attempting to land near Rubian Island, facing Munda, had been discovered. According to the 〇〇 observer's report, twenty-five landing craft were sunk, and enemy soldiers were scattered and floating on the sea. Our Marine Corps soldiers were wiping their gun barrels and sharpening their bayonets. Their common belief was to "avenge Guadalcanal." Five days have passed since I arrived in Munda, and three days since the enemy landed. During this time, I have seen the heroic struggles of the Imperial Army soldiers, and I don't know how many times it has made me secretly shed tears of admiration and gratitude.

Torrential Rain in the Jungle

One crack of thunder in the clear sky, and immediately black clouds gathered, followed by torrential rain. This kind of "Squall" rain in the South Seas doesn't seem to stop easily. The soldiers offered us canned goods and soda. But I firmly refused. I only put a small bag of dry bread on my back, borrowed Commander 〇〇's personal sword, and left the mountain with my companions, Mr. Ozawa (a reporter) and Mr. Fukushima, in the pouring rain. The sea route was dangerous, so we decided to take the jungle path, rarely used by people, to Bairoko.

Crossing the jungle was by no means an easy task. The torrential rain soaked through our clothes, and the clothes, heavy with rainwater, seemed to increase the weight a lot, causing pain in our shoulder bones as if they were breaking. The mud was knee-deep, and we often slipped and fell, sinking into the mud. Along the way, we came across reinforcements heading to 〇〇. Like us, water was flowing from their heavy clothing. Their leggings and leather shoes were covered in mud. We couldn't travel at night, so we only traveled 〇 kilometers each day, staying overnight in the 〇〇 unit of the army. The 3rd was clear, but the Southern unique rain "Squall" came down, and the 4th was also like that. During these two days, we crossed 〇〇 Mountain, crossed 〇〇 Valley, and broke through the muddy area of 〇〇 fruit, and reached the Marine Corps garrison in Bairoko at the wrong time on the 4th.

Enemy Tracer Bullets Overhead

Above Bairoko, as in Munda, the rumbling sound of enemy reconnaissance planes constantly circled in the sky. That night, we were guided by sailors from 〇〇 Headquarters, and hurriedly headed towards the coast in the darkness. At that moment, a heavy aircraft sound suddenly approached, seemingly from an enemy reconnaissance plane, so we left the road and hid in the woods. Then there was a burst of cannon fire. It was the enemy plane firing. We ran into the jungle. Suddenly, fire broke through the darkness, and with a thunderous sound, it seemed like the earth's axis had lost its balance. This was the cannon fire from our 〇〇 battery.

Soon after, enemy bullets were striking the coastline, stirring up a cruel sound. The sea could not be seen. The enemy's tracer bullets were weaving overhead like fire threads, chaotically piercing the darkness. The sound of cannon fire, sometimes weak, sometimes strong, continued one after another until 3:00 AM the next morning, the 5th. During that period, the torrential rain also stopped from time to time, so we were cold to our feet. Before long, the sky began to turn white, so we returned to 〇〇 Headquarters, crying like cattle. The soldiers were fully armed and ready, their eyes all fixed on the jungle. We were also preparing.

Enemy Transport Fleet Crushed

On the night of the 4th, an enemy fleet, covered by three cruisers and three destroyers, attempted to land near Bairoko, and entered Kula Gulf. Fortunately, at this time, one of our destroyers, passing through the northeastern sea off Kolombangara Island, had already seen these shadows clearly. The enemy fleet was sailing in the sea between Kolombangara Island and Bairoko. The cruisers were in the lead, followed by the destroyers, and the transport fleet was bringing up the rear. Suddenly, a fire flashed, and the enemy began to bombard Kolombangara. Our batteries, equipped on Kolombangara Island, also rose up to fight. Our destroyer, carrying a special mission, rushed into Kula Gulf, repeatedly firing torpedoes. The lookout on the lead ship saw two huge columns of water rising high on the hull of the enemy cruiser.

This attack caught the enemy off guard. At the same time, our batteries at Bairoko also unleashed a fierce barrage of fire. As a result, the enemy fleet began to lose formation and retreat. They hid behind Rice Anchorage, but continued to bombard Bairoko. A fierce and incomparable artillery battle unfolded. We were lying in the jungle, listening quietly to this artillery battle. During this period, the enemy transport fleet lowered landing craft from the ships, attempting to land troops. The sound of the landing craft colliding with each other could be heard from the sea in the middle of the night. Our artillery fire concentrated on the area where the sound was coming from. The landing craft caught fire one after another and sank into the dark sea. Our battle results for this evening included one cruiser sunk, one destroyer sunk, and one unknown sunk. Only a portion of the enemy soldiers, taking advantage of the darkness, managed to avoid our artillery fire and landed. The rest were repelled.

On the morning of the 5th, only the sound of cannons and bombing could be heard from Munda, but the sky above Bairoko was very quiet. The enemy only landed near Rice Anchorage and took no action. Our Marine Corps soldiers, of course, did not have the chance to raise their eyebrows in triumph, so they simply went to sleep. That night, we said goodbye to 〇〇 headquarters again and lodged in the 〇〇 team near the coast. After dusk, it started raining again in torrents. (Continued on the fourth page)

In addition to the unified control opportunities, the chief officials of the first, eighth and seventh district offices, as well as the chief officials of friendly agencies, and the presidents of various newspapers, will participate in the guidance.

The Production and Sales Headquarters Will Conclude on a Fixed Date

The Rice and Grain Production and Sales Headquarters has been established for more than a year. Now that the organization of the Rice Control Committee is fully in place, in order to allow merchants' autonomy to be brought into play, an order has been received from the ministry to handle the conclusion of operations. All operations will be completed by the 20th of this month.

However, although the headquarters will conclude operations on the 20th, the procedures will be completed by the end of the month. Therefore, the time when the Rice Control Committee fully replaces the Procurement and Sales Office will be at the end of this month or the beginning of next month.

### The Rationing of Coal Briquettes by Ticket is Under Careful Consideration

The authorities have a comprehensive plan for the raw materials needed for machine-made coal briquettes in this city and allocate them to various coal briquette factories on a monthly basis. The factories have always maintained a normal state of supply and have never been interrupted. However, due to the relatively loose control over coal briquettes, they are often monopolized by unscrupulous merchants, resulting in frequent shortages in the market and making it difficult for citizens to purchase them. In order to remedy this situation, the authorities concerned are also planning to implement a ticketing system for coal briquettes. This is currently being seriously discussed with the parties concerned.

### The Administration of the Baojia in the First and Eighth Districts Has Been Unified

Since the recovery of the concessions, citizens have been unclear about the organizational structure of the Baojia system in the First and Eighth Districts and the age regulations for conscripted militia. The Shanghai Social Affairs Department yesterday made inquiries to the Baojia authorities in the First and Eighth Districts as follows:

Organization of Baojia in the First and Eighth Districts

The former public concession Baojia was divided into seven districts and belonged to the Baojia Committee. After the return of the concession administration, the Baojia organization in the First District was directly under the Baojia Office of the First District Police Bureau and was directly governed by the Baojia Office. The Eighth District established a Baojia Branch Office. As a result, the Baojia administration in the two districts tended to be unified. As for the Baojia Committee organized by the citizens, it had no executive power and was only an advisory body to the Baojia authorities.

Age Regulations for Citizens' Service

Regarding the age regulations for citizens serving as militia in the First and Eighth Districts, there are slight differences. The regulations in the First District are stricter. All healthy men between the ages of twenty and forty-five must be on duty. In the Eighth District, the age of service was originally regulated to be between twenty-five and thirty-five, and they were required to draw lots for duty. However, this has recently been changed to be the same as in the First District, requiring citizens between the ages of twenty and forty-five to have the obligation to serve.

### The Municipal Baojia Committee Will Implement Random Household Checks

Central News Agency: The Municipal Baojia Committee has completed the re-examination of household registration on schedule at the end of last month. In order to ensure that the household registration is thorough and to prevent false reports, the committee will begin random checks of household registration in various districts and has formulated random check methods, which have been submitted to the municipal government for approval. The random check methods are as follows:

Random Check Methods

The random household registration checks will be supervised by personnel dispatched by the committee, together with local police officers and district office personnel, who will supervise the district chiefs, fang chiefs, lianbao chiefs, or township chiefs to handle the matter fairly. The areas to be checked and their start and end dates will be determined by the committee. When carrying out the random household registration checks, the supervisors should wear armbands and badges for identification. All expenses will be paid by the Municipal Baojia Committee and no fees should be collected from residents. Random household registration checks will be conducted daily from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM. The Baojia chiefs of each district to be checked should immediately inform the residents within their Baojia after receiving the notice, and all men, women, and children should stay at home with their residence certificates ready for verification. Those who are bedridden due to illness may be exempted from the check with the certification of the Baojia chief or two or more co-residents. People who are not at home must personally go to the Baojia chief in charge to verify their residence certificates after returning home. If the personnel of each random check abuse their power or engage in other illegal acts while performing their duties, they will be punished according to law once verified.

### The New Chiefs of the Third Police Bureau Take Office

In order to strengthen the organization of the Third Police Bureau of the Water City, the internal personnel have been reorganized. Yang, the chief of the Xiafei Branch Bureau, was transferred to the position of secretary. Yang, the chief of the Mai Lan Branch Bureau, was transferred to fill the vacancy, and Xue Gengcui, the chief of the duty inspection, was transferred to the position of chief of the Mai Lan Branch Bureau. The branch chiefs have successively taken office in accordance with orders the day before yesterday. In addition, Secretary Peng Ziqing was transferred to the position of duty inspection chief, and Secretary Yi Yishou was transferred to the Economic Section of the Special Police Department. They also officially took office and reported to work yesterday.

### A Memorial Service Was Held Yesterday for Two Self-Defense Corps Members Who Died in the Line of Duty, and Certificates of Merit and Bonuses Were Awarded

Shen Heqing and Jiang Chang, members of the Lao Zha area self-defense corps in the First District, died in the line of duty on July 18th while bravely pursuing criminals during a robbery in Fangjiu Xia. All sectors expressed their regret. In order to commend the loyalty of the two martyrs, the Baojia authorities of the Lao Zha District held a memorial service at the Tianchan Stage on Fuzhou Road at 10:00 AM yesterday, and awarded certificates of merit and bonuses from the police authorities. Gu Jiwu, chief of the Baojia Office of the First Police Bureau, Yuan Ludeng, director of the Baojia Guidance Committee, Chen Jiu, executive director, Cheng Liang, Tian Yishishi, chief of the Supervision Office, Hong Yubin, chief of the Lao Zha Branch Bureau, Kori Jun, deputy director of the branch, Wang Lianfang, Baojia district chief of the Lao Zha District, representatives of the various lianbao chiefs, representatives of the Hua community, and more than 2,000 members of the self-defense corps attended. The bereaved families of Shen and Jiang were also present, and Jiang was pregnant with an unborn child of only one month old, which aroused the infinite sympathy of those who came. Accompanied by the music of the Nan Tong Children's Education Institute Orchestra, the atmosphere was solemn. The meeting opened with music, and a three-bow salute was performed to the portraits of Shen and Jiang. After a moment of silence, the chairman reported, and the officials Gu Jiwu, Tian Yishishi, and Hong Hanbin spoke in succession.

Awarding Certificates of Merit and Bonuses

Then, Tian Yishishi, on behalf of the police authorities, presented certificates of merit and bonuses. Jiang was collected by his widow, Jiang Xishi, whose award was "Yi Bo Yuntian [Righteousness Reaching the Sky]," with a bonus of 120,000 yuan.

Finally, the Lao Zha Baojia Association awarded bonuses to meritorious corps members Zhou Genlin 1,000 yuan, Chen Linfa 500 yuan, and Yue Shangpei 500 yuan, each receiving a medal inscribed "Courageous and Commendable." The awards were followed by a report on the amount of donations received and the method of payment by the two members of the sales personnel. The meeting ended with a speech by the representative of the Chonghai Township Association, a speech by the lawyer Ji Chaolü on behalf of the bereaved families, and a speech by the self-defense corps member Tang Qiongxiang, in the majestic anthem of the self-defense corps.

Mr. Zhou Huarun, from the association's secretariat, spoke on "The Path for Youth to Serve the Country." He first described the fallacies of the "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical application" ideology of late Qing dynasty middle schools, as well as the detrimental effects of the May Fourth Movement, indiscriminate Westernization, the plagiarism of Anglo-American culture, and communist ideology. He attributed the change in China's near future to the relocation of the National Government to the capital and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, arguing that only by practicing the Father of Asia's Pan-Asianism could young people truly save the country. The next lecture will be held at 10:00 a.m. on the 25th at the Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School on Yuyuan Road (Singapore Road), where Ms. Guan Lu will speak on "Japanese Women."

### Postal Service Exclusive Items Must Not Be Impersonated

Notice from the Post Office Administration of the Yingbao Post Office: It has been found that postal service exclusive items, such as mailbags, uniforms, bicycles, and stationery forms, are all printed with logos, and outsiders must not impersonate or misuse them, otherwise they will be fined. Recently, due to the war situation, or sea disasters, and robberies, etc., postal service exclusive items are inevitably lost to outsiders. The holders, being unaware of violating the law, are very likely to misuse them. Therefore, we hereby announce that anyone who finds or holds the above-mentioned postal service exclusive items should notify or deliver them to the nearest post office for verification. If they are found for sale in stores or by street vendors, they should not be purchased and the nearest post office should be notified. Those who do not comply with the post office's handling will be sent to the military police authorities for legal action. For those who discoverers and holders who voluntarily report to the post office for verification, a considerable reward may be issued after it is verified that there are no other concealed circumstances. Those who have indeed purchased the items and provide reasonable proof may be reimbursed for part or all of the purchase price, taking into account the original price or market price of the relevant items and their depreciation (no reward will be given) to show consideration.

### Fiftieth Issue of Household Flour is All Top-Grade Flour; Complaints Can Be Made If Inferior Flour is Mixed In

The household flour distributed in the First and Eighth Districts of this city is obtained from the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Commerce Control Committee on a regular basis and distributed in whole numbers to retail rice shops, which issue it to residents upon presentation of coupons. However, the quality of the household flour for the recent 48th and 49th issues was all a mix of second-grade and third-grade flour, making it less palatable. For the current 50th issue of household flour, retail rice shops in the First and Eighth Districts will start selling two catties of top-grade flour from the 15th. According to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, the flour allocated by the committee to the retail rice shops in the First and Eighth Districts is all top-grade flour and does not include any second-grade or third-grade flour. Therefore, citizens who purchase household flour that is of inferior quality or mixed with second- or third-grade flour can report and complain to the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee at No. 2 Beijing Road to have the store's license suspended for investigation.

### First District Public Works Office Hopes Citizens Will Cooperate in Utilizing Garbage, Separating it into Two Parts for Coal Ash to Make Coal Balls

Central News Agency report: Regarding the garbage problem in the First District, the Central News Agency reporter recently interviewed the director of the Public Works Office of the First District Public Office, who made the following remarks: "The large amount of garbage collected within the jurisdiction of the First District has always been partially used by this office to fill in low-lying areas in the western suburbs of the city, and the remaining portion is transported to rural areas for fertilizer use. The amount of garbage transported out by waterway every day reaches about 1,000 tons. Although the required expenses are considerable, this work has never been neglected for a single day in order to ensure public health and maintain cleanliness within the district. Currently, however, it is essential to conserve materials and reduce expenses. After careful study, it has been decided that from today, the garbage accumulated daily in the district will be divided into two parts: coal ash and ordinary garbage. The coal ash will be used to make coal balls, and the ordinary garbage will be used by farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai as fertilizer. In this regard, I sincerely hope that citizens will enthusiastically cooperate in separating the garbage into the above two categories. Although this work may seem troublesome, I hope that citizens can understand the Bureau's intention to conserve materials and give their full cooperation by storing ordinary garbage in garbage cans and piling coal ash separately in suitable locations within the lanes so that contractors can send workers to transport it. The Cleaning Section of this office plans to dispatch personnel to persuade citizens to cooperate in implementing the above plan so that waste can be utilized and there is no discarded material."

Reviewing Books: The Economic World

### Investor's Needed Understanding

Recently, as all parties have recognized the unreliability of hoarding goods and the illegality of speculative behavior, their sights have been focused on factory production enterprises. The well-known factories in Shanghai, with their substantial content, sound management, and products that have always been praised by all parties, are particularly attracting the attention of those with surplus assets. The stock prices of various well-known factories and companies have recently shown a thriving trend, indicating that investors share the same sentiment and understanding. As surplus assets are gradually entering a safe and secure environment, how should our country's industries further enrich their content, improve their management, and actively engage in increasing production? It is the fervent expectation of investors and the most important task for the industrial world to strive for at present.

At the same time, investors should invest properly and have a normal understanding. What is a proper understanding? That is, all investments must be based on on-site observation, thorough investigation, and detailed research into the figures of their assets, the prospects of the factory enterprise, and a detailed analysis to determine the course of action. Only then will the funds be safely and steadily directed, and investors will feel that they can "rest easy." Undoubtedly, it is the responsibility of the industrial world to strive for the progress of the enterprise and the increase in production, and not to disappoint the expectations of investors. The choice, discrimination, and serious research lie within the investors themselves. Therefore, reference materials related to investment research have recently been enthusiastically welcomed by people from all walks of life, and this is the reason.

### Securities Exchange Margin Deposit, Management Methods Agreed Upon, Formal Opening Not Far Away

The Huashang Securities Exchange has resumed business, but the actual opening date has not yet been determined. The reasons for this are somewhat related to organization, management, personnel, etc. However, according to what the Shanghai News reporter has learned, the issue of margin deposit management is also one of the reasons. The regulations stipulate that brokers of the Securities Exchange must pay a margin deposit, the total amount of which is considerable. The question of who should keep this margin deposit has been the focus of attention. Currently, a concrete solution to this difficulty has been obtained. The Securities Exchange, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce have reached a consensus. Therefore, the date of formal opening can be advanced as a result.

### Regulations for Transporting Soybean Cakes in Various Counties of Jiangsu

Key Points for Application to Move

The stipulated commodity names are as follows: (A) Oils: soybean oil, rapeseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, tung oil, cottonseed oil; (B) Cakes: soybean cake (each piece weighs 40-50 catties), medium soybean cake (each piece weighs 5-10 catties), small soybean cake (each piece weighs less than 5 catties), rapeseed cake, peanut cake, sesame cake, cottonseed cake.

### Hua Stock Trends

Yesterday, Hua stocks recovered after falling, because many retail investors saw the high and sold, while the various gangs with capital were still buying as much as possible. Department store and textile stocks were the most resilient. A certain household sold off Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory of the new pharmaceutical industry, which was the only one that showed weakness. Other stocks, such as culture and industry, were all rising. Trading was quite brisk. The market conditions of each stock market are recorded below:

Textile: Yong'an Textile initially fell slightly, but rebounded near noon, rising significantly in the afternoon. Zhongfang's buying momentum expanded, rising considerably. Xinhao also rose; Rong'an set a new high price. Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing had news of stock appreciation due to capital increase, rising suddenly; small-denomination stocks such as Lunhua and Dachina were quite active; Qunfu Shirt and Socks was at the same price.

Department Store: Yong'an Company saw a slight increase; Xinhua and Guohuo Company saw an increase in buyers and rose rapidly, both exceeding the critical level; underwear was also attracting the attention of investors, rising again after exceeding the critical level.

New Medicine: Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory saw a slight decline; Zhongfa Pharmacy was stable; Wuzhou, Zhongxi, Xinyi, and Xintong Pharmaceutical Factories saw little change.

Public Utilities: Zhabei Water and Electricity both entered the critical level; Shanghai Electric Power was stable.

The "Pocket Hua Stock Treasure Book" details the recent content of various Hua stocks. Buyers unanimously believe that it is the most perfect Hua stock reference material. It is reported that the first edition is nearly sold out and efforts are being made to reprint it again to meet the needs of all sectors.

### Commercial Summary

Public Bonds: Yesterday's market price can be described as firm, not much different from the market on Saturday. Compared with the small prices before, it has rebounded quite a bit, so the rising trend was blocked again. Bing was not much different from last week. Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu were mostly outside the market.

Call Loan Interest: The Shanghai Money Industry Association's call loan interest rate remained at two cents.

Japanese Goods: Due to the imminent implementation of per capita allocation by the authorities, genuine users have been reluctant to buy, and the retail sales of the industry have shown a declining trend. The goods are becoming increasingly scarce, so the market price is generally higher than last Saturday.

Incoming Grain: There was a slight increase in incoming goods in the rice market. The merchants' intentions gradually showed weakness, and the market continued to decline. Buyers were watching from the sidelines, and as a result, the price of new japonica rice was slightly lower again. The supply of miscellaneous grains was scarce, with no rising prices. The price of oil grains was high but unsuccessful.

Rayon: Transactions were less frequent than before. Actual sales gradually decreased. The intention of hoarders to sell also softened. The floating interest rate was quite loose, and buying declined.

### A Visit to the Nursery and Kindergarten of the Refugee Children's Education and Shelter

The Expansion of Production

Entering the yard, the production department is on the right. Chairman Li Heling is hunched over his desk, calculating business accounts. Next to him, the boys and girls in the net bag department are working busily.

It is said that initially, workshop activities were considered a type of curriculum to train production skills, with the aim of creating future career paths. However, due to limited funding, not many students could participate, and the results were not significant. Later, it was decided that middle and high school students would participate in part-time work and study. To help the institute's finances, the production team was reorganized into a production department, and a production committee was established, allocating 60,000 yuan as seed money to expand the wickerwork and machine grinding departments. Mr. Li was responsible for the theory and sales and management work. After the production movement expanded, it achieved remarkable results, and business flourished, with daily sales reaching over 10,000 yuan. Later, new-style grinders were added, gradually making production a driving force in the institute's economy. The production department was originally divided into (1) grinding, (2) wickerwork, and (3) net bag sections, with three staff members and hired technicians for guidance. Children participating in the work also received bonuses and allowances, which were saved for them.

The wickerwork department was the first to be established. After expansion, nearly one-tenth of the children in the institute participated in the work. The teaching methods were constantly improved, righteous principles were incorporated, organization was strengthened, management was perfected, and training was actively carried out. Not long ago, two wickerwork retail outlets were established at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Datong Road and at No. 1054 Feifei Road, resulting in a significant increase in production and sales. Although they have now closed, major companies and merchants still directly purchase products from the institute, including tables, chairs, bed frames, cradles, strollers, thermos shells, etc. It is said that every finished product undergoes rigorous inspection by technicians and managers, and the quality and craftsmanship are above average, and the price is lower, so it is well-regarded by all parties.

The grinding department has also been in operation for more than a year and has a 7.5 horsepower small motor donated by Mr. Zhang Chunyan. At that time, the children in the institute had a high enthusiasm for production. Their own report stated that "graduates themselves clearly understand that they should first participate in production work." The bell is the work signal for the grinding department. Motors and grinders roar at 11:20 AM and 5:00 PM. A group of children covered in white flour are skillfully and adeptly performing their tasks, some weighing, some picking, some sifting, some grinding, some packaging. However, due to food rationing and other reasons, the grinding department has been temporarily shut down.

Currently, besides the wickerwork department, the only other production department is the net bag department, which was established most recently, but the results seem to be very good. The children even organized their own sales teams to promote and solicit orders from all walks of life. Some wholesalers, appreciating the quality and low price of the products, often go to purchase them in bulk.

The production activities of the Xu Gong Memorial Branch mainly focus on agriculture. They have rented the famous Lantang farmland of the former Jiangsu Rural Normal School. There is housing, a river, and over 20 acres of arable land. The soybeans planted there are almost ready for harvest, and preparations are being made to plant wheat, expanding the area to 44 acres. The various vegetables planted along the river are already sufficient to meet the needs of the branch!

Group Living

The lives of the children in the nursery symbolize the future of a new China. All teachers and students raise the flag in the morning and lower it in the evening. In the solemn ceremony, everyone feels their responsibility to the country. The national flag rises in the morning sun, and below, the children agilely perform morning exercises and begin their academic life. Especially meaningful are the academic competitions. Because no one wants to fall behind, everyone is making progress. It is said that due to reasonable competition, almost all children who initially entered the institute with poor qualities have changed for the better after two weeks of training.

The children have their own children's organization, with activity time after 5:00 PM every day. The children's organization is divided into five departments: training department, with cadre training classes implementing autonomy; academic department, responsible for alarms and libraries; public security department, with small courts, disciplinary teams, and patrol teams. When you visit, children from each grade and class salute, just like in a military school. The service department has labor, sanitation, nursing, laundry, and cooking teams. The recreation department is responsible for sports activities, chess, singing, and ping-pong teams.

The strong self-governance of the refugee children is fully demonstrated in the nursery, probably because they grew up in the wild. Even very young children can take care of themselves and are very good at organizing themselves. With the guidance of the instructors, the results are particularly excellent.

The refugee children are also very creative. For example, due to a lack of materials, they can use their skills to transform waste into practical items. They collect used soap shavings, boil them in water, and turn them into whole bars of soap. They twist yarn from old socks and make clothing knots and bags. They collect scrap fabric to mend clothes, even piecing together "brocade garments." They also collect scrap cotton, small nails, rice grains, and cardboard to make various practical items and toys.

The labor team is the biggest characteristic of the lives of the students in the nursery. The catering team wears white aprons with three red characters "Catering Team" and an Arabic numeral. Hauling coal, filtering water, burning firewood, and cooking rice are all done by the children themselves, with only two supervisors providing guidance. The "cleaning team" gathers every morning, after meals, and after school to receive their assigned tasks, then disperses to perform their cleaning duties. The principal also runs around, inspecting and recording results, maintaining the cleanliness and energetic appearance of the entire institute. In addition, there is a "sewing team" composed of over twenty girls. They not only mend torn clothes for the entire institute, but also take on the task of making new clothes when the institute needs them. In the past, every child in the institute had a set of work clothes, and the navy uniforms needed for the performance at the Lihua Grand Theater were all made by their little hands!

### The Confession of an Accountant

— A Morning Dream

I am an accountant (cashier) in an old-fashioned factory. Those who hear the term "accountant" may think that the position is quite pleasant. However, this is not something that outsiders can understand. In reality, the treatment of an accountant is as meager as that of a teacher.

Prices are constantly rising, but our salaries have always been slow to increase. Even if the boss occasionally has a change of heart and adds a little, the amount of increase is limited. In this era of high prices, what can you do with this meager monthly salary of 200 yuan? It is difficult to support my family, let alone my own personal life. Apart from the stipulated salary, there is no unexpected income each month. The work is so busy that it is like doing the work of three people at once. From the manager to the apprentices, I have to deal with everything alone, and there is never a moment of free time. The responsibility is heavy, as you can imagine. All the income and expenditure of money goes through my hands. Sometimes, because I am too busy, I forget to record a payment, or I mistakenly miscount the amount of money. At that time, I have no choice but to compensate with my own money. If the amount is small, I can afford it. If the shortage is too large, it is unimaginable. No matter how careful you are, it is inevitable that accountants will have to pay compensation. This is truly like the saying: "Eating cold rice with a sour taste."

Seeing the red, blue, five-yuan, ten-yuan, and even hundred-yuan banknotes flowing in and out of my hands all day long, but thinking about the food for my family of four, I am truly worried about the future. Therefore, I can only sigh all day long while counting money.

My daily life has already been reduced to the point where there is no room for further reduction. I neither smoke nor drink, and I haven't stepped into an entertainment venue for years. I rarely go out. When I do, it is to save money on transportation. I never attend any banquets, and even when invited by friends, I always make excuses that I am busy with work and politely decline. I haven't made a new set of clothes in years. All I wear are old, tattered cloth gowns patched with holes. Therefore, the apprentices in the factory all call me "Accountant" very affectionately on the surface, but behind my back, they all call me "Moldy Old Man." Indeed, I myself admit that I am very unlucky. Is this the life that an accountant should live? Or perhaps the life of a poor teacher!

### (Continued from Issue 2) In the Air Raid Shelter

At half past midnight, more cannon fire was heard at Kra. Though sparse, the sounds of cannon in the rain were very powerful, a testament to our mine warfare squadrons' encounter with an enemy fleet. Our mine warfare squadron, fighting at 〇〇, was comprised of 〇〇 ships that entered Kra Bay just as troops were withdrawing to the eastern shore of Klumpang-Kara Island. Enemy ship shadows drifted across the dark sea. The enemy fleet consisted of a score of ships, including cruisers and destroyers. Our side launched a fierce torpedo attack, their specialty, against the enemy fleet. Shells rained down. By the time another unit, hearing the cannon fire, turned back from the Bruas-Hai Strait, the enemy had already been repelled. Our forces completed the operation and were already returning, having sunk two Class B cruisers and one special service vessel.

The rain continued into the morning of the sixth. The air in the forest cellar was unbreathable. The cloth shoes were saturated with water. Matches and cigarettes were soaked through, impossible to light. Enemy planes circled overhead, haphazardly dropping bombs along the roads, cratering the jungle like a checkerboard. Reconnaissance planes dipped low over the jungle. The tips of the branches were whipped by the aircraft engines, wavering back and forth. They were searching for our artillery positions. The soldiers, their impulse to shoot it down repressed by the captain, could only clench their fists and stare. It was a truly bitter struggle. That day, we took shelter in the air raid shelter thirty-five times.

### Debris of Enemy Ships Drifting with the Wind

At 〇〇 in the afternoon, the artillery batteries at 〇〇 began to bombard. This was an attack on enemy troops landing in Songkhla Bay. Amid the thunderous cannon fire, we crossed over to Klumpang-Kara Island. A boat carried eight wounded brave men from the night battle on the fourth. This boat was the one abandoned by the enemy last night and commandeered by our team. The rain stopped, and small stars twinkled shyly in the sky. Kra Bay felt truly peaceful. Heavy oil, overturned boats, and lumber floated on the sea. These were the remains of enemy ships sunk in Kra Bay during the naval battles of the fourth and fifth. Reinforcements for Pailok were garrisoned in the coconut groves along the coast of Klumpang-Kara. That night, we stayed with the 〇〇 unit nearest the coast.

The seventh was a clear, fine day. We were jostled in transport trucks, delivered to the marine corps camp. Such a fine day continued until the ninth, the day we left Klumpang-Kara Island. But the intensity of enemy bombing there was also very severe. The enemy's bombing was fierce, and our ground artillery fire was equally intense. Our bomber planes also bombed the enemy landing on Ko Lanta and Rice Bay day and night. Our fighters pursued the invading enemy fighters, opening up a fierce and unparalleled war from Kra Bay to the skies above Klumpang-Kara. Our naval reconnaissance planes, tasked with night patrols, were very brave. Late on the night of the seventh, a single plane audaciously attacked a large enemy fleet of over a score of cruisers and destroyers attempting to enter Kra Bay off Ko Lanta, forcing them to turn back. Perhaps the enemy wanted to return to resupply.

### Enemy Planes Drop Food Supplies

The thunderous sounds of cannon fire from Mung and Ko Lanta were audible every day. Especially intense was the artillery battle that took place from the night of the eighth through the morning of the ninth. I witnessed this on a boat in the ocean. Enemy planes flew over our heads, heading towards Mung. Before long, it seemed a large flare was launched high into the sky over Mung, and under its light, artillery fire began. This was artillery fired by the enemy on Ko Lanta.

It was about 〇〇 AM on the ninth. We heard a burst of machine-gun fire, like popping beans, coming from the direction of Pailok. This was the encounter between our reinforcements and enemy soldiers landing in Rice Bay. It was said that this battle had started at dawn on the eighth.

### From Employee Embezzlement to Personnel Management

— Half Page

Recently, news about employee embezzlement and flight has been frequently seen in newspapers and heard in conversations. After these incidents occur, there are often several different opinions in public discourse: some believe that embezzling employees simply do not know the law and that they must be arrested, handed over to the authorities, and punished according to the law; only in this way can legal order be maintained and evildoers be warned. Others believe that current employee compensation is too low, unable to withstand the impact of the cost of living; embezzlement is caused by the environment, and the responsibility lies in the self-reflection of the employers. Still others take a third-party perspective, arguing that the inability of employees to secure a stable life is indeed a cause of embezzlement, but in reality, employees who abscond with large sums rarely have stockpiled large quantities of rice and firewood. Instead, they are often driven to corruption by failed speculation, gambling debts, and other adverse environmental inducements. Therefore, they place the responsibility on society.

To be fair, all of these reasons have some merit. The occurrence of an incident is often the result of a combination of factors. Now, to prevent the continued spread of such incidents, in addition to the responsibility of society, which the social authorities should pay attention to eliminating, I believe that the focus should still be on the personnel management of the organizations themselves, and the following points are particularly urgent and should be improved:

Improvement of Compensation: The rapid increase in the cost of living in recent years is truly alarming. According to statistics, the increase was limited from the beginning of the war until May 1938, and it was still less than 60% by May 1939. By May of last year, it had risen to just under 17.5 times, but in May of this year, it has already risen to over 48 times. According to wage theory, wages should be determined by the minimum cost of living, that is, monetary wages should be proportional to the actual cost of living. This July, the News Daily held a symposium on wage issues. According to the report of Mr. Cai Zhiya, a family of five requires at least 62 essential goods. Based on July's prices, employees need at least 3,070 yuan per month to maintain their minimum living standard. How many organizations currently have employees who can reach this minimum living wage standard? Moreover, prices are constantly changing, and the rice ration for August and September has been reduced again. Employees cannot secure a stable life. Although they are physically present in the office, their minds are still preoccupied with daily necessities. In such a situation, the effectiveness of their work is out of the question, and cunning individuals will seize opportunities to take advantage, and bad intentions will arise! Therefore, to achieve administrative efficiency, business development, and prevention of corruption, ensuring employees' livelihood is a prerequisite.

Guidance on Leisure Activities: Leisure life is originally a part of human life activities. Employees are mentally exhausted from working all day. To maintain their physical and mental health, normal leisure activities should be provided after work, such as ball games, chess competitions, musical performances, etc. Larger organizations can host their own events, and smaller ones can hold joint events. These activities should be listed as legitimate expenses by the organizations. These activities can cultivate the mind, connect emotions, and unconsciously foster the virtues of cooperation, fairness, orderliness, and love for the group. If employees can maintain their minimum living standards and have normal activities for recreation, then all crooked and evil thoughts can be eliminated, and they can focus on promoting their own careers. As the saying goes, "Idleness breeds trouble." Promoting normal activities to replace general activities such as playing cards, dog racing, and dancing is also an important aspect of personnel management that cannot be ignored.

Emotional Communication: I am deeply concerned that in many organizations today, there is too much distance between superiors and subordinates. It can be said that there is only response to orders, and very little emotional harmony. Many employees who have served for many years still have their names and faces unknown to the manager. With so few opportunities for contact, suspicion, resentment, and misunderstanding easily arise between them, and sympathy and understanding are not obtained. At the same time, superiors are indifferent to their subordinates, treating them as strangers, and subordinates do not see their superiors as anything more than passersby, making it difficult to offer loyal service! The Book of Changes says, "Treating subordinates with indifference leads to their loss of righteousness," which is exactly what I mean! This is a common problem in organizations today. I believe that there should be opportunities for individual or group discussions among the various levels of an organization. Family situations, personal interests, and opinions on the business itself can be discussed freely. Problems can be solved, and opinions can be adopted. Through these discussions, not only can there be a meeting of minds, but superiors can also observe their subordinates' origins, and understand their peace of mind, which is also a good reference for promotion and deployment.

Strict Examination: Some people believe that in hiring, one should "use without suspicion, suspect and do not use." Indeed, many subordinates in various places are often hindered and constrained because they do not have the full trust of their superiors. This is very frustrating for those who do the work. However, I believe that while trust is acceptable, excessive trust can easily turn into laissez-faire. Once laissez-faire is adopted, internal betrayal often follows. In history and society, we often see cases of trouble arising within the walls and changes occurring at the elbow, which is due to deep trust and negligence in prevention. Therefore, within an organization, while public interaction can be like family, within the scope of one's duties, one should strive for fairness and impartiality. In particular, attention should be paid to those who are public-spirited and law-abiding, and they should be allowed to remain in their positions. Do not be misled by those who flatter and fawn. The so-called "enforcement of both kindness and strictness, clear rewards and punishments" is the essence of using people.

Cultivating a Frugal Atmosphere: Since the war, Shanghai, with its special circumstances, has created many opportunities for merchants. The enjoyment of life and extravagance in conduct have become unparalleled, creating an extremely vain and frivolous atmosphere in society. Japanese economic expert Yoshida Seiji, in his article "A Study of China's Price Problem," mentioned the scene of Shanghai people indulging in extravagant enjoyment and reckless spending at banquets at the International Hotel. I don't know if this is praise or sarcasm. Should people in wartime be indulging in extravagant enjoyment? And I think the characters in this picture are mostly officials and businessmen! As the war continues and resources become increasingly scarce, the savings movement is a widespread movement in warring countries, and the government is making great efforts to promote and publicize it. Officials and businessmen should reflect on this. I have also seen a trainee, not yet twenty years old, wearing a well-tailored suit, smoking a pipe, and acting important. Although everyone is free to choose their clothing preferences, the atmosphere encourages everyone to dress up to show their status, and therefore, they have to find other ways to make ends meet. Therefore, every organization, especially during this wartime, should refer to the New National Movement and the Savings Regulations in promoting the daily lives and activities of its employees. This will not only help the implementation of national policies but also have a significant impact on the atmosphere of the organization itself.

Encouraging Academic and Technical Research: The progress of all careers depends on continuous efforts and improvements. But we have seen that in many commercial organizations, all facilities have been the same for ten years, following the old rules and regulations as if they cannot be changed. This conservatism is a Chinese characteristic, but it is also laziness. The spirit of research is the most neglected aspect of current organizations. The belief is that simply piling up goods with money can make money, and there is no need to talk about adult education, accounting, or personnel management. In fact, good times will not last long. After the war, how will we survive in a competitive market? Zhu Zhixin once said, "An employee who does not read books is not loyal to his career." But we often see in newspapers that trainees and apprentices are often subjected to terrible and ruthless beatings for stealing time to read, which is infuriating. I believe that public opinion should awaken them to this fact. Trainees and apprentices should be instructed to study and make up for their lack of experience at the expense of the company, and employees should be encouraged to conduct research and write papers so that their valuable experiences in their careers can be passed on to others, or to publicly discuss and solve difficult problems. Therefore, larger organizations should have libraries and publications. Currently, prices of paper are very expensive, and there may be difficulties in resources, but now various industries have public associations, and this matter can also be handled by the associations. The content of publications can include announcements, notices, compilations of laws and regulations, news dissemination, which can avoid the cost and tediousness of many official letters. Discussions on certain issues, mutual visits and reports, personal lives, literary writing, and other interesting essays can all be included. Matters related to themselves will often feel particularly interesting and willing to approach. This can promote the connection of feelings between industries or colleagues, the introduction of knowledge, and the transmission of news. It is a very valuable undertaking. With the establishment of libraries and publications, employees can have their spirits supported and avoid external distractions, reducing many unnecessary social events and consumption. Personnel issues are complex and numerous. The above is just one aspect.

### How to Adjust the Coal Briquette Supply

Implement Price Controls, Improve Coal Quality

Recently, there has been panic regarding coal briquettes in this city. It seems that all coal factories, due to the authorities' price limits, have had to alter the materials used. For example, they increase costs through extra commissions and various pretexts. The actual quality of the coal is poor, like pebbles. It has no heating power and burns too quickly.

This situation is nothing more than the authorities' weak enforcement. Now the black market price will become the official price, and the coal quality is like pebbles. Who is responsible? It only increases the suffering of the people. The solution to the fuel problem urgently needs to be addressed. Regarding the improvement of coal quality, it is hoped that major coal merchants will retain some sense of public morality. This is the boundless hope of all citizens. (Jian Qing)

Distribute Coal Dust, Make Coal Briquettes

A recent newspaper reported, "Coal briquettes, an essential fuel for residents every day, are expected to become scarce soon. Many retail stores are selling them at prices higher than the controlled price, causing inconvenience to residents. This situation, if prolonged, will greatly impact people's livelihood and stability. Therefore, the authorities plan to implement a rationing system to meet legitimate needs." This shows that the authorities are concerned about people's livelihood, and the common people should be grateful.

However, I believe that the essence of coal briquettes is smokeless coal dust mixed with a small amount of soil to solidify it. There is no need for coal briquette factories to manufacture them. Once factories are involved in manufacturing, each ton requires about two hundred yuan in manufacturing costs, increasing the burden on residents. For the factories, they still incur losses. Therefore, there have been recent rumors of price increases. According to the raw material, smokeless coal dust, its price has remained around three hundred yuan since rationing began. This is because the authorities care about people's livelihood and are reluctant to increase it. The reason why coal briquettes have increased in price several times is solely due to increased manufacturing costs. If the authorities directly ration smokeless coal dust to residents and let them manufacture it themselves (the method is simple: take coal dust, add two-tenths of soil, add a little water, mix it, divide it into small pieces, and dry it in the sun or bake it with fire), it can save residents a great manufacturing cost burden. The authorities can then transfer the important materials used by coal briquette factories for manufacturing large quantities of coal briquettes – electricity, baking oil, hardware, etc. – to other more important uses. This is very consistent with the currently advocated conservation movement.

Furthermore, coal briquette manufacturers, citing losses, crudely manufacture coal briquettes. Half of their material is soil and coal refuse, and half is smokeless coal dust. Therefore, the heating power is low, and the consumption is high. Residents are full of complaints, hoping that the authorities will improve the situation. However, coal briquette manufacturers not only have no intention of improving but also frequently use the excuse of broken machinery to reduce production, creating a fuel panic to achieve their goal of raising prices. At the same time, they supply raw material coal dust to the black market (as reported in the September 8th news) or hoard large quantities, waiting for higher prices. These people only seek their own selfish desires, disregard the authorities' efforts, and the interests of the public. Their bad behavior is very hateful. If the authorities can redistribute smokeless coal dust to residents, it can not only reduce the burden on residents and save important materials but also quell part of the black market and eliminate fuel panic forever. It is truly a win-win situation.

Some might say that it is too troublesome for residents to manually manufacture coal briquettes. However, the current coal briquettes are of poor quality and lack viscosity, soon falling apart (some residents deliberately break them because broken pieces burn more easily). All of these require re-manufacturing, which is no different from making them yourself with coal dust. Moreover, coal dust can be placed anywhere, unlike coal briquettes, which must be stored indoors to prevent moisture. Residents can take it at any time to make high-quality fuel. Because the manufacturing method is simple, they will become skilled over time. I believe residents will not find it troublesome but will find it convenient.

However, coal briquette manufacturers and retail stores will inevitably close down as a result. Although it is a local problem, it is not a way to stabilize people's livelihood. The authorities should stipulate a legal profit margin, and the coal dust should still be supplied through them to maintain their business. This would be beneficial in every way.

On October 12th, the director of the Coal Association's Dajiao Affairs Bureau stated in the newspaper: "In this decisive battle, wasting resources is not allowed. This is naturally the right thing to do. Especially coal, as the most important resource in the decisive battle, must be used sparingly. Adjust consumption for non-essential items, those with substitutes, and those with room for savings." If this is true, then coal briquette factories' manufacturing of coal briquettes is almost extravagant and can be replaced by residents making them themselves. This may also be a benefit to the national economy and people's livelihood. It is hoped that the authorities will study this and society will encourage it. (Shuguang)

### Mr. Zhu Jiazhen's Scholarship Helps Education

Respectfully reported: Jiazhen is currently a senior student in the Chemistry Department of the Science College of Shanghai Jiaotong University. He recently received a letter from the school authorities saying, "Upon investigation of Wencong's academic performance during his studies at the school, he has been the top student in the entire college for the past three years, indicating his diligent study. We commend him greatly and specially award him a Rongyu (Honor) scholarship of 1,200 yuan to encourage him and hope that he will continue to work hard to improve his performance in the next semester, not lose the honor he has already obtained, and always be a model for his classmates. We have great expectations," etc. Jiazhen was initially happy upon receiving this, but then felt ashamed. He thought that he had been well-educated and cared for by his parents for twenty years, and that he was about to complete his university studies. Compared to those poor students who had to drop out due to financial difficulties, he already felt very fortunate. Now, with his foolish talent and fortunate grades, he has received funds from enthusiastic educators in society. Their original intention was to encourage young students to make progress, but Jiazhen felt uneasy. He remembered that his father had founded the family's student loan fund seven years ago. Although the scope was very small, it was the first to start the student loan trend in our family. This spring, due to financial constraints, new loans were stopped. All old loans to students who had not yet graduated were still issued on time. He often encouraged Jiazhen's sisters and brothers, saying, "This matter has been carried out for ten terms, but it has not yet fulfilled my aspirations. After you have established yourselves, you should continue to do it for me in the spirit of 'establishing oneself and helping others'." At this time, Jiazhen's educational needs were entirely dependent on his father's payment. The realization of his father's instructions was far away. However, considering his personal feelings and the family's current environment, especially his father's usual attitude in dealing with people, there was no reason to accept this scholarship. Therefore, he informed his father and decided to donate 600 yuan of the funds to the Shanghai Student Loan Fund and 300 yuan to the Xinwen Bao Student Loan Fund. The remaining 300 yuan was donated to your newspaper's educational assistance fund to promote the original intention of Mr. Zhao's scholarship. Jiazhen is deeply grateful and will study hard to live up to the expectations of enthusiastic people in society. Respectfully submitted by Zhu Jiazhen.
