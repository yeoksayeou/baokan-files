### Doctors and Patients

In the course of human life, illness is unavoidable. Illnesses arise from various causes and are of different types. To treat different types of illnesses, various methods tailored to the specific condition are required. Therefore, in theory, it is impossible for a doctor to be all-knowing and capable in every field of medicine. On the contrary, the more specialized the field, the more precise the knowledge and experience, the more confident the treatment. Medicine is a science, and research and discovery are endless. In modern scientifically advanced countries, medical discoveries are truly miraculous. Their contributions to human life are truly commendable. It can even be said that the speed of medical development is directly proportional to the decrease in human mortality rates.

China has a long history of medicine. However, the traditional habits of the Chinese people have always been conservative, and medicine is no exception. Since Western medical methods were gradually introduced in recent centuries, those who were quick to embrace change viewed traditional Chinese medicine as outdated. A heated debate once arose ten years ago. We will not discuss that issue here. However, if we think calmly, "things must rot from within before worms grow," and "the survival of the fittest" is a natural principle. It is regrettable that there are still no individuals with aspirations to study and organize traditional Chinese medicine using modern scientific methods and establish a valuable position for it in science. Therefore, for complex illnesses, only Western medical methods, with their dissection and analysis, can thoroughly point out the underlying causes.

As mentioned above, "the more advanced medicine is, the greater its contribution to human life." Then, the higher a doctor's knowledge and skills, the more confident one can be in preserving a patient's life. And a doctor's knowledge and skills must be honed through diligent and rigorous practice and clinical experience. For the sake of patients' lives and human happiness, we naturally hope that all doctors in society possess advanced knowledge and excellent skills. However, having knowledge and skills is not enough. Doctors also need medical ethics. What are medical ethics? Simply put, it is having a compassionate and caring heart that sees the patient's suffering as one's own, carefully considering the most effective treatment methods, and minimizing the patient's pain as much as possible.

Shanghai, with a population of over five million, has a relatively high rate of disease due to a general lack of attention to public health. There are also a large number of doctors, with both traditional Chinese and Western practitioners gathering here. Of course, there are many among them with genuine knowledge and skills and high medical ethics. However, there are also those who are half-baked, lack medical ethics, or are even outright charlatans. The public's mindset is also extremely restless, leading to frequent disputes between doctors and patients, even involving lawsuits, and rumors of various unexpected deceptions. We believe that this phenomenon is a real social problem that deserves attention.

First, we hope that all doctors in the city will strictly practice self-discipline, use their valuable knowledge and skills to serve patients, and emphasize medical ethics. This is a sacred profession that everyone respects.

Second, when the health authorities screen doctors, they should pay special attention to knowledge and skills, avoiding unqualified individuals who may harm patients.

Third, specialists in various fields who have genuine knowledge and skills should, when they believe surgery is necessary for a patient's condition but cannot guarantee absolute safety, explain this clearly to the patient. After the patient has considered and made a decision, they should treat the doctor as a member of the family and trust them completely.

Fourth, when judicial organs handle cases of doctors' negligence in their duties, the determination of negligence should be made by forensic doctors and, if necessary, by consulting impartial specialist doctors in the same field to carefully determine the extent of their responsibility as a basis for judgment. It is inappropriate to rely solely on common sense and conjecture to reach a verdict, lest doctors become disheartened with their profession.

Our medicine is still in its infancy in terms of scientific standing. We must not allow doctors with knowledge, skills, and a desire for research to be threatened by the adverse environment of society and abandon their medical research and contributions to human life. At the same time, we hope that these doctors will not succumb to the environment but will rise up together to create a bright future for the medical community and society!

### ### China, Japan, and Manchukuo Decide to Dispatch Goodwill Envoys to Each Other; Mr. Takahashi and Mr. Okawa to Come to China from Japan

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - During the second East Asia Groups Conference held in Hsinking this summer, China, Japan, and Manchukuo decided to dispatch goodwill envoys to each other. The Japanese side has decided to dispatch Admiral Sankichi Takahashi of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Advisor to the East Asia Liaison Headquarters, to North China and Mengjiang on the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Dr. Shumei Okawa, a legal scholar and member of the East Asia Liaison Headquarters Cooperation Association, will go to Central China as the first goodwill envoy, holding East Asia Grand Lecture Meetings in major cities. It has also been decided to dispatch an envoy to Manchukuo soon. China and Manchukuo are also scheduled to dispatch goodwill envoys to Japan in January and March of next year, respectively.

### ### Mr. Kurasu Delivers Speech at Yokusankai Hall, Exposing American War Plot

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Former Ambassador Kurasu, who was in charge of the Japan-U.S. negotiations, delivered a speech at 10:00 a.m. at the Yokusankai Hall to more than 300 leaders of local branches of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. The title of the speech was "Analysis of the White Paper on the Causes of the War by the United States." Using the U.S. Department of State's published white paper "Peace and War" as material, he analyzed and exposed the American white paper as a typical example of false propaganda, and criticized its contents on war and peace. In addition to explaining the distance and direct causes of the war in detail, he listed the policies of oppression against Japan taken by the United States since World War I. He pointed out three points not mentioned in the American White Paper: 1. The diplomatic pressure policy adopted by the United States for ten years after World War I, which formed the remote cause of this war; 2. The provocative policies of the U.S. government in the years before the outbreak of this war; 3. Various major distortions and concealments in the descriptions of the Japan-U.S. negotiations, etc., in order to crush American propaganda plots. Finally, he pointed out the reason for the lack of war aims in the United States, saying: According to the White Paper, the United States knew well in advance that economic oppression would inevitably lead to Japanese retaliation and develop into war. Indeed, before the outbreak of the war, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew cabled Roosevelt on November 3, warning that it was a mistake to prevent war in East Asia by means of economic oppression. Grew also considered the solidarity of the Japanese people and thought that this means would cause war. On November 17, Grew cabled again, warning of the urgency of the situation, but the U.S. government not only did not accept Grew's words, but instead of accepting Japan's proposal, presented the so-called final ultimatum on November 26 to oppress Japan. This policy of the U.S. government can't be said to be a scheme to create war. Ambassador Kurusu continued: On the 5th and 6th of last month, representatives of the six countries of Greater East Asia held the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo and issued the Greater East Asia Declaration, which can be said to be the great charter for the construction of Greater East Asia. We can see how frightening this fact is to the Anglo-American camp by trying to see how the Anglo-American camp is doing its best to make false statements about the truth of the Greater East Asia Conference in order to deceive its people. The British and Americans are deeply afraid that Japan will develop Greater East Asia's resources and increase its war power, and that the unity of the nations of Greater East Asia will become more and more consolidated and unshakeable. Therefore, under the slogan of not giving Japan a chance, they have repeatedly made fierce counterattacks from all sides. Before the Greater East Asia War, the United States repeatedly made propaganda not to sit idly by and watch the difficulties of the Chongqing regime. Later, the United States also pretended to be a model. Today, they have removed their masks and are completely devoted to protecting the interests of Britain and the United States themselves and making the Chongqing regime sell its life. Regarding the independence of the Philippines, Roosevelt submitted a message to Congress on the 16th, requesting authorization to advance the independence of the Philippines. We should read its message in detail. At the same time, can the Philippines be independent? Second, why not just say independence, but instead say the legal status of independence? By comparing this point with the fact that Cuba is legally a completely independent country, but the United States has leased the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, it is not difficult to see what the United States is up to. As for the Indian issue, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, when Cripps was sent to India by Britain, some people in the United States strongly advocated promoting Indian independence. For example, the six major labor organizations in the United States and one or two members of Congress said, "In order to achieve independence, the legal status of complete freedom and independence will be granted in order." They also said: "This independent status should be protected," and so on. We have deep doubts about this. First, the United States once argued that the Atlantic Charter could be applied to India, but the U.S. government suppressed this legitimate claim. However, the United States once fought for independence from Britain, driving its people to hinder the independence of India and Burma and engage in war. In summary, it can be seen that their war aims are full of contradictions.

### ### Italian Republic; Presents New Appearance; Drafting Men Enlist

Rome, 3rd (Central News Agency) - After the Badoglio regime surrendered, the Italian people fell into great chaos. After a period of hard work, the Fascist New Party was reorganized, preparing to hold a constitutional assembly, adopting social policies, and moving the main organs to northern Italy, all of which showed the new appearance of Italy. Head of State Mussolini has been planning the revival of Italy day and night.

### ### Japanese People; Strive to Save; Total Exceeds 100 Billion Yen

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese people continue to fight with an indomitable spirit. Even in terms of savings, they have achieved amazing results. The savings target for this year is 37 billion yen, which is expected to be exceeded. Since December, the promotion of the national savings movement in Japan has become more active. It is expected that after this year's target is achieved, the total amount of savings of the Japanese people in the seven years since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident will exceed 100 billion yen. The Japanese people's enthusiastic savings can compensate for the Japanese government's huge war expenditures in the past seven years, and the Japanese national finances can rely on it to be as stable as a rock. This 100 billion yen of savings, divided among the 100 million Japanese people, is about 1,000 yen per person. The efforts of the Japanese people can be seen here.

### Japanese Troops Fighting in Changde Inflict Heavy Blow on Chongqing; Dispatch Army Announces One Week of War Situation

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Chongqing army in Changde County, an important stronghold of the 6th War Zone, has been putting up a stubborn resistance for eight days since the elite Japanese troops entered the city. By the 3rd, due to the fierce attacks from the Japanese army and air force, their resistance seemed to have subsided. The Chongqing army's stubborn resistance for eight days is rare. The reasons for their stubborn resistance are as follows: The Chongqing military authorities mistakenly judged that the Japanese army's operation this time was only a deterrent operation, and never expected the Japanese army to attack the heart of the 6th War Zone. In the first phase of the operation, the Chongqing 73rd and 79th armies were defeated by the Japanese army. In the second phase of the operation, the Japanese army isolated the Chongqing 57th and 63rd divisions near Changde County and eventually wiped them out. The Chongqing army mistakenly judged that the Japanese army was fighting in the South Pacific and that battles were taking place in the Indian Ocean, and that there was no spare capacity to launch such a large-scale operation on the mainland front. Furthermore, the strength of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing was overestimated, and they were encouraged by the督战 of the British and American military leaders, hence this action. This operation has made the British, American, and Chongqing sides fully understand that no matter how fierce the South Pacific battle situation is, it will not affect the Japanese army's operations on the mainland. The Battle of Changde is a major blow to Chongqing's future resistance.

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Dispatch Army in China announced the war situation for one week on the 3rd as follows: The Japanese army attacking the western area of Dongting Lake has been advancing for two periods, and has defeated approximately 100,000 troops of the Chongqing Central Direct Line Army. A fierce attack was launched on Changde, an important stronghold held by the Chongqing army, and the Chongqing army is currently being cleared out within the city of Changde. Another strong Japanese unit besieged the Longyang area in an attempt to rescue Changde, but the two armies commanded by Zhang Hanming and Fang Xianjue, who attacked the Japanese army's flanks, launched an encirclement and annihilation battle everywhere on the 2nd, completely crushing their attempt. Furthermore, the Japanese army in the South China area has been carrying out a clean-up operation in the Fenjia Delta area since the 26th, defeating approximately 1,000 Chongqing guerrilla troops, achieving great results and achieving the intended goals. Furthermore, the Japanese aircraft cooperated with the ground troops and launched a surprise attack on Suichuan and Nanxiong on the 2nd, bombing Chongqing military facilities and runways at various airfields, and engaged in combat with more than a dozen P/40 and P/51 aircraft of the沦机, shooting down seven of them (four of which have not been confirmed). One B/25 aircraft on the ground was destroyed by bombing, and one Japanese aircraft self-destructed. Furthermore, on the 1st of this month, the Japanese Air Force intercepted more than a dozen B/25 and P/40 aircraft of the US and Chongqing air forces that attacked the Hong Kong area, and confirmed the downing of seven B/40 aircraft.

Japanese Aircraft Raids Suichuan and Nanxiong Airfields

Jiujiang, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch)

On the 2nd of this month, the Japanese Air Force stationed in China used a combined formation of bombers and fighters to bomb the Suichuan Airfield in Jiangxi Province and the Yuxiong Airfield in Guangdong Province, achieving great results. It is reported that on the afternoon of the 2nd, the Japanese Air Force used a combined formation of bombers and fighters to bomb Suichuan, engaging with dozens of enemy aircraft. As a result, a total of seven (P40) and (P51) aircraft were shot down, three of which have been confirmed and four of which have not been confirmed. Another two were seriously damaged and escaped. After defeating the enemy aircraft group, the Japanese bombers dropped a large number of bombs, causing great damage to the airfield's runway and important facilities, and also destroyed one small aircraft parked at the airfield. The Japanese side lost one self-destructed aircraft. At the same time, another Japanese air force team, still using a combined formation of fighter bombers, bombed the Nanxiong Airfield in Guangdong. Only a few ground fire responded, and the Japanese aircraft were able to drop bombs calmly, destroying the runway and one (B25) aircraft.

### German Troops Brave Wind and Snow; Defensive Battles Proceed Smoothly; Soviet Offensive on Northern Wing Thwarted

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: The weather on the Eastern Front continues to be harsh, with alternating rain and snow, making the roads muddy and difficult to travel, greatly hindering troop movements. However, on Wednesday, the German troops on the Southern and Central routes continued to launch fierce counterattacks. The German troops operating west of Smolensk achieved remarkable defensive victories against 28 Soviet infantry divisions and over 200 tanks. The German offensive in the Nevel River bend continues to make progress. The German Air Force's continuous bombing of Soviet artillery positions has greatly contributed to the German victory. There were only local military activities on the Crimean Peninsula and the Nikopol bridgehead.

Dnieper River Frontline Soviet Troops Greatly Reinforced

At the same time, the intensity of the Soviet offensive in the Great Dnieper River bend has decreased. The battles south and southwest of Kremenchu are becoming more active. The Soviet army has transferred strong reinforcements to the area, forcing the German army to retreat. However, all the temporary breakthroughs made by the enemy have been leveled by the German army's fierce attacks, and the main front lines remain firmly in the hands of the German army. The German counteroffensive launched on Tuesday in Cherkasy continues to make progress. A German group that had been surrounded in the area for several days has now been relieved and immediately joined the German counteroffensive. The Soviet army has been driven out of several strongly defended positions, and the battles in the area are still ongoing. There were no significant battles between Zhytomyr and Rzhyshchiv.

### Over One Month Since Establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India

The Provisional Government of Free India, led by Chandra Bose, has been established for more than a month since October 21st and is gradually entering the stage of combat with the goal of attacking Delhi. Reviewing the government's progress over the past month, its establishment in the international arena and the strengthening of the government and the Indian military and civilians themselves are quite noteworthy. Three days after the government's establishment, it was recognized by Japan and resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States. China, Manchuria, Germany, Italy, Burma, the Philippines, Croatia, Thailand, etc. also successively recognized it, and a total of nine countries have formed friendly relations. Leader Bose personally visited Tokyo, attended the Greater East Asia Conference, and swore together with representatives from various countries to implement the historical Greater East Asia Declaration. On the way home, he visited China and was treated as a state guest. He witnessed the reality of the new China and learned about the spirit and implementation of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, which stipulated Sino-Japanese friendship based on morality, further consolidating Leader Bose's determination for complete Indian independence and contributing to the establishment of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, there was also a lot of help in establishing the international status.

Regarding the government itself, after days of cabinet meetings, a simple and effective government structure, the daily advancement of combat operations, the creation of a capital to be stationed within India, and in order to ensure that the military and civilians of the National Army have no worries, a cabinet committee was established to establish a merit system and a support system for the families of the deceased.

Enthusiasm of the Indian People

After Prime Minister Tojo's previous statement to return the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the government's substantive power increased due to the acquisition of territory, further boosting the enthusiasm of Indians to support the government. The combination of human and material resources is gradually achieving practical results. As a result, the morale of the Indian people has suddenly become strong, posing a great threat to the enemy. According to New Delhi Radio, the strength of the National Army has recently become impossible to ignore, and they say that "the National Army is a puppet army forcibly formed." On the other hand, the British Indian Army does not trust Indian soldiers, and the Indian frontline troops are made to hand over to the Chinese troops stationed in India to cut off the intelligence work of the Indian army. This move is tantamount to admitting the increase in the National Army's courageous combat missions.

Indians who volunteered to join the National Army have been undergoing intense combat training every day, constantly shouting to attack Delhi. After Leader Bose returned from Japan and the various allied countries of East Asia with assurances of cooperation and support, this trend spread like wildfire, reducing the strength of Britain and the United States. The power of the Provisional Government of Free India, which aims to achieve complete Indian independence, is expected to develop further in the future.

### Japanese Military Achievements in the South Pacific Set New Historical Records; One of the Most Brilliant Pages in World War History

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The allied Japanese forces in the South Pacific have recently reported frequent victories. The people of our country are delighted and admire them, and are paying more attention to the continuation of the war situation in that area. Looking back at the great achievements made by the Japanese army in the past month, it is truly one of the most brilliant pages in world war history. From the naval battle off Mono Island on October 27th to the Fourth Air Battle off the Gilbert Islands on November 29th, the enemy's US warships damaged include: four battleships sunk, three large aircraft carriers, eight medium-sized aircraft carriers, nine large cruisers, twenty destroyers, two ships of unknown type, etc., two large aircraft carriers, three medium-sized aircraft carriers, five large cruisers, one cruiser, three medium-sized transport ships, two small transport ships, and many other boats. If the cost of building the ships is calculated, it is actually more than 10 billion US dollars, and the loss of personnel is also more than 20,000.

Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the United States had a total of 15 battleships, 5 aircraft carriers, 35 Class A and B cruisers, and 223 destroyers. In this one month, the United States has lost 40% of its battleships. Not only have all the aircraft carriers been completely lost, but also the ten newly built ones have been sunk. These figures exceed the total naval power lost by Germany and the Allied powers in the last World War and can be considered a new record for history. Before the outbreak of the war, the United States actively planned shipbuilding three times, including the "Vinson Act" and the "Stark Act," planning to complete 22 battleships, 18 aircraft carriers, 88 cruisers, 374 destroyers, and 194 submarines by the end of 1946. In order to complete this plan, the United States made great efforts to expand shipyards, train skilled workers, and collect materials. But last year, it adopted a completely авиационоцентрический approach, converting battleships, cruisers, merchant ships, etc. into aircraft carriers, so its shipbuilding plan has undergone some changes. Now estimating its total strength, it has 30 battleships, 20 to 25 aircraft carriers, 10 to 15 auxiliary aircraft carriers, 89 cruisers, 374 destroyers, and 193 submarines.

Assuming that the US shipbuilding plan is scheduled to be completed in 1946 and can be fully completed by the end of this year, if the US warships sunk by the Japanese army since the Pearl Harbor attack are counted, including 17 battleships, 27 aircraft carriers, 82 cruisers, 84 destroyers, and 128 submarines, and deducted from its total number, then the US Navy will only have 13 battleships, about 10 aircraft carriers including inferior auxiliary aircraft carriers, 7 cruisers, 290 destroyers, and 65 submarines left. Even if the number of its warships is greater than what people estimate, the fact is that the United States still needs to use a large number of auxiliary ships to transport and aid British and Soviet supplies and must be fixedly deployed in the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, the strength of the Pacific Joint Fleet currently commanded by Admiral Nimitz must be far less than before the war. Moreover, almost every ship has been fiercely attacked by the Japanese navy and air force and is covered with wounds. Therefore, in fact, the fleet he commands is too dilapidated to withstand a single blow.

In order to attempt to dominate the world, Roosevelt did not hesitate to bet the entire country on a single throw. But his choice of the loyal and brave Japanese soldiers as his opponents can be said to be his greatest misfortune. The reason why the US War Department does not hesitate to make such a great sacrifice in an attempt to break through a corner of the Pacific Ocean in order to approach the Japanese mainland is because it realizes that the production number of the US domestic military industry has reached its highest limit. No matter how much effort it makes to mobilize resources and labor, it will not be able to increase it any further. On the other hand, in the past two years, Japan has been actively developing southern resources and striving to increase production at a high speed, so its production capacity is now comparable to that of the United States. By 194趨勢, therefore, if the war is prolonged, the United States will inevitably fall into a situation from which it cannot extricate itself, and the facts are extremely obvious.

### Germany Prepares to Use Rockets to Bomb Britain Across the Channel; Berlin Suffers Another Terrible Air Raid

Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Swedish Aftonbladet reported on the 1st that Germany will bomb Britain with 火剪炸弹.

The German defenders repelled three British attacks, and then withdrew to the rear positions in order to save troops. At the same time, the US Fifth Army, commanded by General Clark, launched an offensive on the west wing on Wednesday after a long period of replenishment. Assisted by three destroyers, it bombarded the German positions along the coast of Terracina. But when the German grenade炮 returned fire, the three enemy ships disappeared into the smoke screen. Active battles took place along the wide front line along the lower Garigliano River.

### Japanese Army Spokesman Discusses Cairo Conference; A Public Communiqué Like an Idiot's Dream

Central News Agency News - The spokesman of the Japanese Army Propaganda Department, when receiving reporters yesterday (3rd), spoke about the intentions of the Chiang Kai-shek Cairo talks.

The Failure of the Talks is Fully Exposed

Briefly stated: After Chiang Kai-shek and his wife participated in the so-called Cairo Conference, they returned to Chongqing on December 1st with more than a dozen attendants. The propaganda freedom of the Chongqing side seems to have been completely deprived by Britain and the United States. The propaganda of Chiang Kai-shek after returning to Chongqing is not worth listening to. From the communiqué issued after the closing of the Cairo Conference, compared with the East Asia Joint Declaration of our side, which is based on righteousness, it is truly known as an idiot's dream, and there is a great difference. The failure of the Cairo Conference is fully exposed by this. Originally, the Cairo Conference came from the strategy of Britain and the United States. At the beginning, there was enthusiastic propaganda, saying that Stalin would also participate, but the result ended in failure. Because the continuous disastrous defeats of Britain and the United States in the Pacific Ocean had a great impact on the anti-Axis people, how to save it, especially the independence of Burma and the Philippines, the establishment of the Provisional Government of India, the Sino-Japanese Alliance, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and other news, which were successively spread, their embarrassed and difficult situation is truly undeniable. At this time, how to prevent the Chongqing side from leaving the camp is the main purpose of this meeting. From this, it can also be seen that Britain and the United States are anxious and uneasy about the Greater East Asia War. The communiqué of the conference will inevitably become the甘饵 of irresponsible shackles on the Chongqing side, but I am afraid it will be difficult for people of reason on the Chongqing side to believe it.

No Progress on Any Battlefield

Their anxiously awaited counter-offensive operation against Japan has been slow to make progress on any battlefield. The counter-offensive in Burma is only propaganda. Apart from sacrificing the Chongqing army on the Yunnan border, there has been no development. Britain claims that preparations have not been completed, which is ridiculous. The offensive in the Pacific has also entered the Japanese army's designated area, and the damage to the US army is not the same as in the past. Moreover, the US troops landing on Tarawa Island and Makin Island in the Gilbert Islands have become the target of the Japanese army's attrition warfare. In the future, in order to maintain its face, the United States will inevitably seek to replenish urgently, but this is exactly what the Japanese army hopes for. How long can the United States endure is truly a question. As for the battlefield in China, the occupation of Changde, the stronghold of the 6th War Zone Army, is only a matter of time. At present, the remnants of the defeated Chongqing army are being cleared out of the city. The counter-offensive of the Chongqing army seems to be quite stubborn. This is because Changde City has been occupied by the Japanese army, and the retreat of the Chongqing army has been completely cut off, so it is bound to be stubbornly resisted. As a result, the achievements of the Japanese army are increasing day by day. Although the US Air Force occasionally dispatches to assist the Chongqing army in combat, due to their unfamiliarity with the geography, they often mistakenly bomb the Chongqing army. Furthermore, some troops from the 9th and 7th War Zones have also come to support, and they are currently being defeated one by one. In short, Changde is the first area attacked by the Japanese army and the key to entering Chongqing. Its fate is strategically important, and its impact on both the spiritual and material sides is also extremely significant.

### Minister Hirota's Review: The Current Stage of the War - The Axis' Short-Term War Plan is Hopeless

Central News Agency Dispatch: Mr. Hirota, the Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, gave a speech yesterday (the 3rd) at 3 PM at the joint press conference held by the Army and Navy in Shanghai, commemorating the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. He reviewed the achievements of the past two years, examined the current state of the war, and discussed future prospects. The details are as follows:

Wartime Experience

Mr. Hirota began by stating, "The 8th of this month marks the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. We plan to hold grand celebrations on that day. Looking back on our achievements over the past two years, and in light of the current stage of the war and future prospects, I would like to make a simple review. The Greater East Asia War has already lasted two years. This period is relatively short; the Sino-Japanese War had already lasted four and a half years before the Greater East Asia War. Germany has also been fighting in Europe for two wars. Therefore, both Japan and Germany have considerable wartime experience. Japan has been at war for six and a half years, and Germany for over four years. Thus, our Axis powers have already engaged in large-scale operations in the ongoing world war. The progress made in these two years is only a small part of a long-term war. Conversely, the politicians of the opposing anti-Axis powers have been telling their people that the current war will be a long-term one. This contradicts their previous statements about a short-term war. The anti-Axis powers believed that the areas occupied by Japan were rich in resources. If Japan were to develop and utilize these resources, its strength would increase, and it would be difficult for Britain and the United States to defeat Japan. Therefore, they tried to deny Japan any time to develop these resources. According to the British and American politicians, these statements are full of contradictions that anyone can see.

Contradictory Theories

Mr. Hirota continued to analyze the contradictions of enemy politicians, saying that the anti-Axis powers' attempt to deny Japan time meant they were admitting they would be defeated by Japan. This is a fact. Therefore, the theory of launching a long-term war is contradictory. Looking back at the recent military strength of Britain and the United States, especially their air raids in the South Pacific, it is evident that they do not want a long-term war and hope to end it quickly. Their true intention was to prevent Japan from developing the resources of the South Pacific and gaining sufficient strength. However, this plan of Britain and the United States has completely failed. Britain and the United States were defeated at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. The resources of the South Pacific are now occupied by Japan. The attempt to counterattack in the South Pacific has also been defeated. Therefore, estimating the results of the Pacific operations in the two years since the Greater East Asia War began, the enemy has suffered heavy losses, with 17 battleships and 28 aircraft carriers sunk. The number of other ships damaged is more than double the above figures. On our side, the losses have been small. In the past two years, only one battleship and two aircraft carriers have been sunk.

Ratio of War Results

According to our recent war records, the ratio of war results is such that for every battleship or aircraft carrier of Britain or the United States sunk, we only need to destroy three or four enemy aircraft. Therefore, despite such significant sacrifices by the enemy, they continue to exaggerate their propaganda, wanting to recapture the South Seas, the Pacific, the Gilbert Islands, the Ellice Islands, and Tarawa Island, and trying to secure the islands of Makin and Apamama. These two islands are extremely small, only two and a half kilometers long and half a kilometer wide, yet they are concentrating their attacks on them. However, so far, they are only conducting air raids and have not launched any active attacks. They continue to exaggerate their propaganda, claiming to be seizing one island after another, in order to attack the Japanese mainland. Judging from the situation in the past, even if they were able to achieve their goals, it would require an extremely great loss and take tens of times more damage and time. The number of battleships and aircraft carriers that the United States has lost so far is roughly equal to the number they had built before the Greater East Asia War. If they want to expand their naval fleet further, it will take a considerable amount of time. According to experts in battleship construction, it takes three years to build a battleship and one and a half years to build an aircraft carrier. Therefore, the time it will take for them to build the fleet they need to attack Japan is unknown, and this task will be even more difficult to complete.

Japan has the Advantage

From this, it can be seen that their long-term war is even more difficult to realize, while the strength of the Japanese army can be realized. The longer the war lasts, the faster the strength of the Japanese army will recover. It is becoming increasingly clear that the Greater East Asia War is advantageous to Japan. Therefore, this is a truly favorable condition for Japan. At the same time, the situation in the European theater can be said to be the same. The anti-Axis powers are extremely eager to end the war quickly, and there are many reasons why they do not want a long-term war. However, Germany has already completed its long-term war plan, so the anti-Axis powers' attempts to end the war with Germany quickly have also failed. Germany has adopted the shortest front line on the Eastern Front, making it easier to defend and difficult for the enemy to attack, which is geographically advantageous. To ensure security, the entire front line has been fortified. The anti-Axis British and American forces attacking Italy have made no special progress in the three months since they launched their offensive against the Italian mainland in early September of this year, so there has been no special development. From Germany's perspective, the number of anti-Axis troops attacking is quite small, only a few divisions. Moreover, special attention is being paid to the Dodecanese Islands and the islands in the Aegean Sea between Greece and Turkey, such as Rhodes and Samos. All of these major islands have been occupied by German forces. With this occupation, the British and American forces have been unable to occupy major areas such as Greece, and they can no longer pass through the Dardanelles Strait to reach the Black Sea. Therefore, in the Eastern European theater, the Italian front, and the Balkan front, the anti-Axis powers have achieved no special results. The anti-Axis powers' exaggerated and reckless claims of resolving the German issue within a few years have also been dashed. Therefore, looking at both the Greater East Asia War and the European War, the anti-Axis powers' short-term war plans are completely hopeless, while the Axis powers' victory in a long-term war is gradually being realized and completed. As we approach the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, we are presenting these reasons, which are only a very small part of what has been achieved in the long-term war over the past two years."

Economic Review

### The Center of Industry

As the authorities order all large and small factories in this city to increase industrial production, we wish to address the issue of "The Center of Industry" as a subject for research on the problem of increasing production. Originally, the world's large industries are the result of increased pressure, but China's industry is still in its infancy, and there is basically no large industry to speak of. Therefore, those who are increasing industrial production today can only focus on light industry and home handicrafts, and cannot talk about large or heavy industry. This is a regrettable aspect of the wartime industrial production increase movement, and we must admit it.

We note that a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 2nd stated that Manchuria's heavy industry has been making rapid progress recently. The amount of steel produced, the massive power generation capacity of power plants, and the entry of the artificial soybean oil industry into the era of formal enterprises are all admirable. We consider it something to be hoped for but unattainable, and Manchuria's heavy industry is leaping forward, while its machinery and chemical industries are also developing at an alarming rate, and is rapidly advancing from the raw materials industry to the finished products industry. Looking back at China, we still feel far behind, and we cannot help but sigh!

According to Marx's theory, the world's large industries rely on production, and production relies on capitalists. This is indeed true. However, China's largest industry in the past was the Hanyeping Company. It had good copper and iron production and ample capital, but it still failed. This shows that the center of industry is not only in the factories that produce goods, but also in the consuming society. Therefore, the world's large industries in modern times manufacture goods according to the needs of consumers. Therefore, we feel that the key to strengthening the base of production lies in strengthening the consuming society, that is, solving the problem of people's livelihoods. Otherwise, expanding production is unrealistic. In short, the center of industry relies on the consuming society.

### Special Deposits Exempt from Reserve Requirements, Financial Inspection Office Specifies Eight Types

Since the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank began handling the business of inspecting financial institutions, progress has been exceptionally smooth. All financial institutions (including banks, native banks, and trust companies), in addition to submitting monthly statements to the office for inspection on schedule, have also deposited reserve funds for fixed-term, current, and special current deposits in accordance with the regulations of the Provisional Measures for Managing Financial Institutions and the Detailed Implementing Rules. The office then determines the deposit reserve fund to be paid based on the deposit amount listed in the monthly statements submitted by the financial institutions, and notifies them to deposit it with the Central Reserve Bank. If the total amount of deposits of each financial institution increases or decreases monthly, the reserve funds can be withdrawn and paid at any time. It is learned that the nature of the special deposit items are regulated. The following types of deposits are exempted from reserve requirements if it is determined that they are truly to be paid out within a short period of time after verification: Deposits from fellow financial institutions, internal transfers, temporary deposits and miscellaneous deposits, entrustments from fellow financial institutions, unmatured bills, savings for war personnel, frozen foreign currency deposits, and other funds collected as an agent.

### Central China Rawhide Company to Collect Cowhides

The Central China Rawhide Joint Stock Limited Company, jointly organized by members of the Shanghai Special Municipal Rawhide Industry Association and members of the Japanese Rawhide Industry Association in Central China, has begun operations. Although the purchase of cowhides has not been decided due to price issues, it will be implemented soon. The purchase area will especially focus on Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. However, the market price of cowhides is different from the past, so the purchase price needs to be carefully considered.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the rise in Chinese stocks intensified, with market prices soaring all day. The entire day was dominated by buying, and only slightly cooled off in the last half hour before the close, due to some short-term retail investors taking profits. Old and new stocks in the financial sector saw substantial inflows, and trading was brisk. The situation of each industry stock and the final closing price are briefly described below:

Department Stores: Wing On Company rose first and then fell back. National Goods Company also increased significantly. Sincere was stable. Innerwear rose by more than two yuan. Xinhua and Guanghua Department Stores each rose by half a yuan. Lane Crawford rose by more than one yuan.

Textiles: Wing On Textile rose by about one yuan. China Textile, Sincere, Rongfeng, Tongfeng, and Lunhua all rose by several yuan. Mayer & Co. rose by six yuan.

### Written Before the Implementation of Coal Ball Rationing

— Cheng

According to reports, the Bureau is actively planning to implement coal ball rationing as early as possible. This is undoubtedly good news for us petty citizens of the working class. However, considering that the rationing of several essential goods in the past did not meet our expectations, with regard to the upcoming coal ball rationing! We hope that the authorities can plan comprehensively and especially hope that the following points can be achieved within the possible scope.

Quantity Since coal balls lack substitutes, and the rice, vegetables, water, and all hot food items of Shanghai residents are mostly prepared using coal ball stoves, the rationing quantity must meet the minimum needs of the general public. According to the author's investigation, the average household with approximately ten people consumes about forty to fifty "dan" of coal per month. In other words, each person needs about forty to fifty "jin" per month. Therefore, if the amount rationed by the authorities is too different from this, the citizens will inevitably find ways to obtain it from other sources. In this way, it may be difficult to suppress the demand in the black market. Furthermore, even if it can be suppressed, how will the fuel problem for millions of citizens be solved? Conversely, panic will naturally be eliminated, and the black market will have no reason to exist. To achieve this, it is hoped that the Bureau will actively ensure the smooth flow of raw material sources and restrict unnecessary consumption.

Quality In addition to coal dust, yellow mud and other ingredients are mixed into the production of coal balls, and there is a fixed ratio for this. However, recently, due to the coal ball panic, some manufacturers have resorted to their old trick of taking advantage of the situation to make a profit by cutting corners. The originally black coal balls have now turned gray, and they are not durable and consume a lot of fuel when burning. Users suffer greatly from this. After the implementation of rationing, it is hoped that the authorities will set certain standards for the composition of coal balls and send personnel to various manufacturers to investigate at any time. If any manufacturers are found to be cutting corners, they should be severely punished to prevent others from following suit.

Price Of course, it is hoped that the selling price can best maintain the previous price limit, but if it is indeed necessary to increase it slightly due to cost factors, it is also acceptable. I believe that the public will definitely not oppose a reasonable price increase. However, frequent changes and price increases are most undesirable, because the price increase of rationed goods is most likely to stimulate the rise of general prices. This is proven by the past, and it can be known that this statement is not false.

Collection Points Coal balls are not as convenient as rice, flour, sugar, soap, etc. Each quantity is in the tens or hundreds of "jin," and they are unusually bulky, making collection very inconvenient. Therefore, the collection points should be as close as possible to the residences of the collectors to facilitate convenience. Do not make the distance too far, like with sugar, which only increases the troubles of the people.

In addition, it is hoped that the determination of the number of rationing times per month, the management of distribution points, etc., will be strictly and reasonably formulated to ensure that the coal ball rationing this time is ideally successful. At the same time, it is hoped that the management of other rationed items can also be gradually improved so that the lives of us common people can be stabilized, which would be fortunate indeed.

### A Record of the Grandeur of Liu Haisu's Art Exhibition, with a Gift of Thirty Rhymes by the Famous Painter Wang Xian

Mr. Liu Haisu's calligraphy and painting exhibition has been held at the China Book Garden on Chengdu Road since the 30th of last month. Since the opening of the exhibition, it has been a grand occasion. The Chinese paintings "Wind, Urgency, and Rain in the Country," "Group of Cattle in the Country," "Emerald Autumn Landscape," "A Pair of Piebald Horses," and "Fisherman's Circle," and the oil paintings "Coconut Grove by the Sea," "Warm," "Cockfight," and other recent works by Bai Ma are particularly eye-catching to the audience. Collectors from home and abroad have come to the exhibition to order works, and more than thirty works have already been ordered. It is heard that there is still one week left in the exhibition period, and those who admire Mr. Liu's art and fellow artists all want to see it as soon as possible. In recent days, the literary and art circles have sent letters to Mr. Liu to express their congratulations and admiration. The famous painter Mr. Wang Xian has specially composed a long poem of thirty rhymes to present to Mr. Liu, criticizing Mr. Liu's art and personality, which can be passed down forever. A special excerpt is as follows:

Haisu creates paintings with natural sounds, his heart is magnificent and filled with strange wonders. He treads the path of calligraphy and painting, encompassing the essence, uniquely creating a realm beyond the ordinary. It is difficult to categorize him into a specific school, his casualness lightly overcomes difficulties. He draws on the inspiration of Gauguin and Matisse, combining Shi Tao and Bada, forging them into one furnace, with a spirit of ancientness, novelty, and universality. His spirit is entrusted to something that will never decay, a small mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru, a form unrestrained and unfettered. Living in a remote corner is also carefree, drawing essence in the night, like riding a horse flying with a long lance. He befriends the ancients, indulging in wild gestures, destruction and praise are left to others without hindrance, what regret is there in returning after tribulations? He regards everything outside the paper as worn-out shoes. Today, there are thousands of calligraphers and painters, how many can truly understand? When discussing painting with me, he seeks the ultimate, the governor of Yunnan is enlightened and praises him (the realm of learning is boundless, success is always just a little bit short, I am lazy and my heart is not lax, I smile at you and relieve my narrowness. Do not let the sun and moon press upon your eyes, the book is completed suddenly, cultivating the wind and the wind, do not boast together in one word, go against the current and never retreat.

### Soliciting Donations for Making Winter Clothes, an Opportunity for Those Aspiring to Help the Poor

The cold winter with its piercing north wind is approaching in the blink of an eye. The homeless people on the streets and lanes, and the hidden poor who lack winter clothes, will undoubtedly freeze to death. In the past, when prices were low, it was easy to purchase clothes everywhere. Those with slightly better living conditions, seeing the misery, would feel compassion and donate clothes. This year, cotton cloth and cotton are under control. There is a shortage of clothing makers, and it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain clothes temporarily. Even if there are manufacturers and retailers, the cost is high, at least two hundred and sixty or seventy yuan per garment. Recognizing this, the Shanghai News has partnered with the Shanghai Buddhist Charity Kitchen to apply to the Commercial Control Association for the allocation of raw materials. The cost per garment is about one hundred and sixty yuan, and the size and amount of cotton are detailed in the newspaper's report on the 28th of last month. It is estimated that there are still 1,800 garments without sponsors. Therefore, this announcement is made to solicit donations from all sectors of society. The methods are as follows:

The cost of making each garment is one hundred and sixty yuan, payable in full in advance. (Collection point: Shanghai News Social Services Department) The number of garments donated ranges from one to one hundred for individuals, and the number for organizations will be discussed separately. The total number is limited to 1,800 garments. However, donors must not profit from the resale of the garments. Even if they are transferred, the price must not exceed the original price of one hundred and sixty yuan. The date for collecting the garments will be announced in this column after the cotton clothes are made. Cotton clothes can be exchanged for the receipt at this newspaper.

### Foguang Sanatorium Establishes Free Outpatient Department

Residents of the Eighth District who are indeed poor and sick can register at the hospital's registration office every morning. The hospital will assign a specialist doctor to provide treatment without charging a consultation fee, which is truly an innovative initiative.

### Loan Soap Vending Method with Soap Factory

Any small vendors without operating capital need only provide a store guarantee of five hundred to one thousand yuan, or a proof letter from the Social Service Department of the Shen Bao, and they can apply to the factory for credit to sell goods. After the factory accepts the guarantee or guarantee, it will lend soap to them at the lowest price for them to set up a stall or sell by hand. However, every night, the proceeds from the sales must be returned to the factory according to the principal, and then the sold-out goods will be replenished for sale the next day. Those who are responsible for the loan, if the soap sales are particularly good every month, in addition to making a profit, the factory can also give a monthly allowance of 200 yuan. If it is not possible to obtain a guarantor, it is also possible to submit a considerable amount of credit or cash guarantee. As long as the goods are paid, the guarantee or cash can be returned at any time. This method can be contacted at Sanxing Soap Factory, No. 17 Xinshi Market, 954 Muming Road, Jing'an Temple Road.

### Old Newspapers Can Be Made into Coal Ball Substitutes

Accidentally, in an old magazine, I found an "Old Newspaper Utilization Method." I thought that the prices must have been low at that time and it must not have been taken seriously; but at this time of high prices due to the lack of coal balls, we need it very much. Now I will extract it and introduce it to you, readers, you can imitate it in large quantities: "First soak the old newspaper in water to make it thoroughly wet, and then shape it into balls to light the fire. The firepower is very strong and can be used for cooking. If you accumulate a month's worth of newspapers, it will not be difficult to use them for a week's worth of cooking. If you put in a little more effort, mix in the enemy's dry soil and knead it into charcoal, then it will have the same uses as coal." (Yu Jing)

### Lament of a Poor Scholar

I regret studying too hard in those years, the solitary lamp accompanied me through long nights. If I had known that the court valued talent lightly, why would I have focused so much on strategy in the window of the study? I am left with deep sorrow filling my chest, ashamed of not contributing to the community. How can I bear to see the late yellow flowers, the wind is strong, the sky is high, and the days are getting shorter!

In my youth, I had lofty ambitions looking towards Yunmeng. The years passed by, and I am now plowing with my pen. In the future, I will share the blessings of the window, and I will have no blessings in this life to wait for the Yellow River to clear. I embellish empty words to the extreme, and the roads of the world are bumpy and I strive in vain. I have words of tears before the wine: why were you so eager for fame in those years? (Wang Zibin)
