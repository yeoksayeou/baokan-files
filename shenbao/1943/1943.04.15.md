### Economic Forces Supporting the War

The term "total war" has been heard and seen frequently lately. Indeed, in modern warfare, the factors determining victory or defeat are not solely military. Politics, economics, education, and culture all play significant roles. Among these, the most crucial is whether economic strength can sustain the war effort. Otherwise, victory is impossible.

A nation must have a guiding principle for its establishment. Based on this principle, it determines its economic policies. All economic activities that implement these policies must align with the nation's founding principle. This is fundamental. Therefore, the foundation of a wartime economy must be laid during peacetime to ensure its stability. The peacetime economic organization should aim to meet wartime needs, truly achieving a state where peacetime is like wartime, and wartime is like peacetime.

If the peacetime economic organization is prepared for wartime needs, entering wartime will not be overly difficult. Moreover, the heightened wartime morale of the people may lead to unexpected achievements. Observing the wartime economic situations of Japan and Germany demonstrates how their peacetime economic organizations prepared for the onset of war, achieving the effect of economic power supporting military operations. The Soviet Union is similar.

German Propaganda Minister Goebbels once said, "The Bolshevik rulers, with their rigorous methods, concealed their national situation, leading us to underestimate their war potential at the beginning of the war. Today, the magnitude of their war power is revealed externally. Therefore, we must now engage with them with the power of the entire nation." Although Germany, with its excellent strategies, sharp weapons, and unified national mobilization, will eventually make it difficult for the Soviet Union to resist. However, the magnitude of the Soviet Union's economic power cannot be underestimated. This further proves how the Soviet Union's peacetime economic organization established the foundation for wartime needs and integrated peacetime and wartime economies, demonstrating its strength. Calmly and objectively, when assessing other nations, we must be thorough. Even if we fundamentally oppose their ideology, their economic infrastructure, with its peacetime preparations for wartime, is worth learning from. We must study the essence of their successful economic construction, catch up, and adapt to our wartime needs. Here are a few principles:

Firstly, in terms of increasing production: Factories should be prepared for relocation, with the movement of machinery and designated destinations planned. A factory that would take a year to build in peacetime can be completed in a month during wartime. Even before the factory is fully built, the machines are already running. This not only avoids hindering production but also increases output.

Regarding land: Previously uncultivated land and crops unsuitable for cultivation are rapidly developed and researched for alternative planting during wartime, ensuring no land remains barren.

Promoting increased production efficiency through production competitions is a good approach. Initiated by factories or farms, with workers and farmers spontaneously participating, this often results in output exceeding the original figures several times over. Attention must be paid to talent training. In wartime industrial zones, establish more training classes, targeting youths aged fifteen to eighteen. When existing workers serve in the military, they are replaced by trainees. This ensures that production volume is not affected.

Secondly, in terms of conserving consumption: This must be absolute and thorough, with restrictions even on travel and communication, eliminating all unnecessary waste.

We are merely presenting a few principles based on our thoughts. Our main desire is that the government recognizes the importance of economic power in supporting the war, broadly adopts the successful methods of advanced countries, considers the current environment, and rapidly strengthens the wartime economic system. This would fully utilize the effectiveness of "total war" to jointly strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War with our ally Japan.

### Special Envoy to Japan, Chen Gongbo, Arrives Back in Beijing Yesterday, Issues Statement Upon Departure from Tokyo, Solemnly Declares Determination to Dedicate All National Strength to the Greater East Asia War

Beijing, 14th (Central News Agency) – Our country's special envoy to Japan, Chen Gongbo, formerly represented China in expressing gratitude to the Japanese government and public and declaring the firm determination to solidify Sino-Japanese cooperation. Having completed his significant mission, he arrived back in Beijing on the afternoon of the 14th.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – Since his visit to Japan on the 7th, Chen Gongbo, our country's special envoy to Japan, has met with Prime Minister Tojo, Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs Aoki, and key figures in the Japanese government, holding cordial talks on issues of strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation. Having completed his mission, he departed from Haneda Airport on the 13th, heading for Keijo, and arrived back in Beijing on the 14th. Upon his departure from Tokyo, Mr. Chen issued the following statement: "Upon the order of the National Government, I visited Japan and was deeply honored to be received by the Emperor, and I am extremely grateful. I am also deeply grateful for the solemn hospitality of Prime Minister Tojo and the Cabinet Ministers, as well as the warm welcome from the Japanese people. After China's participation in the war, we immediately issued a statement to share hardship and life and death with Japan to accomplish the historical mission of completing the Greater East Asia War and liberating East Asia. Japan has also implemented the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions, treating China not only as a friend but as a brother. I firmly believe that this action is rooted not only in the common interests of the two countries but also in a spirit that transcends vested interests, binding the two nations together. This spirit has been clearly demonstrated in Japan's new policy towards China and is gradually being realized, for which we are truly grateful. China also vows to consolidate unity, dedicate all national strength, and spare no political, economic, or cultural contributions to advance the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the great undertaking of constructing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This visit to Japan has allowed me to witness the resolute spirit of the Japanese government and public under the determination to win the war, for which I am immensely grateful. I firmly believe that Japan's lofty sense of justice and enthusiastic attitude towards China demonstrate the inevitability of Greater East Asia's coexistence and co-prosperity. It also inspires China's self-strengthening efforts and enhances the concept of trust in Japan. I am particularly deeply moved to be appointed as the National Government's special envoy during this phase of the unfolding of a new epoch-making relationship between China and Japan and feel an immense honor. I firmly believe that if China and Japan can become close brothers, continuing to support each other, it will not only be for the happiness of the Chinese and Japanese people but also for the happiness of the world."

### Vice Minister Liao Discusses Current Situation of Construction Department's Administration

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) – Under the wartime system, the National Government has established specific wartime construction policies to seek multifaceted production and has established a central construction administrative organization, merging the former Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Water Resources into the Ministry of Construction. It has been two months since its establishment. To understand various issues related to wartime construction, a reporter visited Director Liao Jianan of the Ministry of Construction, who answered the questions raised. The following is a record: (1) Current situation of the Construction Department's administration since its establishment: Since its establishment, the department has made initial progress in adjusting personnel, revising regulations, and advancing work. Subsequent plans for the progress of the department's undertakings can be broadly divided into adjustment matters and implementation matters, both of which are being actively pursued. As for the local construction undertakings of various provinces and cities, the department is also very concerned, hoping that they can adapt to the needs of the times and the environment and advance in cooperation and unity. (2) Key points of wartime construction: Since our country's participation in the war, everything has entered the wartime system. Construction undertakings should be prioritized, concentrating efforts, and advancing gradually. Therefore, in addition to the regular river maintenance and flood prevention, the current plans include the issue of dredging and reclaiming in Jiangnan, the issue of opening new canals in Jiangbei, the improvement project of Furong Embankment in Jiangsu Province, the repair of Huayang River Sluice in Anhui Province, supervising various counties during the agricultural slack season to mobilize labor for the repair and management of farmland water conservancy, and the training of water conservancy technicians, etc., some of which have already begun, while others are being designed. (3) Urban construction issues: Since its establishment, the department has been carefully planning urban construction issues to meet the needs. The designs include the construction of affordable housing and water plants, smoothing urban traffic, promoting urban sanitation facilities and public utilities. All public construction related to people's livelihood and welfare are the key elements of the facilities, hoping to solve the current urban problems of people's housing, transportation, and the various necessary facilities in daily life. (4) Road administration, postal and telecommunications, and other road-related issues, such as the improvement of railway transportation, the construction and maintenance of highways to facilitate the flow of goods and benefit merchants and travelers, the reorganization of postal services, as the current economic situation of post offices is extremely difficult, how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and how to ensure smooth telecommunications in various regions to assist economic development, are also being promoted. In addition, the reorganization of the shipping industry and the promotion of maritime administration will make water transportation healthier. However, the above-mentioned work may be carried out by the department alone or require the cooperation of local and other parties, and it may be successfully completed in a short period of time or require a considerable amount of time. It also requires considerable manpower and material resources to be carried out. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between urgency and needs and gradually realize them. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will rise up together and cooperate in the government's new undertakings so that they can achieve the expected results and assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War.

### Current Situation of Administration in North China (I): Establishing Security and Completing the War Participation System

The North China Political Affairs Commission, in order to adapt to the changes in Japan's policy towards China, convened the first meeting of North China Provincial and Municipal Mayors after the reorganization at the end of March. Chairman Zhu Shen described his views on how to promote North China's wartime policies under the current situation as follows:

The total strength of a country is the integration of the national strength of the entire nation, so the stability of people's livelihood cannot be ignored. The stability of people's livelihood is tied to the security and the guarantee of people's food. These two are the fundamental elements of a country. The establishment of security and the regulation of food are the responsibilities of the authorities. Various studies are underway regarding its countermeasures.

Chairman Zhu's words clearly pointed out the concerns faced by the construction of North China and expressed the authorities' policy and emphasized opening up a new situation by one's own efforts. In this new situation between Japan and China, the specific measures of the local authorities are adjusting with. It is not necessary to mention the relationship between Nanjing, which is implementing the promotion of the healthy development of new China, extremely reliable and rapid. For the institution and maintenance of the New People's Society, the return of concessions and the Beijing Legation Area, the adjustment of the authority of special service organs, the removal of military-managed factories, the transfer of new enemy property, and the loan of 200 million yen from the United Reserve Bank of China, epoch-making measures involving politics, economy, and culture are being implemented rapidly and closely, increasing the excitement of 100 million officials and civilians in North China. For the good intentions of the friendly countries, the total intention and practice from the Chinese side can fulfill the mission undertaken by North China, to reveal the spirit of Japan and China sharing the same life and death. The upsurge of that kind of strong opportunity is worthy of attention.

However, the construction of North China is definitely not as Chairman Zhu claimed. It has already entered a flat track and is advancing all the way. In the political aspect, such as eliminating the Communist Party army to establish security, and in the economic aspect, such as stabilizing people's livelihood by solving the problem of food prices, all kinds of problems that should be solved as soon as possible are placed in front of us. In fact, in North China, it can be said that there is a serious reality that one must fight a war and build at the same time and not allow retreat. This point must be remembered and never forgotten.

The current security situation in North China

The Chiang-Kai Shek system troops in North China, with the Central Plains battle in May of the 30th year of the Republic of China as an opportunity, have almost completely disappeared. At present, only the 40th Army of Pang Bingxun in Shanxi and Henan provinces and the Yu Xuezhong army in Shandong province remain. However, due to the continuous suppression by the Japanese, they have completely lost their courage to counterattack. In particular, under Yu Xuezhong's command, group after group of people came to join the peace camp, making Chiang Kai-shek embarrassed. Therefore, the cancerous tumor of security in North China is the existence of the Communist Party army and its mass armed groups. The Communist army in North China, which belongs to the 8th Group Army (i.e. the 8th Route Army), has various groups such as Liu Bocheng, Nie Rongzhen, Xu Xiangqian, and He Long. Liu Bocheng commands various military regions in southern Hebei, Taihang, Dayue, and Zhongtiao; and the Jin-Cha-Ji military region under Nie Rongzhen is divided into various military regions in eastern Hebei, central Hebei, and western Hebei, and Xiao Ke's Ji-Cha-Re Dare-to-die Army, which is entrenched on the border of Manchuria. Also, Xu Xiangqian's group army is entrenched in the area of Shandong Province, and He Long's group army is constantly making trouble in the northwest of Jin Province. In addition, there is Chen Yi's New Fourth Army, which is entrenched in the Suhuai area. It is estimated that the total strength of the Communist army in North China is about 200,000, and the mass armed groups that serve as external groups of the Communist Party can be regarded as reaching three to four times this number. The power of these Communist troops is of course acting according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. However, due to the thorough suppression by the Japanese, they have been driven into remote mountain areas and are now only launching guerrilla warfare in an attempt to disrupt the security areas and constantly carrying out stubborn sabotage in various aspects. However, the rapid expansion of the Greater East Asia War was beyond their expectations. Under the overwhelming advantage, the progress of the Axis powers has made their uneasiness and shakes in the anti-Japanese camp gradually deepen; with China's participation in the war as the beginning, the suppression of the anti-Japanese bases is inevitable, so they expressed a vigilant attitude. Since the incident, although the security in North China has been improving year by year, the turmoil of the Communist forces in North China, which has become a base for the Greater East Asia War, has had a considerable impact on the achievement of its mission. In response, the North China Political Affairs Commission established the North China Anti-Communist and Bandit Suppression Committee, which decided to implement a comprehensive anti-communist strategy that combines the central and local levels under the leadership of Chairman Zhu, in parallel with the Japanese military suppression operations. On the one hand, the New People's Society, which has been reorganized according to new ideas, has also determined a general policy that conforms to the new situation in Japan and China, and is moving forward to eliminate the Communist army in North China: its policy is to launch an active offensive by completing national organization and strengthening training. Therefore, the anti-communist strategy in North China is expected to be further strengthened, and rapid improvement in security can also be expected. In particular, with the decision of this new policy, it is even more natural to expect the strengthening of the political power and the enrichment of the shocking force of new China. It can be said that the decision-making system of Japan and China for the establishment of security is now prepared.

The Northwest Region as a Base for Chongqing

What is noteworthy in connection with the security issue is the newly emerging northwest region, which serves as a base for Chongqing's resistance against Japan. The development of the Northwest is that the Chongqing government, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, when overseas routes were completely blocked, wanted to carry out resistance by developing the Northwest route with other powers, and also wanted to develop the economy of the Northwest itself, so that it could cultivate the power to resist Japan, which is the so-called strategy of killing two birds with one stone. Moreover, according to the current situation, this Northwest region, which serves as a base for resistance against Japan, is even more clearly indicating that it is also a route for the United States to aid Chiang. The US special envoy Willkie said: "With the situation on the North African front, the development of the Northwest was promoted, especially the construction of flight bases." Later, the United States established embassy offices in Chengdu and Lanzhou and established consulates in Xinjiang Province, clearly indicating that the United States, which is struggling to reverse its decline, is holding on to what kind of attempt. At present, the Northwest development being implemented by Chongqing focuses on transportation and water conservancy development. It is now rushing to build the Baoji-Tianshui railway on the coastal route and plans to gradually extend the line from Lanzhou, Xizhou, along the Northwest route. The development of water conservancy is to make the Bailong River and Tao River in the southern part of Gansu Province flow into the water transport of the Yellow River, as its current priority, to make up for the difficulties of land transportation. Moreover, by using the Yellow River, it is planned to resume the Northwest trade from Baotou through North China to Manchuria, which is particularly noteworthy.

As mentioned above, the Northwest region not only has close ties with North China geographically, but also the Soviet, British, and American aid routes to Chiang will all intersect in the Northwest region in the future, so the Northwest region has also become a base for the United States to counterattack Japan and carries a new mission.

### Ministry of Education Forms Two Committees to Study the Reform of the School System

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the reform of the school system, according to officials from the Ministry of Education, the Fifth Central Plenary Session of the Kuomintang of China has passed a proposal to reform the current middle school system. The Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee sent a letter to the Civil Service Department, requesting the National Government to instruct the Ministry of Education to investigate and handle the matter. The instructions have arrived at the Ministry of Education.

It was generally agreed that each time the school system is changed, it will not be completed without six or seven years. If preparations are being made to change it now, a school system research committee should be organized to conduct in-depth research, and a curriculum standards research committee should be organized to assist each other to achieve compromise. The Ministry has submitted the methods proposed by the members of the conference, which are still insightful, to the Executive Yuan for approval, and will first organize the two committees to conduct research separately. After the results are obtained, the school system system, branch cases, curriculum standards drafts, and implementation methods will be submitted for approval before implementation.

### Hubei Prepares to Establish a Food Bureau

Hankou, 14th (Central News Agency) – Due to the special political situation in Hubei Province, there was no organization of a food administration bureau in the past. Since the authorities of friendly nations declared the lifting of the ban on grain transportation in the Jiujiang-Wuhan area, grain and rice imports into Hubei Province have gradually increased. The government should rationally supervise this to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and manipulating prices. In view of this, the provincial government, in accordance with central regulations, is preparing to establish the Hubei Provincial Food Bureau. Various preparatory matters for the bureau are currently being actively carried out. The candidate for the director of the bureau will be submitted by Governor Yang to the central government for appointment and is expected to be formally established within this month.

### Japanese Army Ministry Holds Award Ceremony for Scientific Personnel; Prime Minister Tojo Attends and Delivers Address

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army authorities have been constantly striving to strengthen the wartime scientific lineup. Previously, in order to reward scientists who have contributed to improving military technology or enhancing military equipment, they formulated the "Technical Medal Order," stipulating that technical medals be awarded to meritorious individuals who have devoted themselves to research and made outstanding inventions. At the same time, all officers, civilians, and scientists were mobilized to open the Army Technical Research Association to discuss and improve countermeasures such as publishing research results, cultivating scientific personnel, and promoting military technology. The Army Ministry announced the names of the second group of award recipients on the 14th and held an awards and medal presentation ceremony at the Army Ministry Auditorium at 9:00 AM. Approximately 1,300 officers, civilians, and other personnel attended. Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo first delivered an address, followed by Army Minister Tojo awarding the medals, and then the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, Sato, delivered a speech before the meeting adjourned. From 1:00 PM, the second Army Technical Research Association was held separately at five locations, including the Army Aviation Examination Department, to begin publishing various research results, with all results to be published by the 17th. There are a total of over 300 items. A total of one item and eighty individuals received the medal this second time. Twelve items and twenty individuals received the Special Merit Badge, certificate, and bonus. Fourteen items and eighteen individuals received the badge, certificate, and bonus. One deceased person was among them. Thirty-four items and forty-two individuals received the certificate and bonus. Three deceased persons were among them. The gist of Army Minister Tojo's address is recorded below: The situation in the Greater East Asia is now complete. Our country and its allies are working together to establish a foundation for certain victory and invincibility. However, the enemy's army, navy, and air force are still stubbornly counterattacking in the South Pacific, Burma, and the Aleutian Islands, and continuing to launch fierce battles. In the extreme, this war can be said to be a competition between science and scientific technology. Moreover, this scientific and technological warfare will become increasingly fierce. If new weapons appear day by day, or if there are new plans to enhance combat power, they can immediately make the situation favorable and become the basis for victory. Therefore, I often say that the continuous creation, improvement, and research of weapons and other war materials, as well as the rapid improvement of all efficiencies in the various departments responsible for preparing wartime production, are the most urgent tasks at present. This is also what I most expect. The content published by this research association since the beginning of this year has shown significant progress compared to last year. While I am grateful for their great efforts, I cannot help but feel happy.

### Major Tunisian Battlefield Shifts to the Western Ridges of Hammamet; British First and Eighth Armies Meet

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a special correspondent from the Havas News Agency, the mountainous area west of Hammamet Bay in northeastern Tunisia is likely to become the major site of conflict. The Axis forces command speculates that the German and Italian forces, who withdrew from the area north of the Kairouan-Sousse line on Monday, will try to establish a longer-term defense in this area and are launching fierce attacks to prevent this. In the rapid advances of the past few days, General Montgomery's infantry units do not seem to be able to keep up. Therefore, the British Eighth Army currently only has tanks and motorized units to launch new attacks. In addition, there is a strong air force that will provide powerful assistance to the land forces in the early stages of the war. According to recent observations, General Montgomery seems unlikely to wait for the infantry and will continue to attack in an attempt to enter the mountains of the northern coast of Tunisia. He will only consider halting his offensive and regrouping his artillery if this attempt fails. In general, the progress of the British vanguard is only delayed when encountering minefields or resistance from the Axis rearguard. There is no major change in the situation on the northwest front of the Axis bridgehead. Although General Anderson has made slight progress in a few locations, he has not been able to drive the German forces out of Cape Serrat in the mountains north of the Oued Zarga-Medjez el Bab road. Anderson's army's left flank in the southern coastal area is now waiting for an opportunity. Due to the reduction of the war zone and the rapid advance of the British Eighth Army, the left flank of the Eighth Army has made contact with the right flank of the British First Army, and the US Fifth Army, which was originally fighting between the two armies, has now been obscured and no longer encounters enemy forces. It remains to be seen when and where the US forces will participate in the war again.

### British Army Suffers Heavy Losses in Fierce Axis Counterattack

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German official news agency announced last night that Axis tanks and motorized units launched a fierce counterattack on Monday against the British Eighth Army advancing in Tunisia, completely surprising the enemy forces. After suffering severe losses, the British army split into several units to fight, but was still forced to retreat in disarray. Military sources in Berlin claim that the counterattack was carried out by the forces of Marshals Rommel north of the Sfax-Kairouan line. A Reuters correspondent also confirmed that the Marshals Rommel's forces not only resisted the British and American forces, but also continued to launch fierce attacks in a very large area on Monday and the previous night. At the same time, the anti-Axis forces must now deal with a much shorter front line, and the Axis forces have been able to concentrate their forces in large numbers after the retreat. Algiers Radio broadcast last night that British Eighth Army units had contacted Axis forces in Sebuga-el-Khelbia, a salt lake about twenty miles west of Sousse and northeast of Kairouan. The German news agency claimed that the Axis forces had taken away all their equipped ammunition and food, leaving only necessary items to the civilians, so the anti-Axis forces are in a very difficult environment, and the situation is further deteriorated. At the same time, powerful Axis combat units also launched effective attacks, repelling General Montgomery's vanguard. No less than twenty-one British tanks were destroyed. The German side claimed that these operations were all carried out by the Axis rearguard. The speed of the British advance was greatly reduced, but the Axis forces used only small forces to hinder the enemy's actions. In the southeastern and southwestern sections of the central and northern Tunisian front lines, British, American, and Free French forces were repelled by the Axis forces in several attacks. A strong Axis air force also participated in the battle, attacking the anti-Axis forces' transportation equipment in various parts of Tunisia. An anti-Axis anti-aircraft gun position was hit in several places, and a gas station and a ammunition squad were also set on fire. Several vehicles were completely destroyed. Anti-Axis tanks, troop assembly camps, and supply depots in the Medjez el Bab area and west of Jebel Mansour were bombed, and there were fires in many places. Five armored vehicles were destroyed, and two others were severely damaged.

### Eastern Front Impassable Due to Mud; Fighting Limited to Local Incidents; Soviet Counterattack Repelled in the Leningrad Area

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - A military observer from the Havas News Agency reported that the pause in military operations on the Eastern Front continues, mainly because the period of impassable roads due to heavy rain has lasted longer than expected. Therefore, the war in the past five days has been limited to local incidents. It is true that the Soviets have concentrated their forces behind the Kholm area, but no large-scale offensive has occurred, and fighting in that area has almost completely ceased. The fighting in the central Donets area is more active than last week. German forces continue to systematically clear the various bends of the rivers, with considerable success. The Soviet army originally intended to use the troops stationed in the trenches of the river bends as bridgehead fortresses, but they have not deployed large numbers of troops to compete for the Donets river bends. The Moscow news reported by the British and Americans is an exaggeration. It is noteworthy that the Soviet army has not continued to launch a large-scale offensive against the German Kuban bridgehead. The Soviet army launched three consecutive days of attacks last week without success. Now, only regiments occasionally attack south of Lake Ladoga and in the middle of the front line, and there are only local battles. The Soviet army is now obviously conserving its manpower.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German official news agency announced last night that on Monday, German forces repeatedly launched organized sorties with reconnaissance units and advanced their positions in the Leningrad area. Two Soviet counterattacks were repelled by German forces. At the same time, the German air force also attacked the targets of Leningrad's labor force and destroyed the power plant. The Balakleya area southeast of Kharkov and the Izium area are also becoming quieter. The German forces in that area were engaged in clearing the remnants of the Soviet army in the Donets river bends last week. Powerful German dive bombers and heavy bomber squadrons also attacked Soviet positions in the southeastern part of the Kuban bridgehead and in the Novorossiysk area. They also attacked Soviet front-line and inland military camp supply stations and airfields. In this operation, German fighter planes shot down eleven Soviet aircraft. Many trains carrying troops and military supplies were also derailed by heavy bombs. The Krasnodar airfield in the Kuban area was subjected to extremely heavy attacks for nearly an hour. At least twenty-one Soviet aircraft were destroyed or severely damaged on the ground. Two gas stations were burned, and the hangar was completely destroyed. In the central and northern front-line areas, German fighter and bomber squadrons attacked Soviet fortresses, supply centers, and transportation lines. The railway network behind the Donets front line was effectively bombed. The Soviet army was forced into a passive position along the entire front line.

### Italian Dignitaries Comment on the Decisions of the Hitler-Mussolini Meeting

Rome, 14th (Central News Agency) - Former Minister of Popular Culture, Pavolini, wrote an article in the Messaggero, commenting on the meeting between the Italian Prime Minister and the German leader, stating that all basic and important issues were discussed during the meeting, including the submarine warfare, the Mediterranean issue, the Soviet front, the aerial bombardment, and the connection between European operations and the Pacific Greater East Asia war. In addition, they also discussed how to take secret initiatives in the future to prevent the enemy's actions in military operations or armaments supply. From the tone of the communiqué, it can be seen that decisions have been made on these issues. The other part of the communiqué mentions the decision to mobilize all forces to achieve final victory, which is also worth mentioning. Military victory is the only solution to this war.

### British Finances Face Daily Shortfall of 8 Million Pounds

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to news from London, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Kingsley Wood revealed in a speech in the House of Commons on Tuesday that the British government must borrow 8 million pounds daily to cover war expenses. According to the figures released by Sir Kingsley Wood, Britain's daily revenue is about 8 million pounds, including 2.5 million pounds in income tax, 1 million pounds in tobacco tax, 1 million pounds in alcohol tax, and 1.75 million pounds in consumption tax. The remaining shortfall of 8 million pounds must be borrowed by the Treasury at low interest rates.

### British-Indian 14th Regiment to be Completely Annihilated

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 14th the combined results of land and air operations in Burma, clearly showing the active situation of the Japanese army in Burma. In this battle, the enemy's losses included 4,200 killed, including 2,000 British, and 516 captured. The number of enemy aircraft shot down since last December has reached 465, which proves the effectiveness of the Japanese encirclement operation and the brave fighting of the Japanese army. The British-Indian army, which attempted to recapture Burma, had approximately 25,000 troops, the most important of which was the 14th Regiment as the main force. Their attempt to counterattack was like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. The strength of the Japanese army became increasingly clear.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army air force and ground forces in Burma, in close cooperation, either attacked the enemy's bases in eastern India or intercepted attacking enemy aircraft, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on enemy aircraft. According to the announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters on the 14th, a total of 465 enemy aircraft have been shot down or destroyed from December last year to April 10 this year. The details are as follows: 106 were shot down by ground fire, including 16 in December last year, 32 in January this year, 36 in February, 20 in March, and 2 in April. 181 were shot down in aerial combat, including 41 in December, 23 in January, 26 in February, 66 in March, and 25 in April. 178 were destroyed on the ground, including 42 in December, 17 in January, 13 in February, 58 in March, and 48 in April. The main enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed were the Consolidated C-87 Liberator and the Hawker Hurricane fighter, but they all met the fate of being shot down or destroyed by the Japanese army air force. The Japanese army air force has previously attacked Chittagong, Feni, and Sitakunda in eastern India, and has reached as far as Calcutta. Recently, it has fiercely attacked the enemy's bases in Agartala, Hazaribagh, and Ramgarh, inflicting heavy damage.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Port Moresby Heavily

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Gold Mountain, the Japanese air force heavily bombed Port Moresby on the 12th, greatly shocking the anti-Axis camp in the Southwest Pacific. The anti-Axis deputy commander in the area, Blamey, issued a statement on the 13th, stating that the Japanese air force had bombed Port Moresby more than 20 times. The scale of the past bombings was smaller. The number of aircraft has increased significantly during recent attacks. This shows that the Japanese army has seized air superiority in the Southwest Pacific and may launch a large-scale offensive.

### British House of Commons Questions the Defeat in Arakan

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London, the news of the British army's retreat on the Arakan front caused great shock in both the British government and the public. It is reported that on the 13th, members of the British House of Commons questioned the government about the truth of the Japanese General Headquarters' announcement that it had annihilated a British regiment and captured a British general on the Burmese front. The British Secretary of War, Grig, only responded vaguely and evasively to the questions.

### Indian Public at Home and Abroad Launch Anti-British Movement

Istanbul, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Indian public is using April 13th as the memorial day for the British army's massacre of Indians. They are touring various parts of India from that day to launch an anti-British movement. Several students in Amritsar were arrested for distributing anti-British leaflets. Three South American officers were brutally murdered in a hotel in Peshawar, and all the servants of the hotel were arrested. In addition, hundreds of members of the Indian National Congress in various parts of India have been arrested and imprisoned.

Shonan, 14th (Central News Agency) - The end of Indian National Movement Week was on the 13th.

They also inspired the Indian public to consolidate their determination to save the motherland.

### Thai Reconnaissance Team Repels Enemy Troops Crossing the River

Bangkok, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Supreme Military Headquarters of Thailand announced at 4:00 PM on the 30th that a Thai reconnaissance team near the eastern part of Chi Luo, near Sakharat, clashed with a unit of enemy troops attempting to cross the river.

### High-Ranking Australian Military and Political Figures Deeply Fear Japanese Army's Attack on Australia

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) – A Melbourne dispatch received here today states that Australian Army Chief of Staff General Blamey, when hosting newspaper reporters, solemnly stated that the Japanese Air Force is increasing its strength daily and issued a warning, saying that Japan could take offensive action against Australia at any time. Blamey, when discussing the recent heavy bombing of Port Moresby, Oro Bay, and other anti-Axis positions in the Southwest Pacific by the Japanese Air Force, revealed that Japan has concentrated a large air force in northern Australia.

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) – According to news from New Golden Mountain, Australian Prime Minister Curtin continued his warnings today, saying that Japan may begin an attack on northern Australia, and that its scale will be larger than before. He said that he fully agreed with the opinion of Southwest Pacific anti-Axis forces Commander General Blamey regarding the Japanese army concentrating in northern Australia, which is a very serious threat. Curtin also hinted at the possibility of a serious attack on the Solomon Islands.

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) – According to news from the Southwest Pacific anti-Axis headquarters, General MacArthur announced today that the Japanese army has now controlled the sea routes in the western Pacific and the direct routes to Australia. This is due to the great power of its navy and air force. In fact, the Japanese navy is strong and powerful, and it would be as easy as turning one's hand to take Australia.

### Australian Foreign Minister Asks the United States to Increase Military Strength in the Pacific

Buenos Aires, 14th (Central News Agency) – Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, when meeting with Roosevelt on the 12th, requested a stronger military presence on the Pacific front. On the 13th, he pointed out the erroneous evidence of the European focus doctrine, generally saying that the Japanese army is currently building a new economic sphere in East Asia and occupies rubber, oil, tin, iron, nickel, and other important resources. These materials are sufficient to control the fate of the anti-Axis countries. If the Japanese army establishes a considerable position in this area, the anti-Axis forces will be in dire straits. Also, regarding ships, the Japanese army regrettably has a numerical advantage.

### Japanese Local Governors' Conference Continues to Hold Various Meetings

### On the Seriousness of the Price Issue by Toshisuke Yoshida

Mr. Toshisuke Yoshida is one of the Japanese people most familiar with Chinese social problems, and also one of the most sympathetic to the suffering of the Chinese people. If you read this article carefully, you can prove that our introduction is not flattery. He analyzes the following points in this article:

(1) "The vicious cycle formula of the decline of currency purchasing power and the victory of expensive prices is that the people themselves raise prices, but they themselves suffer from the aftermath," which is really scratching where it itches.

(2) "Generally, Shanghai citizens want to purchase goods in advance to supplement the rising cost of living. This action cannot be regarded as hoarding in general. They are hoarders, but at the same time, they are also victims who directly receive the bad results of the speculative market." This is obviously not to defend the general public, but to express this ridiculous and pathetic self-destructive behavior.

(3) The proposed points that should be included in the punishment of hoarding law are reasonable. The proposition of stipulating a temporary implementation period for the hoarders is to be lenient in warning, which is indeed a view suitable for the social psychology of our country.

(4) He specially reminds us that the current price issue in Shanghai contains a very important meaning of economic struggle, and regards the success of this investigation of speculation as a test of whether the Shanghai citizens wholeheartedly support the National Government, and we feel the same about this. (Editor's note)

The soaring price of goods is a serious social problem in Shanghai. The so-called speculation of "hoarding and speculating" is no longer a commercial profit-making behavior, but an extraordinary means taken by Shanghai citizens for their livelihood. A certain Chinese person once strongly declared: "In the whole of Shanghai, no, in the entire peaceful area... if you still want to live as a human being, you have to hoard some goods. What public welfare, morality, country, social security, conscience, can all be damned, otherwise you don't want to live as a human being." (A section from the special commentary in the New China Daily on April 12). From this, we can know how profound the problem is.

It is not necessarily correct to regard the impact of goods as the cause of the current soaring prices. Before the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai merchants had already seen the future situation, and everyone purchased a large number of goods from overseas. Therefore, when the Greater East Asia War began, most of the goods in Shanghai already had considerable reserves. Someone once said that Shanghai had enough inventory for five years of consumption. Therefore, the path of investing 400,000 yuan of floating capital in Shanghai in production enterprises was blocked, and the inventory in the commodity market suddenly decreased. The prices of soap, cigarettes, grains, medicines, candles, towels, shirts, socks, and other commodities rose sharply. This obviously suppressed the purchasing power of the reserve certificates and, coupled with the agitation from Chongqing, reduced the public's willingness to use reserve certificates. Thus, the trend of capitalists using floating capital to hoard goods gradually became widespread. The general public also followed speculators in searching for physical objects in the market. As a result, the types of hoarded goods also expanded to an extremely wide range, and the prices of all daily necessities used by Shanghai citizens soared rapidly.

Thus, because Shanghai citizens searched for goods, they were caught in a "vicious cycle" formula of rising prices—and lower purchasing power of reserve certificates. The people themselves raised prices, but they themselves suffered from the aftermath.

Such an extraordinary phenomenon of soaring prices cannot be summed up by general reasons such as insufficient production and inconvenient transportation. The hoarding trend that surged into the Shanghai citizens and the panic psychology that promoted this trend is probably the most direct and powerful cause of soaring prices! What cannot be ignored is the behind-the-scenes instigation of people who use the public's panic psychology, possess huge capital and social status, and manipulate the speculative market to make huge profits. People who have no choice but to engage in speculative behavior due to the oppression of life are not hateful. The speculative behavior (?) of wives and children of the Frunze class "hoarding" dozens of bars of soap is not a problem. If we want to punish these piecemeal speculative behaviors one by one, it may be more agile to build high walls around Shanghai to form a prison.

Therefore, the National Government's April 7th order to thoroughly investigate speculation stated: "It has been found that there has recently been large-scale speculation and hoarding of important materials in Shanghai," indicating that its goal is people who disrupt the market on a large scale. The Shenbao's editorial (April 11) further put forward the point of "never letting go of the big fish and letting go of the small fish."

Generally, Shanghai citizens want to purchase in advance to supplement the rising cost of living. This action cannot be regarded as hoarding in general. They are "hoarders," but at the same time, they are also victims who directly receive the bad results of the speculative market. Regarding this point, Mr. Wu Chengzhi told a very interesting story in the New China Daily. He said: "Now Shanghai, the entire society has become a big casino. People who are stripped naked in the casino are called "white slaughtered chickens" in Shanghai. The casino owner uses the identity of this white slaughtered chicken as collateral, and then lends him money to let him gamble again. Similarly, the speculators in the current Shanghai speculative market have the backing of bank owners. The old board will use speculative hoarding assets to help them. The difference is that those who do large-scale speculation and hoarding are the shareholders of the big casino themselves. They will never be "white slaughtered chickens". Only salaried people are "white slaughtered chickens" in the speculative market. "

This is the general Chinese people's opinion of large-scale speculative hoarders, the so-called "big hoarding tigers." Anyone who now feels any reason for indignation knows that their big hoarding tigers are the chief culprits in destroying the lives of Shanghai citizens, and of course, it is necessary to severely punish them. But there is another type of people who want to manipulate the speculative market from political motives. Everyone still remembers that when the old legal tender was circulating in Shanghai, the reserve certificates launched an economic offensive against the old legal tender. As a result, the old legal tender was defeated by the reserve certificates, and its currency value finally collapsed in chaos. Who can say that in the current Shanghai speculative market, the UK, the US, and Chongqing will not follow the same tactics and launch an economic counterattack? The current Shanghai market does not give this economic counterattack favorable conditions. And the Shanghai market has a so-called "black black market," which conducts transactions on the road, so the authorities find it difficult to crack down on it. Chongqing calls this market a "guerrilla market," using various agitations to agitate the public's panic psychology in the market and drive up prices. The current soaring prices cannot be viewed simply as an economic problem, while ignoring the political manipulation behind the scenes. Shanghai's price issue, economic warfare comes before everything. Therefore, if the National Government's order to thoroughly investigate fails and, as a result, really "catches small fish and lets go of big fish," then prices may continue to soar, which is a big blow in the economic war. Japan cannot but pay close attention to it. At the same time, there is also a part of the responsibility that the citizens of Shanghai have as to whether the first step in this price countermeasure will go astray. If the citizens of Shanghai do not abandon their long-standing passivity towards politics and do not help the National Government implement this speculation investigation order, they will not be able to escape this difficult situation. Therefore, if this speculation investigation order ends in failure, the people who will be most directly disadvantaged are the vast majority of citizens of Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai citizens have now expressed unprecedented activeness on this issue politically. The Shanghai citizens' mouthpiece, "Shenbao," representing the cooperative attitude of Shanghai citizens, requires the National Government to further formulate a law on punishment for hoarding in black and white, instead of a temporary and political measure like the anti-hoarding law, which is often shaky, and use a clear standard for the fair crackdown, so that the political tactics have no room for activity, and can achieve practical results. The government has of course thought about this issue and is speeding up the formulation of a law on punishment for hoarding. The points that should be included in the punishment of hoarding law, the author proposes as follows for reference:

(1) Those who disrupt the economy with political motives through speculative hoarding will be sentenced to death.

(2) Those who hoard as a profession, especially those who open warehouses for hoarding and rent private residences to hoard a large number of daily necessities will be sentenced to death. The hoarded materials will be confiscated by the state.

(3) Those who hoard daily necessities for the purpose of a sideline will be sentenced to imprisonment for a definite period of time depending on the severity of the circumstances. The hoarded materials will be confiscated by the state. However, if the hoarder can prove that the material is for household use, the quantity shall be limited to what is needed for household use, and the rest shall be considered hoarding.

(4) Shops that refuse to sell goods at the limited price will be treated as hoarders and punished according to Item 1 or Item 2 depending on the quantity and situation of their inventory.

(5) After the above laws are promulgated, a certain period of temporary implementation will be stipulated, during which the hoarders will be allowed to automatically dispose of their hoarded materials. The authorities will use this period to buy up the hoarded materials and buy them at a reasonable price. The purchase price will temporarily be based on the current market price and slightly lowered. When the authorities use reserve certificates to pay the purchase price and there is a fear of causing inflation, they may issue "commodity treasury bonds." The method for "commodity treasury bonds" will be stipulated separately.

(6) After this purchase period, the authorities will guide the Baojia leaders to report the inventory of each household. If necessary, they can search the household at any time. The Baojia leaders and inspectors will be trained in advance on the spirit and techniques of cracking down on hoarding.

The reasons for each item do not need to be explained, and it is clear that I will not repeat them. However, during the above-mentioned temporary period, the authorities should complete the distribution mechanism for various daily necessities as soon as possible, and it is necessary to implement the limited price distribution of daily necessities in the city. It is also necessary to prepare for the general limited price system for each commodity. At the same time, we should launch a spiritual mobilization campaign among Shanghai citizens against hoarding and speculation, for example, "Hoarding Elimination Week", to guide them to participate with the government in the struggle to eliminate the hoarding that threatens the lives of citizens. Even the "Hoarding Elimination Movement" should be attended first by Japanese, and if large Japanese companies and banks are making huge profits by hoarding, they should be reported first.

Perhaps some people say that the provision of the death penalty in the punishment for hoarding is too cruel. This is a sign of not understanding the political importance of this issue. We repeat once again that Shanghai is still on the front line of the economic war with Chongqing, and the speculative market is its central battlefield. If the National Government can win this issue, the citizens of Shanghai will become wholehearted supporters of the National Government; if it fails, the future of the National Government will have serious consequences, and it will simply be a major blow to Japan's completion of the Greater East Asia War.

### After Comprehensive Exercises, Air Raid Drill Training Will Be Held at Any Time Without Prior Notice, Yesterday's Training Was Even More Tense

In order to continue to increase the public's awareness of air defense, the city's highest air defense authorities held air defense training again. Yesterday (the 14th) was the third day, which was the beginning of the comprehensive training, so the situation was even more tense, and all the measures in each district of the city had been properly arranged. The city's Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters issued a warning alarm at 7:30 a.m., and after issuing the first air raid alarm at 9:45 a.m., the responsible party took precautions and implemented traffic control, which was extremely strict. The people must be commanded by the police and the self-defense corps members until 11:45 a.m. when the alarm was lifted. The second air raid alarm was issued at 3:00 p.m. and lifted at 4:05 p.m. The third air raid alarm was issued at 7:00 p.m. and lifted at 8:37 p.m., but the warning alarm was still being carried out. From yesterday onwards, air raid alarm training will be carried out at any time without prior notice, so Baojia personnel and the public must pay attention to the sound of the alarm at all times. At the same time, the basic self-defense corps members in all districts of the city are dispatched together and cannot avoid their posts on any excuse.

Iron Gates Closed

Also, during the air raid alarm, the iron gates in various places in the Chinese area adjacent to the French Concession were sealed off. Except for those holding special passes, all entry and exit were prohibited. As for the bridges on the Suzhou River, except for the Waibaidu Bridge and the Zhapu Road Bridge, which temporarily suspended pedestrian access, all other bridges were open to traffic.

Training at Any Time

According to sources, from yesterday (the 14th), the air defense authorities will not notify in advance of the various fire-fighting and other exercises in each district, but will hold them at any time. After sending personnel to pretend to be criminals and throw various dummy explosive materials such as sulfur, they must be extinguished. Therefore, each Baojia district should pay attention at all times and prepare for various exercises. All equipment such as sand, mud, and reed mats must be placed properly so that they can be used in their original state.

### Red and Green Flag Symbols

Starting yesterday, in order to easily convey various alarms to the people, in addition to hanging cloth banners at the offices of the Baojia chiefs and next to the self-defense pavilions, small red and green square flags will be used as symbols. The red flag is for the air raid alarm, and the green flag is for the warning alarm.

Simulated Shooting

Also, during the air raid alarm, two Japanese planes took off, one of which towed a symbol as a simulated enemy plane and soared in the air. Where there were no anti-aircraft guns, shooting exercises were conducted, and the sound of shooting shook the Shanghai Bund. In addition, the sound of the planes was creaking. Although it was an empty bullet, the performance was quite realistic, and the results were very satisfactory.

Huangpu River Navigation Suspended

Yesterday, the comprehensive air defense exercise began, and the air raid alarms were constantly and frequently transmitted throughout the day. The situation was indeed more tense than the previous two days. The water patrol team and the water Baojia team in the Huangpu River were all dispatched. Ferryboats on both the east and west banks of the Huangpu River were suspended, which was tantamount to sealing the river. Passengers on both banks sat quietly in the boats, and the order was still good. The water patrol team's boats constantly patrolled the river surface, and the vigilance was extremely strict. It was not until the air raid alarm was lifted that the ferryboats were allowed to operate and returned to their original state.

### Nanshi Deploys a Full-Scale Exercise

Yesterday was the first day of the first comprehensive air defense exercise in the later stage in the city. Nanshi District deployed a full-scale exercise under the strict supervision of the Air Defense Command of the Municipal Police Department. The various situations are recorded in the following paragraphs:

Fire Prevention

The fire prevention exercise in the Yimiao area of Nanshi began at 8:30 a.m. yesterday. At that time, grass piles were set up at the intersection of Luxiangyuan Road. When the time came, the fire was set and burned. At one time, the flames were fierce. When the air raid alarm was launched, the entire area immediately became strictly vigilant, and the fire alarm was frequently transmitted. The police rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and gave instructions on the spot. The chief of the police station and the chief of the self-defense corps, Wang Delin, personally led the police and the captains of the self-defense corps, about 100 people, to stand in shifts. One part implemented the rotation of water to extinguish the fire, and another part of the personnel used yellow sand to stop it. In an instant, they were all extinguished. Then, the rescue exercise was launched. With a bang, a fake bomb exploded, and four people fell to the ground on the spot, pretending to be injured by the bomb. The rescue team immediately launched, and the stretcher bed was brought to the scene of the accident. With rapid steps, the injured were rescued separately. The actions were agile. The exercise was not completed until about 11:00 a.m.

Evacuation

In the afternoon, after the air raid alarm was launched again in the city, the entire Nanshi area was immediately repeated in a state of standstill. The iron gates at the junctions of the Chinese and French areas were closed as usual. All the key points and streets and alleys in the entire area were cut off. The Air Defense Command of the Municipal Police Department held an evacuation exercise in the Minli Middle School on Zhonghua Road, guiding all the pedestrians lingering near the area to be brought into the shelter to avoid danger. Women and children were in the front, and men were in the rear. The order was orderly. After this guidance, the citizens will naturally become more knowledgeable about evacuation.

Terror

After the air raid alarm was lifted in the afternoon, the Laoximen Zhaojia Port and Yinggongci Road Shangwen Road in Nanshi held terror exercises again at about 4:00 p.m. Two people pretending to be criminals immediately escaped in separate directions after shooting. The self-defense corps and nearby police officers鳴响警笛. The situation was extremely tense. The police rushed to the scene to assist in the arrest of the criminals. At the same time, the Nanshi Military Police Team also rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm to assist in the arrest. The two people pretending to be criminals were finally arrested one after another, and the nearby traffic began to return to normal.

### Exercises in Various Districts

When the air raid alarm sounded yesterday, the various fire-fighting and other training sessions in each district were held separately. The Laozha District held a fire-fighting exercise at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhili Road at 10:00 a.m. by the First Joint Bao. In the afternoon, the Second Joint Bao held the above training at the intersection of Hankou Road and Fujian Road at 3:30 p.m. Also, the Route Laozha of the French Concession used Building No. 546 as a hypothetical bombing site at 10:00 a.m. The police department's fire department, the civil police corps, the fire brigade, the rescue team, etc. were all dispatched to conduct fire extinguishing and rescue exercises. The performance was quite realistic. The Public Concession (Central District) held fire extinguishing exercises at the intersection of Henan Road and Guangdong Road at 9:45 a.m., and at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road and the intersection of Hong Kong Road and Sichuan Road during the air raid alarm in the afternoon.

Rescue Exercise in Chengdu District

Chengdu District held a fire extinguishing and rescue exercise at the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association gate at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Chengdu Road from 10:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. yesterday. At that time, two incendiary bombs were thrown, and two people pretended to be injured. The rescue team bravely rescued and supported the stretcher separately. The scene was realistic. In addition to practicing three times at the intersection of Xin Dagu Road and Chongqing Road at 8:45 p.m. the night before, the district also practiced at four places in Macho Road and Dagu Road last night. The Gordon District had fewer exercises yesterday, but during the air raid emergency alarm, traffic was organized at any time, which was quite meticulous. As for the Hongkou Garrison Area, in addition to the Chinese people holding an exercise at the intersection of Haihe Road and North Zhejiang Road in the Seventh District at 2:00 p.m., the Japanese held fire extinguishing exercises one after another in front of the New Asia Hotel on Wuchang Road, Zhapu Road, and North Sichuan Road.

Burning Boats on the Suzhou River

At the same time, the water Baojia also held fire extinguishing exercises separately. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the naval team, together with the customs fire brigade, practiced fire extinguishing in the Suzhou River in front of the river liner company at the Henan Road Bridge. For a while, the red light lit up the sky, and the ships parked on the shore suddenly assumed a fire. The navy and customs fire brigade, together with the water Baojia, bravely extinguished the fire and performed exercises such as rescuing the wounded. It was not completed until a quarter of an hour later. In the afternoon yesterday, the Shanghai West side held an exercise in Zhaofeng Park once. The district police, the newspaper, and the Second Fang Joint Bao of the police's Third Branch were all dispatched. During the emergency of the air raid, traffic control was unusually meticulous. At the same time, Zhabei also held many exercises in succession.

French Concession Defensive Precautions

Note: This air defense exercise, both individual and comprehensive, is the last day today. However, the table on the right can be used at any time, so residents of the concession should still pay attention to it.

### Xinzha Police Station Investigates the Situation of Schools

The Xinzha Police Station, in order to understand the current situation of the many schools in the area, sent police officers to investigate each school on the 13th. At that time, two types of forms were distributed, one was a school profile investigation form, and the other was a teacher investigation form. The main items in the former table included the school name, location, public or private, where to register or record, what kind of organizations have been added, school property and facilities, the resume organization and establishment of the school board, whether it has been reorganized after the incident, what kind of courses are paid attention to, whether Japanese is a compulsory course, the number of students, the number of teachers, the number of boarders, student organizations in contact with the school, economic conditions, etc. The latter table included the name, age, origin, length of service, courses taught, current address, religious belief, marital status, ideological tendency, family profile, economic environment, social relations, extracurricular activities, what kind of organizations have been joined, and when hired, etc. The principals of each school were ordered to fill in and report according to the format within a deadline, and no omissions were allowed.

### Second Phase of Cooking Oil: Postponed Sale

The Shanghai Cooking Oil Trade Association Wholesale Department originally planned to sell the second phase of cooking oil on the 15th. However, due to the procedures for delivering the goods not yet being ready, the sale must be postponed for several days.

### Talks Between German and Italian Leaders: Solid Axis Alliance, Statement by Minister Hirota

The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy yesterday (14th) hosted the Chinese press corps of the city, as usual. Those present from the embassy included Information Minister Hirota and Vice-Consul Fukuma. Minister Hirota immediately delivered his thoughts on the recent talks between the German and Italian leaders. He first expounded on the significance of the meeting between German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini from the 7th to the 10th of this month. He said that the German-Italian alliance is a sincere combination of the two countries, so the meeting between the two leaders has a profound significance. The results of this meeting include decisions on:

Two Objectives

(1) The common goal of Germany and Italy is to strive for ultimate victory, mobilize all forces, and rebuild in all aspects of politics, military, and economy with a new determination. (2) To seek the liberation of Europe and Africa, and under the common goal of building Europe and Africa, to achieve the free development of all ethnic groups in Europe and Africa, each obtaining what they deserve, especially to defeat international communism. This will not stop until the final victory is achieved. This resolution has been clearly stipulated in the past treaties signed by Japan, Germany, and Italy. We observe the second item of the war objectives decided by Germany and Italy this time, and in its content, Germany and Italy must have reached a considerable conclusion regarding the liberation of various European nations. The opinions of Germany and Italy on joint operations have long been completely consistent. Japan, based on its position as an ally, also expresses its deep congratulations. At the same time, Japan has repeatedly declared its determination for all-out warfare and will not compromise until the final victory is achieved. Japan's war aims to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and liberate the various ethnic groups in East Asia. This is in complete agreement with the common war objectives declared by Germany and Italy.

Completely Consistent

Germany and Italy take the construction of Europe and Africa as their principle, while Japan takes the construction of Greater East Asia as its principle, and jointly shoulder the mission of building a new world order. Looking back at the anti-Axis side, the so-called "Allied Powers" are divided in opinion, becoming a stark contrast. We quote Mencius's meaning of "Heaven's timing is not as good as geographical advantage, and geographical advantage is not as good as human harmony." Now, where is human harmony? Everyone can understand who the final victory belongs to.

### Zhu Qingxiang Arrested: Shanghai Police Detective Team Apprehends Him, Confiscates Numerous Weapons and Ammunition

Wandering bandits Zhu Qingxiang (also known as "Wild Chicken Anniang") and Shen Gensha (also known as "Black Skin Gensha"), etc., have been harassing the people in the Chenxing Township area, northwest of Guangfu Town in Jiading District. Feeling unable to survive after the start of the second phase of rural cleansing in Shanghai, they wanted to carry weapons to other places. This was detected by Gu Baolin, the leader of the investigation team of the Cleansing Branch. He led the team members on the 12th of this month to track them to the East Gate of Jiading, where they arrested Zhu. Shen escaped. Two thousand yuan in national currency was found on Zhu at the scene. Based on Zhu's confession, they went to the home of Shen Quanliang, a member of the gang in Nanxiang, and found a revolver, two large six-inch pistols, one pistol grip, and five rifles, and thirteen bullets. Shen Quanliang was previously a gunsmith in the army. When the search was conducted, the suspect was out and not caught. That night, Zhu was escorted to the branch for strict interrogation. Zhu confessed that the firearms belonged to his teacher, Wang Nianqing, and there was also a light machine gun and many rifles hidden there. The team leader will pursue the case based on Zhu's confession and bring them to justice.

### Grain Rationing Within the Shanghai South Blockade Line: 150 Bags of Rice Allocated to Longhua and Caohejing Towns

The current population within the blockade line in Longhua and Caohejing Towns in this city is estimated at 7,000. Since the implementation of grain rationing in the urban area, these towns have not yet organized it, resulting in a severe shortage of food supply for the residents of these towns. In order to generally alleviate the food threat to the residents of these towns, the Municipal Grain Bureau decided to effectively supervise and handle the grain rationing from the beginning of this month, and allocate approximately 150 bags of rice based on the current population. All procedures are ready. It is reported that each person will be given 2.5 liters of grain per phase.

### Know How on Air Defense: Questions and Answers (2)

(Question) Please explain the handling method when an incendiary bomb ignites after being hit.

(Answer) Let's start with the handling of when an incendiary bomb falls. Once you understand where the incendiary bomb has landed, you must immediately come out of the shelter and tell the people nearby to let them know. When the incendiary bomb falls, the enemy plane has already left its original position, so don't worry about the same place being hit by two incendiary bombs. The sound of an incendiary bomb exploding is very loud, sparks fly everywhere, and the fire is very strong, but the direct danger to the human body is less than that of a bomb, so as long as you are brave and alert, use a wet cloth or yellow sand clear water to put out the fire, and prevent it from spreading to nearby combustibles, this is the most important thing, but do not directly use water to put out the incendiary bomb containing burning oil.

In this way, the fire will weaken. If the hit location is inside the house, use a long stick or hoe to move the fire source that has burst out to the outside of the house and let it burn out. This is something you must remember. Secondly, if there is a fire, you must first report to the fire brigade and ask them to dispatch. Before the fire brigade arrives, you should concentrate on using fire extinguishers to put out the fire. Water must be poured on the fire.

If a fire breaks out in a high place, you should use objects to break the connection and spray water at the same time. If a fire breaks out on the ground or on the floor, use a long stick to destroy it. If the fire is severe and the family firefighters cannot extinguish it, you should spray water on the adjacent houses to prevent it from spreading, especially be careful of the wind direction.

Those engaged in fire prevention work must first wet their clothes with water, and their actions must be calm. If you panic, it will cause a big fire.

(Question) Do pregnant women have an obligation to attend air defense training?

(Answer) Pregnant women and women in childbirth are in a protected position and can be exempted from service. The reason is that pregnant women must prevent miscarriage and protect the fetus. Regarding this point, the Civil Air Defense Headquarters will inform pregnant women and women in childbirth to be handled in accordance with the following air defense laws.

When necessary for air defense, the evacuation to avoid the danger of air raids may be prohibited or restricted in accordance with the provisions of the Air Defense Law, but this does not apply to one of the following circumstances:

(1) Children in the elementary grades of national schools (or equivalent to national schools) or those under the age of seven.

(2) Pregnant women and women in childbirth.

(3) Those who are 65 years old or older or are injured and sick, disabled, and unable to engage in air defense.

(4) Those who are indispensable to protect the above-mentioned people.

However, the enemy countries of Britain and the United States disregard humanity, and even non-combatants are among their bombing targets, so even if they are pregnant women, they should at least have air defense knowledge in case of emergency. (Mainland News, April 14)

### Economic Circle

According to Xin Yao Ye's news, red and green tea cores are still in high demand, but there are few sellers. As for other varieties, they are quiet and stagnant.

### Commentary: Advice to Speculators

Due to the National Government's punishment of those engaged in speculation, we feel that our advice to general speculators must not be said too early, because two and a half months ago (February 1st of this year), the editorial of this newspaper gave the following advice to speculators: First, speculators must know that the acquisition of huge profits is accidental and lucky, while the sanctions of criminal laws and regulations are inevitable and inescapable; second, whoever engages in speculation is not only walking down a dead end, but also becoming a sinner of the state and society.

In normal times, engaging in speculation is not allowed by the organizational state laws and regulations. If in wartime—during a period of scarcity of materials and decline in people's livelihood—one abandons the idea of "everyone eats when there is food" and only seeks one's own wealth, regardless of everyone else's poverty, this is not only an act that harms the state and society, but also an act that violates benevolence, righteousness, and morality. Because it is an act that harms the state and society, it cannot avoid legal sanctions; because it is an act that violates benevolence, righteousness, and morality, it cannot avoid social condemnation. We are willing to strongly advise those engaged in speculation to "base on their conscience and resolutely stop all actions that harm people's livelihood," and not wait for the advice of public opinion to be followed by the advice of national law. That would be too late!

### Ministry of Industry Convened the First Batch of Initiators of the Federation Yesterday: Soap and Candle Industries Schedule Inaugural Meetings

In order to urge the prompt organization and establishment of the ten categories of major commodity trade association federations, it specifically designated the first batch of five federations to be established, namely the cotton industry, the cotton product industry, the match industry, the soap and candle industry, and the cigarette industry, to begin preparations for organization. It is reported that the Ministry of Industry specifically convened the initiators of the first batch of four industrial and commercial trade federations at 2:00 pm yesterday (14th) within the National Commercial Control Association to hold a discussion meeting.

### Vice Ministers Chen and Yuan Arrive in Nanjing: Investigation Work Continues

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency): The National Government authorities, in order to thoroughly investigate Shanghai's general speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants, previously specially dispatched Chen Zhishuo, Decision Director of the Ministry of Finance, and Yuan Yuquan, Decision Director of the Ministry of Industry, to Shanghai to conduct the investigation work together with Secretary-General Zhao of the Shanghai Municipal Government and Supervisor Chen of the National Commercial Control Association. Recently, this work has come to an end. Decision Director Chen of the Ministry of Finance and Decision Director Yuan of the Ministry of Industry jointly returned to Nanjing the day before yesterday, and reported the progress of the investigation to the central government. In order to understand the truth, the reporter specially interviewed Vice Ministers Chen and Yuan to inquire about their experience in Shanghai. According to them, after arriving in Shanghai, they immediately consulted with Secretary-General Zhao and Supervisor Chen to discuss the investigation methods, and reviewed the lending business of banks and money shops. Based on the investigation of the giants whose loans were guaranteed by the banks and money shops, they investigated whether there was any speculation and hoarding. On the 12th, they also convened leaders of the banking industry for an informal discussion to clarify the intention of the investigation. It has now been confirmed that ×××, the operator of ×× Company, illegally hoarded important materials, and ×× Bank is also suspected of serious involvement. They have been separately detained and sent to court, or temporarily ordered to suspend business. However, unscrupulous merchants who hoard are probably not limited to this, so although they have returned to Nanjing, the investigation work is still continuing. The goal is to curb the unscrupulous merchants and stabilize prices. It is expected that after this thorough investigation, the market situation will improve.

### Central Reserve Bank Issues New Subsidiary Coin Notes

### Municipal Economic Bureau Limits All Businesses to Mark the Sale Price of Goods

Central News Agency, Shanghai: Recently, prices have soared without end, affecting the people's livelihood. After the establishment of the Municipal Economic Bureau, in order to prevent businesses in the urban area from manipulating goods and disrupting the market, it has specially submitted a request to the municipal government for approval to limit all businesses in the urban area to mark the sale price of goods within ten days, in order to curb the rise in prices and effectively prevent unscrupulous merchants from exceeding the price limit. Those who dare to deliberately violate this will be severely punished, in order to suppress and stabilize prices in the urban area and benefit the people's livelihood.

### 18,000 Tons of Coal Allocated in the Ninth Phase: Distributed in Four Grades, Prices for Each Grade Have Been Set Separately, Payment and Collection of Goods Deadline on the 20th

The amount of coal allocated for the months of April, May, and June of this year has been decided by the authorities to be a total of 18,000 tons, including 11,000 tons for people's livelihood and 7,000 tons for household use. It has been distributed by Da Zhong Lian Coal Company to the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association. All payments must be paid clearly and delivery orders collected by April 20th, otherwise it will be considered as abandonment.

Four-Grade Distribution

Yesterday, it was learned that the ninth batch of coal allocation, the Coal Retailers Association, has decided to distribute it in four grades: A, B, C, and D. Grade A: Yangquan lump 7.375 tons, Liuquan screened lump 2.375 tons, Shandong screened lump 2 tons; Grade B: Yangquan lump 5.875 tons, Liuquan screened lump 1.875 tons, Shandong screened lump 1.625 tons; Grade C: Yangquan lump 4.375 tons, Liuquan screened lump 1.375 tons, Shandong screened lump 1.25 tons; Grade D: Yangquan lump 3 tons, Liuquan screened lump 1 ton, Shandong screened lump 0.75 tons.

Collecting Agencies

All coal retailers should pay the payment to the 28 major coal companies such as Yitai Xing, Huazhong, and Yuantai from today onwards, obtain receipts and delivery orders, so that they can deliver the goods with the orders. The deadline is set for the 20th of this month. If these procedures are not fulfilled after the deadline, the membership will be revoked and the right to allocate coal will be suspended. The Coal Retailers Association has notified all its member companies separately. They can use this notice (each must affix its own seal) to handle matters with the designated coal companies or coal dealers.

Coal for People's Livelihood

Most of the above-mentioned coal are white coal, which is suitable for restaurants and has good quality. Once these coal retailers have been allocated, they must sell them to those who use coal for people's livelihood, such as families, bathhouses, hot water businesses, apartments, and restaurants, at the limited price, and must not sell them to factories, etc. Those who violate this will be punished according to the regulations once discovered. The daily coal needed by factories in various industries is allocated by the authorities on a regular basis, so it seems that there is no need to add to the coal from the coal industry.

### New Economic Policy Towards China Discussed at East Asia Economic Conference

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – In order to thoroughly implement the new economic policies towards China decided by Japan after China's participation in the war, and to promote Sino-Japanese economic cooperation based on the new economic policies, the East Asia Economic Conference was held at the Marunouchi Greater East Asia Hall on the 14th. Present were Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Vice-Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Director-General Takeuchi of the General Affairs Bureau, related officials from the Army, Navy, and Munitions Ministry, and representatives of the people, totaling seventy individuals. First, Chairman Ogura delivered a speech, followed by Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry, who explained the situation after the implementation of the new economic policies towards China, and then exchanged opinions with each other.

### Director of the Nanjing Economic Bureau Discusses Solving the Price Problem

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency)

The price problem is of great importance to the people's livelihood. The government authorities have been actively implementing effective countermeasures to seek price suppression and stabilize people's livelihood. Yesterday, reporters specially visited Mr. Lin Dazhong, Director of the Nanjing Municipal Economic Bureau, to inquire about everything. He kindly made the following statement: "Our bureau seeks a rational solution to the price problem. Firstly, we will start by rectifying and strengthening the various trade associations, ordering the municipal chamber of commerce and the various trade associations to report the list of directors and supervisors and their detailed experiences. We sincerely hope that those with prestige and experience in the business community will come forward to take charge of the affairs of the trade associations. Secondly, for all controlled goods, the respective trade associations will count the consumption quantity, and our bureau will assist in directly contacting the local authorities to issue transport permits, and then notify the various trade associations to go to the producing areas to purchase, and then distribute them evenly to the merchants for sale. The selling price will be determined by public discussion of the standard price, based on the production area price, actual transportation costs, and reasonable profits. At the same time, we also hope for the assistance of the public to jointly plan the implementation, so that price management will gradually become more reasonable."

### Translation and Commentary: Thorough Investigation of Hoarding and Punitive Policies

The National Government has ordered a thorough investigation of hoarding, hoping that the people will assist. This matter has now largely come to an end. Based on the method and process of the investigation, it is generally believed that the punitive policies are roughly as follows: Those engaged in speculation and hoarding by the National Government's financial institutions and other industrial and commercial circles are expected to be announced, but the scope of hoarding is too broad and the situation is so complicated that it is generally believed that only a very small part will be announced and publicized.

(1) The cooperation between newly established small banks and powerful large banks, the combination of newly established factories, enterprise companies, and large and small banks for speculation and hoarding, did not start today. Taking advantage of the gaps in the economic policies after the Greater East Asia War, planned and widespread speculation was carried out. The public believes that it is impossible to thoroughly eliminate it with only four days of investigation (from April 9th to 12th).

(2) As for the financial background of hoarding activities, checking the account books of some banks can certainly reveal the use of checks, loans, deposits. However, if the goods hoarded in warehouses and residences are not immediately thoroughly investigated and sealed up, then it will be difficult to thoroughly expose hoarding. However, there are only four investigators, and it is impossible to actually inspect warehouses and residences. The scope of the fundamental investigation has already been limited by itself.

(3) The factional forces in Shanghai's economic circles and the political relationships behind the scenes are very complicated and subtle. Therefore, such investigations cannot ignore the political and economic realities. There must be a relatively strong non-factional political force.

It is believed that the National Government has the determination to eradicate hoarding and eliminate such doubts and rumors. The future handling of the National Government can sweep away people's doubts about hoarding engaged in by political figures or about the Central Reserve Bank. Whether it can stabilize people's hearts is a major issue in the future. Therefore, everyone hopes for fair punishment and a thorough policy of controlling materials and managing prices.

### Troubles and Life

— Qi Luo

A plant produced from excellent seeds is easily deformed due to adverse environmental conditions. Similarly, a perfect child with excellent innate qualities can suffer adverse consequences due to various bad experiences on the path of "life." "Troubles" are a very important part of the bad environment on the path of "life." When our hearts are filled with dissatisfaction, many chaotic thoughts are aroused, and constantly thinking about the unsatisfactory reality produces "troubles." "Troubles" are harmful to "life" and have no benefit. "Troubles" make us think wildly, and our observation of everything becomes blurred. "Troubles" cause us to develop neurasthenia: feeling tired all day, dizzy, indigestion, bad temper, and insomnia at night. "Troubles" make us become uninterested, emotionally unstable, depressed, and pessimistic. "Troubles" can shorten people's lives? "Troubles" can cause family tragedies and the misfortunes of society and the country... Who has ever benefited from "troubles" and reached the road to success?

How pitiful! Those who are trapped by "troubles."

Often we can see many degenerates in society who initially developed some of the above-mentioned phenomena due to "troubles." Then, they become less diligent in their work, and everything shows a backward trend, and eventually they fail and are destroyed.

The opposite of "troubles" is "optimism." We must get rid of "troubles" and seek success. The only way is to be content, content with real life. Observe everything with an "optimistic" attitude. Then, a happy life is truly waiting for us! The "life" we hope for will also gain brilliant light due to the elimination of "troubles."

### Spirit of Fearlessness

— Yan Yanchu

The spirit of fearlessness is the most precious thing in the world. With it, the world will progress, otherwise the whole world will appear to be in decline, and there will no longer be the spirit of rapid progress. We often see a young man, holding great ambitions, burying himself in hard work every day. However, after suffering a failure and being ridiculed by relatives and friends, his enthusiastic ambition is like withered wood and dead ashes, and he even abandons his original plan, viewing his future as a dangerous path, thinking that it is full of thorns and cannot be further developed. His spirit is also abandoned, and he eventually becomes a failure on the journey of life. On the contrary, if he is not discouraged by failure, not hindered by sarcasm, firmly adheres to his will, and moves forward with a spirit of fearlessness, he will eventually discover the truth and invent things, and the world will progress accordingly. Therefore, only the spirit of fearlessness can send this person to the forefront of the times and drive the progress of all undertakings in the world.

When Columbus set out to explore, those who considered themselves smart all said it was a crazy idea. No one could sympathize with his thoughts. However, he resolutely moved forward regardless of everything and finally discovered the New World!

In the era before airplanes, people all said that riding the clouds and mist was only the ability of gods and could never be used by the world. However, today, it is not surprising that airplanes cross the Pacific Ocean and span the Eurasian continent.

When Stephenson invented the train and requested the Upper House to build a permanent railway, he encountered great difficulties. The members all said that the train's speed exceeding fifteen miles per hour would cause the danger of overturning. He firmly denied it and explained the reasons. After many negotiations, the parliament allowed him to build an experimental railway on the condition that the speed should not exceed fifteen miles per hour. Now, humans safely ride trains at a speed of one mile per minute without any danger!

Edison Bell's invention of electric lights and telephones went through dozens or hundreds of failures, but he was finally able to invent them. Humans simply cannot be separated from electric lights and telephones for a moment.

It can be seen that the reason why inventors can invent these things is that they all have a spirit of fearlessness and succeed through continuous struggle. Therefore, we need to earnestly bury ourselves in hard work to create the great cause of the future world.

### Zero and Whole

— Ji Weiyi

Usually, many people can use a "whole" sum of money or a "whole" time. However, they are unwilling to use "scattered" money or "scattered" time.

For example, you can get one hundred yuan in two ways: one is to take ten yuan every day and finish it in ten days; the other is to take one hundred yuan at a time. Then, you probably prefer the "whole" method. Perhaps after getting it, you will use it all at once, and spend the remaining nine days in a tight life. This is such a dangerous habit.

For example, if you have ten minutes of free time before eating, someone asks you to read an article or do some "scattered" things. You might say, "There will be plenty of time after eating! I'll do it then." And lightly let this precious ten minutes slip away.

Why do everyone like "whole" and ignore "zero"? This is really an incomprehensible question. But, thinking about it carefully, it is nothing more than the bad habits of "procrastination" and "greed." How regrettable, there are many, many things in the world that have suffered setbacks and failures because they didn't pay attention to "zero." And, of course, a person who doesn't pay attention to "zero" won't use "whole" very well either.

As the saying goes, "To do great things, you must start from small things." If we cannot accumulate "scattered" money into a large sum, and cannot use many five-minute and ten-minute "scattered" times as a "whole" time, then, in our short life process, we will waste so much precious power invisibly. And when the "whole" sum of money and the "whole" time are in front of us, we will feel helpless and not know how to use them!

"Many grains of sand make a pagoda." This is truly a golden saying. We must treat "zero" and "whole" the same to achieve extraordinary success.

Look!

An old, wounded,

Old warrior,

Will re-sing the march of his life

Establish his future great achievements

Youth!

Get up!

Love that new life of the future!

### Roots

— Xin Bo

Of course, if they all rushed up at the same time, Dagen would definitely fail. But although they shouted "Everyone come on together," no one dared to really go first.

"Brother Dagen, Brother Dagen!" A Wu ran over, with several people chasing behind him. He rushed through Dagen's perimeter and onto Dagen's high mound. His clothes had been torn a large piece, and there were several red and swollen spots on his face. He and Dagen stood back-to-back defending, and they both felt relieved.

Soon, the people from the south of the mountain, from Lingshan Bay to Chongwen Town, came one after another, and then another kind of fierce battle started below the high mound. Based on the voice, based on the expression, based on various reasons, they could recognize who was a comrade, who was an enemy, and who was an irrelevant idler, and would never hit the wrong person. The people from the south of the mountain became more numerous; the people from the south of the mountain gradually gained the upper hand; the siege of the high mound was finally lifted.

"Damn it, beat these bastards to death!" A Wu was full of enthusiasm, jumped down from the high mound, and joined the battle. Dagen did not move, still standing on the high mound. However, he had put down his defensive posture, acting as a leisurely bystander. He didn't want to show off his ability; he had no interest in fighting.

"The team people" are here! "The team people" are here!" Suddenly, someone in a certain group fighting shouted like this, and then several people with broken heads and bleeding faces rushed out, fleeing north in embarrassment.

"The team people" are here! "The team people" are here!" Various groups echoed each other.

Dagen still did not move, with some smiles on his face.

A thick fog, carrying drizzling rain, covered the top of the mountain from the north of the mountain. Immediately, the people on the top of the mountain each lost the target they wanted to see. No one could see anyone.

"The Three Mao Bodhisattvas are driving the clouds!" the children were shouting, "The Three Mao Bodhisattvas are driving the clouds!"

"Hahaha! They're setting off a smoke screen!" A Wu's laughter reached Dagen's ears from the thick fog.

"Brother A Wu! Brother A Wu!" Dagen shouted, "Come here! Come here!"

"Coming, coming," A Wu responded. But he responded for a long time, but he still didn't walk to Dagen's side, and finally said again, "Damn it, I can't see!"

The thick fog suddenly came and suddenly left, and everyone's eyes regained their original function. However, the drizzle was still falling.

A Wu walked over, and Dagen also got off the high mound. A Wu was still rubbing his fists, showing that his remaining bravery was commendable.

"How is it, is there anything serious?" Dagen asked with concern. (31)

### Seventh Place in February Essay Contest: How to Read, What to Read? (Part 1)

— Ni Guizhang

Heaven has endowed us humans with wisdom, enabling us to read and understand principles, and learn to be sound people. For this reason, whether male or female, whether rich or poor, and regardless of age, intelligence, or foolishness, all human beings should read. However, there are many people who understand the importance of reading and know the benefits of reading, but only because they do not read in the right way, they gradually become indifferent to reading. Even if they reluctantly read, they achieve half the result with twice the effort and do not get much benefit. This is such a pity! Therefore, we should not read if we don't, but if we want to read, we must have good methods. I am not a good reader, but I dare to introduce the reading methods I know here, just to provide a reference for the readers.

For the sake of convenience, the reading methods are divided into two parts, basic and subject-specific, to explain as follows:

1. Basic Reading Method

(1) Attitude towards reading (A) Interest: The most important driving force for reading is interest. With interest, reading is not considered a bitter thing, and you can concentrate, have a deep impression, and have lasting memory. Therefore, before reading and during reading, you should always have a strong interest, then after reading, you can still feel endless interest. (B) Concentration: You must concentrate when reading, and you must not be thinking wildly while reading. The situation of "thinking that a swan is coming, thinking about pulling the bow to shoot it" will not achieve the function of reading. (C) Perseverance: The most taboo thing about reading is not having perseverance. Today you are happy and read dozens of pages, but tomorrow you are unhappy, so you don't read for a few days, "one day's sun, ten days' frost," will inevitably lead to nothing. If you don't finish reading a book, you abandon it and read other books. This way of reading will inevitably lead to nothing. Therefore, reading should have perseverance. (D) Questions: You should use more thought when reading, and ask questions at all times. Reading to solve problems will make it easier to have insights. Mencius said: "To believe everything in a book is worse than having no book." Zhang Zai, a Confucian scholar in the Song Dynasty, said: "Those who do not doubt when they should doubt will not learn. Learning requires doubt." We cannot but doubt more and investigate the root cause when reading. Tao Yuanming's reading method of not seeking thorough understanding is unacceptable. (E) Application: Never forget to apply when reading, and should always cite social phenomena and actual situations to illustrate. After reading, you should apply the knowledge in the book to the facts to confirm whether the knowledge in the book is true. If you only know how to read by rote and don't know how to apply it, then you will only create a bookworm.

(2) Reading tools When reading, you should have various tools. In addition to books, you should have notes to record the main ideas of the book, for future reference. You must also have dictionaries and vocabularies; if you are studying history and geography, you must also have maps for reference.

(3) Reading environment Although it is said that people who want to read can read anywhere, it is not suitable for reading in a noisy environment, such as singing or snoring. As for dark places and backlit places, they are not good reading environments.

(4) Reading time It is best to read in the morning. When reading at other times, the time should not be too long, and there must be appropriate rest. Reading different types of books alternately is also a way to regulate nerves. Reading late at night is extremely quiet, but it is harmful to both eyesight and body, so it is better not to read.

(5) Reading economics If you don't have enough economic power and want to read, you can only borrow from the library or friends, or organize a reading club and pool money to buy books, or you can spend a small amount of money and read a large number of books. Those who are determined to read will be able to overcome the environment and strive to make progress; only those who abandon themselves will make excuses for not having money to buy books and refuse to read.

### Spring in Shanghai

— Written by Tianming

Introducing a famous book, "Yun Ke Man Lu", written by Yang Weiyun of Wuxi. Mr. Yang made remarkable achievements in summarizing and verifying accounting policies in the early Republic of China and was a famous scholar in our country. This book is divided into two volumes. The first volume describes the philosophy of life in our country, and the second volume discusses the methods by which people in various countries appreciate literature and art, as a means of cultivating sentiment and nourishing nature. This book has now been translated into English by Mr. Liu Linsheng, who has been engaged in Chinese and English literature for many years and has enjoyed a good reputation. The translation is faithful, expressive, and fluent, and is not much different from Lin Yutang's works. A hardcover copy is priced at twenty-five yuan and is sold by the Commercial Press.

### All Sectors Enthusiastically Donate: List of Donations for the Holy Mother's Infant Asylum

Sister Bu Daixian, Director of the Holy Mother's Infant Asylum in Xujiahui, Shanghai, wrote to say that since your newspaper published the interview report on the Holy Mother's Infant Asylum on February 22 of this year, many readers have donated money. The names and amounts of donations have been listed and sent to your newspaper for thank you. The interview report has also been printed into leaflets for distribution. We admire your perseverance and kindness. Now, we are sending the list of donations received from readers again, and we still ask you to disclose it on our behalf to express our gratitude. In addition, an anonymous great philanthropist has promised to donate 30,000 yuan per month for one year. In addition, the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association will subsidize 20,000 yuan per month for three months. The difficulties of our hospital's infant asylum for several years have finally seen hope. This is truly due to the prestige of the newspaper, which, once advocated and publicized, is enough to gain the trust of people in the community and quickly obtain their sympathy. Our hospital is deeply grateful, needless to say. I thought that our hospital only knew how to silently fulfill its righteousness for orphans, but now it has received the help of the community, so we must think more about receiving it from the community and repaying it to the community, ensuring that there is no waste of money from philanthropists, and that there is no lack of emotion for orphans. We hope that all sectors will continue to provide relief, so that our hospital's infant asylum business can not only last for a long time, but also, if there is extra power, we deeply wish to expand this extra heart, hoping to give more accommodation and care to orphans. We sincerely hope that you will observe this. The list of donations is as follows: Poor and Sick Relief Association 20,000 yuan, Qiu Yuru 2,000 yuan. Sheng Wo Jing 2,500 yuan, Wang Chun De Tang, Jiading Infant Asylum, Anonymous, Xu Mu Xing each 1,000 yuan. Rong Zhi Kang 600 yuan. Zhang Huici, Anonymous each 300 yuan. Yu Sheng Gong, Mrs. Hua, Zhou Jiancheng, Hechang Company, Cao Dekui, Mr. Qiu, Anonymous, Yuan Zhongyi each 200 yuan.

Zhang Yixiang 40 yuan. Zhao Wenxiang broken rice totaled 34 yuan. Huang Rubin, Cai Jiren each 30 yuan. Chen Fengshu, Zhang Yousheng, Hua Yiying each 20 yuan. Cheng Ruifang, Anonymous, Fan Jiagu, Zhu Jiangtao, Sun Songhe, Xu Junyao each 10 yuan. Cai Huaide, Chen Hongxiang each 5 yuan. A total of 29,975 yuan.

Printing Nie's Mother's Posthumous Writings Mr. Zhu Mingxin wrote to say: "Wealth is like floating clouds and is not worth boasting about. The folk customs are too extravagant. I often advise people with the two words: Diligence and frugality are the foundation of a good family. Alas, the world is deteriorating, people's hearts are not ancient, and the extravagance is now intense. Improving customs is the most urgent task. I once asked Mrs. Zeng, Nie's mother, for her ninetieth birthday, to write Zeng Wenzheng's family motto: "A diligent family will prosper, a diligent person will be healthy, and those who are diligent and frugal will never be poor." to encourage myself. Now the old lady has passed away to heaven, and her handwriting is still there, which is very precious. I dare not keep it secret and share it with my friends. I hope everyone knows the way to manage a family, and diligence and frugality are still important? I hope to save the situation. I previously donated 100 yuan to do my part. There are many people with good intentions at sea, and I hope they will generously help with the printing costs so that they can be distributed widely and achieve their success as soon as possible. How can I bear not to pray for it?" (Editor's note: Nie's mother's posthumous writings take the two words diligence and frugality as the foundation for establishing oneself, managing a family, and dealing with the world. She entrusted Bai Yun Jushi to handle the printing, and each copy is two yuan. If readers want to print and send them to others, please contact us.)
