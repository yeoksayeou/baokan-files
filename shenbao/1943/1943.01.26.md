### Further Discussion on the Implementation of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

Regarding the implementation of the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration of January 9th and the Sino-Japanese Treaty, this newspaper has previously offered suggestions on the spirit and essence of implementing the treaty. We have always believed that the Sino-Japanese Agreement contains positive significance, and that unlimited strength must be generated from the practice of this agreement—unlimited strength in politics, military affairs, economy, and culture. In other words, the greatest goal of the Sino-Japanese Agreement must be to strive to increase production and increase the strength of the two countries in combat from today onwards, in order to fulfill the mission of the two countries to the new era. Therefore, the practice of the treaty must not be abstract and passive, but must be concrete and active. Now, we would like to propose the following three principles regarding concrete implementation methods for the reference of the Sino-Japanese authorities.

First, in the concrete work of implementing the Sino-Japanese Agreement, anything that is suitable for China to preside over completely in the future, that is, any undertaking that can achieve greater results if China manages it itself than if Japan presides over it, should be handed over to China for management as soon as possible without hesitation. The Chinese side must have the spirit of not shirking responsibility, regarding it as an assumption of responsibility, rather than a recovery of rights, in order to achieve greater effectiveness in the future. This selfless manifestation must be implemented in every word and deed of the two countries' interactions in the future in order to thoroughly guarantee the eternal cooperation of the two countries in the future.

Second, in the concrete work of implementing the Sino-Japanese Agreement, for any undertakings that are most suitable for cooperation between China and Japan in the future, regardless of the type of undertaking, we hope that both sides will cooperate sincerely and adopt more effective methods to complete the common mission of China and Japan. We cannot say that all matters can be managed by China alone and achieve better results than Japanese management. There are some undertakings that may only be able to proceed smoothly under the principle of division of labor and cooperation between China and Japan, so both sides should conduct cooperation openly.

Third, we must at least admit that the strengths of China and Japan are very different at present. From political organization and economic structure to technical standards, they are unbalanced. Precisely because of this, the cooperation between the two countries has a practical basis, rather than merely a theoretical one. Also, precisely because of this, in the concrete work of implementing the Sino-Japanese Agreement, for some undertakings that are currently beyond China's financial and human resources, especially its technology, it is more effective for Japan to act alone than for China to preside over it alone or for China and Japan to cooperate. Then, under the premise of recovering sovereignty, it is advisable to invite the Japanese side to continue to preside over it, without making any unnecessary changes in personnel, institutions, or scope of work.

The above three points fully consider the actual situation, fully consider the actual effect, and are completely for the purpose of enabling China and Japan to have greater strength at present to defeat the common enemy, and at the same time to take into account the eternal cooperation between China and Japan after the war. We demand that in the steps and methods of treaty implementation, both China and Japan must absolutely not harbor any so-called face-saving mentality, and must absolutely be "selfless" and "open and honest," focusing on practical needs. Because this work is not only related to the life and death of China and Japan, but also to the life and death of all the people of East Asia.

### Soviet Counter-Offensive Suffers Setback

President Hitler, in his New Year's address to the German military, elaborated his determination, roughly saying: "We must overcome the difficulties of this winter with the spirit of last winter. This war has no possibility of compromise." Chairman Kalinin of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also delivered a speech on New Year's Day, calling on the people: "We must move towards final victory." Observing the words of the leaders of both sides, it is sufficient to prove that the German-Soviet war will become even more intense this year. The Soviet Red Army attempted to exhaust the strength of the German army as much as possible this winter in order to recover lost territory in one fell swoop. However, according to recent information, the Red Army's attempt has been thwarted by the German army's fierce attack.

According to Chairman Kalinin, the Red Army's counter-offensive against Germany began in the Stalingrad area on November 19th last year, in the central area on November 25th, and in the middle reaches of the Don River on December 16th. Since the end of the year, it has launched counter-offensives from the northern ocean to the Caucasus front. The Red Army's main operation focused on the battle to seize Rostov. Red Army leaders believed that after recovering Rostov, the German forces in Stalingrad and the North Caucasus could be isolated. Proceeding south from the divergence point of the Don and Donets rivers, heavy troops were deployed across the Manukee (phonetic) Canal to the Salsk front, further threatening the west. Part of it has advanced to the area near Xiafu Tuoi in the corner of Donbass. The Red Army's destination, Rostov, is only 60 kilometers southwest of Xiafu Tuoi.

In the North Caucasus area located south of Rostov, the Red Army launched a fierce attack on the German army on the banks of the Terek River. In the Stalingrad area, the Red Army mobilized 16 divisions (including 6 tank divisions, totaling 300,000 troops) to launch a general offensive. Powerful counter-offensives were also launched in the Don and Vawow rivers. The front line in the central and northern regions focused on retaking the city of Velikiye Luki. In the northeastern part of Leningrad, a fierce attack was also launched on the 11th of this month with the joint efforts of the army and air force. In the Kandarlaksha area of northern Karelia, troops were mobilized to attack the German-Finnish forces facing them.

The German-Finnish forces temporarily concealed themselves and allowed the Red Army to make local advances and retreats. However, since the beginning of the year, they have gradually strengthened their counter-attack posture. On the 10th of this month, they launched a full-scale attack on the Red Army and won great victories on all fronts. The Red Army lost countless tanks, and its attempt was thus frustrated. From November 20th of last year to the 11th of this month, the German army destroyed 550 Red Army tanks. This shows a glimpse of the intensity of this winter operation. In addition to the above-mentioned counter-offensives, the German army also launched air raids on the Rubaqi Peninsula on the Arctic coast and the ports of Murmansk and Kantalakska on the White Sea coast, inflicting heavy damage on the Soviet side.

The climate on the German-Soviet front this winter is not as cold as last winter. At the same time, the German army's cold-weather equipment is more complete and tidy than last winter, which is one of the reasons for the Red Army's failure in its winter counter-offensive. The biggest reason for the failure is that the Soviet Union over-relied on Britain and the United States. Stalin believed that the British and American operations in North Africa were at least unfavorable to the Axis forces. Therefore, he simultaneously launched active operations against the German army. However, the situation in North Africa had no impact on Germany's combat power. Britain and the United States were alarmed by the real situation of the German-Soviet war. However, the blow to Britain and the United States from this situation is actually more pessimistic than the setbacks suffered by the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities must not ignore this point.

### Central Voronezh District German Army Shortens Defense Line Automatically Abandoning Bridgehead Forts Stalingrad's Isolated Army Achieves Immortal Feats

Berlin, 25th, Allied Press Urgent Telegram. The German High Command announced today that in order to shorten the defense line, the German army withdrew from the Voronezh bridgehead on the Don River without being subjected to Soviet pressure. The Soviet army launched an offensive on the long front south of Voronezh, but was painfully attacked by the German army, suffered heavy damage, and retreated. The High Command also praised the heroic resistance of the German army and its allies in the Stalingrad area, saying that the Sixth Army sacrificed itself in Stalingrad, fought heroically, and gained immortal glory. The Romanian 20th Infantry Division and 1st Cavalry Division fought side by side with their German comrades to the end and also shared in the glory. At the same time, the German army continued to defend against Soviet attacks in several areas of the southern front, and the German counter-offensive between the Chmani hub and the Don River, although met with strong Soviet resistance, finally reached its goal. Enemy offensives against the southern side of the German army in the Don and Donets River regions were all repulsed, and the German army has consolidated its positions. The fighting in western Caucasus was hindered by rain. The Soviet offensive in the Kuban area was jointly repulsed by the German and Slovak armies. The Soviet army's continuous attacks south of Lake Ladoga, day and night, were also repulsed.

### Caucasus Battle Moves to Kuban Area German Army Smoothly Conducts Avoidance War

Switzerland, Jingyu, 24th, Havas News Agency Telegram. According to Axis sources, the situation on the Eastern Front is still unabated, with the focus shifting to the southern route. A summary of the situation on each route is as follows: (1) The German army in northern Caucasus smoothly conducted a circumvention battle yesterday, moving the battle to the Kuban Basin. The Red Army was unable to prevent the German army from reorganizing its forces. (2) North of the plain along the Manych River, the German army counterattacked, and the Red Army retreated eastward, losing 23 tanks. (3) The Red Army in the Rostov area gained nothing. Repeated attempts to land were repulsed. (4) A German team in the Stalingrad area is still fighting to the death, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. The Red Army once broke through the German line last night, but the entire defense line remained intact, and fierce fighting is still going on. (5) Since November 20th of last year, the Axis forces have destroyed 6,200 Soviet tanks between the Don and Volga rivers. (6) The Don area is still the center of the battle, and the war is currently being fought west of the river. The German-Hungarian Allied Forces in the middle reaches of the Don River counterattacked and achieved local victories. (7) A Red Army team south of Voronezh was surrounded. (8) From Voronezh north to the Arctic coast, there was almost no fighting yesterday. According to sources from Rome, Italian mountain troops are holding the front line on the Eastern Front, assisting the German army in operations in the Caucasus and Don River regions. A commentator on Rome Radio claimed that the war is proceeding according to plan. In this situation, reserve troops are the most important factor. The Red Army is wasting manpower and resources by transferring all reserve troops to the war zone. In the Axis High Command, it is better to abandon certain areas than to suffer heavy damage, which would be detrimental to the future of the war. Soviet newspapers fully understand the German military strategy and have warned against being overly optimistic about the Red Army's offensive.

### Ambassador Shigemitsu Returned to Nanjing Yesterday, Made a Statement to Reporters

Nanjing, 25th, Central News Agency Telegram. Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu went to Shanghai on the 19th of this month to hold important discussions with Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China, Commander Yoshida of the Chinese Fleet, and local Japanese agencies of the Army and Navy, as well as various agencies of third countries, to determine the political and economic policies to adapt to the new situation after our country's entry into the war. He has returned to Nanjing at 2:20 pm on the 25th after completing his mission. At 4 pm on the same day, Mr. Shigemitsu specially met with the press corps at the embassy and made a statement as follows: "My trip to Shanghai was partly to inspect the areas under my jurisdiction as the Ambassador to China, and to observe the actual situation in Shanghai, the most important center in China after China's entry into the war. In Shanghai, I met with Commander-in-Chief [blank] and Commander Yoshida of the Fleet and exchanged opinions with each other. As a result, we unanimously advocated that in order to adapt to the central government's promotion of strong policies, the local branch agencies, the Army, the Navy, and the Greater East Asia Ministry should also cooperate in unity. In terms of the situation in Shanghai, all aspects of the Japanese side can cooperate in unity to adapt to the new situation and follow the central government's policy. I am very pleased with this enthusiasm. I also met directly with representatives from various sectors of the private sector and listened to their opinions. All parties can fully understand this policy. During my stay in Shanghai, I had many in-depth opportunities for talks with the Chinese side. Also, at the inaugural meeting of the Diplomatic Promotion Association, well-known figures in Shanghai's diplomatic circles attended and expressed their strong determination to cooperate in developing China's future diplomatic relations. I am very pleased with this point. Chinese people of insight understand the meaning of participating in the war and understand Japan's true intentions, believing that since China is now an ally of Japan and stands on the common front, the path that China should take is very clear. Policies consistent with Japan are to actively implement the common purpose of prosecuting the war. This tendency will become more intense and urgently needed in the future. After the transformation of Japan's policy toward China and China's participation in the war, various situations may change. This change is progressive. China and Japan, standing on the common front, must have a long-term vision and act cautiously in order to achieve the common goal of the Greater East Asia War. Once a decision is made, it must be quickly and actively implemented. Japan will quickly put into practice what it once vowed to do. Regarding the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the various matters in the treaties concluded between Japan and China are currently underway. I think they will be concretized soon."

### Fierce Battles in Tunisia All Day Axis Forces Make Progress Both Sides Fight to Death for Strategic Heights US Troops Reinforce from Algeria

Switzerland, Jingcheng, 24th, Havas News Agency Telegram. Fierce battles raged all day yesterday on the Tunisian front. According to German sources, Axis forces made progress in El Mansourah and Funduq al-Alalib. A team of US troops was surrounded in the mountains. Italian forces have sent troops to reinforce from Algeria. Also, according to the Italian official war report, Axis forces are currently building new positions, and the Air Force is also bombing Allied lines. According to the Allied Command war report, the German army is currently advancing towards Djebel Djaffap. Fierce fighting is raging between the two sides for the heights between Ban Zhubridge and Kairouan. French separatist forces were also forced to retreat in the Os利亚 Valley. According to the command of the French separatist forces in the port of Algiers, the Axis paratroopers who landed in the French defense zone have been resolved after fierce fighting. According to Rome's announcement, the armored units of the Axis forces in Tripolitania have already established new defense lines. Currently, only small-scale rearguard battles are taking place between Rommel's army and the British army. In addition, British and American aircraft bombed the airfields on Sicily, causing minor casualties among residents. A US destroyer was also sunk by us in the western sea of Algiers. Lisbon, 25th, Allied Press Telegram. According to news from North Africa received here, the battle in central Tunisia has become more intense in recent days. The Axis forces used mobile tactics and suddenly launched an offensive, crushing the resistance of the French rebels in the Osertia Creek Valley northwest of Kairouan. On the 23rd, they captured the strategic height of Djebel Djaffap in the southeast of the valley, suppressing the important road from Kairouan to Osertia, and pursuing the anti-Axis forces retreating to the west of the valley. They are currently advancing with all their strength. The anti-Axis command also admitted that the French rebels had retreated, and said that Djebel Djaffap had fallen into the hands of the Axis forces, so the French army had to retreat to Djebel Ousslat. It is generally believed that Axis Commander General Fin Anim will expand the stronghold in the Kairouan area to the north and south and strengthen the offensive taken north of Pengdevass. Therefore, the French rebels on the eastern side of the Atlas Mountains will soon be annihilated. The anti-Axis forces are deeply disturbed and have transferred the US 2nd Mechanized Division and 3rd Infantry Division from Teba萨方面 in Morocco to reinforce the Tunisian troops.

Berlin, 15th, Allied Press Telegram. On the night of the 23rd, the German Air Force, with a large formation of heavy bombers and escorted by fighter planes, attacked the anti-Axis transport base in Algiers, the port of Bona. At that time, they braved fierce artillery fire and bombed fiercely for 30 minutes, completely destroying the port facilities. At the same time, several places in the city caught fire and burned. Another formation of the German Air Force raided the anti-Axis airfields in Tunisia and Algeria.

### Significance of Rommel's Army Retreat British Eighth Army Loses More Than It Gains

Berlin, 25th, Allied Press Telegram. The German authorities explained the significance of Rommel's army's retreat operation on the 24th, saying that the movement of the German-Italian army west of Tripoli was not hindered by the British army in any way, and all movements were carried out smoothly according to plan. The British Eighth Army's work in the past three months has clearly attempted to encircle Rommel's army from the side, but today it has not only completely failed, but has also suffered heavy losses. In reality, although British Eighth Army Commander Montgomery is far superior to the Axis forces in terms of troop strength and modern weapons, he has still failed to drive out the Axis mechanized forces in North Africa, but has instead wasted combat power. Moreover, in the battles of recent days, the British side, especially a part of the southern wing, has suffered heavy damage to its weapons and troop strength. All of this is sufficient to prove that the combat power of Zamel's army has not been reduced in the slightest. The British operation has shown that it has failed, and the British army has never received supplies from the sea. In addition, the port facilities of Tripoli have been completely destroyed by the Axis forces, so the port is of no benefit to the supply of a large number of mechanized troops. Therefore, the Montgomery army will have to rely on the difficult land transport route in the future. This route is long and has many weaknesses and has been repeatedly bombed by the Axis air force in the past.

### The Position of Commander of the US Army in North Africa Rumored to be Succeeded by Marshall

Soviet Union, 25th, Allied Press Telegram. Since the establishment of the French North African regime, British Commander Eisenhower has been dictatorial, and the Chief Secretary of Politics Marie has also lacked flexibility, which has aroused criticism from both British and American political circles. According to a Washington special correspondent report in the London Chronicle, it is rumored that Eisenhower has recently resigned, and the vacancy has been appointed to General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the US Army. However, this statement has not been confirmed, but it has caused great repercussions in British political circles. Sweden, Jingcheng, 25th, Haitong News Agency Telegram. A special correspondent from a Swedish newspaper stationed in London reported that after learning that General Rommel's troops in North Africa had crossed the Tunisian border and occupied the Mareth Line, he was extremely disappointed. The British plan to prevent the German army from reaching Tunisia has now completely failed, and it will take time to reorganize General Montgomery's troops, so it will not be possible to launch an offensive against the Mareth Line in a hurry. Also, the British Eighth Army and the First Army may launch an offensive against the Mareth Line at the same time, but the First Army is making slow progress and may not be able to launch a major offensive early.

### Roosevelt and Churchill Discuss Unifying the United Front and Will Convene a Meeting of the Four Great Powers Important Announcements Will Be Made Soon

Sweden, Jingcheng, 25th, Allied Press Telegram. According to a Washington dispatch, US Secretary of State Hull told the press corps on the 23rd that US Ambassador to Britain Winant and British European Fleet Commander Stark were in Washington. He also hinted that Britain and the United States are currently holding major discussions on unifying the anti-Axis front. Therefore, it is generally believed that the British and American governments will issue a statement as soon as the discussions come to an end, clarifying the anti-Axis policies in operations and politics. Washington's diplomatic circles believe that the important topics of the agreement will be: (1) Regarding the organization of a four-nation conference by representatives of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing to serve as the highest anti-Axis agency; (2) Resolving the Anglo-American disputes over the French North African regime; (3) Opening a second war front in Europe and the Pacific War; (4) Countermeasures to deal with the Axis trade disruption war. It is expected that the results of this agreement will have an impact on the anti-Axis war policy in the future.

Sweden, 15th, Allied Press Telegram. According to a report by the British government, the British and American governments are holding extremely important negotiations in Washington, and official reports may be available soon. Although the content is unknown, it is believed that the political situation in French North Africa and the organization of a four-power meeting of Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, and Chiang Kai-shek are both under discussion. As for the saying that Churchill has arrived in Washington, it originated in London. During the meeting of the British House of Commons last week, Churchill was absent, and Deputy Prime Minister Adler reported on the war situation on his behalf. The outside world therefore speculated that Churchill had gone to the United States.

### Striving to Break the Deadlock in the North African Political Problem

Switzerland, Jingcheng, 24th, Havas Telegram. According to sources in London, the British and American sides may take new solutions to the North African political problem in order to break the deadlock. London has been constantly rumored that Prime Minister Churchill and US President Roosevelt decided to entrust General Baudru to preside over North African military and political affairs after a long talk. Mr. Jia was the former High Commissioner of France in Syria and Lebanon, and once served as the Governor of Vietnam. After participating in the 特戈尔派 分裂运动, he made great efforts in the attack on Syria and was appointed as the private representative of 特戈阐 in the Near East. In informed sources, it is said that Prime Minister Churchill's consultations in Washington have resulted in a solution that is difficult to solve the difficulties encountered by Britain in North Africa. For two and a half years, Jia Delu has been in collusion with 特戈尔. If he comes forward to deal with the North African political situation, it can be accepted by 特戈尔. However, it is questionable whether it will be accepted by the Inspector General of Morocco, Noguès, the Director General of French West Africa, Boisson, and General Jilao, because the former two usually despise Jia Delu's behavior, and Jilao may also have difficulties in giving up military power in North Africa.

### Australia's Prime Minister Curtin to Broadcast Today: Parliament to Convene Amidst Political Instability

Lisbon, 25th (Allied News) - According to a cable from Canberra, the Australian government has announced that Prime Minister Curtin is scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech on the 26th. It is also reported that in addition to being broadcast nationwide by Australian radio stations, both the United Kingdom and the United States are also planning to rebroadcast it. It is widely expected that Curtin will address the current situation of the war in the Southwest Pacific, as well as issues related to Australia's current human resources, the deployment of Australian troops overseas, and American aid. Currently, with Parliament not yet in session, the Australian political situation is quite unstable. The Labor Party has deep-seated opposition to the deployment of Australian troops overseas, leading to widespread rumors of a cabinet crisis. It is believed that Curtin's speech is intended to address Parliament under these circumstances. At the same time, the evolution of the war situation in the Southwest Pacific has made Australia's position increasingly precarious. Recently, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt delivered a speech strongly emphasizing Australia's crisis, and Minister for Shipping Beasley followed on the 24th, warning Australians that Australia's position has not improved. All of this demonstrates that senior Australian government officials are deeply concerned about a Japanese invasion of Australia. It is anticipated that Curtin will use this speech to point out the importance of the Pacific war situation and request that the United States strengthen its aid to Australia.

### Confirmation of the Sinking of the British Aircraft Carrier "Revenge"

Bern, Switzerland, 25th (Havas) - According to news from London, the British Admiralty has announced that the British aircraft carrier "Revenge" has sunk off the coast of North Africa, with a total of 507 personnel killed.

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to a cable from London, the British Admiralty announced yesterday that the submarine "Tra La" has not returned to its base beyond the expected timeframe, and it is presumed that it may have been sunk.

### India-Burma Border

— Kodama

Translation from Tokyo Asahi Shimbun

(Dispatch from Kodama, Special Correspondent of Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, from the Arakan Mountains on the India-Burma border, 6th) - The Arakan Mountains are located at the intersection of the India-Burma border. Sparsely populated, it is a wilderness where tigers, lions, elephants, leopards, and other wild beasts roam, with many mysterious stories passed down. The terrain is strategic, forming a natural defensive line in the western part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This reporter served as a war correspondent last winter...

I ventured deep into the Arakan Mountains, visiting the brave guards stationed there who look down on western India from the mountains. The jungle is dense, with the roars of tigers and the cries of monkeys capable of terrifying the soul. My visit coincided with the eve of the Lunar New Year, and the next morning, we celebrated New Year's Day together there.

Herds of Wild Monkeys in the Jungle

After crossing the Irrawaddy River, many Arakan tribesmen greeted us, welcoming our entry. Around 4 PM, we ventured further into the mountain road, flanked by towering jungles, with herds of wild monkeys jumping and frolicking in the trees. That night, we stayed in a mountain hut, and the brave guards stationed there welcomed the visitors from their distant homeland. They specially prepared roasted peacock meat as a treat, which was delicious. The next day, we followed a narrow path, which was treacherous. The Arakan Mountains stood majestically, a truly magnificent sight. The sun was scorching, and the heat of the day caused headaches, while the evenings were chilling.

Piles of White Bones at the Foot of the Mountains

There were many遗骸 and piles of white bones buried at the foot of the mountain. In the past, due to the British government's disregard for the people's livelihoods, it issued a forced evacuation order. Indian civilians, with Burma as their only escape route, climbed the treacherous Arakan Mountains, retreating through this area. Since February of last year, as many as tens of thousands of people have passed through. On average, fewer than 20,000 out of every 100,000 returned to India, with 80,000 dying of starvation, thirst, heatstroke, or being killed by wild animals. Therefore, the mountainside is filled with piles of white bones, a truly tragic scene!

Even under the clear sky of daylight, one could feel a chilling atmosphere. It is said that after dark, fires must be lit around the huts to scare away wild animals, as tigers tend to appear.

The Indian Ocean Clearly Visible

The mountain range stretches endlessly. Around noon, standing on a high peak, we could see a vast expanse of white, resembling the edge of the sky, which was the Indian Ocean. In the evening, we stayed in the tent of Captain Kawano of the Mustard Unit. Around 3 AM, the sounds of birds and monkeys were extremely loud, making the Arakan night very lively. Shortly after, a tiger roared, and the sounds of birds and monkeys immediately ceased. The tiger's roar was long and spine-chilling. On New Year's Day, the weather was even colder, and despite wearing multiple layers of clothing, the chill was still piercing. As the sun rose, all the brave soldiers bowed towards the east, welcoming the new year, feeling greatly excited.

Japanese Soldiers Guarding the India-Burma Border

### Japanese Aircraft Active Everywhere: Attacks on Chittagong and the Solomon Islands, British Aircraft Blindly Bomb Rangoon, Burmese People Indignant

Lisbon, 25th (Allied News) - According to news from Washington, the US Navy recently announced that after Japanese aircraft attacked US military positions in the Solomon Islands area the previous night, they returned to bomb them three times yesterday.

Lisbon, 21st (Allied News) - According to news from Melbourne, General Macworth’s headquarters recently acknowledged that Japanese aircraft attacked Milne Bay and Port Moresby on Saturday night, and the port facilities in both locations were severely damaged.

From a Certain Japanese Air Base, 25th (Allied News) - It was disclosed here today that Japanese army aircraft attacked Chittagong and Feni in India on Friday and Saturday, inflicting heavy damage on military facilities. On Friday night, during the attack on Chittagong, bombers used the bright moonlight to concentrate their bombs on port facilities, causing a fire in one area. On the same night, another unit of Japanese aircraft attacked the Feni airfield, causing fires in four locations. All aircraft from both units safely returned to their bases. During the second attack on Chittagong, Japanese bombers, protected by fighters, braved intense anti-aircraft fire to bomb oil tanks, docks, train stations, and other military targets, causing six fires. As Japanese fighters were returning from Chittagong, enemy fighters attempted to intercept them, but three were shot down. One Japanese aircraft is missing.

Rangoon, 25th (Allied News) - British aircraft, in formations of three, attacked Rangoon three times on the afternoon of the 24th, dropping bombs blindly. Japanese forces immediately responded with heavy anti-aircraft fire, and Japanese fighters also took off to intercept them, shooting down two enemy aircraft in a short time, which fell into the Bay of Bengal. The victims of this air raid were mostly hospitals, mosques, and ordinary residences, so the Burmese people expressed considerable indignation at the British bombing.

Rangoon, 25th (Allied News) - It was disclosed here today that when Allied aircraft attacked Burma on January 22nd, six British Hurricane fighters were shot down by Japanese land artillery units, and another two may also have been shot down. Several prisoners were captured, including Captain Moore, who stated that he was born in Oxford, England, in 1912 and recently traveled to India via Egypt. His group left Egypt and only stayed for a few days before going to India.

### Prime Minister Tojo's Health is Not Well: Diet Postponed by One Week

Tokyo, 25th (Allied News) - It was learned today that Prime Minister Tojo has contracted a minor illness but is recovering quickly. He should be able to attend the Diet session rescheduled for January 28th.

### Ambassador Stahmer Departed for Japan to Assume His New Post

Shanghai (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, departed from Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the 25th to assume his post in Japan. Ambassador Stahmer came to China in January of last year, along with the first Italian Ambassador, De Aloisi, after Germany, Italy, and other European Axis powers recognized the National Government on August 1st of the previous year. He assumed the position of the first German Ambassador to China. Ambassador Stahmer personally participated in the planning and conclusion of the Tripartite Pact and is well-versed in European and Asian diplomacy. During his one year as Ambassador to China, he gained a deep understanding of the New China. His transfer to Japan as Ambassador, at this decisive stage of the world war, places upon him the heavy responsibility of cooperating to complete the common war effort of the East Asian Axis. His future activities are certainly worthy of attention.

### General Hayashi Senjuro Gravely Ill

Tokyo, 25th (Allied News) - General Hayashi Senjuro, President of the Greater Japan East Asia League and former Prime Minister, suddenly contracted a cold and dysentery on the 18th. Two or three days ago, he developed symptoms of congestion, and his condition suddenly worsened. As he is already 68 years old, his relatives and friends are quite worried.

### Exchange of Notes Between Japan and Vietnam: Contents Announced, Future Settlements Between Japan and Vietnam to be Based on Special Yen

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government's official gazette officially published today the documents regarding the settlement methods between Japan and Vietnam. The contents are divided into seven items, first stating that future settlements between Japan and Vietnam will be based on the special yen. Previously, the settlement methods between Japan and Vietnam were divided into three categories: (1) trade settlements, (2) non-trade settlements, and (3) military expenses. Among these, the first and second categories were settled in gold or foreign currencies, i.e., in free yen, while the third category of military expenses used special yen. However, according to the exchanged documents, future settlements between Japan and Vietnam, whether for trade, non-trade, or military expenses, will all be based on the special yen. This method of settlement in special yen will apply not only between Japan and Vietnam but also between Japanese-occupied territories and Vietnam, as well as between areas currently using the yen settlement system and Vietnam. As for the exchange rate between the special yen and the Vietnamese currency, according to the documents, it will be based on the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the Vietnamese currency on January 1, 1943, i.e., 100 Vietnamese currency units are equivalent to 97.60 Japanese yen (with a buying and selling difference of 50 sen). This exchange rate will not be changed unless a revised agreement is reached between Japan and Vietnam. The effective period of the exchanged documents is indefinite from January 1st of this year, i.e., it will remain in effect until a termination agreement is reached between Japan and Vietnam. After the exchange of documents, if any of the contents conflict with the content of the Japan-Vietnam Economic Agreement concluded on May 3, 1941, the terms of the exchanged documents will supersede them. The special yen is distinct from the free yen, i.e., the special yen is a currency used for settlements within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and is in principle not convertible into ordinary currency. Vietnam will be able to use the special yen obtained through this settlement method for trade settlements with various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

### A Corrupt Township Head Embezzles Nearly 20,000 Yuan in Public Funds and Remains Unpunished

The phenomenon of political corruption in the interior is endless, and we do not need to do much to expose it. Even the position of a township head takes advantage of the convenience of the office, exploits the villagers, and embezzles public funds. Once reported, they can still live freely, unpunished by law. It is truly disheartening. Below is a bitter and indignant text from a farmer named Hui Li from Cili, Xiangxi, which can also reflect the phenomenon of political corruption.

"Our township is a small and poor township located in the remote Cili, Xiangxi. Last year, due to the impact of the drought, the autumn harvest was disappointing. Since winter and spring, most civilians, except for a few who can eat mixed grains, have been gathering wild quinoa and ferns from the mountains to fill their stomachs. The government launched the National Construction Savings, National Salvation Bonds, and One Yuan Donation for Aircraft fundraising campaigns, strictly ordering apportionments. The poor people all tighten their belts, even suffering hunger and cold, and all pay according to the assigned quotas, which are handed over by the bao chiefs to the township head. Who would have known that our township head was born with a "suede leather throat" (local saying, meaning immune to accountability). He received 5,450 yuan in National Construction Savings from the entire township, and he embezzled 3,390 yuan. He received 4,154 yuan in National Salvation Bonds, and he embezzled 2,123.60 yuan. He received 21,270 yuan in One Yuan Donation for Aircraft, and he embezzled 4,579 yuan. This is not all. He also took the opportunity to build and repair the township warehouse, using 64 dan of accumulated grains. He also received 1,653.12 yuan in government funding for warehouse construction and arbitrarily fined 1,173 yuan. After deducting expenses for wood, labor, miscellaneous items, etc., he embezzled 7,463.52 yuan. The government purchased military grains from the people and issued supplementary prices of 3,936 yuan, and he also embezzled 1,722 yuan. Just these few items alone amount to a total embezzlement of 19,278.12 yuan. This aroused the indignation of all the people in our township, and we immediately listed the embezzled amounts by category and requested the county government to investigate. The county government immediately sent two clerks to the township office, convened the bao chiefs of each bao, and the township head had already rushed to receive training. The account books were found in the township head's home, and the amount of various payments paid by each bao chief were checked and reconciled one by one. The carpenters and handlers who built the warehouse were also summoned to inquire about the actual warehouse construction expenses, which were not much different from the amounts reported by our people. The township head's family became anxious and offered heavy bribes to ask the two clerks to intercede, but the two clerks still had a conscience and refused to accept them. However, there are still a few points that our ordinary people cannot understand: (1) According to recent reports, a county magistrate in a certain county in Yunnan was officially tied to the execution ground for embezzling public funds and shot. In the past, when Xue Yue first arrived, he also shot a tax bureau chief for embezzling 500 yuan. Why is it that our township head, who embezzled public funds, which has been verified by the county government to be more than 19,000 yuan, can now safely receive training in Laiyang? (2) It cannot be said that the current political institutions lack anything in terms of organization. For example, to supervise township administration, guidance officers are sent to supervise at any time. For example, the township office has an economic section that is specifically responsible for economic matters. Why is it that our township head embezzled so much public funds and it was still necessary for the people to report it before it could be known? The account books of our township office for the collection of payments are not in the economic section but in the township head's home. I wonder if other townships are like this?"! (Sent by Hui Li from December 20, 1942)

### French Concession Re-investigates Household Registration; Each Household Must Re-Fill Joint Guarantee Forms; Number of People and Ages Must Be Accurately Recorded; Photo of Head of Household Should Be Affixed to Household Registration Certificate

The French Concession authorities, considering that the joint guarantee forms for household registration within the concession have become inaccurate due to personnel changes since this year, have decided to re-investigate household registration starting immediately. Each household must re-fill the joint guarantee forms, and must fill them out item by item according to the most accurate current situation. If there is any intentional concealment or false reporting, severe penalties will be imposed upon discovery. The joint guarantee offices in each district have received orders from their respective police stations to comply and implement this. Regarding the filling out of the joint guarantee forms, in addition to filling in the items stipulated on the form, the following items must be noted: (1) The number of people must not be inflated or underreported when filling out the household registration joint guarantee form; (2) The residence permit number should be indicated in the remarks column, and those who have not received it should indicate "applying"; (3) The age should be filled in according to the age on the residence permit, and there should be no false information; (4) Each form should be filled out in triplicate, one to be submitted to the police station, one to the responsible joint guarantee, and one to be framed by the head of the household and hung in a conspicuous place; (5) A photo of the head of the household should be affixed to the back of the Baojia (collective security system) household registration certificate for verification when receiving rice purchase permits. If the head of the household is unable to collect it in person and wants someone else to collect it on their behalf, a photo of the representative should also be affixed. After all photos are affixed, they should be sent to the responsible joint guarantee office for official stamping and certification.

### Cooperative Prepares to Sell Sugar; Different Methods in Southern City and Concessions; Civil Servants Request Issuance of Oil Purchase Certificates

Sugar

The Sugar Merchants Cooperative, in order to maintain the sugar rationing system in Shanghai, has already prepared for the fourth phase of sugar distribution. (1) In the southern city area, a trial implementation of per capita distribution based on the Baojia system will be conducted, stipulating a certain amount of sugar to be distributed per person, sold upon presentation of a purchase certificate. The distribution amount and price will be officially announced by the cooperative at that time. As for the re-registration of retailers, it is being rushed. Once the trial implementation in the southern city is effective, it will be implemented throughout the city. (2) Sugar sales in the Public Concession, French Concession, and Hongkou will be handled in the fourth phase according to the new method implemented on January 23, that is, sold upon presentation of property tax receipts. Retailers are scheduled to sell sugar on alternate single and double days. Retailers first collect tax receipts and give receipts to consumers, then submit the tax receipts to the cooperative for review. After the review is approved, the tax receipts are returned, and on the fourth day, sugar is sold upon presentation of the receipts, and the property tax receipts are returned.

Oil

Since the Shanghai Edible Oil Traders Wholesale Office purchased 20,000 dan (a unit of dry measure) of edible oil from the military authorities and distributed it to 1,830 retail edible oil stores in the city this month, divided into Group A and Group B, the second phase of edible oil stores in Group A and Group B has been fully distributed one after another. The date for the third phase of oil sales for Group A and Group B is still difficult to determine. However, the Edible Oil Wholesale Office has been convening board meetings to discuss methods and request the authorities to quickly distribute oil to meet the needs of the year-end. As for the office's past distribution of edible oil to civil servants of various agencies, it suddenly stopped distributing oil a few days ago, resulting in the inability of ordinary civil servants to purchase edible oil. It is now known that civil servant groups from various agencies are preparing to negotiate with the office, requesting the rapid issuance of special oil purchase certificates.

Ad Valorem Tax Implemented Starting Today

The date for starting the new tax system was originally scheduled for the 20th of this month. However, the Sino-Japanese tobacco manufacturers in this city requested a postponement because of the sudden change in tax by the department, which caused many practical difficulties. It is now known that the Taxation Department, after receiving the request, considered the reasons stated to be factual and has transferred the request to the Ministry of Finance for approval, postponing the implementation until today (the 26th).

### Japanese Marquis of the House of Peers Visits Special Prison No. 2

Mr. Shijo Takauta, Marquis of the Japanese House of Peers, and Mr. Kono Takeshide, who recently arrived in Shanghai from Japan, drove to the Second Special District Prison on Masnan Road in the French Concession yesterday morning for a visit. Huang Yaqiang, the warden of the prison, personally received them and accompanied them on a tour of the prison's interior. The two gentlemen inquired in detail about the motives for the crimes of all the prisoners, and did not leave until noon, it is said.

### Preserving Wealth (5)

— Nie Yuntai

The Amitayurdhyana Sutra also says that those who wish to be reborn in the Pure Land must cultivate the Three Blessings. All sutras explain that to attain Buddhahood, one must first deliver sentient beings. Because the Dharma takes great compassion as its foundation, without great compassion, everything is false. Although one eats vegetarian food and recites the Buddha's name, when one's life comes to an end, one's karma is too heavy, and the Bodhisattvas do not appear, but the demon soldiers come forward. At that time, one's mindfulness of the Buddha is completely lost, and the retribution for what one has done out of greed, anger, and delusion in ordinary times will mature, and one will still fall into the realms of hungry ghosts, animals, and hells. It will be too late to regret it. I see that in recent society, there are many people who consider themselves Buddhists, but most of them do not understand the principles of Buddhism. They have millions or tens of millions of assets, but they reluctantly do a few thousand yuan worth of good deeds, and then think that they have already done merit. That is why I am explaining this passage in detail, "hoping that they will awaken." Furthermore, Tolstoy of Russia said: "People in today's society take in millions of yuan with their left hand and give one or two yuan with their right hand, and then call themselves great philanthropists." It can be seen that this kind of behavior is a common problem in the world. Ordinary people cannot escape sin, so how can Buddhists escape sin?

I will briefly conclude the above text and list the points below:

(1) In the past few decades, all the rich people I have seen have had their descendants decline.

(2) In the past sixty years, all the families of great civil and military officials have declined, and their descendants have not prospered.

(3) Only a few great officials who were unwilling to get rich have descendants who can still study and make progress.

(4) Officials who are extremely high-ranking and have many opportunities to get rich, but are unwilling to get rich and are always thinking about helping the people, have the most prosperous and lasting descendants, and there are historical facts to prove it.

(5) In Shanghai, there are several examples of families with tens of millions, tens of millions, or hundreds of millions of dollars that suddenly went bankrupt. All of these families were unwilling to do charitable deeds to help others.

(6) Wealthy families only care about their own extravagance and enjoyment, accumulating money to leave to their descendants. When they see famine, they are unwilling to donate large sums of money to help disaster victims, which is no different from committing murder and will be subject to moral condemnation and the dominion of karmic retribution.

(7) The Buddha-dharma and heavenly principles are in everyone's heart. When everyone is grateful to someone, heaven is happy. When everyone is angry about something, heaven is angry. An ancient saying goes: "If a thousand people point their fingers at you, you will die without illness." The Book of Documents says, "Heaven sees as the people see, and heaven hears as the people hear." The Avatamsaka Sutra says: "If one causes sentient beings to rejoice, then one causes all Tathagatas to rejoice." Therefore, if you want to gain blessings, you must create more blessings for others, otherwise the Buddhas and heavens cannot help you.

(8) Wealthy people seek gods and worship Buddhas, burn incense and recite scriptures, but if they do not arouse great compassion and give up wealth to help others, their merits will be small and their sins will be great, and they will be difficult to escape evil retribution.

### Ambassador Shigemitsu, Having Completed His Official Business in Shanghai, Returned to Beijing Yesterday; Held Earnest Talks with Various Parties in Recent Days

### 25th Installment of Household Ration Rice; Purchase Order Quantity Remains Unchanged; Only Five Days for Sale

In order to regulate the people's food supply and control grain, the Public Works Department, after monopolizing the purchase of major food grains in the producing areas, has implemented a distribution system. Regarding the 25th installment of household ration rice sales date for Shanghai residents, it has been agreed that the period from February 1st to 7th will be set, of which the 5th and 6th will be the final period of closure, and sales will be stopped. The 8th is the last day of routine closure. Therefore, the actual sale dates for the next installment are only five days: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 7th. The 26th installment is from February 9th to 17th, and the 18th is the routine closure. The 27th installment is from February 19th to 27th, and the 28th is the routine closure. From March onwards, the old system of ten days per installment will be restored. As for the next installment of household ration rice, various contracted rice shops have begun to receive purchase orders. The allocation amount of white rice and flour listed on the rice purchase order is still the same as the previous installment. The prices are: (1) White rice per bag (one picul and two and a half dou) is 300 yuan plus 4 jiao (a unit of currency); (2) Flour per bag is 92 yuan. Therefore, the amount of grain distributed in that installment is still two sheng of white rice and one jin and twelve liang of flour, and the price should also remain unchanged.

### National Diplomacy and Participation in the War; Wu Kaisheng's Broadcast Speech

Mr. Wu Kaisheng, at the invitation of the Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association on the evening of October 24, broadcast a speech on Shanghai Radio on the question of national diplomacy and participation in the war, the gist of which is as follows:

The government's declaration of war is by no means an empty decoration, but a manifestation of the government and the people's morally consistent awakening. The government authorities are doing their best to make the political, military, economic, and cultural aspects adapt to the wartime system. In addition to this, it is necessary to awaken the people and promote an independent and innovative diplomacy. Otherwise, no matter how hard the government authorities work, the result will inevitably be half the effort for twice the result, or even become mere paper talk.

The so-called national diplomacy is to mobilize the national people - including the people's will and power - to be the backing and vanguard of national diplomacy. In other words, it is to stand in the position of the people, fulfill the responsibilities of the people, coordinate with the government, contribute everything, and strive for diplomacy. In short, it means "the people have the right to diplomacy." Of course, "national diplomacy" does not mean that the opinion of a part of the people purely represents the diplomatic policy of a country, nor does it mean that the diplomatic policy of the government is controlled or interfered with according to the private opinions of the general public. The most reasonable thing is that the government authorities determine a proper diplomatic line, and then encourage all the people to move forward along this new path.

The meaning of national diplomacy has been explained clearly, and then a brief review of the relationship between participation in the war and its various aspects is made.

Since our government entered a state of war, it should do its best to promote the sudden awakening of the people's diplomatic consciousness, mobilize the human and material resources of the whole country, contribute everything, sacrifice everything, fight shoulder to shoulder with the people of friendly countries, share weal and woe, and cooperate to advance, in order to achieve the early completion of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, the authorities of friendly countries should also understand the sincerity and spirit of sacrifice of the Chinese people in cooperation, eliminate past suspicions and prejudices, establish a sympathetic psychology, and treat each other frankly and accept each other's friendly diplomacy. Furthermore, they should treat each other equally with reciprocal treatment. This can be said to be a kind of "moral assistance" from the Chinese people to friendly countries after participating in the war. The purpose of the establishment of the National Diplomacy Promotion Association lies in the realization of this ideal.

The authorities' advocacy of national diplomacy is the first sign of respecting the status of the people and valuing public opinion. After participating in the war, it is of course impossible to ignore the point of harmonizing the feelings between China and Japan. Now, friendly countries have resolutely returned the concessions and abolished extraterritoriality, and Italy has also followed suit. Such a sincere expression is very touching to the government and people of our country. However, it is also hoped that the authorities will go a step further and minimize the time for the people to "share suffering" as much as possible, and quickly seek the expression of the fact of "sharing happiness." If the real life of the people can be stabilized, the psychology of the people will naturally improve. In this way, the feelings between the two peoples can be truly harmonious, and the cooperation between the two countries can also have real effect. This is the most important goal of promoting "national diplomacy," and it can also be said to be the most earnest expectation of the Chinese people after participating in the war.

The National Government resolutely participated in the war, indicating that the government has a 120,000-point determination to cooperate with Japan. With the spirit of "sharing life and death" and "sharing weal and woe," all Chinese people should support it. I believe that the Chinese people should change "sharing life and death" to "sharing death and life" and "sharing weal and woe" to "sharing woe and weal." First, have the determination to die, and seek life from death. First, have the spirit to endure hardship, in order to seek sweetness after hardship.

In order to seek the true liberation of the East Asian nations and the comprehensive and lasting peace of the world, China and Japan should be sincere, united as one, take national diplomacy as the prerequisite, implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, and unite the oppressed nations of East Asia to fight together. Finally, I hope that the people should encourage the members of this association to work hard to promote national diplomacy under the five major guidelines of independent innovation, promoting peace, eliminating evil forces, implementing the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and protecting overseas Chinese.

The old system will be restored on February 7.

### Authorities Urgently Seek to Stabilize Prices; Strengthen Control of Goods Sources; Expand the Scope of Food Rationing and Adjust Supply; Trade Associations Undertake Major Central Work

According to well-informed sources, the authorities of the two concessions, after controlling the prices of goods sold by manufacturers and wholesalers from yesterday, so that retail prices can also be stabilized, are now planning to further control the sources of goods in the city, especially the main foods. The purpose is to maintain the continuous supply of various major foods, and to expand the scope of the rationing system that has already been implemented for rice, bread, and flour to include various major foods. It is learned that the authorities are still considering this matter. Once implemented, trade associations will be the main key in the distribution structure.

Trade Associations Submit Lists

It is verified that the authorities in this city have been very strict in supervising major commodities, and have repeatedly issued regulations, urging all industries to comply. All trade associations of major commodities should compile a list of their members, stating the following items, and submit them to the competent authorities for verification: (1) Member number; (2) Name of buyer and seller; (3) Business location; (4) Type of major commodity being managed; (5) Date of approval of registration; (6) Registration number; (7) Must be filled out in detail, without any ambiguity or false reporting. Otherwise, the trade association will be subject to legal sanctions.

Wholesale Prices Reported for Record

As for members of each association who also engage in wholesale business, they should report the following items to their respective trade associations every ten days. After receiving the report, the association should record them by household at the end of the month and report them to the full management agency for record, including (1) Wholesale quantity, price, and name of the buyer's business; (2) Quantity sold and price, and name of the seller's business; (3) Accumulated quantity; (4) Storage location. The above points must be detailed and complete. Those who violate the above regulations will be fined up to 1,000 yuan. According to the new regulations promulgated by the authorities, wholesalers should copy the prices and cost calculations of goods sold on the 23rd of this month into a table and report them before February 10.

### Aili Garden Fire Yesterday Morning; Precious Antiques Suffered Heavy Damage; Main Residential Bungalow Reduced to Ashes

This newspaper reported yesterday that a major fire occurred on Jing'an Temple Road in the early morning. According to an investigation by reporters, the location of the fire was the residential bungalow in Aili Garden (Hardoon Garden) at 1273 Jing'an Temple Road. The fire suddenly broke out at about 3:15 in the morning. The flames rose and spread very quickly. Although the fire brigade rushed to the scene and tried its best to put out the fire, it still burned for as long as four hours before it was extinguished. The main residential bungalow was reduced to ashes. The old residences adjacent to it also suffered heavy damage. In total, about a hundred wooden houses and bungalows were destroyed. Fortunately, the fire brigade isolated the fire, and several sections of houses in the east, west, and south were spared from the fire.

Losses of Millions Heard to Be Fully Insured

It is reported that a large number of jewelry, furs, antiques, and valuable furniture were stored in the destroyed residence, so the loss was extremely large. The exact amount is unknown, but it is estimated to be about several million yuan. However, it is fully insured and there is no worry about compensation. As for the Hardoon family members and servants living in the residence, about 200 people, they escaped properly and no one died in the fire. It is said that the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit in the female servants' bedroom in the residence.

Two Hundred Masters and Servants All Escaped Properly

Several of the Hardoon family's adopted daughters first discovered the fire and quickly sounded the alarm to wake everyone up to escape. The Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade's lookout saw the fire at 3:16 and quickly dispatched three fire trucks to the scene. When they arrived, the central buildings had already become a sea of fire, and the flames were spewing out in all directions and were unapproachable. They quickly summoned the Xinzha Fire Brigade to also dispatch three fire trucks to rush to the scene to cooperate in putting out the fire. The deputy director of the Public Concession Fire Department, Huajinsi Mu (likely a transliteration), personally went to the scene to direct the fire fighting. Because the important residence that caught fire was at the southern end of the garden, the fire source was far away at the Jing'an Temple outside the north wall of the garden. Therefore, firefighters had no choice but to draw water from the pool next to the residence and fight the flames. It was not until 5:00 in the morning that they were able to control the fire and extinguish it. It is estimated that the fire burned for about four hours. It is reported that there are more than 500 people living in Aili Garden, and about 200 of them live in the main residence that was destroyed.

### Increased Tuition and Crowded Applications: Insufficient Aid Funds Will Likely Cause Impoverished Students to Drop Out of School, a Situation That People From All Walks of Life Cannot Stand Idly By. Middle School Group Exam Time Tomorrow.

The fourth annual *Shen Bao* Reader Scholarship for elementary school students screening test has concluded. The middle school group's screening test is scheduled for tomorrow (27th) morning from 9:30 to 11:30 AM for high school grades 1, 2, and 3. The junior high school grade 1 exam will be held from 1:30 to 3:00 PM, and the junior high school grades 2 and 3 exam will be held from 3:30 to 5:00 PM. The location is at the YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road. Examinees should bring pens and other necessary items and should not be late.

Elementary School Screening Results to be Announced at the End of the Month

The elementary school exam papers are currently being reviewed by male and female teachers from the YMCA. Staff members of the newspaper's scholarship committee are separately investigating the family circumstances of each student, hoping to complete the investigation and review work within this month. The date for the distribution of funds is scheduled to be announced at the end of the month.

Number of Students Seeking Aid Doubles Compared to Last Year

Approximately 2,000 middle school students are taking the exam. With the general increase in tuition fees at various schools and the impact of rising living expenses on impoverished students, their family circumstances have become even more difficult. Looking back at the previous scholarship, about eight out of ten applicants received assistance. The scholarship funds for this year have not increased compared to last year, while the number of students seeking assistance has more than doubled. Under these dual difficulties of increased applicants and increased tuition fees, the number of applicants who can receive assistance this year will likely be less than half. The educational opportunities for those students who do not receive assistance are on the verge of being cut off. This situation is something that people from all walks of life cannot stand idly by and it is what the *Shen Bao* Reader Scholarship Committee urgently hopes that people from all walks of life will promote the spirit of human mutual assistance and continue to donate.

Trend of Transferring Funds to Aid Education is Rising

The newspaper received two letters from donors yesterday: (1) transferring New Year's money to aid education, and (2) transferring gift money to aid education. Both are commendable, and it is hoped that all sectors of society will continue to respond and emulate them to help more students. The letters state: (1) "I used to teach at various middle schools and have personally experienced the pain of hidden poverty. My five children have also felt the suffering of dropping out of school. Now that I am in business, my family can live comfortably. Therefore, in the spirit of human mutual assistance and with the consent of my children, I will use the customary New Year's money to assist one impoverished elementary school student each. It is estimated that the tuition and miscellaneous fees for five students each semester will be about 600 yuan. I have specially signed a check for this amount. - Ni Xiaotong" (2) "We are all from the countryside and from the lower class. Due to our family circumstances in our youth, we received little education. To this day, we deeply feel the pain of being out of school. For several years, we have received the earnest guidance of our teacher Zhu Yiyun, which has enabled us to be self-reliant. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the death of our teacher's late father. We have sent 300 yuan as a small token of our respect. He has donated the funds to your newspaper and asked us to transfer our contribution to your organization to benefit society. His enthusiasm for public welfare is something we admire. Although the amount is small and cannot solve the problem, it is our small effort. We believe there are many enthusiastic people in all walks of life who will come together to make a difference, and the impoverished children will be grateful beyond measure. - Du Yulin, Qiu Zhenhua, Zhou Zaisheng, Yuan Hongyi"

A Public-Spirited Cloth Merchant Donates

Mr. Li Tian'er, a cloth merchant from Hebei residing in Shanghai, came to the newspaper and stated that he had been repeatedly reading Mr. Nie Yuntai's methods for preserving wealth and the difficult situation of crowded scholarship applications and financial difficulties as reported in the *Shen Bao*, and he was deeply moved. For the past three days, he has been unable to sleep peacefully. He generously entrusted 1,000 yuan to publish an advertisement, calling on all sectors of society to support the newspaper's scholarship program, quickly fill out the donation notification form, and requested that the notification form be enlarged and printed for easy filling. His enthusiasm is deeply appreciated. Instead of using 1,000 yuan to publish an advertisement, it is better to directly donate it to the scholarship fund. He has agreed. The donation notification form will be enlarged and printed as requested.

Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday

The scholarship funds received yesterday include: Ni Xiaotong 600 yuan, Mr. Zhu 300 yuan, Du Yulin, Zhou Zaisheng, Qiu Zhenhua, Yuan Hongyi (combined) 300 yuan, Mr. Huang, Wang Zhongheng 200 yuan each, Zheng Xiangquan, Zhou Weibin, Cheng Xiangsheng, Wang Wenbin, Xu Zhihe, Xu Shaohe, Liu Wenhai, Xu Ke, Hua Zubei, Zhang Xiangchi, 100 yuan each, Zhang Guanlun 60 yuan, Renwu Society Class B of Senior High School 56 yuan, Zhang Jinsheng 40 yuan, Chen Zhenxie 35 yuan, Wang Songji 30 yuan, Mr. Li, Dai Cangqi (as much as possible) 20 yuan each, Mr. Yu, Zhu, Cui Ping 10 yuan each, Lin Shiyi 5 yuan, totaling reserve certificates 2,896 yuan. Previous balance 141,455 yuan and 85 cents. Current balance: 144,351 yuan and 85 cents.

Jingan Temple Scholarship Method

A letter from Abbot Dewu and Supervisor Miga of Jingan Temple in this city states that the newspaper's advocacy of assisting students and benefiting the impoverished is deeply admired. The temple has now established a Buddhist scholarship fund, tentatively setting four scholarships specifically to assist university students in their final year to complete their studies and avoid failing at the last hurdle. The methods are attached below. All student selection and payment procedures will be handled by your newspaper. Attached methods: (1) Scholarship quota: two final-year university students majoring in arts and philosophy, and one final-year student each majoring in agricultural science and medicine. Students majoring in philosophy should focus on the study of Indian philosophy and Chinese philosophy (emphasizing Song and Ming Dynasty Neo-Confucianism), and must write a thesis on the respective subject upon graduation to be preserved by the temple. (2) Application requirements: in addition to the above qualifications, applicants must believe in Buddhism, have no bad habits, have good character, and have excellent academic performance, as certified by the school. (3) Application procedure: apply to the *Shen Bao*, undergo examination and selection. (4) The scholarship includes tuition and miscellaneous fees. At the beginning of the semester, the payment slip should be submitted to the *Shen Bao* to receive the fees. The newspaper's scholarship committee decided at yesterday's meeting that this scholarship should be open for applications separately starting from the 28th. Students who meet the methods set by the temple and whose families are impoverished can apply. The application deadline is the end of the month, and the selection will be determined after another examination.

Various Schools Donate Free Scholarships

The newspaper has received letters from various schools donating free scholarships, showing their enthusiasm. Here are some excerpts: (1) Southeast Women's Junior High School: "Your newspaper's organization of the scholarship fund to benefit impoverished students is truly commendable. Our school has been engaged in education for many years and dares not lag behind in promoting education. However, due to the relocation from Jiangwan to Shanghai after the incident, we are experiencing financial constraints. Donating funds to support education is beyond our ability. We have specially set up five free scholarships in the second year of junior high school. We hope your newspaper will recommend students with excellent grades, and we will waive all tuition and miscellaneous fees to do our part." (2) Mingxin Business Accounting Tutorial School: "Our school is showing sympathy for the readers' scholarship fund movement sponsored by your newspaper, and has set up a total of ten free scholarships to show our support. Anyone who is interested in learning accounting, and has been verified by your newspaper as truly impoverished but with high aspirations and unable to afford education, should be asked to bring a letter of certification to complete the admission procedures. The free places for each subject are listed as follows: (University Group) Cost Accounting one place, 75 yuan, Elementary Accounting one place, 75 yuan, (Middle School Group) Accounting two places, 60 yuan each, Advanced Bookkeeping four places, 50 yuan each, Elementary Bookkeeping two places, 35 yuan each." (3) Wuguang Girls' Middle School: "Jiang Tingxian, a student in the third year of senior high school at our school, unfortunately passed away due to acute appendicitis. Jiang was kind and loving to others and diligent in her studies. It is regrettable that her studies were cut short. Her friends and classmates are all grieving. Her classmates have launched the Tingxian Scholarship Fund as a memorial. First, Jiang's parents generously donated 500 yuan, and the students donated a total of over 3,000 yuan. We have long admired your newspaper's management of student loans for impoverished students, which has achieved remarkable results. The Tingxian Scholarship Fund Committee has decided to request your newspaper to recruit 15 new first-year junior high school students starting this spring, and the Tingxian Scholarship Fund will be used to pay for their expenses." (4) Huashi Elementary School: "Our school was originally located in the Nanshi area and was founded 36 years ago. After the war, it moved to its current address (No. 16, Huanghe Road, Annakin Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession). We have always emphasized strict discipline in our teaching. This semester, we have been trusted by the Shandesh Society and enthusiastic educators to set up 150 student loans, designated to cultivate outstanding children from impoverished families. We have heard that the number of applicants for your newspaper's scholarship fund for elementary school students is crowded, the quota is limited, and there are insufficient allocations. Our school is willing to specially reserve ten remaining places each for grades five and six. Students can come to our school for free (excluding books) with your exam passing certificate."

### 工部局上年度 重要行政槪述

### Important Administrative Overview of the Municipal Council Last Year Implementing the Baojia System Training Citizens in Air Defense Levying Three New Taxes Establishing a Comprehensive Committee

The Municipal Council released an overview of important administrative affairs for the year 1942:

Revaluation of Real Estate

In accordance with item 8 of the resolution passed by the foreign taxpayers' meeting on April 17, 1941, the Bureau revalued all real estate within the boundary for the purpose of collecting donations. The valuation matters were completed last year (1942). Regarding land tax, the Bureau, in view of the fact that the land within the boundary has not been revalued since 1933, decided in July of last year to re-estimate the land price in order to increase tax revenue. However, due to the current situation, the above two new valuations have been postponed for implementation. The Bureau issued a statement on December 24, formally stating this matter.

Joint Municipal Council Meeting

In August of last year, the municipal authorities of the city agreed to hold a joint municipal meeting once a month in order to enhance cooperation and jointly discuss all issues related to public welfare. Since August, there have been four meetings, and the results of the meetings have been satisfactory.

Special Police Force in West Shanghai

The establishment of the special police force in West Shanghai was based on the temporary agreement on police power in West Shanghai signed between the Bureau and the Municipal Government on February 16, 1940. This agreement was announced to be abolished on May 1 of last year. After that, the police power in the outer area of West Shanghai was taken over by the Municipal Government.

Implementing the Baojia System

After the bomb throwing case in the Lao Zha District on the eve of the Lunar New Year last year, the Bureau immediately approved the implementation of the Baojia system, promoting close cooperation between citizens and police officers to effectively eliminate undesirable elements and prevent illegal activities. Detailed rules and regulations on the organization and powers of the Baojia were formulated and published in the Bureau's gazette on October 2.

Citizen Air Defense Training

The Bureau, in close cooperation with the Air Defense Command, took appropriate measures to prevent air raids and promulgated detailed rules for light control and air defense measures. Air defense exercises were held from time to time to train citizens on how to practically apply air defense measures.

Abolishing the Curfew

The curfew was announced to be abolished from September 16 of last year. From the same date, citizens should carry their citizen certificates with them at all times for inspection by patrolling police officers, otherwise they will be detained for questioning. The curfew was first implemented in 1933 during the Sino-Japanese War, and a second time in 1937. At that time, it was stipulated that citizens were not allowed to go out between 10:00 PM and 5:00 AM. The curfew hours were changed to 11:30 PM to 5:00 AM on September 2 of the same year, and then to 12:30 AM to 5:00 AM on March 12, 1938, until the date of the abolition of the curfew.

Advancing Closing Time

At the beginning of last year, the Bureau stipulated that all public places should close at 10:00 PM every night in order to reduce electricity consumption. The closing time was allowed to be extended to 11:00 PM in February, and then extended by one hour to midnight in August, provided that the places could comply with the air defense regulations and not exceed the set electricity consumption.

General Car License Measures

In accordance with the financial agreement for West Shanghai signed between the Bureau and the Municipal Government on December 10, 1941, private car licenses issued in the city or concession could be used interchangeably in each area. The French Concession Public Works Bureau also expressed its agreement to this matter, and the measure for the general use of private car licenses in the three districts was implemented from January 1 of last year. After consultation between the municipal authorities of the three districts, it was agreed to extend the above joint license measure to private bicycles, and a trial period of six months was carried out from July 1 of last year.

No Unauthorized Rent Increase

In 1941, the Bureau felt the need to manage the issue of rent and the prohibition of collecting tips. This issue was jointly discussed by a committee organized by the two concession authorities. The Bureau subsequently published a notice on December 24, 1941, advising landlords to be considerate of tenants who were unable to afford huge rents. If there were disputes, they could be submitted to the Bureau's Rent Mediation Committee for mediation. Before March 31, landlords were not allowed to force tenants to move out or increase rent without authorization. The restriction on rent increases was subsequently changed to allow rent increases if both the landlord and tenant agreed, or if approved by the Bureau's Mediation Committee.

Subletting Housing Requires a License

In order to relieve the general three-room tenants, the Bureau drafted Article 55 of the Property Regulations last year and submitted it to the Consular Body for approval. According to the provisions of the attached rules, the subletting housing licensing measure was implemented on April 1, ordering the second landlords of all residential houses within the boundary to obtain a subletting license. The most important clause of the license was to restrict the profits of the second landlord and prohibit the collection of tips.

Establishing a Employment Agency Section

In order to relieve unemployed workers, the Bureau decided to establish an Employment Agency Section in September of last year. Its task was to introduce unemployed workers to suitable positions. The Bureau also approved the employment of additional staff to carry out the important preparatory work of the section.

Child Protection Affairs

After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the economic situation in this city changed, so the charitable organizations that cooperated with the Bureau to rescue children were mostly experiencing serious difficulties and refused to continue to take in refugee children. In view of this, the Bureau took temporary measures, using the Salvation Army Beggar Shelter to accommodate homeless children. It also hired ten additional staff members to find ways to return abandoned children to their families or find willing adopters.

Issuing Waterproof Bonds

In order to carry out the waterproof plan, 5 million yuan of 6% bonds were issued in June of last year. These bonds are scheduled to be redeemed by lottery every year from December 1948 until they are fully redeemed in December 1957.

Controlling Grain and Foodstuffs

A special committee oversees the maintenance of food supplies and other items. The committee's work report is detailed elsewhere and will not be repeated here. (To be continued)

### Various Factions Hastily Covering Positions, Government Bonds Rising Even More Sharply

Yesterday, the government bond market suddenly rose again, with the momentum becoming even stronger. The goods sold by various factions were hastily covered, and it was quite difficult to cover them. There were very few sellers, so the market trended upward, which was also the result of the environment. Yesterday, Class C started at 4 yuan, immediately rising by 1 yuan. Later, it even reached as high as 6.34 jiao, and finally, it still had 5.89 jiao. Class D rose from 50 yuan to 2.7 jiao, and finally, it also had 2.45 jiao.

### Military Scrip Turning Firm Again, Joint Currency in Demand Exceeding Supply

Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was suspended at 1 jiao 7 fen, and it has not changed.

Yesterday, the military scrip market turned firm again due to a small amount of settlement. The interbank trading price has risen to 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3.5 li. The trading price between small money shops and banks was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen and 6 fen, still flat. The Joint Reserve Bank notes were also rising in a state of demand exceeding supply. Operators bought in at 3 yuan, 9 jiao, 5 fen, and sold out at the 4 yuan mark, a huge squeeze of 1 jiao 5 fen, it is said.

### Jiangsu and Zhejiang Grains to be Subjected to Unified Control and Purchase

The authorities have already implemented unified control and purchase of major agricultural products such as rice, wheat, and cotton produced in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, there is no unified control agency for miscellaneous grains. It is now learned that the authorities, in view of the large production of miscellaneous grains in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, also consider it necessary to strengthen control. Therefore, they have recently ordered Chinese and Japanese miscellaneous grain merchants in Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places to separately organize miscellaneous grains. Once the purchasing organizations in various places are fully established, the highest organization for unified control and purchase of miscellaneous grains in Central China will be organized.

Yesterday, miscellaneous grain trading in this city was still limited to soybean cakes, which were slightly traded. The market was firm because the owners raised the price. It is estimated that two cars of Kaiyuanlong soybean cakes were priced at 57 yuan to 56 yuan, and three cars of Feizi soybean cakes were priced at 105 yuan to 107 yuan. Soybeans, etc., have not been officially traded, and the asking prices are very high.

### Cotton Cloth Market Falls Back

The cotton cloth market situation, due to reports that the authorities will strictly control prices and will not allow price increases without permission, people's minds suddenly became weak, and the market fell back. Fine cloth, etc., all fell by more than 10 yuan. Sijunzi Drill fell from 11.2 yuan to 10.6 yuan, with many fluctuations along the way, resulting in 10.9 yuan, a reduction of 3 jiao 5 fen. Peach Lady Silk of Colored Cloth is quoted at 480 yuan for spot goods, and White Cat Calico at 250 yuan.

### Waterproof Cloth Also Increases in Price

The waterproof cloth market saw a great turnaround yesterday, and the market prices all saw sharp increases. The Golden Bear brand is quoted at 28 yuan per yard, the Daming brand at 24 yuan, and the Ape Tarzan at 22 yuan. The market inventory is not much. Because the factory is affected by the high price of raw materials such as yarn, and the difficulty of moving back and forth, the output of each manufacturer is small, and the buyers' needs continue to be continuous, so prices have also increased.

### Woolen Fabrics Remain Firm and Expensive

Woolen fabrics have consistently been in a state of shortage and expensiveness in recent days. Although transactions have decreased, the owners still remain weird, because the retail prices of door shops are lower than the wholesale prices on the market. Therefore, most woolen fabric shops are unwilling to post retail prices, and many post "limited to one purchase" signs.

### Ample Supply of Japanese Cigarettes

The cigarette market price yesterday, British and American goods were slightly stronger, but they did not escape the swirling, because the end of the year is approaching, those with sufficient goods are temporarily waiting and watching, waiting for the establishment of the China Tobacco Association, how to allocate, so the price will not rise sharply. Japanese cigarettes are stable, because starting today, retail peers will be assigned A and B cards, the deadline is three days, so the allocation is quite sufficient, the price is flat as usual, the price of Daying brand is 12,000 yuan, Laodao brand is 10,200 yuan, Pinhai brand is 7,650 yuan, Wuhua brand is 6,650 yuan, and Fairy brand is 8,000 yuan, an increase of 100-200 yuan compared to the weekend. Japanese cigarettes Golden Spear brand 3,000 yuan, Golden Building 3,750 yuan, Red Rose 2,700 yuan, Quanlu brand 3,500 yuan, Guide brand 2,850 yuan, Guoyan Pyramid 6,400 yuan, Beauty brand 5,800 yuan, Golden Mouse brand 4,100 yuan, White Golden Dragon 4,150 yuan, very little change.

### Slight Changes in Daily Necessities

The daily necessities market has been rising continuously recently. Yesterday, the price increase has been suppressed, but after all, the inventory is scarce and it is not easy to buy, so those who hold the goods set prices according to the situation. Although the transaction was sparse yesterday, the price was still stable. It is estimated that the price of Meili brand matches is 4,000 yuan, Phoenix brand 3,850 yuan, Jinding brand 12,200 yuan, Miscellaneous brand 2,150 yuan, Guben soap 780 yuan, Baixiangmao 730 yuan, Huangxiangmao 660 yuan, Scissors soap 750 yuan, White Reese candles 560 yuan, Monk Hat brand 480 yuan, Miscellaneous brand 340 yuan, the change is very small. The market price of medicines is slightly more expensive. It is estimated that the price of headache powder is 37 yuan, Wan Jin You 48 yuan, Bagua Dan 43.5 yuan, Partridge Vegetables 68 yuan, and Longhu Rendan 35 yuan.

### Thin Inventory of Scrap Iron

The circulating goods of various thick and thin, large and small scrap iron in the market are not very abundant. Fortunately, the local demand is sluggish, and there is no imbalance between supply and demand for the time being. It is found that the inventory of these goods in Shanghai has been in short supply for a long time due to the lack of sources. Coupled with the long-term consumption, the spot goods are even thinner. Fellow traders who hold a small amount of inventory are thinking highly, and now there is a risk that the big square block and long block are nowhere to be found in the market. The only things circulating on the market are various thick and thin, uneven, large and small deputy scrap irons. Yesterday, the market was selling for about 10,000 yuan per ton. Those with high thoughts were also shouting for 11,000 yuan.

### Zhongzhuangyuan Meat Offers a Suitable Price

Zhongzhuangyuan meat, from outside the industry, had 50 pieces opened yesterday. The quality of the goods was average, and the color was relatively poor, about 150 yards worse than Gaozhuang. It was immediately distributed in full. Hainan cargo number has recently arrived about 600 packages. According to the owner's intention, he is unwilling to purchase and unload, so the asking price is more expensive than the Shanghai market.

### Abundant Arrival and Inventory of Jinshan Branches

Jinshan branches are recently on the market with a relatively thick bottom inventory, and the number and range are lacking. It is found that more than 5,000 boxes have arrived recently, and as the end of the year is approaching, the number and the owners do not want to sell immediately with the market, and the spring market may be slightly shaken.

### Tight Market for White Skin Yaoqian

White skin yaoqian has not arrived for a long time, and the market inventory is extremely scarce, so the asking price for old goods from Shangzhuang is also high. Yesterday, there was a batch of goods with a good appearance and color, and the trading party returned 400 yuan, but the transaction has not yet been completed.

### Poor and Humble Couples

— Jia Sheng

It is not easy for couples to get along well if they are too rich; it is also not easy for couples to get along well if they are too poor. If they are too rich, the "husband" often seeks pleasure outside; the "wife" is also often addicted to gambling, and as a result, they sleep in the same bed but have different dreams, and only have the name of husband and wife. These people do evil after being full and warm, and they are to blame and not worthy of pity.

What this article wants to talk about is poor and humble couples. The poet once said: "Poor and humble couples are sad about everything." Tasting this poem, the embarrassment of crying to each other in a straw coat is like it is happening now.

Despite advocating spiritual civilization, despite saying that the spirit is more important than material; but when the spirit is separated from the material, it becomes empty, disillusionment, and self-deceiving nouns! In the history of our country, there are two pairs of poor and humble couples that can be studied, one is Zhu Maichen, and the other is Liang Hong.

Zhu Maichen was a native of Kuaiji during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. When he was not famous, his family was very poor, and he made a living by selling firewood, reading as he went. His wife was ashamed of this and divorced him. Later, Maichen served as the prefect of Kuaiji and saw his ex-wife and her husband building roads. Maichen ordered the back car to carry the couple into the prefect's house. The wife was ashamed and angry and hanged herself.

Liang Hong was a native of Pingling in the Eastern Han Dynasty. He was orphaned and poor when he was young, but he had integrity. When he grew up, he read widely and made a living by herding pigs. He married Meng Guang and lived in seclusion in Baling Mountain. Later, Liang Hong was hired to work in the spring, and every time he returned, his wife prepared food for him, and they raised the tray to their eyebrows in respect.

The story of Zhu Maichen is the popular story of "spilled water is difficult to recover." The story of Liang Hong is the beautiful story of raising the tray to the eyebrows in respect. In history, there are no statistics on the separation and reunion of couples; however, these two pairs of poor and humble couples can be said to be an excellent contrast.

I think there are many stories similar to Zhu Maichen's in today's society. Although they do not necessarily divorce and leave, quarrels due to the husband not becoming an official or getting rich are commonplace. As for the story of Liang Hong and his wife living in peace and contentment, its rarity is probably like the friendship between Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya!

Since the implementation of new education in our country, everything blindly follows American hedonism and individualism. Women's education is controlled by the church, resulting in a group of vase-like "modern" women. They only know how to sing and dance; they only know about honeymoon trips, nutritional chemistry, and sanitary equipment. Some female students, for the sake of enjoyment, even degenerate into concubines of wealthy families. Women's education has declined to this point, what else can be said!

Therefore, many educated women often marry late or remain single; unless they can marry a husband who is one level higher than her and has property. If the husband's family declines after marriage, they will force the husband to become an official and get rich. In their eyes, Meng Guang is an unbelievably silly fool.

### Eating Porridge

— Chun Qiu

The grain currently distributed according to the number of people is only enough for about five days of eating for every ten days. Helplessly, we eat porridge all day. The method is: use a small amount of rice, add a large amount of water, and cook it into a porridge that is so thin that it cannot be any thinner.

The consequence of the three children eating porridge every day is that they urinate a lot. This is because the excessive water in the porridge passes through the intestines and reaches the kidneys, and then turns into urine. It is winter, and there is already a lot of urine; in addition to eating porridge, the amount of urine is unexpectedly large. During the day, they often pee in their pants; at night, they often pee in the bed. To say it humorously: the dry faction children have become the wet faction. This is the law of conservation of matter at work, and it is not that the children lack the ability to absorb water. I can't bear to give them a good beating, I just hope that the amount of rice per household can be increased, and change from eating porridge to eating rice.

The children are used to eating porridge, and when serving porridge, they know the trick. They try their best to scoop the bottom of the pot with a spoon. In this way, relatively dry and thick porridge is served. Philosophers say that wisdom is only expressed when encountering difficulties, which has its basis.

Sometimes, the part of the porridge pot near the bottom is scorched and condenses into porridge blocks, which are thick and fragrant. If one of the children accidentally scoops it up, the other two children will quarrel. Confucius said: "I am not afraid of scarcity, but of inequality." They are all eating thin porridge, but if there is some inequality, they will still quarrel.

The parents, of course, eat the thinnest and least porridge. Protecting oneself and propagating offspring are the two major tasks of mankind. In order to maintain their own lifeline, all kinds of life and death struggles have arisen in the world, and they are unwilling to back down. In the world, only parents are willing to sacrifice "protecting oneself" for their children and maintain "propagating offspring."

Some people say that the monks have strict precepts, and hundreds of monks eat porridge at the same time without any sound. Some people also say that Cantonese chicken porridge and duck porridge have a special flavor. Some people also say that eating some porridge after eating oily food can reduce gastrointestinal diseases. Some people also say that a large company sees that there are more and more families eating porridge and prepares to newly produce several kinds of pickles to suit the occasion. We parents don't have the leisure to talk about these things when we eat porridge: the children don't have the interest to listen when they eat porridge.

### Number Addiction

— Jia Sheng

In schools, scores are used to represent the academic performance of each student, and scores are used to encourage each student's efforts. When reviewing or taking exams, students generally hope to get more scores in each subject, preferably all 100 points. The amount of scores is indicated by numbers, so every student becomes addicted to numbers: moreover, the more hardworking and diligent the student, the deeper the number addiction.

The modern world is a scientific world, and almost everything is expressed in numbers. Large numbers are used to express the distance of each planet, the so-called astronomical numbers. Small numbers are used to express the radius of electrons. Other things such as the speed of airplanes, the production of goods, the amount of business, etc., are all expressed in numbers, and many often take breaking records as an honor. The world is a world of numbers, and life is also a life of numbers. In this way, everyone has to be addicted to numbers!

Do you hate numbers? If you really hate numbers, you will not be able to live.

Bankers, capitalists, especially speculators, can be said to be addicted to numbers. They are thinking and studying all day long: how can they earn hundreds of thousands of millions more, how can they get a profit of 100% or 200%. Their view of life is to increase, increase, and increase the number of assets to an infinite extent. In the last four or five years, a number of six or seven digits could satisfy them. Now it is not possible, it must be eight or nine digits!

Currently, a small clerk's salary must be at least three digits. A rickshaw puller's daily income must be at least two digits, otherwise they will have to starve to death. Therefore, small clerks and even rickshaw pullers are also addicted to numbers.

There are many chairmen and managers who "are cautious in gaining" and pay too much attention to the increase in their own numbers. They often neglect the numbers of the employees and partners. The employees and partners, if they "live," of course they can't "live" on; if they "die," they don't dare to "die"; therefore, "death" also requires a large number, at least four digits!

### Visit to Hongren Hospital

— Shuo

Hongren Hospital, with a history of more than 70 years, serving the society and benefiting the people, is located at the corner of Aiwenyi Road and Chengdu Road. In order to understand the recent situation of the facilities, I made a special visit.

When the reporter arrived at the hospital, Dr. Jingyi Shuai graciously received and showed me around. His kind attitude and sincere feelings were admirable. The hospital was originally named Guangren, and was renamed to its current name after the war. It is under the same system as Tongren Hospital on Jiujiang Road. Hongren specializes in admitting women, and Tongren specializes in admitting men. The two hospitals have a total of more than 500 beds. The medical subjects are all available, and the scale is quite complete.

The source of funding, the income from consultation fees and medical expenses, accounts for most of it. In addition, there is a subsidy from the American Church, so the shortfall in previous years could be made up by this. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the subsidy has been cut off, and prices have risen sharply. The prices of medicines, cotton, gauze, etc. have increased from several times to dozens of times. Therefore, it has fallen into a situation where it is struggling to maintain itself. The hospital has always paid attention to public welfare facilities, and the fees are low, so the losses are even greater. Ordinary patients are only charged 4 yuan per day, including food and accommodation. Currently, the monthly expenses are 240,000 yuan for Hongren and 120,000 yuan for Tongren. Such huge expenses are really difficult. It is estimated that by next year, there will be a shortfall of about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Fundraising is currently underway, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will give enthusiastic assistance.

The treatment of employees in the hospital is also very meager. The living allowance is generally only about 100 yuan. Each year, 50 nurses are recruited in the spring and autumn seasons. The level must be above junior high school, and they are given three years of training. Tuition and accommodation fees are waived. The cost of bedding and clothing was also originally provided, but recently, due to economic difficulties, they must be provided by themselves. After graduation, they work in the hospital or are introduced to other places. The results are very good. It is a good opportunity for those who aspire to study nursing.

The hospital has a close relationship with the medical department of St. John's University. Most of the doctors in the hospital are professors at St. John's. Graduates of St. John's medical department must also intern at the hospital. The obstetrics department is particularly perfect. About 4,000 to 5,000 children are born in the hospital each year. The equipment is excellent and the care is comprehensive, which is praised by all parties in the society.

Finally, there are two things that seem particularly worth mentioning. One is that there are some doctors in the society who are close to fraud, who falsely post advertisements, such as saying that the fees are low, and everything is included. People are greedy for cheap and are deceived when they go, and they are transferred to the hospital for treatment. This is not uncommon. It damages money and puts lives in danger, and should be strictly inspected and cracked down on. Second, teachers are the most pitiful among patients. Their income is meager and their lives are poor. If the fees are too low, they are not used to the life. If the fees are slightly higher, they cannot afford them. It is proposed that enthusiastic people in the society specially plan a sum of money to give preferential treatment to poor teachers. If it can be realized, it is indeed very meaningful and valuable.

Before leaving, I visited the entire hospital for a week. When I returned, it was near dusk, and these various impressions were still lingering in my mind.

### The Model Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yijin

(9)

This is a service, and this service gave him the freedom to take care of himself to the highest and fullest extent. Due to his age and virtue, he had earned the privilege of being alone; those who were slightly eccentric would often attack teachers and pastors, and he had also acquired their right. The robe on his body was always worn to the point where it was almost broken to the point where it could not be pieced together: he had a mysterious and informal air when he stood on the wooden bench next to the stone steps of the hall to call the roll. He managed the school list, a long piece of paper curled up on a board; every student, as he passed by, said his name, and Gipps made a small note on the list after checking. The glance he made when checking was something that everyone in the school liked to imitate for fun - the steel-rimmed glasses slid down the bridge of his nose, and the eyebrows, one high and one low, bounced up, making a half-amused and half-mocking gaze. On windy days, his robe, white hair, and school list fluttered in great confusion, and the whole thing became a ridiculous game, between the afternoon game and the resumption of class.

Some of the names, like some small choral pieces, would reappear in his heart without having to work hard to remember them. ... Ainsworth, Atteut, Afongmour, Barberke, Barges, Barnard, Barsonswait, Bartespay, Bergels, Bedford, Bendley, Buster...

Another section

... Enszat, Falgi, Wardhay, Wagerstaf, Warrington, Watters the First, Watters the Second, Watling, Wawenna, Webb...

There was another section that he had said to the Latin students in the fourth grade, which was the best example of a hexameter.

... Lancaster, Latton, Leemall, Leton, McGonigle, Mansfield...

He often wondered where these people had gone; how far had the thousands of threads that he had once held together been scattered, some broken, others woven into unknowable patterns? The chaos and impermanence of the world shook him, and that chaos would never again give those choral pieces any meaning as long as the world existed.

Behind Brockfield, when the fog cleared, you could see the overlapping mountain ranges in the same way, behind Brockfield, he saw the world of change and conflict; he saw this world, which he had not yet realized, was seen together with Katie's memorial eyes. She was not able to give him all of her mind, let alone the strengths of her mind; but she left him with quietness and openness, which was very much in tune with his inner emotions. His characteristic was that he did not, like the extreme patriots, desperately oppose the Boers not because he was a supporter of the Boers - he would never be so in tradition, he abhorred those who claimed to be supporters of the Boers; but, even so, in his heart he often had the thought that the Boers were engaged in a struggle that had a strange similarity to the struggles made by some heroes in British history - such as Herward the Wake or Caractacus. He had once thought of making this point to shock his fifth form, but they only thought it was one of his little jokes. (21)
