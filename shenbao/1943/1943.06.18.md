### New Significance of the "Aid-Education Movement"

What is the most important condition for the revitalization of China? We took this question to ask contemporary experts, scholars, and even practical politicians. Although the answers may not be consistent, we can assert that there is definitely no one who does not mention this one condition: "Talent!" "Talent!" "There must be sufficient talent!"

The revival of China or the construction of a new China that we hope for certainly requires political reform, that is, a perfect political organization and political program. However, what is more important is the people who promote political institutions and implement political programs. Therefore, the sages once said: "Having laws is not enough without people to govern." The reason why China's national power has declined in modern times is certainly due to the incomplete political reforms, but the most fundamental reason is the lack of true talent. If we look at the history of the past two or three decades, it cannot be said that there are absolutely no relatively complete political institutions or political systems, and it cannot be said that there is an absolute lack of relatively complete political programs and policies. However, those who can be strictly called "true talents," especially those who occupy the upper leadership positions, are really too few! As a result, all good political institutions, systems, programs, and policies cannot be promoted and implemented, and the country falls into decline day by day. Recalling the past, there is already a feeling of being overwhelmed by the scarcity of talent, and looking around at the present, it is felt that the work of cultivating talent has not been fully exerted, and looking forward to the future of the country, one cannot but make those with aspirations sleepless!

We believe that whether it is during the war or in preparation for post-war construction, there are many undertakings that the government must undertake, but they cannot be launched immediately because there is no suitable talent. There are also many undertakings that have been launched, but because of the lack of sufficient and suitable talent, they are stalled or fail to achieve the expected results. This phenomenon is equally evident not only in the government, but also in the financial, economic, business, and cultural sectors. Therefore, the reason why various undertakings are finally shelved and cannot be realized is often the lack of talent and the difficulty of obtaining talent.

The serious phenomenon of talent shortage today can be said to be the result of backward education, especially the lack of universal education, in the past ten or twenty years. We want to ask, what will be the construction of China in ten or twenty years? What will the fate of the country be? Then we must look at the current situation of talent cultivation? To what extent has today's education been universalized? Those who look at the present will also be like those who look at the past. So, looking forward to the future, can we not worry about the fate of the country? Therefore, how to popularize education and accelerate the cultivation of talent is the most urgent task today. Otherwise, without talent, no perfect political institutions, programs, policies, or even business plans can be realized. The responsibility for popularizing education certainly lies with the relevant government authorities, but from the current actual situation in our country, due to the expansion of the national wartime finance, we cannot completely expect the government to take full responsibility for education and talent cultivation. We must awaken far-sighted people and powerful people in the private sector, and everyone must be inspired to cooperate with the government, improve and enrich educational institutions, and expand the talent cultivation movement. Therefore, the significance of the "scholarship" movement we have held over the years dares to be attached to this.

The important significance of our newspaper's scholarship has actually been deeply recognized by people from all walks of life. We see enthusiastic people in society donating their salaries to help education, selling property to help education, and jointly helping education collectively with relatives and friends. There are also many students in school who are enthusiastically participating in the aid-education movement. This spirit of warm mutual assistance is deeply engraved in our minds and also in the glorious history of the construction of the future new China.

From the year-by-year increase in the number of people participating in the righteous act of helping education and the amount of donations, we can prove the increased awareness of people in society regarding the righteous act of helping education. The increase in the number of students receiving assistance can also make us excited, because our efforts have not been in vain, and we can also encourage other cultural groups to work hard in the aid-education movement. We firmly believe that as long as everyone works hard to promote it, it will definitely have an inestimable benefit to the future of the country and society.

Now this semester has come to an end, and the aid-education affairs for the next semester are about to begin. From the actual situation, due to the high prices, schools may inevitably increase fees. In the next semester, I don’t know how much the number of people who cannot afford to continue their studies will increase! I don’t know how many people who are preparing to enroll will be deterred! We cannot bear to see a large number of young people wandering outside the school gate or even on the streets because of insufficient funding for schooling. For the sake of the future of the country and society, and for the nation to stand in the future world, every one of us in society has the responsibility to do our best to help children, teenagers, and young people to be able to go to school. Taking Shanghai as an example, if each relatively wealthy person can specially save more than ten yuan, then millions of yuan can be collected in a short period of time, which can make thousands of young people worry-free from dropping out of school! Therefore, we are more actively organizing the scholarship movement, and we are more eagerly hoping that all sectors of society will rise up together and donate enthusiastically.

### Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Clarifies the Essence of Japan's Diplomatic Policy: Establishing Good Neighborly Relations with China Based on Equality and Mutual Benefit; Seeking the Liberation of All Ethnic Groups to Build a Greater East Asia

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Shigemitsu of Japan, in response to the question raised by Representative Masataka Ota in the general budget meeting of the House of Representatives on the 17th, "What is the international impact of the Empire's Greater East Asia policy and how can it be utilized?" clarified the essence of Japan's diplomatic policy for the first time since taking office as follows: Prime Minister Tojo, in his speech yesterday, already clarified the Empire's unwavering grand policy, which is to permanently liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of the United Kingdom and the United States and restore its original form. Today, the one billion people of East Asia are convinced that without the victory of the Greater East Asia War, there will be no liberation of Greater East Asia; without the construction of Greater East Asia, there will be no welfare for the people of Greater East Asia. It is time for us to give spiritual support and cooperation to the demands of the people of Greater East Asia. Therefore, regarding the matter of restoring Greater East Asia to its original form, we have repeatedly stated its specific plan, which is to grant complete independence to each country or allow it to participate extensively in politics to achieve its hopes, and to establish cooperative good neighborly relations on the basis of mutual equality and benefit. Based on this view, we will build East Asia and defend against those who disturb the stability and peace of East Asia. The so-called realization of the long-awaited national states in the Greater East Asia region, cooperating with each other on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, has been gradually realized in the new policy towards China, which is to re-explore the new relationship between China and Japan and establish good neighborly relations between the two countries. The Empire's policy is to thoroughly implement this policy, spread its spirit throughout Greater East Asia, and seek the unity of one billion people, which is also the true construction of Greater East Asia. This policy is the spirit of the Empire since its founding and the spirit of ancient times, but although it is so ancient, it is also an extremely new problem.

Summarizing International Relations and Exposing the Ambitions of the United Kingdom and the United States

What is new about relations, I would like to state here in terms of national festival relations. You should know that the Eastern policy of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, and other countries is a policy of division and rule. Speaking of the United Kingdom, its policy towards India is to alienate them and rule them, and its policy towards the European continent is a policy of balance of power. In East Asia, it is to alienate China and Japan and make them fight each other, because it does not want a strong country to exist in East Asia. Their policy often aims to disrupt and satisfy their political ambitions, so it is fundamentally a destructive policy. Eliminating this destructive policy and its elements and building the grand vision of Greater East Asia is the Empire's grand policy. Also, what is the economic policy they adopt, especially their colonial policy? Their policy is to occupy the colony and then seal it off and seize its benefits, which is fundamentally different from the Empire's advocated policy of liberating resources, mutual benefit, and equality. What is their policy towards China, what is their policy towards India, and what is their policy towards Asia? This is an extremely clear fact in economic terms. Without eliminating these political and economic clutches, the path of construction cannot be opened up. In the past, the Empire made the greatest efforts to realize the grand spirit since its founding, but it often encountered various difficulties. What are the reasons why it was not easy to fully promote this spirit in the past? There are various reasons, which are not easy to explain simply.

Using Force to Remove the Clutches and Open Up the Path of Construction

However, from the perspective of the overall situation, the intrusion of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other forces into East Asia is inherently destructive, exerting its disruptive effect. The clutches of the United Kingdom and the United States have been gradually removed through the Empire's extraordinary efforts and struggles, that is, they have been removed by the direct force of our army, navy, and air force. Here, the path of construction is opened up. The construction of Greater East Asia is the expression of the loyal spirit since the founding of the country, and the protection of this spirit is the Empire's military force. If these clutches continue to exist in the future, we must always engage in defending Greater East Asia. This defense is carried out by the automatic cooperation of all countries and ethnic groups in the Greater East Asia region. In fact, as mentioned earlier, the liberation of Asia is our national policy. If we do not liberate Greater East Asia and free it from the exploitation of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries, Asia cannot be stable, and it is not enough to talk about building Greater East Asia. Now Asia is no longer a colony of the United Kingdom and the United States, and the policies of the United Kingdom and the United States often encounter reefs, all because exploitation and monopoly eventually lead to economic warfare. Although they claim that war is not an instrument of policy, they openly declare economic warfare to force other countries to submit, such as the freezing of funds, which is one example. If the freezing continues to the end, war cannot but occur. It is not necessary to repeat the causes of the Greater East Asia War. The United Kingdom and the United States are not friends of the countries and ethnic groups in East Asia, but our enemies. Looking at the recent situation in the West, we can see that the Axis powers of Germany and Italy are protecting the various small countries in reality. The United Kingdom and the United States flaunt great powerism and do not want the interests of small countries to be like this. Summarizing the international relations, our country's grand policy towards Greater East Asia is to liberate Asia and build Greater East Asia. This is a construction policy that is different from the disruptive and destructive policies of the United Kingdom and the United States. This is of great significance to all ethnic groups and countries, especially the ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. A policy that conforms to this justice will surely be understood by the world, and the enemy may also understand this policy and submit to this meaning. We must promote this policy to complete the war. I believe that the future of the Empire's participation in this war, existing as a major power, also lies in its ability to promote a policy based on justice. I believe that it can bring dawn to Asia and complete the construction of Greater East Asia, which is the great foundation for the permanent happiness and peace of the world.

President Wang, who is also the President of the Executive Yuan, Issues a Statement Thanking Allied Nations for Their Profound Friendship

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - After Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech in the Japanese Diet on the 16th, officials and civilians in our country were excited and more convinced of the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the coexistence and co-prosperity of the East Asian peoples, and especially welcomed and paid attention to Prime Minister Tojo's kindness in "fundamentally revising the existing treaties between China and Japan." Wang, who is also the President of the Executive Yuan, specially issued a statement on this matter, which was released in full by Minister of Propaganda Lin to domestic and foreign reporters in the capital at 3:00 p.m. on the 17th as follows: "At the time of the opening of the Diet of the Allied Empire of Japan, the policy speech delivered by Prime Minister Tojo is a concrete revelation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Doctrine, and the purpose of the Greater East Asia War is even clearer here. I am convinced that all the countries and ethnic groups in East Asia will be more determined in their faith in their own future and in the overall situation of East Asia upon hearing this speech, and the unity of the East Asian peoples will be as solid as a rock. This Greater East Asia War, as its name suggests, is actually for the East Asian peoples to seek liberation for themselves, and there is no intention of invading other continents. However, for a hundred years, the United Kingdom and the United States have harbored ambitions to invade the world, especially East Asia as their colony, and therefore promoted this war. All the countries and ethnic groups in East Asia should stand on the same front as fellow East Asians and never allow the existence of even one East Asian traitor. Since the Allied Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, it has fundamentally swept away the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Southeast Pacific region and has established the foundation for certain victory. The recent death in battle of Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and the collective martyrdom of the defending troops on Attu Island further demonstrate to the East Asian peoples a model of achieving their ambitions at the cost of their lives. Not only are all the soldiers and civilians of the Allied Japan in tension, but all the East Asian peoples feel the same way. Now Prime Minister Tojo has decided in the Diet of the Empire to support the countries and ethnic groups in East Asia so that they can permanently escape the shackles of the United Kingdom and the United States and fulfill their long-cherished wish to love their country, love their neighbors, and love East Asia together. The countries and ethnic groups in East Asia are grateful and excited upon hearing this virtuous sound, and they are encouraged to jointly advance with a spirit of inevitability. Moreover, the depth of friendship, the earnestness of expectation, and the increasing strength of assistance to China allow the Chinese government and all the people to feel inspired. Since the Allied Japan first returned the concessions and abolished extraterritoriality on January 9 this year in order to assist China in completing its independence, it has made the Chinese people feel the brightness of the future and increased their infinite courage. Now, taking a further step, it will fundamentally revise the treaties signed between China and Japan, which will greatly enhance the friendly relations between China and Japan. The main principle of the treaties signed between the National Government and the Allied Japan since the return of the capital is to enable China and Japan to cooperate and jointly devote themselves to the construction of a new East Asian order based on morality. This principle is permanently indelible. However, in the meantime, considering the environment at the time, the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States took the opportunity to invade and肆害.There had to be expedient measures, now that the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States have been swept away and the environment has changed, thereby making a decisive revision so that China can exert its overall strength in military and economic terms, complete its unification, and contribute its national strength to the Greater East Asia War. In addition to thanking the Allied Japan for its profound friendship, we can only work harder to move forward in order to realize the joint efforts of China and Japan and complete the purpose of the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible."

The Three Axis Powers Are Closely Linked, and the Belief in Ultimate Victory Is Even Stronger

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - All circles in Germany attach great importance to the policy speech delivered by Prime Minister Tojo of Japan at the Diet. Dr. Schmidt stated the main points of Prime Minister Tojo's speech at the regular meeting of reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 16th, and expressed special importance to Prime Minister Tojo's statement that he was convinced that the powerful war being waged by the Allied countries in Europe would be successful and that Japan would fight to the end with the close support of its allies to reduce the determination of the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition to publishing Prime Minister Tojo's speech in major newspapers on the evening of the 16th, German newspapers have also commented on it. For example, the Berliner Abendblatt stated, "There is no doubt that the Tripartite Pact will be victorious." The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung stated that the Secretary-General of the Italian Fascist Party had previously clarified that the Italian people were determined to fight until they achieved ultimate victory, and today Prime Minister Tojo reiterated his determination to fight with the close support of the Allied countries in Europe until they secured a joint victory. The determination expressed by the German people at the current stage of the world war has been clarified by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Armaments Minister Speer, which is a consistent and increasingly clear answer to the spiritual war waged by the United Kingdom and the United States. When the national groups of the Axis powers encounter external pressure, it is enough to enhance their unity with each other. The United Kingdom and the United States will suffer major blows whenever they attempt to launch an offensive in Europe or East Asia. The United Kingdom and the United States should be aware of the answer given by the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy, and should be aware of it. Also, the German National News commented that Prime Minister Tojo's powerful statement is also sufficient to prove once again that the dreams of the anti-Axis powers have been answered in fact. In the future, the construction of the new East Asian order will gradually become concrete, and the statement made by Prime Minister Tojo that he will make the Philippines independent will become a guideline for rebuilding the political path in East Asia. Regarding the future happiness of China, Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, and other countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it has been guaranteed in the policy of the Japanese government. The Japanese government's plan to strengthen its close relations with the aforementioned countries has the same important meaning as the heroic operations of the Japanese army. We, from the standpoint of an ally, are very pleased with Prime Minister Tojo's statement that he is convinced that the operations of the European allies will be successful and that Japan will fight to the end with the close support of the European allies until they achieve ultimate victory.

The Philippines, India, and Burma Are Greatly Excited and Cooperate with Japan to Complete the War

Manila, 17th (Central News Agency) - Philippine Executive Director Vargas issued the following statement on the 17th: Today is one of the happiest days in the history of the Philippine people, and the deep gratitude of the Philippine people cannot be described in words. We are grateful to learn that Prime Minister Tojo of Japan has made it clear that he will grant the Philippines the honor of independence this year. Japan's granting of independence to the Philippines with such a straightforward, rapid, and clear statement is a manifestation of Japan's sincere, noble, and affectionate expression to the Philippine people. The Philippines is now aware that it will share weal and woe with Japan in war and peace. For the sake of the victory of the Asian peoples, the Philippines is willing to contribute all its material and spiritual resources to Japan at the request of Japan, and feels that this is the supreme glory of the Philippine people. At this most important time for the Philippines, if there is anyone who hinders our independence, he is tantamount to betraying the lofty ideals of the Philippine people. Also, if there is anyone who hopes to be dominated by the United Kingdom and the United States again, he is a traitor to the future new independent country of the Philippines. For the independence granted to us by Japan under its lofty ideals, we pray to God that this independence will become a valuable independence.

Manila, 17th (Central News Agency) - The New Philippine Service Corps, in view of Prime Minister Tojo's clarification in the Diet of the timing of allowing the Philippines to become independent, has made the firm determination of all Philippine officials and civilians to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War even more vigorous. It has been decided to hold a general meeting of the New Philippine Service Corps on the 18th and 19th at the Capital Theater in Manila. The head of the Philippine Executive Government, Vargas, the deputy director of the New Philippine Service Corps, Aquino, and governors and representatives from various states will attend. The total of 16 million people in the Philippine Islands will be united to clarify the policies adopted by the Philippines in response to Prime Minister Tojo's statement in the future.

Rangoon, 17th (Central News Agency) - The 15th was the first anniversary of the establishment of the Indian Independence League here. After a year of efforts, its foundation and organization have been completely established. The 2 million Indians in Burma will take this second year as the year of implementation and will devote all their efforts to achieving the goal of anti-British independence. Prime Minister Tojo of Japan has stated three times that he will support India's independence. This time, he has clearly clarified that "he is willing to use all means to drive the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States out of India and complete India's true independence," which has deeply moved them. The powerful local Indians believe that the complete independence of India will be realized by Prime Minister Tojo's statement this time. At the same time, all the Indians are determined to devote all their efforts to the final struggle for survival to thank the Japanese government for its kindness. Karim Gani, the president of the Indian Independence League here, gave a speech on the 16th, which meant that Gandhi has launched an unyielding struggle against Britain since August last year. This struggle is a struggle between those without weapons and those with cruel weapons. Our fellow Indians in East Asia will make various preparations to rescue the brave comrades in their homeland. Prime Minister Tojo's statement has made us feel infinitely excited. Burma has also adopted the same pace as Japan and believes that it should devote all its efforts to supporting India's independence and driving out the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States. The realization of India's independence is a major element of Burma's complete independence. The war goals of Burma and India are completely the same.

### Italy Is Actively Strengthening Domestic Defense to Prepare for Any Eventuality; Southeastern Europe Has Become a Strong Bastion of the Axis; Any Landing Attempt by Britain and the United States Will Be Strongly Repulsed

Rome, 17th (Central News Agency) To prepare for any eventuality, Italy is actively strengthening its domestic defenses. The Italian government issued an order to the people on the 16th, stating that if any soldiers, spies, or suspected individuals of the anti-Axis forces are discovered, they should be reported to the military or police authorities immediately. The order also stipulates that Italian citizens have an obligation to report to the authorities any behavior that harms national defense. Those who conceal suspects or assist them will be sentenced to ten years of imprisonment.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) The "Berlin Financial News" published an article yesterday entitled "The Fortress of Southeastern Europe," discussing the defensive strength of the Balkans and the chances of the anti-Axis forces landing in Southeastern Europe. It stated that in recent weeks, an invincible Atlantic front has been established, extending from Narvik in the far north to Irun on the French border. Therefore, the only hope for the anti-Axis forces is to land and invade in Southeastern Europe. But if they do, their attempt will make them realize that they have made a serious mistake by ignoring the major changes in Southeastern Europe. The current situation can no longer be compared with 1914 or 1918, because the Balkans, long known as the powder keg of Europe, has now become the fortress of Southeastern Europe. Today's Bulgaria, under the leadership of its King Boris, is prepared to defend the country to the last man. The Romanian army, under the command of Marshal Antonescu, fights shoulder to shoulder with the German army. The Hungarian army has also shown its bravery in the current war and will strongly resist any invaders of Europe. Yugoslavia no longer exists, and Serbia is showing an increasing understanding of its responsibilities in Europe. Croatia, which has long been oppressed, is now liberated and is a powerful assistant to Germany. And the liberated Slovakia also has a strong army that has achieved significant results on the Eastern Front. If the anti-Axis countries invade Southeastern Europe, they will find it extremely difficult, as the German and Italian troops defending the Balkans are prepared for an effective defense. Greece, occupied by the German army for more than two years, has now become a bridgehead of special value, with many advantages for defending the Balkans. In the first Balkan War, the British army hastily retreated to various ports and fled in embarrassment. If they attempt to land again, they will suffer the same fate.

### On the Orel Front, the German Army Launched a General Counter-Offensive

Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency) After the Soviet army's breakthrough operation in the northeast of Orel was frustrated, the German army took the opportunity to launch a general counter-offensive on the 65-kilometer front between Mtsensk and Belev. The Soviet positions in the Belev area, covered with smoke, seem to have retreated to new positions after a fierce German attack. However, according to a communiqué issued by the Soviet Information Bureau on the morning of the 16th, "the German counter-offensive has been repulsed." Northwest of Mtsensk, under the cover of powerful dive bombers, the German army also launched four fierce attacks on the main Soviet line, engaging in fierce mobile warfare with the Soviet army defending its positions. There have been no reports on the situation since then. In the areas of Mtsensk, south of Balakleya, and Sevsk, the air battles between the German and Soviet armies were extremely fierce. According to the German news agency, the German air force bombed Soviet airfields near Starobelsk, Shitigersfahtovo, and also bombed the railway facilities in Voroshilovgrad and Milerovo, causing significant damage.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) German News Agency military correspondent Harenslimu declared: Since the situation on the Eastern Front began over four months ago, except for slight changes in the positions of both sides, the general situation remains as before. The German command is taking advantage of the current relatively calm opportunity to add new divisions to reinforce the Eastern Front. Various new equipment and new weapons have further strengthened the firepower of the German army. The correspondent pointed out that the mechanized equipment of the German army on the Eastern Front has reached such a level that it can be called a "wheel front." The enemy's efforts should not be underestimated. Certain signs reveal that the enemy seems to be most concerned about the Kursk area, as the enemy's transportation movements in that area have been very tense in the past few days. German military circles do not want to comment on the German countermeasures, but it can be predicted that the German army is preparing a deep, terraced defense line along the entire front to use flash speed to intercept any offensive actions by the enemy.

### The Turkish Prime Minister Reaffirmed His Neutrality

Istanbul, 17th (Central News Agency) The Sixth Congress of the Turkish Republican People's Party, which began on the 8th of this month, lasted for eight days and closed on the 15th. At the closing ceremony, Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu delivered a speech, clarifying the Turkish government's domestic and foreign policies, and reaffirmed Turkey's adherence to its policy of neutrality. The main points are as follows: (1) Foreign policy: In the past four years, the Turkish government has faced imminent war several times, but thanks to the government's consistent foreign policy and the nation's spirit of sacrifice, the Turkish people have been spared from these dangers of war. Looking at the Turkish government's diplomatic relations with various countries, it is clear that the friendly relations between Turkey and the Soviet Union have become closer due to the treaty signed between the two countries. Both countries are faithfully abiding by the treaty. Moreover, the treaty between Turkey and Britain has a long term and a large scope, and there have been talks with British Foreign Secretary Eden and Prime Minister Churchill, which is proof that the views of Turkey and Britain are completely consistent. In addition, the non-aggression treaty concluded with Germany is based on the interests of both Turkey and Germany. This treaty will create conditions that are even more beneficial to both countries. In light of this, what completely protects Turkey from the dangers of war is the Turkish government's foreign policy, which is based on national unity and a strong army. (2) Domestic policy: At the beginning of this war, the Turkish government immediately started to pay its members. In the past three years, the Turkish government's budgeted amount reached 486 million Turkish pounds, and the temporary expenditure amount reached 500 million Turkish pounds. Because a bumper harvest is expected this year, the increase in revenue from agricultural products next year will rise to 1 billion Turkish pounds. The government has not obtained any revenue from domestic ethnic minorities and foreigners, but if difficulties are encountered in the future, taxes will also be levied on these residents.

The Minister of Commerce Details the Current Situation of the Mining Industry in North China

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) At the Budget General Meeting of the House of Representatives on the 17th, the Minister of Commerce, Mr. Kishi, responded to the inquiry of Representative Tanaka regarding the current situation of the mining industry in North Central China, stating: Regarding the utilization of the Yantien iron ore, development is being actively promoted, and a portion has already been transported to Japan and Manchuria. Regarding the on-site iron smelting work in North China, Sun plans to move Japanese factories and equipment there and start iron smelting in Shijingshan. At the same time, small smelting furnaces are being set up in North China and Mengjiang to strengthen the local iron smelting industry. A portion has already been completed and plans are being made. A small smelting furnace has been set up in Qingdao, Shandong Province, with the aim of making full use of local iron ore. The iron ore resources on the Yangtze River coast have long been used. A large part of this year's iron ore production plan relies on iron ore produced in Japan and along the Yangtze River. The iron ore on Hainan Island is of excellent quality, and development is proceeding faster than planned.

Improving Important Enterprises and Strengthening Combat Power

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) At the session of the Enterprise Improvement Committee of the House of Representatives on the 17th, the Minister of Commerce, Mr. Kishi, responded to the questions of Representatives Koyama and Funada by detailing the following four points: (1) the basic policy for enterprise improvement, (2) the improvement between industrial departments, (3) the improvement of the distribution mechanism, and (4) the improvement of the control work. When explaining the basic policy of enterprises, he further pointed out that its purpose is to mobilize the entire industrial power and concentrate it on enhancing combat power. The gist is that this enterprise improvement is not adopting a passive improvement due to lack of raw materials. Its purpose is to mobilize the entire industrial power of Japan and concentrate it on enhancing combat power, so its nature is positive. Therefore, the target of improvement is not limited to the peace industry. The biggest focus of the improvement is on improving the key industrial sectors in order to effectively utilize the factory equipment and labor transferred from other sectors. Therefore, a fundamental restructuring of the content, technology, and organization of key industrial sectors is an urgent task at present.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) At the session of the Enterprise Improvement Committee of the House of Representatives on the morning of the 17th, the Minister of Commerce, Mr. Kishi, and the Minister of Greater East Asia, Mr. Aoki, responded to the question of Representative Ryogoro Kato by explaining the government's policy on improving the weaving industry and moving it to the South as follows: (1) The improvement of the textile industry sector will continue to ensure the supply of infant products. (2) The clothing problem in the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere will also establish a certain clothing plan on the same plan as the material support, so that its export volume can be the same as last year. In addition, a certain relocation plan has been established for the plan to relocate domestic spinning mills, and it is currently being carried out in the Philippines and Java. Weaving machines related to spinning will also be relocated. In addition, the second and third relocation policies have been decided. (3) Although the cotton produced in northern China is not necessarily optimistic, this is because it needs to be solved in combination with the food problem, so we are currently working on research. (4) The procedure for improving the textile industry is that in the cotton, artificial fiber, spinning, and other departments, about 40% of the work is done, 30% or 40% is preserved, and the remaining 20% is transferred or abolished. In addition, about 40% to 50% of the same fabric is still working, 20% is preserved, and the remaining 40% is abolished.

Selected Translations of Current Events

### Italy Is Preparing to Repel Britain and the United States

(Special Dispatch from Berlin, 10th, by Special Correspondent Kato) The 10th of this month marked the third anniversary of Italy's participation in the war, a great test. The loss of Tunisia is regarded by Germany and Italy as "merely a border war." Although the calls for "invading the continent" by Britain and the United States are a weapon of psychological warfare intended to intimidate the Italian people, the bombing of various parts of Italy by the British and American air forces after the Tunisian war has become increasingly fierce. The continuous heavy bombing of Pantelleria, Sardinia, and Sicily is by no means an optimistic situation. On June 7, the British army attempted a landing on the island of Lampedusa, but was repelled by the Italian garrison on the island. The British may continue to try such probing, enemy-before-landing operations on Pantelleria (translator's note: the Italian army has now abandoned it) and Sicily. The Italian side, of course, has made sufficient preparations for this. Even if the enemy does not attempt such small-scale probing, but attempts to open up a second front with a large number of troops, the Italian side has completed preparations to defeat them.

In mid-May, when the Axis forces stopped fighting in Tunisia, I was in Rome. After receiving this painful report, the Italian people did not experience an unexpectedly deep spiritual impact. This was naturally because everyone already knew that the situation since General Rommel's retreat was unfavorable to us, and Prime Minister Mussolini had warned us to prepare for the worst situation. That is to say, everyone had made mental preparations in advance. Therefore, the loss of Tunisia did not cause much surprise or panic. Three years ago, when Italy entered the war in excitement, Prime Minister Mussolini's secret thoughts were another matter, but some people may have thought that this was a short-term war. Since the beginning of the war against the Soviet Union and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has become a true world war that covers the entire globe, so all Italians are aware of the historical significance of this war. In the long run, there are bright days and dark days. Since the loss of Tunisia, the situation encountered by Italy has been more difficult than that of Japan and Germany. Enduring this difficult situation and completing the war of resistance with hardship will eventually lead to the brilliant victory of the Axis powers. In the hearts of the Italian people, this awareness and determination to face the cold reality can be seen from the outside. Prime Minister Mussolini's words "Return to Africa" are sad, but they hide the spirit of dying after death. Is this not the spirit of the new Italy?

Recently, Prime Minister Mussolini told the people to "have a demonic hatred for the enemy." The Minister of Propaganda Goebbels also repeatedly stated this in Germany, inscribing the hatred for the enemy in their hearts. By regarding Japan in the East and Germany in the West as the main enemies, and viewing Italy as secondary, the British and American sides are simply trying to sever Italy from the Axis camp. On the one hand, they are using air power to suppress the fighting spirit of the Italian people, but this has had the opposite effect. Reports from Naples, Sardinia, and other places that have been blindly bombed clearly show the strong emotions of hatred for Britain and the United States. Although it is not yet clear what the British and American intentions are in attacking Lampedusa, assuming that the enemy plans to occupy this island as a foothold for spying on the Italian mainland, it has obviously failed. We will not discuss the intentions of Britain and the United States for the time being. The methods of attack by Britain and the United States, especially air raids, will become more and more fierce. Will Britain and the United States really bomb Rome? There are all sorts of speculations about this question. The Italian people, given the indiscriminate bombing of Britain and the United States, realize that Rome will not be spared and are therefore seeking adequate defenses.

Italy now stands at a critical juncture for the survival of the nation. How will the Italian people, who have been forged by Fascism for the past twenty years, endure this磨鋉 [torment/grinding]? How will they win? The repulse of the enemy's attack on the island of Lampedusa is a harbinger of victory for Italy in the face of difficulties. We, the people of the allied nations, sincerely wish them victory. (Translated by Xiang from the 62nd Western Daily News)

### Anti-Axis Offensive in Europe Will Incur Great Sacrifices

According to a broadcast from London, Churchill's speech in the House of Commons on the 8th regarding the Washington talks did not mention any expected concrete results, and the British public generally felt dissatisfied. But an offensive in Europe is undoubtedly becoming increasingly imminent. Amid various speculations, there are rumors of a landing in northern France. A dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden on the 8th, citing a report from a Berlin correspondent, states the German view on this as follows:

Even if the anti-Axis forces attempt to invade northern France from the English Channel, they must have at least 500,000 troops. About 50,000 troops must be used for the landing operation. The first landing force must sacrifice 25% when crossing the English Channel. Assuming that about 35,000 troops break through the German machine gun nets and can secure a bridgehead of 100 to 150 yards along the coast and inland, then the second landing force will reach the German fortress area two kilometers to fifty kilometers from the shore to obtain artillery positions and prevent the replenishment of reinforcements. At this time, about half of the first landing force will be lost, and the third landing force will be lost by about 15%. At the same time, because the German army's strong defensive positions can be reinforced from behind, the landing army will be in a dangerous situation. At this time, the third landing force will enter the coast, forcing the German troops who are still resisting to retreat, and build a special fire net on the coast. But at this time, only 10,000 of the original two units remain. The loss of the third unit may be less, but the total number of anti-Axis forces dispatched in three units is only 50,000 out of 150,000. 50,000 people must defend the five-mile-long coastal area. After that, batch after batch of troops should still include their losses at sea. Before the decisive battle begins, at least two-thirds must be lost. Therefore, if the anti-Axis forces want to achieve even local success, they must mobilize at least 90 divisions, that is, 1.8 million troops. The sacrifices made in the middle will be a fatal blow to them.

In addition, no matter how exaggerated the anti-Axis forces are about the power of their air force, it is impossible for them to control the airspace of the English Channel. Therefore, it is wrong to estimate the strength of the anti-Axis air force above this. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Daily News, June 12)

### Construction Progress of the Japanese Army in the South

(〇〇 Base, Special Correspondent Mashi) From the southeastern part of New Guinea, through New Britain, New Ireland, and the Bismarck Archipelago, to the Solomon Islands, composed of over thirty islands, lies the so-called air route in the southeastern Pacific. This battle line is the decisive location for the Greater East Asia War. The enemy is putting up a stubborn resistance, and Japanese soldiers are active on all fronts—sea, land, and air—filled with abundant fighting spirit. Many people are following these brave warriors, overcoming all adverse conditions to engage in development and construction, sharing the hardships with the soldiers. We cannot underestimate these facts.

Construction of the Base

The development and construction of the 〇〇 temple and supply base are steadily progressing. Naval Bureau direct units, such as civil administration officials, and related companies in fisheries, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, lumbering, and civil engineering, are selecting their elite and dispatching them to the northern lands, dedicating all their strength and technology to desperate construction. Lumber companies are venturing into forests untouched by axes since ancient times, undertaking everything from logging giant trees to processing lumber.

The marine resources are incomparably rich. The fish species of the South Seas are yielding excellent results. The amount of fish caught by fishing boats is truly unexpected. Soldiers greatly enjoy eating this fish as sashimi.

In addition, design teams are laboring hard in various war zones, engaged in the construction of airfields, roads, bridges, and the design of base facilities such as barracks. People often associate war with destruction, but conversely, many modern facilities are being actively constructed in formerly uninhabited areas. War can truly be called a great construction of culture.

Spirit of Naval Aviation

In this area, naval aviation units are engaged in fierce battles day and night, filled with a vigorous fighting spirit, never forgetting their mission to destroy enemy aircraft. Even during breaks from combat, they are constantly on alert and reconnaissance, and they continue rigorous training. What I felt during my stay at the 〇〇 base was that the aircrew directly participating in combat are also extremely hardworking. On the eve of tomorrow's departure for battle, comrades shed tears of sympathy for those about to engage in combat. Bathing and other matters are conducted with orderly hierarchy. To avoid disturbing sleep, voices are kept very low. When passing in front of their sleeping quarters, one walks on tiptoe to avoid making even the slightest sound. When the aircraft return safely, everyone embraces in joy.

On one bombing mission, the fuel tank of a night fighter was pierced by enemy fire, leading to a heroic self-detonation. When a wingman was hit by enemy fire and descended from the sky, its speed reduced, the comrade flew alongside to protect it, waving to signal. The other pilot waved back, looking determined. Unable to save himself, he had no choice but to self-detonate. Another pilot, witnessing this, couldn't help but shed tears. Also, when the bombing concluded and they retreated from enemy airspace, the escorting fighter aircraft approached, and they said to each other, "That was great!" "Thank you!" Waving to celebrate each other's safety and valiant fight. That momentary posture was truly admirable.

After landing, after all reports are completed, they always offer a silent prayer of reverence towards their homeland. Ground crew members like mechanics cannot help but shed tears. Standing in a corner of the airfield in the fading twilight, they gaze intently towards the sky, waiting for the return of their beloved aircraft. Seeing that tragic posture, one can only be deeply moved.

Small Transport Ships

The crews of small naval vessels such as minesweepers, destroyers, and small transport ships that transport troops and supplies also endure considerable hardship. Minesweepers and destroyers naturally participate in combat, needless to say. Even when not in combat, they are constantly engaged in minesweeping, vigilance, patrols, and various escort duties for transport ships. Even when the South Sea is calm, there are still violent waves. The ships are very small, so they rock violently. Unable to cook, they often subsist on crackers and water for several days, which is not enough to eat. Fresh water also becomes a precious commodity; each morning, only one beer bottle of water, barely more than a liter, is distributed, which must last through the day. It is also rare to be able to take a bath.

The crews of small transport ships are quite worried because they are not equipped with heavy armament. When they are loaded with troops and supplies, the burden is very heavy, and at night everyone is very anxious.

Marines

Think of the valiant marines in the Wuhan campaign... Especially at this stage, although there are no reports of where the marines are active, their secret missions have not ceased. The current mission of the marines is different from that on the mainland. They are responsible for maintaining security, air defense, and other tasks at various bases. In certain locations, they penetrate deep into the forest, clearing thick undergrowth to deploy troops to take charge of maritime and aerial defense. A certain sergeant Huang said: "Vigilance in the forest and along the coast is extremely important. We tread paths without trails, through mud and wetlands, to perform our duties. The hardship is definitely beyond the imagination of those who do not know." (Excerpt from the Western Asahi Newspaper, June 10)

### Profit Money from Japanese Military-Managed Factories Distributed Yesterday, Finance Ministry Representative Receives Over Three Thousand Yuan

### Shanghai-Dalian Intercity Athletic Competition to be Held on the 20th of this Month

—Preparatory Committee Receives Press Corps Yesterday

(Shanghai Central News Agency) The Shanghai-Dalian Intercity Athletic Competition has been scheduled for half past noon on the 20th of this month at Hongkou Park. Track and field events will begin promptly at one o'clock in the afternoon. Athletes from China, Japan, Manchuria, Germany, and Italy will participate in the competition, promising a grand and unprecedented spectacle. Yesterday (17th) at three o'clock in the afternoon, the Preparatory Committee hosted members of the press from this city. Mr. Manabe, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, Mr. Nishino, Honorary Secretary of the Japan Amateur Athletic Association, Mr. Ogawa of Mantetsu, and others, entrusted by the Preparatory Committee, reported on the progress of preparations and the impressive training of the Shanghai and Dalian athletes.

Speech by Mr. Manabe

First, Mr. Manabe, Secretary, delivered a speech, stating briefly: The Shanghai-Dalian Intercity Athletic Competition will proceed as scheduled. He hoped that everyone would cooperate in publicity. Intercity competitions are still in their early stages. Although Shanghai has had several large competitions in the past, the nature of this intercity competition is very different. He sincerely hoped that everyone would exert all their efforts to assist the conference in publicity, so as to benefit the progress of the conference. Further details of the athletic competition will be described by Mr. Nishino and Mr. Ogawa. In terms of reporting, Japanese newspapers and the Domei News Agency will make their best efforts. It is anticipated that this grand occasion will not only be known throughout the city, but will also extend to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and any other places.

Track and Field Situation

Mr. Nishino then reported on the track and field situation and predictions. Among the track and field athletes in this city, the Chinese, Japanese, and German athletes are more numerous. Italians are more numerous in football, but have not participated in track and field. Dalian is represented by a cooperative team of Japanese and Manchurian athletes, totaling fifteen, who arrived in Shanghai on the 14th and began training the following day. There are a total of twenty-seven participants on the Shanghai side. The order of the events is: (1) 1500-meter race, (2) pole vault, (3) 100-meter, (4) shot put, (5) long jump, (6) 400-meter, (7) discus, (8) high jump, (9) 5000-meter long distance, (10) javelin, (11) 400-meter relay race, etc. For scoring, the top three finishers are taken into account for the 1500-meter and 5000-meter races, the top two for the relay race, with the champion earning four points and the runner-up one point. For all other track and field events, the top four finishers are taken into account, with the first place earning four points, second place three points, third place two points, and fourth place one point.

Track Race Prediction

He then discussed predictions for the competition between the Dalian team and Shanghai athletes. (100-meter) The Dalian team boasts Fukuda (with a record of 10 seconds), Japan's Sugita Hirose (both 11.4 seconds), and others, while the most promising for the Shanghai team is Mr. Kimura Takashi. Fukuda and Kimura are expected to be the most likely to win. (400-meter) The Dalian team has Japan (with a record of 55 seconds), Seguchi (53 seconds), Endo (56 seconds), etc. The Shanghai team has Ivanov and Kubota, both with records of 53 seconds. In recent training, Kubota's competition and Seguchi's relentless running from beginning to end, and Ivanov's strong stamina, make it likely that the three will vigorously contend for the lead. (1500-meter) Dalian's Seguchi, Tada (with a record of 4 minutes 30 seconds), Yu, and Tominaga are expected to be contenders, with Seguchi most likely to win the championship, followed by Tada and Tominaga. (5000-meter) The competition between Dalian's Tominaga, , Seguchi (score of 16 minutes), and Shanghai's Wang Zhenglin and Abe will be fierce, as Abe's recent performance and spirit have improved, and his results have progressed rapidly. (400-meter relay) Fukuda, Tsuchimochi, Hirose, Matsuda, Tatto, Japan, and Kato, with Fukuda, Hirose, Matsuda, and Kato having the greatest confidence, making prediction difficult.

Field Event Prediction

Later, he described the field event predictions. (1) In the long jump, Fukuda still holds the record of 7 meters, while Kimura Takashi's score is 6.96 meters, with little difference between them, the competition should be even more intense. (2) In the high jump, Kimura Takashi has a confident expectation with a score of 1.90 meters, but Fukuda is also not inferior, and it is predicted that the two will compete for the lead. (2) In the pole vault, Dalian's Abe and Kido are the most confident, and Shanghai is unlikely to have any hope. (4) In the discus, Fukuda, Kido, and Kato are all between 32 and 35 meters, while Shanghai's athletes Palocco, Hua Liechai, and Yamamoto are also between 33 and 34.5 meters, making it difficult to predict who will win. (5) The shot put will be won by Dalian, with scores between 21 and 12 meters. (6) Although Kido, Kato, and Fukuda hold records of over 50 meters in the javelin, Shanghai's Tian Xuewu has a score of 53 meters and has shown considerable improvement in recent training. This track and field competition will be conducted in a solemn and orderly manner, making the event solemn and grand.

Football Situation

Finally, Mr. Ogawa reported on the preparations for football. He first stated that the inclusion of the football competition in this conference is of great significance, and football is especially of interest to the general Chinese population in the city. Therefore, football is a team sport, and both Shanghai and Dalian have formed strong teams to compete. Regarding the formation of the Shanghai team, preliminary selections were held on the 15th, dividing into red and white teams, with athletes selected from China, Japan, and Italy to compete. After the selection committee screened the outstanding players, the team was established. The list has been announced, but overall, the Shanghai team is the strongest, with Chinese players such as Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, and Li Tiansheng, and the Italian navy has increased its strength, with five players selected. The Dalian team, in terms of overall strength, is also not weak, with a balanced development of individual strengths. Although Shanghai's players have their own strengths and skills, the Dalian team has a strong belief in winning, and if the Shanghai team is negligent, they may find it difficult to win.

Economic Commentary

### Allocating Public Agricultural Tools

In order to revitalize agriculture and forestry and increase agricultural production, the Ministry of Industry has purchased public agricultural tools and allocated them to various agricultural improvement areas, allowing local farmers to apply for rentals. This measure is sufficient to bring out the following meanings: (1) The Chinese farmers' diligence, hardiness, and agricultural techniques—at least in terms of manual skills—can surpass those of any other ethnicity. However, the economic situation of Chinese farmers does not allow them to own all kinds of necessary agricultural tools. This is the biggest shortcoming of the Chinese countryside, which needs to be compensated by us. (2) "If one wishes to do good work, one must first sharpen one's tools." In the Chinese countryside, even those who own agricultural tools often have old and broken tools, which they勉强apply, impacting manpower and time in agricultural affairs, which cannot be calculated. Now, with the government's resources, purchasing brand-new public agricultural tools, and even stipulating that farmers must return them in complete and undamaged condition, and must be responsible for repairs if there is damage. Therefore, there is no doubt that the working efficiency produced by public agricultural tools will far surpass that of privately owned agricultural tools. (3) The rental price for farmers to rent public agricultural tools is only based on maintaining repair costs. In this way, farmers spend limited amounts and gain a lot. Those who have always been diligent and hardworking will feel particularly excited and work even harder. Even those who are lazy by nature and do not engage in production, seeing the agricultural tools in front of them, will feel a surge of interest in farming; invisibly, it will naturally promote agricultural activities and increase agricultural production. (4) Originally, the direct purpose of agricultural loans was to maintain the daily lives of farmers, but its indirect purpose, that is, the ultimate purpose, is to increase agricultural production. Farmers who rent agricultural tools must pay rental prices, so those who cannot afford to pay can rely on agricultural loans, so they do not have a feeling of望洋興嘆.

In addition, since farmers can rent public agricultural tools, it is thought that the same principle can also be applied to small-scale industries, in order to increase industrial production. When it comes to today's production issues, agriculture and industry are equally important. The industrial authorities can purchase public agricultural tools and allocate them to agricultural improvement areas, and they can also purchase public tools and allocate them to small-scale industrial areas, because the facts tell us that many small-scale factories cannot fully发挥their production capacity because of incomplete equipment and insufficient machinery. Those who talk about industrial national funds today may study this issue; at the same time, it is hoped that the industrial authorities will give it overall consideration, in order to increase wartime multifaceted production power.

### Silver and Money Industries Form Syndicates to Handle Investment in Production Enterprises

Since the National Government implemented the wartime economic policy guidelines, the National Commercial Control Council, which secures material control institutions, and the various industry trade associations under its subordinate agencies, and the various major commodity trade associations, have been established and adjusted, and are about to告二段落.

It is learned that regarding the adjustment of agricultural institutions and the enhancement of production enterprises, in addition to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry having ordered the Bank of Communications to handle rural lending, the Bank of Communications has now established a simple agricultural economics department to investigate the rural economic conditions in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai, and invest in rural areas and handle agricultural lending. The silver and money industries in this city are also forming syndicates to handle investment in production enterprises. The ones currently in progress include: (1) China and other twenty-one banks jointly formed the China Silk Industry Company Lending Syndicate, lending 50 million yuan, for the company to purchase spring and summer cocoons. (2) The Financial Promotion Association, together with more than forty banks, organized a lending syndicate to handle lending related to production enterprises, hosted by the Shanghai Industrial Bank. (3) The Shanghai Fuhe Exchange Bank, together with twelve同業, organized a lending group to handle industrial and commercial lending. (4) Regarding the purchase of wheat loans, the Yantian Grain Storage and the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Commercial Control Council have agreed to designate the China and Bank of Communications to lend 100,000,000 yuan for wheat loans, in the form of commercial acceptance drafts.

### Central Reserve Bank Handles Rediscounting of Drafts

In order to调剂interbank finance and stabilize the market, the Central Reserve Bank, in accordance with the revised Central Reserve Bank Law, handles rediscounting of commercial drafts, bank drafts, etc., stipulating: (2) Rediscounting of domestic bank acceptance drafts, commercial drafts, and promissory notes. The aforementioned negotiable instruments must have arisen for the production, manufacturing, transportation, or sale of goods, and their due date must not exceed six months from the date of acquisition by the Central Reserve Bank. (2) Rediscounting of treasury bills and public debt interest coupons issued or guaranteed by the National Government. The due date of the aforementioned securities and interest coupons must not exceed six months from the date of rediscounting. (3) Real sales of foreign payment drafts. The due date of the aforementioned drafts, if arising from import and export trade, must not exceed four months after sight. All drafts that determine payment dates in accordance with commercial custom should have at least two signatures of reputable商號, but if accompanied by bills of lading, warehouse receipts, or warehouse warrants as担保品, and the value of the goods exceeds 25% of the amount of the negotiable instruments担保ed, one signature of a reputable商號may also be handled. The bank's loans, rediscounts, or other advances and purchases of drafts, checks, or other negotiable instruments to private individuals or companies or other individuals may not exceed 500,000 yuan per household in total. If it is a limited liability company, it may not exceed one-third of the company's capital and accumulated funds.
