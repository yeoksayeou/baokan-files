### Wartime Production Rationalization

For days we have discussed the development of wartime production, and we hope to attract the attention of the authorities in Sino-Japanese relations and entrepreneurs of all sizes; however, we must particularly remind everyone that all wartime production must be rationalized to more effectively increase wartime production.

The so-called rationalization of wartime production is the reasonable coordination of all wartime production undertakings. Obstacles to the increase and stability of production. Now, leaving aside political obstacles, let’s just talk about technical aspects. First, there is an excessive dependence on the weather, which of course must be addressed through water conservancy and forestry. When it comes to water conservancy, it involves things like digging canals, building dams, constructing sluice gates, building dikes, digging wells, storing water, and diverting water. All of these require manufacturing and supply from the industrial sector. Second is the cultivation of soil, that is, the fertilizer problem. At present, the agricultural sector has an extremely urgent need for fertilizers. Foreign supplies are almost non-existent, and the domestic fertilizer industry is extremely poor. Neither phosphorous, nitrogenous, sulfurous, nor calcareous fertilizers can help agriculture solve the fertilizer problem. In fact, Japan is a well-known fertilizer-producing country, and Manchuria’s soybean cakes were the main source of fertilizer for Chinese (especially Jiangsu and Zhejiang) farmland in the past. As this East Asian axis accelerates, it seems that there should be some performance in this area. Third, there is an insufficiency of manpower and animal power. After joining the war, the rational allocation of manpower and animal power in rural areas will naturally be even more worthy of attention and consideration. The difficulty of this power can only be solved technically by applying more mechanical power so that plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, and water lifting can all utilize machinery as much as possible, to adapt to the reality of the future shortage of rural labor. If the industrial sector can fully achieve these three points, agricultural production can be quite optimistic. Even if it cannot be fully achieved, partial achievement is not impossible. But regarding these, it depends on the future communication between the agricultural and industrial sectors to seek coordination. Because on the other hand, the increase in agricultural production should also suit the needs of industry. For example, molasses (made from sugarcane) required for the production of liquid fuels, tung oil, and rapeseed oil, will certainly increase in demand for future war participation, and the supply of agricultural production can be said to be very urgent. In addition, cotton and hemp required for textiles also occupy a very important position in the supply, and all are expected to be organized and planned in wartime agricultural coordination with industry.

Secondly, there is the coordination of mining and industry. If the raw materials and fuels required by industry cannot be fully supplied by the mining sector, then industry will not be able to maximize production and may sometimes be forced to stop work entirely or partially, or reduce working hours and reduce output. The most obvious is fuel – coal. One aspect is the question of whether production is sufficient, and the other is the question of reasonable and fair distribution. Especially for factories with weak capital, if they are not given assistance, production will inevitably be affected. As for the raw materials required by the smelting industry, such as iron, copper, manganese, and zinc, they also rely on the rational supply of the mining industry. Iron is an important raw material for steelmaking, and refined metals such as steel and copper are the raw materials that industry and the military industry need the most. After participating in the war, the need will naturally increase even more, and the degree of coordination between the mining and industrial sectors will also increase. The above is what industry needs from the mining sector. Conversely, the mining sector also depends on the close cooperation of industry. For example, the equipment required for mining, such as drilling, grinding, smelting, ventilation, power, transportation, repair, and construction, all require supplies from the industrial sector. Because if this supply is not rational and sufficient, then the expansion of mining equipment and the increase in production will encounter great difficulties.

Power and industry also require close cooperation. Many industries cannot obtain sufficient power, and therefore cannot expand equipment, increase production, and even the establishment of new factories has to accommodate the supply of power. This phenomenon is not only true in small cities, but even in large cities. Insufficient power further hinders production. However, in some places, there may be a surplus of power because the equipment of power plants exceeds the local power consumption. From another perspective, the power sector also needs the cooperation of industry, such as generators, turbine transformers, power lines, insulators required by the electricity industry, and diesel fuel required by diesel generators. If the electricity industry cannot get a sufficient supply from the industrial sector, the production and expansion of the electricity industry and the establishment of new power plants will have great difficulties.

Coordination is even more needed between industries. Factories that manufacture power lines need refined copper, factories that manufacture radio equipment and larger factories that manufacture machines need industrial raw materials, factories that make steel need iron, and so on. All must have mutual cooperation between various industries, otherwise it will be difficult to expect an increase in production. Moreover, in the industrial sector, especially between Chinese and Japanese industries, the squeezing, infighting, and other bad phenomena between large and small industries, the conspiracy of the big fish eating the small fish, cannot always be avoided, and of course there is no talk of cooperation. In the future, this can no longer be improved.

In addition, finance cannot cooperate with industry, so that the turnover of industrial funds is very difficult, and transportation cannot cooperate with industry, so that the construction of industry and the supply of raw materials all encounter great difficulties. And the lack of cooperation between agriculture, forestry, mining, industry, finance, transportation and other industries is equally huge and serious. For all of these, it is hoped that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will, with a selfless spirit, implement the most complete planned production under the premise of considering both wartime needs and postwar development, completely including all production undertakings in the peace zone. At the same time, one of the existing many economic institutions must be selected, or a wartime economic institution must be established to give full power, concentrate talent, and be responsible for the planning, adjustment, and coordination of production undertakings. The original competent authorities of various economic and production undertakings, as well as important production undertakings, should always maintain close contact, exchange opinions frankly, and review gains and losses, all with the interests of the country and the nation as the premise, and strive for effective cooperation. In this way, production undertakings can be brought into the right track, fully developed, play the greatest role, and work together to win the victory of the Greater East Asia War and stabilize the economy and national life in the peace zone.

After the meeting, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department of the Central Party Headquarters received Chinese and foreign reporters at the Propaganda Department at 3:00 p.m. and gave a speech on the situation of the conference. The general idea is as follows: A total of 49 draft proposals were discussed in detail at this conference, all of which were passed and handed over to the Standing Committee and relevant departments for reference and handling. The focus of the discussion was on issues related to participation in the war. There were also very detailed discussions on wartime culture, economic propaganda, youth training, etc., and important decisions were made, the most important of which were: (1) In view of the inappropriateness of the current secondary school system, the four-year secondary school and two-year university preparatory system will be restored.

Nanjing, 15th (Haitong News Agency) A well-informed source here told Haitong News Agency today that the abolition of other Chinese political parties will be the theme of discussion at the Fifth Plenary Session this morning, in order to promote China's relationship of sharing weal and woe. It is said that the Great People's Society and other organizations will be cleared up. This can indeed be said to be a great victory for the Kuomintang and the Chairman. From now on, the Kuomintang will step up its work in various places. It is said that the Kuomintang is now planning to set up a branch party headquarters in Peiping. From this, it can be seen that the result of Chairman Wang Yitang of the North China Political Affairs Commission's visit to Nanjing this time has made the relationship between North China and Central China closer. Therefore, it is expected that the New People's Society will also be abolished. This measure will undoubtedly have a major impact on China's war facilities.

### Declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) The declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is as follows: When the Premier of our Party, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, went north in November of the thirteenth year of the Republic, he detoured through Kobe and gave a speech on Pan-Asianism. This was the speech after the Three Principles of the People, and it was also the last speech in the Premier's life. In March of the following year, the Premier passed away in Peiping. In his will, he earnestly urged his comrades to abolish unequal treaties. Since then, seventeen or eighteen years have passed. Unfortunately, disputes have occurred between China and Japan, leading to war and suffering, which has pleased the Anglo-American imperialists and pained the East Asian comrades. Until today, the Republic of China has finally regained the original appearance of Pan-Asianism, cooperating with the friendly nation of Japan to participate in the Greater East Asia War, drive out the enemies of East Asia, the Anglo-American imperialists, and unite the 1 billion East Asian compatriots to strive for the victory of the Greater East Asia War for the East Asian comrades and seek the realization of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At this time, the friendly nation of Japan also assisted the Republic of China in abolishing unequal treaties, returning concessions, and abolishing extraterritorial rights, in order to complete the necessary conditions for the Republic of China's independence and autonomy. Alas, the Premier's will and the long-cherished wishes of the 400 million compatriots have been fulfilled in one day. When the comrades of our Party met at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, they saw this epoch-making progress, recalling the past, and could not help but feel both sad and happy. Looking forward to the future, they were even more excited.

Since the Sixth National Congress of our Party, it has promoted the importance of peace, saying that if China cannot obtain equality and freedom, it will not have the ability to share responsibility for East Asia, and the complete acquisition of China's equality and freedom must be sought in the liberation of East Asia. Therefore, at the beginning of the peace movement, it responded to the friendly nation of Japan's proposal to build a new order in East Asia based on Pan-Asianism. The so-called peace should be a true, permanent, and just peace. It is not a name that can be borrowed by post-war exhaustion and respite, nor is it a purpose that can be achieved by being confined to narrow nationalism and seeking its own revival. Following this main point, evolving and progressing, since the establishment of the Treaty on Basic Relations between China and Japan and the joint declaration of the three countries, and the formation of the Axis, since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government has made a statement of sharing weal and woe, and the trend has been decided. Taking a further step to participate in the Greater East Asia War is a natural step, and also the final decision. Compatriots across the country should do their best to achieve this in this great era, and our Party comrades should be aware of the greatness of their mission, the uniqueness of their responsibility, and sacrifice everything to contribute to the Greater East Asia War, so that China will gain freedom and East Asia will be liberated because of the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Here are a few things to tell our Party comrades:

First, the East Asian League Movement and the New Life Movement were initiated by our Party comrades. One focuses on external unity and the other focuses on internal reform. Both originate from the same starting point and aim to achieve a common goal. Now that we have entered the period of participation in the war, all our comrades should know that the East Asian League is the ideal organization for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the New Life Movement is the necessary condition for China to obtain the qualifications to share the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. They should be based on the spirit of working hard and setting an example, leading the people. All our comrades should know the meaning of "those who teach by example will be followed." The implementation of the Outline of the New Life Movement does not depend on words but on deeds. The Premier once painfully defended its falsehood: "Knowing is not difficult, but doing is difficult." Therefore, all our comrades should be in awe.

Second, when the friendly nation of Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, it took on the front line alone, causing the Anglo-American forces to be shattered. How much can China, after its exhaustion, contribute to the Greater East Asia War? This is what our Party comrades should deeply consider. However, the friendly nation of Japan not only supports China's participation in the war, but also provides assistance to China when it participates in the war, so that it can independently enter the realm of independence and autonomy. There is no other reason than to unite the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War and enable the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to be realized. China, here, only has the purpose of sharing weal and woe, living and dying together, and practicing it vigorously. Only by sharing weal and woe together can we turn bitterness into sweetness. Only by living and dying together can we survive in death. From now on, the relationship between China and Japan will become even closer. The nations of Manchukuo and Thailand are common builders of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The nations of Germany and Italy are common creators of the new world order. Recently, Italy and Japan have taken the same steps to assist China, returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. All our comrades should redouble their efforts for this kind of profound friendship and generous act in order to consolidate the East Asia Axis and the World Axis.

Third, for a hundred years, Anglo-American forces have been deeply rooted in people's hearts. It is not only the oppression and exploitation in politics, military affairs, and economics, but also the cultural anesthesia, which is even more poisonous and harmful. China's participation in the war is not only to eliminate the tyrannical forces of the Anglo-Americans in form, but also to fundamentally eradicate the anesthesia of the Anglo-Americans in psychology. All our comrades should follow the principle of "attacking the heart is the best strategy" so that all attempts to sow discord and divide East Asia will have no way to proceed. Only then can the unity of East Asia be guaranteed.

Fourth, the above three points are based on principles. As for specific methods, we should take the military point of view. The significance of the Greater East Asia War should be popularized and deepened. Productivity should be increased, and all production factors should have a surplus for reproduction. Security should be strengthened. This is the greatest policy of administration and economy, and also the greatest purpose of the military. All our comrades should first concentrate their efforts on this, so that their mental and material strength will not be wasted.

Fifth, it is true that a small number of people in Chongqing are obsessed, but most people are still stuck in the middle of wandering and watching. All our comrades should no longer be tolerant of the small number of people who are obsessed, but for the majority, they should understand the crux of the problem and strive to establish a model of peace and a model of East Asian co-prosperity to increase their belief in us. Then, their internal conversion can be counted on the days. The way to promote comprehensive peace lies in this.

The above five points are the main points. All our comrades, if they want to practice them, should first examine their own organizational and training capabilities, and especially examine their inner hearts. The purity of the inner heart is the source of courage. The courage is unyielding, the spirit is more and more used, and the wisdom is more and more clear. The great achievement is achieved. The good or bad of politics depends on the tension and slackness of party affairs. The praise of party affairs depends on the purity of the inner heart. Today's affairs cannot be made safe and stable and saved from danger and survival if the country and the nation are not contributed with the purest and most sincere mental and material strength. The guidance and encouragement of the people of the country is only in our Party. All our comrades, the relationship is great and the responsibility is heavy. Is the Republic of China cut off by our Party itself, or is it saved by our Party itself? Can the Republic of China fulfill its responsibility as a member of East Asia and share the safety and danger of East Asia, or will it be alienated from East Asia? In a word, it depends on how our Party works. The spirit of the Premier in heaven is really something to rely on. All our comrades, work hard and don't neglect it.

### Vice President Zhou Gave a Broadcast Last Night: "Clarifying Questions about China's Participation in the War"

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) Zhou, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, gave a broadcast in Nanjing on the evening of the 15th, entitled "Clarifying Questions about China's Participation in the War." The main points are as follows: The National Government has already declared war on Britain and the United States on the 9th of this month. Compatriots all over the country should be of one heart and one mind, be diligent and courageous, and cooperate with friendly nations to win the final victory. However, as far as I know, some people still have many doubts and misunderstandings about China's participation in the war. I will now list them one by one for explanation and clarification. First, some people think that China's participation in the war is forced by the friendly nation of Japan and has to be implemented. This conjecture is completely wrong. Second, some people think that if China participates in the war, the burden will be heavier and the people will suffer more. This is also a rash talk that does not understand the facts and does not understand the benefits. If we cannot enjoy the harvest of the victorious country with the status of a belligerent country, we will still have to bear the same burden and the same suffering. What are we doing for? Therefore, participating in the war is absolutely beneficial to China. Third, some people think that Britain and the United States will definitely win in the future. Why should we get involved in the whirlpool and perish with them in the future? This argument is even more wrong. Can Britain and the United States win? I dare say that they do not have this certainty. In terms of military affairs, the strategic points of the Pacific have been occupied by the friendly forces. In terms of resources, the gasoline that the United States is proud of already has a very rich source of rice in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, the military resources such as rubber and tin that the United States has always relied on the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can no longer be imported to the United States. Therefore, the final victory of Britain and the United States is absolutely uncertain. What are we afraid of? Fourth, some people think that if China participates in the war, Japan will take the name of joint operations to impose great restrictions on China's sovereignty. This is completely an unfounded worry that obliterates the facts. Fifth, some people think that the purpose of the peace movement is to seek comprehensive peace. If China participates in the war, will it not close the door to comprehensive peace? This argument is really very shallow. We want to achieve comprehensive peace, there is only one way, and that is to quickly defeat the Anglo-Americans, defeat the Anglo-Americans who bind Chongqing and do not allow him to engage in comprehensive peace. Sixth, some people think that if Japan wins, China will be even more in trouble. Why should we participate in the war to help him win? This doubt is answered in two points: (1) Japan did not ask China to participate in the war. China participated in the war voluntarily. This is enough to prove that Japan has long been prepared to fight alone to win the victory. (2) Japan's final and complete victory is only beneficial to China and will never be harmful. Seventh, some people think that after participating in the war, we will have to draw conscripts, restrict withdrawals, economic controls will be more stringent, and production will be more depressed. These concerns are also unnecessary. The above explanations are given for all kinds of doubtful psychology and arguments one by one. What I said is not at all sophistry, but is completely based on facts. Since there is nothing to worry about in participating in the war, everyone should do their best and unite as one to complete the final victory with all their strength. Britain and the United States said this year is the year of counterattack. We will use facts to shatter their dream of counterattack.

### The North African Eastern Front Is Brewing Important Developments; The British Eighth Army Is Preparing to Launch Again; Rommel's Troops Are on High Alert

Xiongcheng, 15th (Allied News Agency) Berlin officials reported that British General Montgomery will launch a new attack on the Axis powers in the next few days. It is reported that General Montgomery has the 41st and 44th Infantry Divisions stationed on the coastal highway, supplemented by the British 10th Tank Division to the south. According to German reconnaissance, there are five divisions to the south, including two tank divisions, supported by two reserve divisions.

The enemy forces in Tunisia attacked with heavy troops, but were all repelled.

Capital of Switzerland, 14th (Havas News Agency) There was no major activity on the Tunisian front yesterday. However, judging from the news from both Britain and Germany, the Tripoli-Darnah front on the eastern front is clearly brewing important developments. As far as the battle situation in Tunisia is concerned, apart from air battles, there were only slight skirmishes between the German army and the French separatist forces west of Kairouan. According to Axis sources, the British Eighth Army is now preparing to launch again. A major battle east of Misurata may break out at any time.

### Japanese Garrison in China Announces Weekly Battle Report

Nanjing, 15th - Central News Agency: The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced a weekly battle report on January 15, stating that in the third Shandong operation that began in late November last year, 8,000 prisoners were captured, and the Communist forces in Jiaodong are on the verge of collapse. The Japanese army launched a campaign to annihilate the main force of the 171st Division of the Chongqing army, which was stirring up trouble in the Lujiang area of Anhui Province, on the 6th. Through close cooperation with the artillery, the Chongqing army, which put up stubborn resistance, was completely surrounded and annihilated. On a certain day, they occupied its important strategic point, Tuogao. They also braved the severe cold wind and snow to fight against the Chongqing army in the Dabie Mountains area under the command of Li Zongren of the Fifth War Zone, and completely destroyed the main strongholds of the Chongqing army. So far, about 6,500 Chongqing soldiers have been killed and about 1,500 captured. On January 10, Chongqing's air force attacked Jingmen in western Hubei with six P-40 aircraft, and two of them were shot down by the accurate ground artillery fire of the Japanese army. Also, January 9 was the day the National Government participated in the war, and at the same time, the Japanese side specially returned the concessions to China and abolished extraterritorial rights. As a result, the Chongqing side has completely lost its ability to resist. Furthermore, because the Japanese army has launched vigorous annihilation campaigns in various places, Chongqing's predicament has reached its final stage and entered a dead end.

### Foreign Minister Chu Issues Statement, Saying China is Defending Japan's Rear, Denies Rumors of Sino-Japanese Military Alliance, Japan Will First Return the Tianjin and Hankou Concessions

Nanjing, 15th - Reuter: Foreign Minister Chu Minyi told Reuter reporter Trentel today that all of East Asia has now declared war on Britain and the United States. China's participation in the war is only fulfilling its obligations to other East Asian countries. Japan has achieved successive victories last year, which has enabled it to take on the task of defending Japan's rear. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, China has been preparing for military mobilization. Japan can withdraw its troops from certain areas and be replaced by properly trained Chinese troops. The rumor that China and Japan are negotiating a military alliance is not true, but the relationship between the two countries has become closer than before. Regarding the disposal of enemy assets and all treaties concluded with Britain and the United States, they have lost their effectiveness. The disposal of enemy assets will be handled by a joint Sino-Japanese committee, and the treatment of enemy nationals will be entirely in accordance with international law. Regarding the return of concessions, Japan will first return the Hankou and Tianjin concessions, and then the Shanghai and Xiamen concessions. Finally, Foreign Minister Chu commented on Sino-German relations, saying that Stahmer has been the German ambassador to China for a year now. Although Sino-German relations have greatly improved, it is truly regrettable that Stahmer is being transferred to Tokyo. When I was previously the ambassador to Japan, I met Dr. Kordt, who has now been transferred to China as the German Chargé d'Affaires. Dr. Kordt is also very interested in Chinese affairs.

Nanjing, 15th - Central News Agency: Regarding Italy's return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, Foreign Minister Chu decided to personally go to the Italian Embassy at 9:00 AM this morning on behalf of the government to express his gratitude.

### Ningxia Travelogue (Continued) Northwest Plateau is Barren and Desolate, Green Fields at the Foot of Helan Mountain

Entering a Smooth Road

After leaving Tongxin City, the road became relatively flat and easy to travel. The car drove through a wilderness between two mountains, with no cultivated land in sight. The wilderness was only covered with clumps of grass. The areas with clumps of grass were relatively high, making the plain look like leprosy. The color of the mountains here turned iron-blue, with many uneven edges and corners, showing that the soil quality was somewhat different from before. There were no trees or water to be seen. Only near the town of Zhongning County did green trees appear beside the villages. The wolfberry trees, which had shed their leaves, were planted in the fields like cultivated seedlings. The flowing water of the Tongji Canal was also seen. The scenery outside Zhongning City was somewhat like the outskirts of Xi'an, but the city was not lively. The county government had sent people to greet us at the city gate and took us to two restaurants for breakfast. Wolfberry is a local specialty, and people were carrying it on the streets to sell. It is said that eighty yuan could buy a liter. After breakfast, we left Zhongning. The young trees along the road were protected by enclosures made of earthen bricks more than two feet high, which shows the local efforts to cultivate roadside trees. You could see people planting wolfberry nurseries next to their houses along the way. The shape of the trees looked a bit like small, gnarled pine trees. We encountered more flocks of sheep than before. When the car passed, the lambs were startled and ran away, their fat bodies appearing unsteady.

Arriving in Ningxia

At around 3:00 PM, we arrived at Tongxin City, the first county within Ningxia, 79 kilometers away from Zhongning. It was not easy to get there that day, so we decided to rest in Tongxin City. This was a very desolate city, without city walls, only a main street. The so-called main street was quite deserted. We didn't seem to see a southern shop selling cloth. When the car stopped, a large group of bearded men in sheepskin jackets curiously surrounded us, while women were peeking from the cracks in the doors. We went straight to the "Ningxia Provincial Government" guest house, because we definitely couldn't find any other accommodation. Although we only got a few empty rooms with ten bunks in the guest house, we received warm hospitality. From their conversations, we learned that the city was also called Banchengzi (Half City), because an earthquake had submerged half of the city a long time ago. Now the entire county has only more than 37,000 people, with only more than 2,000 people in the city. Muslims account for more than 90% of the total population. There are also as many as five mosques, which are led by them. We visited one or two mosques, one was an old-style temple, and the other was a new-style temple. It is said that there is also a new-new style. Both temples were quite grand and magnificent. In such a desolate and poor place, there are such beautiful temples. What other reason can be said besides the piety of the believers? It is said that old-style religious followers have to go to the temple to worship five times a day, each time for at least forty minutes. Except for the elderly, people under middle age probably cannot fully do so because of work. The old-style religious rules are relatively strict. Followers are not allowed to drink, smoke, or watch plays. Women are not allowed to wear new-style clothes. New-style religious followers do not have so many restrictions. Dinner was hosted by the county government. The water we drank had a slightly salty and bitter taste because the soil here contains many salt and halogen components. Locals often store rainwater to drink a little fresh water.

At noon, we arrived at the Yellow River and entered the Qingtong Gorge. The Yellow River is sandwiched between two mountains, with a width of less than a kilometer in the middle. The road the car passed through was opened along the rocky mountains from the 24th to 25th year of the Republic of China (1935-1936), with a total length of about a dozen kilometers. The project was not very small. On the east bank of the gorge, there are place names such as Xixin Spring, Erdao Gully, and Sandao Gully. On the west bank, there are small fortresses made of white and grayish-white plastic. It is said to be Mu Guiying's Tianmen Formation, with a total of one hundred and eight formations, arranged like upside-down pagodas. At the mouth of the gorge, there are dams of the Qin Canal, Han Canal, and Tang Canal. On the dams, there are stone steles with inscriptions of each canal and the inscription of Chairman Ma Hongkui opening the Qingtong Gorge Highway. After exiting the gorge, the scenery is completely different from before. You can see green fields and fragrant trees, showing the benefits of canal irrigation. Soon we arrived at the city of Jinji County. Because we planned to go to the provincial capital according to the schedule, we left in a hurry. In the southern basin of Ningxia, in poor places, without local hospitality, food and accommodation may sometimes be a problem.

Ningxia Snippets

At 2:30 PM, we arrived at Wuzhong Fort. Although this place is a town, it has become the commercial center of Ningxia in terms of economy. People generally call it "the Shanghai of Ningxia," and its development has only been in recent years. Ningxia's donations and taxes are allocated based on the size of the region, and there are many wealthy merchants here, which has created its special prosperity. The area of the market does not seem to be very large, but the houses are all Western-style buildings made of fire bricks, and the streets are wide, with green willows growing on both sides, which is very neat and beautiful. The fields outside the town are lush and full of vitality. After walking through desolate places for a few days, it felt like seeing a miracle. Unfortunately, in order to hurry, the car left without stopping. More than an hour later, we arrived at the Yellow River bank. The river water here does not seem to be as rapid as the Jialing River. But because it completely relies on manpower to support the crossing, it also took a bit of time. By the time we reached the other side, it was almost dusk. Before we arrived at the provincial capital, it was already dark. In the dimness, we seemed to see fragrant trees and flowing water, and earthen houses and cultivated land. After a while, the moon rose, huge like a wheel, and the river was like rouge, projecting into the water, which was even more beautiful. We arrived at the provincial capital at 8:00 PM. Walking into the outer gate, we still had to go through another city gate. The streets seemed very wide, and the electric lights emitted a not very bright light. We were led to the guest house—Yinchuan Hotel.

We stayed in the provincial capital for five whole days. Prices here are still cheap.

However, the commerce here is very depressed, probably because the population is only two or three hundred thousand, the consumption capacity is weak, and the external transportation is not very convenient. But the city is quite neat and clean. Although the shops are not Western-style buildings, they have a uniform style. These words neat and clean can really be applied in many places in Ningxia.

Those who have read Yue Fei's "Manjianghong" should have a deep image of the Helan Mountains. When we arrived in Ningxia, the mountain range stretching across the horizon that we saw was the Helan Mountains, only forty kilometers away from Ningxia. We originally planned to take a car to play for a day, but we stopped it because a wind was blowing on the scheduled day. When I think about this in the future, I will definitely feel deep regret.

### Nanshi to Implement Sugar Rationing Next Month, Plan for Rationing Sugar by Population Determined, Prices to be Announced in Advance Monthly, Sugar Purchase Certificates Must Be Stamped with Head of Household's Seal

The serious situation of sugar in this city has not yet been completely resolved. Therefore, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has adopted a method of rationing sugar by population in order to make it universal and eliminate the threat of sugar. It is scheduled to be implemented in the Nanshi area starting next month. The details are as follows:

The method of rationing sugar by population, based on the Baojia system, is scheduled to be implemented in the Nanshi area starting next month. The Baojia system is the basis for handling sugar rationing. All application forms for sugar rations and simplified sugar rationing regulations for Nanshi households have been printed. The Cooperative Business Office specially submitted them to the Municipal Police Headquarters yesterday, requesting that each Fang Public Office be instructed to fill in the correct household population figures and send them by the 20th of this month.

The entire city, including the concessions, will implement sugar rationing. Although sugar rationing will be implemented in Nanshi first, the scope of sugar rationing will include the two concessions, Hongkou, Huxi, Zhabei and other areas. The population in each area is stipulated to be in units of Jia. The Jia heads will fill in the application forms for sugar rations for each household in the Jia, with one original and two copies, and each household head will affix a seal to be used as a basis for allocation. If there are any changes in the household population, the Jia heads will notify the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office before the 15th of each month for adjustment.

One sugar certificate will be issued per person. Regarding the sugar rationing, it has been decided that it will be given once a month, with one sugar purchase certificate issued per person. The Jia heads will distribute the certificates to each household. If there are attached households, the household heads will distribute them to each attached household. They must not make things difficult for any reason. Those who violate this will be punished by the relevant authorities. The allocation of sugar will be based on the sufficient balance of 16 taels per person. Sugar is divided into three types: green sugar, red sugar, and white sugar, which can be sold together at any time. The amount and price of sugar allocated per person each time will be announced by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office in various newspapers in the city on the first day of each month for universal knowledge in order to prevent fraud.

Citizens are not forced to purchase sugar. The procedures for citizens to purchase sugar have also been determined by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office. Citizens are not forced to purchase sugar after obtaining the issued sugar purchase certificate. If they need to purchase sugar, they can fill in the Baojia to which they belong on the back of the certificate, then affix the original seal of the household head, bring sugar containers, and take the certificate to the designated retail sugar merchant for purchase. However, the retail merchant must verify that the seal matches before allowing the purchase. In addition to filling in the Baojia to which they belong on the back of the sugar certificate, attached households must also have the seal of the household head affixed. The household heads must not refuse or make things difficult. The validity period of the sugar certificate is stipulated to be limited to 4:00 PM on the last day of each month. It will be invalidated after the deadline. If it is lost, it will not be reissued.

Those who disrupt control will be severely punished. The retail sugar merchants who sell sugar have been designated by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office and have been assigned numbers. The numbers and locations of the retail merchants are marked in front of each retail merchant's store, and the office will print and send them to the Jia heads for safekeeping. Citizens can inquire with the Jia heads at any time for purchase. At the same time, in order to effectively prevent retail sugar merchants from committing fraud and seeking profit, if there is any situation of exceeding the price limit, deducting the amount, or mixing, the sugar purchaser can report it to the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office at any time, and the authorities will be requested to severely punish them for the crime of disrupting control. Those who forge sugar purchase certificates will also be dealt with in the same way if they are found.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Controls Goods, Maintains Normal Supply, Prices Based on Legal Profits, Considers Both Businessmen's and Citizens' Interests

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's Goods Control Department separated from the General Office on January 1 this year and became an independent institution, its internal organization has been greatly expanded. The number of working staff has increased from the initial 12 to more than 100. The current system is divided into four sections: cost accounting and investigation, price limit execution, goods supply, and guilds. The cost accounting and investigation section specializes in evaluating standard research. The price limit execution section sends staff to various stores every day to investigate business and pricing conditions. If any violations of price limits are found, they will be punished. The goods supply section is responsible for the supply of food and other items. The guild section specializes in contacting various trade guilds in the city to provide considerable guidance and assistance for evaluation and allocation matters.

Actively Adopts Low-Price Policy Because the scope of work is expanding and the nature of the work is becoming more complex, the Goods Control Department has had to improve the city's overall price and goods situation based on the most basic policies. In terms of controlling prices, it actively adopts a low-price policy, but only to the extent that it does not hinder the legitimate and legal interests of all industries. If an industry has a situation where it is necessary to revise prices based on actual reasons, it will be given more favorable consideration upon application. However, the price control authorities also take into account the interests of general consumers and do not allow them to suffer undue losses due to price increases. In terms of goods control, the problem is not as simple as price limits. To control the distribution of goods, it is necessary to first grasp the source of the goods. In the current environment, although the possibility of difficulties is greater, the Shanghai Municipal Council will do its best to maintain the normal state of goods supply.

Communicating Official-Business Cooperation and Implementation Among the various sections of the Goods Control Department, the one with the shortest establishment history but the most responsibility is the guild section. Currently, among the trade guilds in the city, there are more than 300 units that have registered with the Police Department and have close contact with this section. Whenever various industries intend to revise prices or need to obtain sources of goods, they can apply to this section for consideration by the highest authorities of the Goods Control Department. The purpose of establishing this section is to communicate the relationship between the Shanghai Municipal Council and various industries. When various industries have difficulties, the guild section tries its best to solve them. When the Shanghai Municipal Council implements any price policy, various industries assist and cooperate in its implementation. In terms of internal organization, the guild section is divided into investigation, review, and supervision sections. The work of each section is closely related to the implementation of contacting various industries and communicating official-business. The person in charge is currently Mr. Sheng Yuqi.

### Central Market Project Abolishes Middlemen to Suppress Vegetable Prices

Allied News Agency, this port, according to a report in the Continental News last night (Friday night), in order to suppress the cost of living for Shanghai citizens, the Central Market of Shanghai Special Municipality has planned to improve. One of the main reforms is to abolish the middlemen who hinder transactions. The Central Market Planning Committee, which investigates the prices and costs of goods from north and south of the Yangtze River, pointed out that the reason for the high prices of vegetables and daily necessities is the monopoly of middlemen.

### Anti-British and American Association Broadcasts Tonight

In order to clarify the significance of the government's participation in the war this time and to enable the public to fully understand, the Shanghai Radio Station in this city is scheduled to invite the Anti-British and American Association of the Chinese Nation to host a radio speech starting at 9:30 tonight (16th). Tonight, the Propaganda Department of the Association and Mr. Chen Binhe, advisor to the Association, will speak on the topic "The Obligations that Citizens Should Fulfill After Participating in the War." There should be a detailed exposition of the responsibilities of the people in wartime.

### Hankou Branch of Bank of Communications and Central Bank Scheduled to Reopen Tomorrow

In order to revitalize finance in the Wuhan area, the financial authorities of this city have formed a reopening committee for the Hankou branch of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank. According to a reporter from the Commercial News Agency, the Hankou branch of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank is scheduled to reopen on the 17th of this month and will officially begin operations on the 18th.

### Prevent Remittances to Guangzhou, Cash Buying

In order to facilitate the transfer of funds from various places, after the Central Reserve Bank reduced the exchange rate for remittances from Shanghai to various places, various circles have been eager to entrust the bank to remit funds. Therefore, the bank's remittance business has broken historical records in recent times. Among them, the amount remitted to Guangzhou is the largest. Originally, because the price of gold in Guangzhou is currently worth 1,830 to 40 yuan per tael, general speculators in Shanghai have been remitting cash to Guangzhou for cash buying. Now it is learned that the authorities have discovered this matter and believe that this move has a significant impact on finance. Therefore, Japanese banks and the Central Reserve Bank have restricted remittances to Guangzhou, with a maximum remittance of 2,000 yuan each time, and an application must be made.

### Radios with Seven or More Tubes: Deadline for Submission to Purchasing Office, Acquired by Japanese Military

A public notice from the Wireless Radio Supervision Office states, "Regarding the ‘seal’ marked radios (those with seven or more tubes) registered this time at this office and the temporary registration office at 733 Route Pichon in the French Concession, they are now being acquired by the Japanese military. Therefore, all people holding such radios must, according to the number on the upper corner of the registration certificate issued by this office and the designated dates below, send the radio in question, along with the registration certificate from this office and the registration certificate from the former police station (or police bureau), to the purchasing office at 133 Sichuan Road. This is a public notice.

The purchasing office is open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

Those currently applying for permission to continue using their radios will have their applications decided upon within the next few days. Those whose applications are denied must send their radios to the aforementioned office by February 22nd.

From the 18th to the 22nd of this month, 200 numbers will be processed each day, calculated sequentially according to the registration number:

### Generous Donations from Industrial and Commercial Sectors: Sympathy for Impoverished Students. Shen Bao Education Fund Begins Accepting Applications Yesterday. Hundreds of Students Braving the Cold to Await

The fourth session of this newspaper's readers' education fund began accepting applications yesterday. We are deeply moved and encouraged by the enthusiastic donations from all sectors. This newspaper has scheduled a special edition on the education fund for the 17th. Details are as follows:

The plight of students evokes sympathy.  Registration for applications began yesterday. From morning to evening, over a thousand people came to the office to complete the application procedures.  Many were innocent children, thinly dressed, carrying worn-out satchels, enduring tears, waiting to collect registration forms, accounting for six out of ten applicants. This truly fills one with compassion and reinforces the urgency of the education movement. Considering the current balance of the education fund, only over 110,000 yuan remains. Sympathizing with the difficulties of impoverished students, we cannot but place high hopes on the generous donations from all sectors of society. The staff of this newspaper humbly hope to exert all their strength to gather donations. Once collected, we will announce the total amount donated. Even a drop in the bucket is a way to express our sincere wishes. We earnestly hope that all sectors will continue to donate generously to the cause of education.

Heshun Company and others make generous donations.  Yesterday, we received education fund donations from various sectors. Among them, Heshun Company generously donated 5,000 yuan, which is deeply appreciated. The industrial and commercial sectors have consistently supported this newspaper's education movement and will surely rise to the occasion to benefit the students. Furthermore, Mr. Pan Hongyuan came to the office yesterday to subscribe to the newspaper and, witnessing the impoverished students crowding in front of this newspaper's business department to obtain application forms, was moved to compassion and immediately donated 200 yuan. His courageous act of righteousness is commendable. Other individuals also came in person to donate. We thank you on behalf of the impoverished students.

Donations Received Yesterday.  The total education fund donations received yesterday include 5,000 yuan from Heshun Company, 100 yuan from Pan Hongyuan, 35 yuan from China and Foreign Bank, 20 yuan from Mr. Zheng, 10 yuan from Xu Jieyi, 10 yuan from Cao Xigen, and 10 yuan from Li Shushi, totaling 5,285 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Adding the previous balance of 113,323 yuan and 1 jiao, the total balance is 118,608 yuan and 1 jiao in Central Reserve Bank notes.

Many Letters Received from All Sectors Encouraging Us.  In recent days, we have received numerous letters from various sectors encouraging this newspaper's education fund. The committee members of this newspaper's education fund have also sent insightful articles, either urging us on or making appeals. Many students who have received assistance have also sent letters describing their diligent studies over the past semester, seeking to reassure the donors. We have carefully read all the letters and, although we feel limited by space, we wish to select a portion for publication to the public for their perusal. We have decided to publish a special edition of the fourth education fund in the "Free Talk" section on the 17th (Sunday), including a simple statistical summary of the donation amounts and the number of beneficiaries from the previous three sessions. Furthermore, all expenses for documents, paper, and printing incurred in handling the education fund affairs will be borne by this newspaper. Our staff's travel expenses will also not be reimbursed. All donations, even the smallest amounts, bank interest, will be included in the education fund.

Ciyou Association Distributes Winter Clothing to Impoverished Children. The China Ciyou Association is working under extreme pressure to distribute winter clothing due to the continuous cold weather. Applications for winter clothing are being submitted by families for their children. After verification by the association, over 200 pieces of winter clothing have already been distributed. To ensure that impoverished children receive winter clothing as soon as possible, the association has not only sent staff to various impoverished areas for investigation but has also sent letters to various churches in the city to assist in the process, compiling lists of impoverished children and sending them directly to the association by the 25th of this month for coordinated distribution.

### New Shantytowns After the Jinjia Lane Fire in West Shanghai Are Now Completed

In late October last year, no fewer than 3,000 impoverished shantytown residents were affected by the major fire in Jinjia Lane, West Shanghai. Reconstruction was initiated by the Buddhist Benevolent Association, with the enthusiastic assistance of charitable individuals from all sectors.

The completion ceremony is scheduled for 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 17th).

### 4,500 Tons of White Coal Dust Arrive: Spring Rationing Prices Set

Coal is the main fuel for residents of this city. Currently, stockpiles are ample and arrivals are steady. On the 12th, the Portuguese ship "Pulus" arrived in Shanghai, carrying 4,500 tons of white coal dust, a raw material for making coal balls. It is moored at pontoons 9-10 on the Huangpu River, and unloading began yesterday. It is reported that this is an order for a coal ball factory.

Authorities consider coal as important as rice, oil, sugar, and other daily necessities and strictly enforce the rationing system to suppress the black market and protect people's livelihoods. The Dachung Union Coal Company was established as the central distributor. The company allocates coal monthly to the Coal Industry Association (organized by major coal companies with factories and stockpiles), which then allocates to the Coal Retailers Association for sale to citizens. Prices are also set to ensure legitimate profits, and unauthorized price increases are strictly prohibited. This system has been in place for a year, and coal ball fuel sales have remained within price limits, with coal balls still selling for 25 Central Reserve Bank notes per *dan* (擔, load), plus an additional charge for delivery, benefiting the common people considerably. The authorities have set the prices for Spring rationing of coal per ton (from January to March), detailed below:

### 1,305 Bags of Soybeans Ordered

Yesterday, only soybean cakes saw some trading in the miscellaneous grains market. Transactions in other commodities remained stagnant. Two truckloads of Kaiyuanlong soybean cakes were traded at 96.5 yuan to 96.25 yuan, and one truckload of Feizi soybean cakes was traded at 97 yuan. The market initially rose and then stabilized.

It is also reported that the miscellaneous grains group's broad bean distribution is continuing. Furthermore, it is heard that an order has been placed for 1,305 bags of soybeans, which will soon be loaded and shipped to Shanghai.

Due to the recent insufficient supply of soybeans, the tofu industry in this city is facing imminent suspension of operations. Yesterday, a request was submitted again to the authorities, forwarded to the miscellaneous grains group, to expedite the shipment of soybeans to Shanghai and establish distribution points to benefit people's food supply.

### Cotton Fabric Foothold Remains Firm

Yesterday, the cotton fabric market remained optimistic due to the firm foothold (脚地) and continued market confidence. However, there were few transactions. White goods, both coarse and fine fabrics, were offered but not sold. Colored goods, such as *Huahua Nv* (花花女) and *Qilin* (麒麟) cloth, were priced at 375 yuan, and *Chuji Shilin* (雏鸡士林) cloth was also sold at the same price. *Sanyang Piqi* (三羊哔叽) was priced at 8 yuan, and *Sijunzi Piqi* (四君子哔叽) red bills rose from 9.1 yuan to a high of 9.35 yuan, with bids at 9.2 yuan at noon. Bank bills were at 9.5 yuan, and spot goods were bid at 9.6 yuan.

### Black Iron Blanks Scarce, Expensive and Sought After

Yesterday, trading in 2,000-pound black iron blanks was lively due to demand from local thermos flask factories, printing factories, and machine factories. The inventory of this commodity in Shanghai is low, making procurement difficult for buyers. As a result, dealers with limited inventory are unusually confident, and prices continue to rise. Currently, 2,000-pound bundles of original black iron blanks are selling for 16,000 yuan per bundle, 200-pound goods are selling for 1,600 yuan per case, and retail sales range from 10 yuan to 12 yuan per pound. 20-gauge black iron scrap is 16,000 yuan per ton, and 12 to 14-gauge patterned scrap is quoted at around 14,500 yuan per ton.

### Cigarette Hoarders Maintain Prices

The cigarette market remains strong due to the stimulation of tax increases. As a result, holders are unwilling to sell at reasonable prices to await higher prices. Yesterday, Big Ben was priced at 10,600 yuan, and then rose by 100 yuan. Old Knife was at 9,500 yuan, Pinhai at 7,800 yuan, Fairy at 7,850 yuan, Wuhua at 6,700 yuan, Japanese Golden Gun at 3,200 yuan, Golden Building at 3,700 yuan, Red Rose at 2,750 yuan, Quanlu at 3,400 yuan, 20-Stick at 3,250 yuan, Compass at 2,890 yuan, National Gold Mouse at 4,200 yuan, Beauty at 5,600 yuan, White Gold Dragon at 4,100 yuan, and Golden Dragon at 3,000 yuan.

### Soap Prices Keep Rising

The market for daily necessities, such as soap, is seeing price increases. Solid "Ben" soap is priced at $620, White "Xiangmao" soap at $980, Yellow "Xiangmao" soap at $530, "Scissors" soap at $600, White "Reiss" candles at $580, and "Monk's Cap" brand at $540. Matchsticks continue to be rationed, with the price remaining at 340 military notes. Therefore, yesterday's quoted prices were $3300 for "Phoenix" brand and $3500 for "Beautiful" brand. The market trend is firm.

### A Record of Prince Zhong, Li Xiucheng (Part 1)

— Fu

When speaking of the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the ones who inspire me the most are Prince Yi, Shi Dakai, and Prince Zhong, Li Xiucheng. Xiucheng found himself in a suspicious court, bearing the heavy responsibility of the military and the state alone. Externally, he faced strong enemies, and internally, he suffered slander from petty people. In the end, he was able to sacrifice himself for his country and perish with Nanjing. His spirit of loyalty and righteousness is commendable. Compared to Wen Tianxiang's loyalty to the Song Dynasty and Shi Kefa's loyalty to the Ming Dynasty, he is no less worthy. No wonder that after the city fell and he was captured, Zeng Guofan treated him with special courtesy. And when he faced death, the residents of Nanjing set up sacrifices and tens of thousands of households mourned. Liang Qichao once commented on Xiucheng, saying: "Li Xiucheng is truly a hero! At a time of crisis, when the entire city was on the verge of survival, he was still able to command thousands of brave soldiers to break through and fight, nearly annihilating the enemy... And after the city was captured, he was able to save the young prince with his beloved horse and bravely chose to die, with the determination to perish with the state. How can even the great ministers and Confucian generals of ancient times surpass him? Xiang Yu's crows did not fly away, and Wen Tianxiang's lacquer treasure was not effective. Is it fate? Is it human?" After reading these words, I think anyone would shed a tear of admiration for Xiucheng.

Xiucheng initially joined the Taiping army as a mere foot soldier in the front lines. His father was still serving as a cook. It was only after the Taiping captured Yong'an that he was promoted to Er Sima for his merits. Because he was naturally studious and liked to ask for books, he would often read them when he was waiting for dawn with his weapons. This violated the Taiping ban, and he was to be punished. If the Qing army had not captured Yong'an and released him as a prisoner, he might have become an unknown sacrifice under his own steel blade. Not only would his talent and achievements never have been displayed, but the latter half of the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom would have been obscure and uninteresting.

When Xiucheng was captured, Zeng Guoquan wanted to imprison him, but Guofan refused, saying: "This man has kept many officials of our dynasty alive. We must not show narrow-mindedness and be ridiculed by others." Therefore, he hosted banquets every day, treating him as a guest with great generosity. This does not show Guofan's generosity, but rather is a powerful illustration of how deeply Xiucheng moved him. The banner of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was to overthrow the Tartars and restore the old ways. Its officials and ministers naturally regarded all Qing officials as enemies without any leniency. However, once Xiucheng had been disarmed, he forbade killing, treating all, whether Manchu officials or Manchu soldiers, equally with courtesy. Among the Taiping generals, besides the magnanimous Shi Dakai, it seems that only Xiucheng could do this. For example, he respectfully buried Wang Youling, the governor of Zhejiang, and the fierce general Zhang Guoliang. He sent personnel to escort Zhang Xigeng, the educational commissioner, Wen Rui, the commander-in-chief, and Lin Fuxiang, the retired provincial administration commissioner, out of the territory, and provided them with travel expenses. He generously treated 50,000 to 60,000 surrendered soldiers in Suzhou, all of which showed his magnanimity. No wonder Liang Qichao praised him for "having the intention of wartime civilized national law." As for Zhao Jingxian being captured and cursing and begging for a quick death, Tan Shaoxi could not bear it and shot him through the chest. Xiucheng even wanted to kill Shaoxi to warn the public, which was even more commendable.

### Second Place in Essay Contest: My Plans for This Year

— Jia Suixiang

I am already over sixty years old, an old pearl of little value. This is my true situation, so why should I take up a brush and compete with young and middle-aged people in the literary arena? However, "it is never too late to learn," and "how can one know the aspirations of an old man?" These two famous sayings from Wang Zian of ancient times are enough to inspire me. So, when I received this topic, I couldn't help but feel excited. Now, I will briefly write down my plans as my contribution to this year's writing.

A. Plans Regarding Education

(1) Continue Teaching Chinese Literature: I have been teaching Chinese literature at Datong Middle School for nearly thirty years. I have always focused on lectures and dare not be perfunctory in the slightest. Starting this year, I will continue to teach Chinese literature and plan to have students focus on reciting and explaining, so that they can thoroughly understand the meaning of the books. If they can understand Chinese literature, other subjects such as history, geography, biology, and civics can also be solved easily.

(2) Compile Textbooks: Since last year, history textbooks for middle schools have been rarely sold by bookstores, making it difficult to teach history in middle schools. Starting this year, I plan to compile this textbook and have it mimeographed for use in class, so that both teachers and students will be spared the problem of having classes without textbooks.

(3) Supplement Dictionaries: Dictionaries are essential reference books for the study of Chinese culture. The current popular versions, such as "Ciyuan" and "Cihai," still have omissions and deficiencies, making them feel insufficient for use. Starting this year, I plan to collect the terms omitted from the dictionaries, add explanations, and create a supplement to the dictionaries, which may be of some small help for the study of Chinese culture.

B. Plans Regarding Charity

(1) Try My Best to Design: I have been serving as a director of charitable organizations for more than thirty years. I am currently in charge of the design group. Although it costs me food and effort, and I don't seem to have much power, I enjoy it and am willing to do my best to fulfill my obligations. I feel that the most urgent problem that the charitable organization I am currently working for needs to solve is the issue of providing coffins. Now, a coffin costs at least around 200 yuan, which is difficult for charitable organizations to sustain. My design is to request that all roadside corpses be exempt from coffin burials and be directly buried in the ground. This method was implemented five years ago when the burial team was established. If we can follow suit now, the coffin problem can be solved.

(2) Encourage the Donation of Winter Clothing: The most important work of charitable organizations throughout the year is winter relief. Part of the winter relief work is clothing distribution. It is currently the beginning of the year, and it seems too early to talk about clothing distribution since it is still far from the winter relief campaign. However, being prepared is better than digging a well when thirsty. Moreover, purchasing winter clothing in the spring and summer will definitely be cheaper than purchasing it temporarily. I plan to take on this fundraising work and focus on it in the spring and summer, so that donors can be happy to donate clothing at a lower purchase price. This is the idea of ​​merchants stocking up on furs in the summer, so that they can avoid the situation of difficulty in fundraising when winter is approaching and the price of winter clothing rises.

C. Plans Regarding Life

(1) Save on Rice Consumption: My family has no permanent property. Since rice has become expensive, there has been a problem with three meals a day. In recent months, although we have household rice to receive, the ten days' worth of grain we receive is only enough for five days' worth of food. The remaining rice we need to purchase ourselves, and the purchase price is about three times higher than the household rice. This situation is really difficult for me to sustain. Now, in order to save money, I have decided that starting this year, I will cook porridge and rice every day, using half rice and half grains. The price of grains is more expensive than household rice, but cheaper than the rice sold in the market. If we continue to support ourselves in this way, my family of eight may be able to avoid starvation.

(2) Economize on Practical Use: My miscellaneous expenses, which are related to hobbies, such as cigarettes, cost about 50 yuan per month; entertainment, such as watching movies, costs about 20 yuan per month; watching operas costs about 30 yuan per month; and shared meals cost about 40 yuan per month. Now I plan to economize on all of the above four miscellaneous expenses, saving to the point of not spending a single penny. Perhaps my life can be a little more spacious.

(3) Frugally Maintain Marriage Affairs: My fourth daughter will be getting married soon. I have decided to practice frugality in this extraordinary period, not publishing announcements in the newspaper, not distributing [marriage] cakes, and not being extravagant with the dowry or the wedding feast. Everything else will also be based on frugality, so that my life will not be affected in any way.

(4) Run a Store: I am not a capitalist, so I cannot run a business, but raising 1,000 to 2,000 yuan of capital to run a small store is still possible. I will ask my wife to be the assistant manager of this store, specializing in selling several kinds of cooked foods (such as bean porridge, wontons, and zongzi) in order to earn a small profit, so that my life can be slightly subsidized. In the past, Duke Tai sold meals and Zhao Qi sold cakes, which were passed down in books as beautiful stories. My intention to open a small store is to sell meals and cakes. If this plan succeeds, my life problems can also be solved.

(5) Sell Writings: In the past, Sima Xiangru's fu was sold to the Empress of the Han Palace, and Bai Juyi's poems were sold to the merchants of Gyerim. It was common for poor scholars to make a living by selling their writings. In the past, I did not charge for writing for others, but starting this year, for the sake of life, I will set a fixed price, with prose being cheaper and parallel prose being more expensive. Whether it is prefaces, inscriptions, eulogies, poems, lyrics, or couplets, I will charge according to the price list. In this way, I can get some small help with my life.

The above lists a total of three items regarding education plans; a total of two items regarding charitable plans; and a total of five items regarding life plans. In my opinion, it is still easy and simple; in terms of my ability, it is not difficult to implement. However, it is not difficult to say, but it is difficult to do. I don't find it difficult to write this essay, but I find it a bit difficult to put this essay into practice. I hope that things are done by people, and I can work hard to achieve it, so that by the end of the year, forty to fifty percent of my plans can be put into practice.

(Note: Mr. Jia is sixty-one years old and a teacher at Minli Women's Middle School)

### Teacher for All Ages

— written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin Tan

But most notable was the transformative work she did on Chips. Before his marriage, he was a dry and somewhat indifferent person; he was liked by the masses at Brookfield and considered a good man, but he was not a person who was very popular and aroused great love. He had been at Brookfield for more than twenty-five years, and the length of time was enough to make him a reasonably good partner, a hard worker; but for too long, no one would believe that he could make any more progress. In fact, he had already begun to decay, and this decay was gradually cultivated by the dry teaching method, which is the worst and last pitfall in this profession; teaching the same lessons every year, life is like a stereotype, and other things fall into this stereotype and adjust themselves, becoming unhurried. He worked well; he was conscientious; he was a service, a satisfaction, a trust, and everything, but he lacked inspiration.

Finally, this surprisingly youthful wife came along, whom no one had expected - especially Chips himself. She made him a new person in the eyes of everyone; although most of this "newness" was just a restoration of warmth and vitality to various things, these various things were aging, confined, and unexpected. There was a light in his eyes; his mind, if not exceptionally prepared in the first place, was certainly properly prepared, and began to move more adventurously. The sense of humor, which he often possessed, also suddenly developed greatly and matured, reducing his age a lot. He began to feel more confident in everything; his discipline improved to a point of not being too strict; he became more popular. When he first came to Brookfield, his goal was to be loved, respected, and obeyed - and to be obeyed anyway. He had indeed obtained obedience, and respect had already been given to him: but love had only come now, which was the students' sudden love for a person who was now amiable, but not weak, and understood them very well, but not too much; his personal happiness and their happiness were linked together.
