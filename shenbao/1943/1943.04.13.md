### Outlook on the Global War Situation

The current focus of the global war situation can generally be said to be the battle in Tunis, North Africa. The enemy, with the British Eighth Army, the American Fifth Army, and the French forces who defected from the Pétain-Laval government, launched a "large-scale offensive" which has been ongoing for three weeks. In terms of the number of soldiers and the equipment, the enemy has an absolute advantage; and it is said that in a few days, the British First Army will also join this war. On the contrary, the Axis forces, under the command of General Rommel and General Arnim, are undoubtedly inferior in strength. However, for several weeks, due to excellent strategy, strong defense lines, and the convenience of communication and supply from places like Sicily, they have been able to persist in counterattacking the British, American, and rebel French forces, step by step preventing their advance. Except for the planned shortening of the defense line in southern Tunisia, the most important positions and areas have remained steadfast. This arduous and outstanding defensive war, in which a small number of troops resists a three-sided siege, can be said to have the same important significance as the Eastern Front's defense of Stalingrad. Due to the German and Italian forces holding fast in Tunis, they have at least achieved the following important gains: First, absorbing a large number of troops that the British and Americans are preparing to counterattack, hindering the realization of their dreamed-of "second front"; second, buying more time to complete and strengthen the defense lines of Italy and the northern coast of the Mediterranean, and the preparations for anti-landing operations on the northwest coast of France and the countries of the North Sea; third, tying down the largest enemy force with the smallest number of troops, so that the German and Italian Allied forces can fight on the Eastern Front without any worries about the West; fourth, maintaining the initiative in the world war, so that they can calmly prepare for the launch of the summer offensive. In one corner of Tunis, the German and Italian forces have diligently completed these four major tasks and are now approaching the decisive battle stage. The guarantee of ultimate victory lies in maintaining the shortest transport line in the Mediterranean—the transport line between Sicily and Bizerte—and in controlling the air. Up to now, we absolutely trust in the superiority of the German and Italian forces in these two aspects.

Due to the unexpectedly slow progress of the enemy's so-called major offensive in Tunis, North Africa, the war on the Eastern Front of Europe has been directly affected in a way that favors the Axis powers. The German and Italian side can gain time to calmly gather reinforcements from Europe, reorganize the front lines, launch an offensive, and regain the initiative temporarily lost in winter. In the Kuban and Donets regions, the battles of the past few weeks have completely changed the face of the German-Soviet war situation since the new year, and even the Soviet Information Bureau had to admit to a "temporary lull" on the German-Soviet front. However, in any case, this front remains the main theater of war in Europe. Before the war in Tunis is concluded, the German and Italian forces have ample time to deploy the initiative and offensive in this theater. The future situation depends on (1) how the Soviet Union handles the situation caused by the winter offensive, how it reorganizes its forces, and the extent and strength of new troop replenishment; (2) to what extent Germany and Italy achieve in concentrating troops and mastering the initiative in air operations; and (3) what is the actual significance of the "second front" that the British and Americans are again clamoring about. From the current actual situation, Germany and Italy maintain an absolute advantage in the second point, and the third point is still just thunder without rain so far. As for the first point, we naturally cannot draw a definite conclusion from scattered telegrams and news, but judging from the fact that the British military delegation has gone to the Soviet Union these days, and that the Soviet Union has agreed to the international economic conference initiated by the United States, it seems that even the Soviet Union itself still lacks sufficient confidence.

Of course, we must not ignore the other aspect of the world war, the Greater East Asia battlefield. However, perhaps everyone can see the situation on this battlefield clearly: the armies of our friendly nation, Japan, have always maintained the initiative and a certain advantage of victory. We can see positive news in the newspapers every day, so there is no need to repeat it here. Let's look at the opposite side of the story. In the Americas, the new Australian Foreign Minister Evatt arrived a few days ago. He is preparing to go to Washington via Argentina to discuss Pacific issues with the US authorities. On the way, he repeatedly made speeches criticizing the policies of Roosevelt and Churchill, fully expressing Australia's concern about the increasingly close Japanese threat. Similarly, the so-called military delegation from Chongqing staying in Britain is also complaining everywhere, just like Soong Tzu-wen and Soong Mei-ling's activities in the United States. All they have received is so-called popular "warm welcomes," while the rescue they are anxiously seeking to save them from danger has been unexpectedly met with indifference. As for the India issue, due to the British authorities' persistent obstinacy and brutal suppression of the Indian people's demands for independence, the situation is becoming increasingly serious. All these new developments in Australia, Chongqing, and India show the bright future of the Axis powers in East Asia. The friendly relations between Japan, China, Manchukuo, and the countries of the South are also developing in an unprecedentedly optimistic atmosphere. The daily victories of the Japanese navy and air force in the Southwest Pacific and the new victories on the India-Burma border will be the prelude to the victory of the Axis powers in the 1943 world war.

### Meeting of Two Major German and Italian Leaders to Discuss Joint Operation Plans and Resolve to Exert All Efforts to Strive for Final Victory

Berlin, November 11 (Central News Agency Telegram) The government announced tonight that Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had met for four days from April 7th to 10th at the Führer's headquarters. This was the seventh meeting of the leaders of the two major Axis powers in Europe since the beginning of the European War. The communique stated that the two sides had discussed in detail the general political situation and all issues related to joint strategy, and had reached complete agreement on the measures to be taken in all aspects. Those who participated in the meeting with the Prime Minister included Italian Army Chief of Staff General Ambrosio, Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini, and officials from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Supreme Command. Hitler's entourage included Marshal Göring, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, German Army Commander Keitel, Navy Commander Dönitz, Army Chief of Staff Zeitzler, as well as German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen and Italian Ambassador to Germany Alfieri. "Regarding the communiqué, the two leaders discussed the general political situation and all issues related to joint strategy, and reached complete agreement on the measures to be taken in all aspects. The German Führer and the Italian also reiterated their determination and the determination of the two peoples to mobilize all their forces to fight until final victory, completely eliminating the future dangers threatening Europe and Africa, whether this danger comes from the West or the East. They also reaffirmed the common goal of the Axis powers to defend European culture and guarantee the free development and mutual cooperation of all countries. The victory of the Tripartite Pact countries will ensure peace in Europe, and all nations will cooperate based on their common interests and the fair distribution of world economic resources. The negotiations between the German Führer and the Italian Prime Minister were conducted in the most sincere spirit," it said.

Berlin, November 12 (Central News Agency Telegram) This meeting between the German and Italian leaders was the seventh major meeting since the outbreak of the war. Regarding this meeting, knowledgeable sources expressed their views as follows: This meeting was a review of the overall political situation and joint strategies on the Axis side, and complete consensus was reached on opinions such as striving to complete the war and upholding European civilization. This meeting has decided to fully mobilize the economic power of the Axis powers, and opinions have also been exchanged on the future organization of Europe. In short, the ultimate goal of the Axis forces is to ensure the fair distribution and abundance of the world's resources and to make the standard of living in Europe safer. The anti-Axis camp has repeatedly discussed post-war strategies recently, but their discussions are only to prevent the free development of small countries and nations in order to cater to the Soviet Union. The Axis powers are now presenting a completely new plan for solving various difficulties in world politics and economy, as well as domestic and social issues in various countries. The purpose of the social and international issues discussed this time can be said to be the construction of pan-Europeanism.

Berlin, November 12 (Central News Agency Telegram) The dramatic meeting between the two major German and Italian leaders began last week at the German Führer's headquarters and lasted for four days.

This conversation began immediately after Mr. Mussolini and his party had unpacked their luggage. In this initial meeting, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini lasted half a day, and the entire Italian delegation attended a banquet hosted by Ribbentrop in the evening. Formal talks were held on the 8th, 9th and 3rd. Because the various military and political issues were extremely complex, they were discussed in groups. The military meetings were generally chaired by Hitler and Mussolini.

Those present on the German side were General Göring, General Keitel, Admiral Dönitz, Air Force Chief of Staff Major General Bodenschatz, General Zeitzler, etc. The political meetings were all presided over by Ribbentrop and Bastianini, and German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen and Italian Ambassador to Germany Alfieri also participated in the meeting.

### The Chongqing Army Around Wuhan Has No Will to Fight; They Have Been Defeated by the Japanese Army Everywhere

### Announcement from the Japanese Imperial Headquarters: War Results in the India-Burma Area

### Macau Correspondence: Qinghai in the Northwest – Rich in Mineral and Forest Resources, An Unexplored Virgin Land

— Jin Yan

"Gold is everywhere in Qinghai." After traveling through some parts of this province, we are even more convinced that the words of our predecessors are not false. However, this is a "virgin land" that has not been developed throughout the country, and it should not remain barren for long.

In terms of its location, Qinghai relies on Xinjiang to the west, is bordered by Mongolia and Tibet on the left and right, connects to Gansu in the northeast, and borders Xikang in the southeast. It is located in the center of the country, surrounded by high mountains and steep ridges. In terms of resources, it is rich in minerals, forests, fisheries, animal husbandry, and water resources. Therefore, it can be said to be an ideal area for future industrial development.

When the reporter arrived in Qinghai, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to go to Dulan to see the Chaka Salt Lake. After crossing Riyue Mountain from Xining, we traveled along the southern shore of Qinghai Lake across a vast grassland. The journey took one and a half days, and we spent one night in a tent in the severe cold of fourteen degrees below zero, eating cold mutton and drinking water boiled with cow dung as fuel. However, it did not diminish our courage to see the salt lake. On the grassland, the car sped like lightning, startling herds of wild horses and rapidly running Tibetan gazelles. In the twilight of the setting sun, we finally saw the jade-like, crystal-clear, and infinitely silver Chaka Salt Lake.

The salt lake is 75 li wide from east to west, 35 li long from north to south, and 175 li in circumference. This vast salt lake is filled with a thick layer of crystals. Although the reserves are so abundant, only 50,000 dan were extracted last year. This is not because the salt extraction method requires any technological improvements. We saw the salt workers using iron spoons to probe the water, placing it on the lake surface and rinsing it once more, and that was the white, high-quality salt. Because this salt belongs to a cold crystal, its composition is higher than that of sea salt.

It is difficult to have an accurate estimate of the reserves of the salt lake. In the past, some people calculated the amount stored in each cubic meter, then multiplied it by its area, and the resulting amount was 300 million tons. Based on the pre-war national salt consumption of 1.5 million tons per year, it would be enough to supply the country for 200 years. However, the depth of the salt lake is more than three zhang in the center. The current mining ports are on the periphery, with a depth of only one zhang and five chi, and the crystal layer is only one chi wide. Below that is all water, and the salt content in this water accounts for 25%, which is not included in the calculation. Moreover, since it was formed by the drying up of the sea, the reserves in the surrounding strata are also considerable. After rain, the runoff flows into the lake and recrystallizes, forming a salt layer again. Therefore, the estimated quantity is quite different from the actual amount of salt contained.

What is even more unexplored is whether there is rock salt in the lake. If there is, then it will truly become an inexhaustible treasure. Otherwise, if our industry develops in the future, like the United States, where each person uses an average of 48 pounds of salt per year, it will still be a limited resource.

However, as far as the present situation is concerned, we can still use this salt lake to make Qinghai the center of industry, because salt is indispensable for industry, and salt is the mother of all chemical industries.

The cost of salt is lower than other places because of its large supply. The Chaka Salt Lake belongs to the Mongolian banner, the jurisdiction of the King of Qinghai. The salt workers are all Mongolian people, and the central government gives the King of Qinghai a sum of money every year. The Mongolian people are paid one yuan for every shi of salt they extract. The several Mongolian yurts near the salt lake rely on animal husbandry and salt extraction for their livelihood.

The current output is not high due to transportation difficulties. This year, due to the prevalence of cattle plague, too many yaks have died. The number of Tibetan people responsible for transporting salt is decreasing day by day, and it is even more difficult for the output to exceed last year's. The salt is supplied to places within the province and even transported to the borders of Sichuan and Xikang and Gansu Province. There are five distribution centers: Niezhu, Xining, Datong, Lusha'er, and Shangwuzhuang. The transportation cost per dan from the salt lake to the above-mentioned distribution centers is sixty-two yuan to Xining and seventy-two yuan. What the reporter saw at the salt lake, apart from the salt workers, were herds of camels and cattle transporting salt.

On the way from Xining to Chaka Salt Lake, the reporter passed through the Haiyan grassland area. The obstacles encountered along the way were nothing more than cattle and sheep bones, especially the number of lying cattle was even greater. This certainly shows the severity of this year's cattle plague, but it is a pity that these bones are discarded on the ground. Bones are an excellent raw material for making fertilizer, and a greater use is for making phosphorus, which is also a necessity for industry. Like other resources in Qinghai, it is left there unused. In fact, within Qinghai, we can have unlimited hope from livestock alone. There are too many leather products, and I am afraid that everyone is only shocked by the name of black-purple lambskin, which is only used for luxury goods. We do not have statistics on production, but in the past, there were also several thousand pieces exported each year. Before July of this year, it was a period of control, and it was not possible to transport and sell freely out of the province, which made the leather goods stores in Xining City have sluggish business. Now that it is open, a tax of 280 yuan per piece can be freely transported out.

There are very few leather products seen within Qinghai Province. Here we can know that, in terms of resource use, it seems that we have not yet entered the door of industry. Apart from seeing the military uniform factory having a leather tanning section, other leather processing factories are not yet mentioned.

As far as the current situation is concerned, wool still occupies the first place in the assets received from livestock.

We do not have an accurate statistic of how much wool Qinghai produces each year. Roughly speaking, there are always forty to fifty thousand dan. The provincial authorities told reporters that the wool quality is still good, and in the future, we should not improve the breed of sheep, but focus on how to breed sheep. In fact, seriously speaking, Qinghai wool was popular in the international market in the past because the wool fiber is hard and has a luster, which is suitable for weaving carpets. If it is used to manufacture woolen fabrics, the color will be worse. It is also necessary to improve the breed of sheep for domestic sales. A recent example is that the merino sheep in Xinjiang are said to produce as much as ten catties of wool per year, while Gansu and Ningxia only produce three catties. If the wool quality is not much different, it seems necessary to transplant and breed the sheep from Xinjiang.

Speaking of cattle, Qinghai is famous for its yaks (i.e., Bos grunniens), followed by yellow cattle and yak-cattle hybrids. Yaks come from Tibet, and yak-cattle hybrids are formed by mating yellow cattle and yaks. Most of the farming and transportation rely on yaks. This year, the yak plague is very severe, and it is said that more than 1.2 million heads have died. Regarding the arrival of the cattle plague, some people say it comes from the Dulan area. In fact, Dulan is relatively good. The most serious is still Yijiao City. When the reporter passed through Huangyuan County, more than 17,000 yaks had died in the city.

Qinghai's famous horses and camels do not have definite numbers. It is only known that the horses ridden by the cavalry charging at the front are mostly produced in Qinghai.

In terms of minerals, it is difficult for any province in the Northwest to compare with Qinghai. As far as we know, China's gold mines are headed by Heilongjiang. In fact, Qinghai's gold mines have rarely been paid attention to in the past. Despite shouting "exchange gold with legal tender," describing artificial labor as expensive and gold panning as not worth the loss, there are still a large number of workers working every day. Regarding the quantity, the reporter did not inquire and should not speculate.

Qinghai's mineral distribution area is concentrated in Dulan, Tong-Northwest to Dunhuang, and Southwest to the Qaidam Basin. This includes gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, sulfur, borax, and other types, which are too numerous to mention. In addition, the reserves of alkali and petroleum are also thick. It's just that these treasures have not only not been developed, but even the initial investigation has not been done in the past. Only the coal seams of the Qilian Mountains and the east of Riyue Mountain are mined by indigenous methods, and the quantity is also considerable.

But no matter how much the amount of coal is, the future industrial development of Qinghai can completely rely on electrification. The Xiangtang Gorge, Laoya Gorge, and Zhama in the middle that the reporter passed through on the way from Lanzhou to Dulan have rapid water flow and strong water power. According to experts, the three places have more than enough power to generate hundreds of thousands of horsepower, which can not only create the electrification of Qinghai in the future, but also supply neighboring provinces. Now, the water mills on both sides of the Huangshui River are connected one after another, and the agricultural society still knows how to use power.

The inability to develop resources is hindered by the difficulty of transportation. If Qinghai is really electrified, the best means of transportation is still the tram. Speaking of transportation, Qinghai Lake is not necessarily unable to navigate, and it is also the best seaplane field. Qinghai's vast and boundless grasslands can park countless airplanes.

The reporter only stayed in Qinghai for twelve days in a short period of time, and already felt that the countless resources that could not be explained or described should not be wasted. Qinghai's door needs the assistance of the industrial community in all aspects to come and develop. (Sent on March 10, 1943)

### Fierce Battles in Central Tunisia: German-Italian Allied Forces Shorten Their Lines, Withdraw from Sfax and Kairouan

Rome, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Italian Army Headquarters announced today that the German-Italian Allied Forces intend to adopt new positions in Tunisia and have withdrawn from Sfax and Kairouan. The enemy, covered by tanks, launched a fierce attack on the southern part of the front line, but was repelled. At the same time, the Axis air force destroyed many anti-Axis communication lines, and German fighters also shot down five enemy Spitfires.

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Axis forces in Tunisia are now shortening their positions to a strong defense line 400 kilometers long, from Sfax in the north through Kairouan in the west to Cape Serrat, 60 kilometers west of Bizerte. The line has a depth of 50 kilometers and is strong enough to stop the advance of the anti-Axis forces. The fiercest fighting occurred on the central front on the 10th, when the British Eighth Army, advancing north from Sfax, coordinated with the French rebel forces and launched an attack on Kairouan in the west of Kairouan. The battle was extremely fierce all day long, but was repelled by the Axis forces, and 60 tanks were destroyed. According to a report from the United Press, the anti-Axis forces in the Sfax area advanced to La Hencha, 27 kilometers north of the city, on the 10th, but this has not yet been confirmed. In addition, on the northern front, the two armies continue to engage in fierce fighting in the areas of Medjez el Bab and Mateur.

Bern, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Rommel's troops continued to retreat north to new positions yesterday. The powerful Axis forces fought bravely and inflicted heavy losses on the anti-Axis forces in the Pichon area of southern Tunisia. The total number of casualties suffered by the anti-Axis forces while attempting to break through the Axis line in the Magel Bel Abbès valley is currently unknown, but Reuters, citing military sources, said that on the first night of the battle, there were twelve remains of anti-Axis tanks in the valley. After the U.S. forces under General Patton and the British Eighth Army under General Montgomery met, they jointly launched an offensive in the area. The main objective of the anti-Axis attack was to reach the east coast of Tunisia, hoping to isolate the tank force under Wermel stationed further south, preventing it from retreating north and joining forces with the troops under General Arnim. The offensive route taken by the anti-Axis forces was through the Magel Bel Abbès valley, which is a thoroughfare running east-west, with mountains on both the north and south sides, defended by Axis artillery. Before the anti-Axis forces attacked, they bombarded the area with artillery fire in an attempt to shake the Axis artillery positions and bypass the mountains held by the Axis forces, hoping to attack the Axis artillery from the rear. Although the British and American forces far outnumbered the Axis forces, they ultimately failed to break through the German defenses. It is said that elite British troops, French rebel troops, and powerful tank forces assisted the American forces in the attack. According to a Berlin announcement, a U.S. tank force was completely annihilated by the Axis artillery. The attack of the anti-Axis forces was defeated, and they hoped to avoid the battle and reorganize their troops. The Axis air force then attacked, causing great chaos among the anti-Axis forces. At the same time, the main force of the Axis forces continued to retreat north in an orderly manner. Reuters' military correspondent stated today that he believes that Marshal Rommel will not attempt any resistance in Sousse, but will continue to retreat north to the mountainous area of Enfidaville, and after joining forces with the troops under General Arnim, will establish a position along a line from Enfidaville to somewhere west of Bizerte on the northwest coast. The strong positions of the German-Italian forces in this hilly area will be able to offer extremely fierce resistance.

### British Commander-in-Chief in the Near East, Wilson, Visits Ankara; The Soviet Union Expresses Concern

Ankara, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to sources close to the British Embassy here, General Wilson, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Near East, along with a large number of staff, is expected to arrive here tomorrow to discuss everything with Turkish officials. President İsmet İnönü and Prime Minister Şükrü Saracoğlu will return to Ankara tomorrow.

Ankara, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to Reuters, the Soviet Union here is quite surprised by the upcoming visit of General Wilson, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, to Ankara for consultations. Soviet Ambassador Vinogradov has not received sufficient information on the future British-Turkish negotiations, and the Soviet Embassy is apparently trying to seek information about General Wilson's visit from other diplomatic representatives in Ankara.

Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between the Soviet Union and Egypt Seems Unlikely

Ankara, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to Reuters, the new Egyptian Minister to Turkey, Abdurrahim, stated in a conversation with the Iranian Ambassador to Turkey a few days ago that it seems unlikely that Egypt and the Soviet Union will resume diplomatic negotiations. The Egyptian minister pointed out that conservative elements in Egypt, especially the court and orthodox Islamic circles, are strongly opposed to the resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

### Eastern Front Remains Quiet, with Only Reconnaissance Activities

Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Eastern Front remained quiet yesterday. In recent days, there seems to be no immediate large-scale operation. Reuters' correspondent in Moscow, Mr. King, reported that there is very little news from the domestic front, so Soviet people have paid more attention to the Tunisian campaign. Along the two-thousand-mile Soviet front, there are only reconnaissance and reconnaissance activities to break the silence. At present, the areas of operation are the Kupyansk bridgehead in the south, the Donets River area in the middle to the upper reaches of the river, and the area south of Lake Ilmen, but there are no fierce battles in these three areas.

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On the Eastern Front, due to warm weather and snow melt, the roads are muddy, and ground operations are extremely difficult. There have only been small-scale local battles in the past two or three weeks, while the German Air Force has been unusually active. The German military authorities issued the following war report on the 10th: The Soviet forces in the Novorossiysk and southern Kupyansk River areas are isolated due to the German attack. At present, the Soviet forces seem to be trying to strengthen their forces and launch a counterattack to reverse the decline. In the middle reaches of the Donets River, the German army surrounded several Soviet units and completely annihilated them, thwarting the enemy's resistance on the west bank of the river. The German Air Force is still active. German bomber squadrons have raided Soviet airfields on both sides of Lake Ladoga, and other squadrons have attacked dense enemy forces in the southern area of Lake Ilmen. The enemy suffered heavy losses in soldiers and military supplies. The German Air Force also attacked important transportation hubs on the Murmansk Railway, destroying several freight cars, and simultaneously launched a fierce attack on important military facilities behind the Soviet lines.

### Anglo-American Bombers Bomb Three Cities

Rome, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Italian General Headquarters announced today that several squadrons of anti-Axis four-engine bombers attacked Naples, Trapani, and Marsala yesterday. The residential areas suffered the most damage.

### Japanese Local Governors' Conference Held; Prime Minister Tojo Delivers Keynote Address: Officials and People Cooperate to Complete the War

### An Analysis of Eden's Mission to the U.S.: Nakedly Revealing the Evil Intentions Harbored by Britain

(Special Telegram from Stockholm, 29th) British Foreign Secretary Eden's activities in the U.S. over the past two weeks have been obscured by various propaganda maneuvers, making it difficult to grasp the truth. However, based on comprehensive information arriving here from various sources, it is an undeniable fact that his mission was to prevent rifts in the relationship between the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union. Moreover, it is also clear that the outcome of the discussions regarding countermeasures for this issue did not achieve any success. Harold Callender reported in the New York Times on the 28th: "According to leaks from U.S. government circles, the talks did not go beyond the realm of exploration and did not reach a final conclusion." This report can serve as proof of the aforementioned fact. But what agreements did Eden actually make with the U.S. authorities? What discussions did he have? - To understand this, one only needs to conduct a correct study of the existing fundamental conflicts and cooperative relationships between the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union, and the truth of the situation will naturally emerge. The following is an attempt to examine the situation by integrating information from various sources:

Eden's main task was to adjust the relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, especially to alleviate the U.S.-Soviet opposition centered on the issue of post-war management, which is an undeniable fact. That is, the Soviet Union's post-war plan advocated for the restoration of the three Baltic states, the eastern half of Poland, and the old territory of Bessarabia; in response, the United States, based on the principle of national self-determination contained in the Atlantic Charter, took a resolute stance of rejection, thus causing disputes. Britain, situated in the middle, had already made its attitude clear in Churchill's previous broadcast and the editorial of The Times of London, which was to sacrifice the small countries of Europe and recognize the Soviet Union's claims. To mediate the conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, Eden made this visit to the U.S. However, the fact that Britain would readily agree to the Soviet Union's demands conceals the cunning of Britain's traditional, shrewd diplomacy, which cannot be overlooked. That cunning is:

(1) The current issue is to alleviate the Soviet Union's dissatisfaction with the still undeveloped second front.

(2) In the future, regarding the threat of the rise of a Fourth German Reich, the Soviet Union will be tasked with containing it from behind. (Britain's balance of power policy in Europe before the war was to make Germany and France confront and fight against each other. Now, with the collapse of France as a turning point, it has changed into a new policy of balance of power based solely on the opposition between Germany and the Soviet Union.)

(3) Furthermore, regarding the threat of the Soviet Union's communization of the world, it wants to take the lead with diplomatic concessions in advance, in order to restrain the Soviet Union's activities to a certain limit.

(4) On the other hand, for the necessity of maintaining its empire, Britain is extremely afraid of the U.S. dominating the world, especially its extension into Europe. Therefore, it wants to shake hands with the Soviet Union to prevent the U.S. from dominating Europe. (This is completely the same strategy as the U.S. supporting Darlan and Giraud in French North Africa, while Britain and the Soviet Union are setting up a common front to support de Gaulle.)

In short, Britain's post-war plan undoubtedly envisions cooperating with the Soviet Union to divide the European continent, and then to restrain the unlimited expansion of Soviet power, while at the same time preventing the U.S. from entering Europe as much as possible. Some reports say that Britain has also indicated to the U.S. that it is willing to entrust the western half of the Atlantic and the entire Pacific waters to the U.S.'s sphere of influence, so that in the future, when the Soviet Union leaps too far, the Christian countries of Britain and the U.S. can unite and confront the Soviet Union from both ends of the ocean. In that case, it can be said that Churchill is trying to learn from Zhuge Liang, planning to divide the world into three parts with Britain, the U.S., and the Soviet Union, in order to harmonize the three countries. However, the U.S. believes that Britain's intention is in fact a betrayal of the Atlantic Charter and holds a resentful attitude. Former U.S. Ambassador to Paris William Bullitt gave a speech in New York saying:

"If any of the anti-Axis countries tramples on the Atlantic Charter, the U.S. will return to its isolationism again with disappointment and resentment."

This speech can also be seen as revealing Roosevelt's feelings towards the Soviet Union and Britain.

In addition to the above, Eden's main task in visiting the U.S. was also the issue of the second front. Britain takes the position of hoping to realize the second battlefield as soon as possible due to the following reasons:

(1) Fear of Germany attacking the British mainland

(2) Fear of being strangled by submarines;

(3) Hope to get rid of the suffering of war sooner

(4) There is an urgent need to sweep away dissatisfaction in the Soviet Union and at home.

However, needless to say, it is impossible to realize the second front by Britain alone. Therefore, in order to have something to say to the Soviet Union, it has to explore the U.S.'s intentions regarding the early deployment of the second front. However, the U.S.'s position on the second front issue is very different from Britain's; Britain takes the war against Germany as its first principle, but the U.S. is in fact in a position where it must concentrate all its efforts on the war against Japan. Therefore, it eagerly requests a guarantee that Britain and the Soviet Union will actively participate in the Asian war after the war against Germany is over. Therefore, the more realistic reason for the current US-Soviet opposition can be seen as the mutual strategy regarding this second front issue, which contains the meaning of a price. During the previous Casablanca conference, Roosevelt's biggest goal was to lure Stalin to participate in the Asian issue as the price for deploying the second front in Europe, but the result was a complete failure. The U.S.'s dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union was clearly exposed in the daydream about the post-war plan, and it always wanted to drag the Soviet Union into the whirlpool of Asia whenever it had the opportunity; however, the Soviet Union still has not regarded this matter as an important real issue with a firm attitude; and Britain, from its utilitarian position of wanting Germany and the Soviet Union to fight each other comprehensively, does not express any joy about this matter. Now, the Soviet Union is complaining that it is solely bearing the pressure of the German army, and the U.S. is using its sole bearing of the strong pressure from Japan in the Pacific as an excuse to thoroughly use the European second front as the price for the Asian issue.

### Dusty and Weary: Soong Mei-ling Receives Ridicule in the U.S.

(Dispatch from the Argentinian Capital, Guttet, 2nd) Since the departure of Xiong Shihui of the Chongqing military delegation from Washington, due to the U.S.'s lack of sincerity in assisting Chongqing, a "blank" state, the first since 1938, has emerged between the U.S. and Chongqing. Soong Mei-ling, who arrived in Washington with great fanfare on February 14th of this year, her mission was to break this blank state. As soon as she arrived there, she met with reporters, gave speeches in Congress, attended lectures, and flew back and forth between Washington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and other places, using her American-style English that she was good at. She was busy without warming her seat, shouting hoarsely to the U.S. government and the public, "Promote and strengthen aid to Chongqing, the Pacific War first,". Recently, even Wellington Koo followed suit and came to work on the sidelines with T.V. Soong, Wei Tao-ming, and others to support her. But what kind of reaction has the U.S. had to her enthusiastic activities? Here, we will try to collect reports from the U.S. to provide an indirect report on Soong Mei-ling's activities in the U.S.

Soong Mei-ling Being Played With

Among all the movements in the U.S. government and the public centered on her, the first thing that makes people feel is the question of whether she is truly receiving heartfelt and sincere hospitality in the U.S. The speeches day and night and the continuous evening parties finally caused her to faint once. American newspapers and magazines did not seriously mention her biggest purpose in visiting the U.S., "Promoting and strengthening aid to Chongqing, Pacific War first," but only talked about how good her speeches were, how moving her demeanor was, how beautiful her clothes were, etc., using the tone of promoting red dancers and famous opera singers, fooling around randomly, and deliberately avoiding the truth of her political intentions. In short, this beautiful "Empress Dowager of Chongqing" is ultimately nothing more than being played with in their palms! For example, when she spoke in front of more than 20,000 audience members in Madison Square Park in New York on March 1st, Time magazine carried a report of more than two pages, all of which described the scene of the meeting and the unparalleled beauty of this VIP:

"Behind Soong Mei-ling was a gray-green curtain with two red Chinese characters 'Victory' written on it. She was wearing a black, long-style evening dress, wearing green earrings, and wearing black gloves. Her outfit that night was exactly the latest fashionable style in the world created by Hollywood superstars a few months ago. American reporters had used more than 20 adjectives such as charming, gentle, and stunning before the proper noun 'Soong Mei-ling': but that night, she could also be added with more than 30 such adjectives."

However, the introduction of the content of the speech and the words about helping Chongqing were not mentioned at all. Also, on February 28th, when she stepped onto the podium of the U.S. Congress as the second foreign woman (the first was Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands) amid the melodious music, the New York and Washington newspapers, like Time magazine, all wrote it as an interesting article. Let's give an example.

"In the Senate chamber, Soong Mei-ling arrived wearing a black satin Chinese dress. After Vice President Wallace, with his sharp, curious, and admiring eyes, made his introductory remarks, she smiled gracefully and quietly spoke into the microphone, giving a very moving speech that lasted more than an hour. The most unforgettable part was about a pilot under General Doolittle. When that pilot jumped out of a parachute in the sky over Chongqing, he waved to the arriving foreigners and shouted the only Chinese words he knew, 'America, America.' We can clearly see a vivid image of the friendship between the U.S. and Chongqing."

As above, it is just a low-key example.

Soong Mei-ling's Anger

Not only newspapers, but in any aspect, they always dealt with her in such a tone. She finally became angry at this kind of low-key flattery. When she continued to speak in the House of Representatives, she used a rather resentful and sarcastic tone of sarcasm, and completely abandoned the diplomatic rhetoric used in the Senate. She quoted a letter written in 1928 by a classmate from her alma mater, Wellesley College in Massachusetts, saying:

"Although I am thinking of going to the United States, I would hate to be seen as asking the United States to send troops." After saying something angry about her mission to the United States, she continued:

"The American people have the right to boast about the American soldiers who are engaged in combat all over the world. But it cannot be forgotten that the current American soldiers are stationed in remote places, where they live a monotonous life day after day with other anti-Axis soldiers, waiting for the opportunity."

She further made a sharp satire of the inactivity of the American Air Force in China and the defensive position of the Pacific front, indirectly questioning the U.S.'s lack of sincerity in aiding Chongqing. Then, the father quoted a Chinese proverb, "It's easy to watch others carry the burden," and described Chongqing's painful position of fighting against Japan alone, and made a fairly direct question of the Anglo-American bystander attitude. Finally, she said:

"What Chongqing needs most now is airplanes. As long as there is a supply of airplanes, Chongqing will definitely become the most powerful wing of the anti-Axis camp and will definitely fight for you to see."

Although she said such harsh words, the reports in the newspapers at that time did not take it seriously at all, with the only exception being the Washington Post, which said, "Soong Mei-ling's speech ultimately caused the entire House of Representatives chamber to suddenly reveal an embarrassed look."

Selfish Sacrifice

In short, Soong Mei-ling's visit to the United States was charged with the extremely profound mission of opening up a path for Chongqing, which was standing at a critical juncture of life and death. How could she have been surrounded by such a superficial, sensational, and taste-oriented atmosphere? Is this due to her own so-called confusing personality, or is it the cunning policy implemented by the Roosevelt faction? Although it is difficult to judge, it is never completely independent of these two elements.

During her meeting with the press corps at the White House last time, Soong Mei-ling made full use of diplomatic rhetoric in front of hundreds of journalists: According to the American newspapers at the time, Roosevelt, who was sitting at the same table, used an attitude like "an uncle comforting his nephew" to take on the task of introducing Soong Mei-ling to the press corps. At that time, Soong Mei-ling said to the journalists in a tactful manner: "The President is most concerned about the urgent matter of aiding Chongqing. I am at ease with everything and rely solely on the President." Although she used such clever expressions to urge aid to Chongqing; however, Roosevelt said: "Everything is up to God's will," and lightly brushed off Soong Mei-ling's sharp edge.

That being said, the truth is that the traditional policy of the United States depends on its own interests. Roosevelt's decision to increase his air force in China in order to bomb the Japanese mainland was an established fact, not for the sake of "aiding Chongqing," and had nothing to do with Soong Mei-ling's activities.

### German Aircraft Attack the U.S.: Extremely High Probability

According to dispatches from Washington, recently, American newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune have introduced the power of the newly completed German new long-range bomber to the newspapers, and pointed out that "the possibility of the German Air Force's air raid on the U.S. mainland is becoming more and more realistic," thereby urging the American people to be vigilant. This kind of warning is sufficient to replace the decline. It should be said that it is the article by Henry Taylor published in the American News Paper (America Mercurles). Taylor said in his thesis: "From the coast of Brittany, France, to New York, the straight-line distance is five thousand four hundred and fifty kilometers. According to reliable information, this distance is within the radius of action of the new German bomber. Seversky and other radical air force theorists in the United States are all enthusiastically advocating the bombing of the Japanese mainland, so that the eyes of the people are only facing the other side of the western Pacific, and how can they know that the American people will receive a major threat from the Atlantic behind them. Due to the changes in the European war situation, New York and Washington, which were believed to be absolutely immune to air raids, have to realize that they will be subjected to considerable frequent air raids." According to the special telegram from London from the Swedish newspapers, the situation is the same in the United Kingdom. The military experts in London also attach importance to the performance of the new German bomber and point out that there is a possibility of bombing the U.S. mainland, and point out that Germany's intensification of its submarine operations has put Britain in a state of coercion in terms of both material and spiritual aspects. Because of the completion of the "European Fortress," it will strangle Britain's preparations for launching a second front, as well as other reckless actions. After this spring, Germany will carry out the largest air raid on the British mainland since the start of the war, which is very possible. They also said that the method of the German air raid will be a fierce concentrated bombing aimed at disrupting traffic lines. It goes without saying, and it seems that parachute landing disturbances will be carried out at the same time.

While the U.S. Air Force is clamoring to bomb the Japanese mainland again, rumors that Germany has a new long-range bomber that threatens the U.S. mainland from behind have caused a great shock throughout the U.S. According to foreign telegrams, this long-range bomber is the Messerschmitt 264 aircraft, but its structure and performance are unknown due to strict secrecy. However, the range is known to be 15,000 kilometers, so it can travel from the German-occupied area of France to Washington with ease. Also, if used properly, it is possible to directly bomb the U.S. mainland from Tokyo with this aircraft, as the distance between Tokyo and San Francisco is 8,000 kilometers. It is said that the German military has repeatedly broadcast radio broadcasts recently, announcing that "in retaliation for the U.S. air raid on Berlin, the German Air Force is prepared to bomb the U.S." In response, the U.S. rushed to gather on its coast to prepare more than 500 air raid detection devices, trembling in fear of the German aircraft's attack.

### Yesterday's Independent Air Defense Training: Air Raid Alert Drill, and Fire Prevention and Evacuation Exercises

The highest air defense authorities in this city, in order to continue to increase the people's air defense awareness, held a comprehensive air defense exercise and blackout for four days starting yesterday (12th). The Army and Navy Air Defense Command, the Municipal Government, and the Public Concession Works Bureau, the French Concession Municipal Council, and other institutions all participated. From 8:00 AM, all districts of the city entered a state of alert, with air raid emergency alerts being issued twice during the day. Vehicle traffic was suspended during the emergency alerts, and citizens were only allowed to walk on the sidewalks on the left side of the road under the traffic control of the neighborhood and lane authorities. At the same time, various fire prevention, firefighting, and evacuation training exercises were held in all districts of the city.

Emergency Alert

Starting at 8:00 AM in the morning, another air defense exercise was held, and a warning alert was issued.

### The Virtuous Words and Deeds of the Old Lady Chongde

— Chen Binhe

Madam Chongde, the mother of Mr. Nie Yuntai, passed away on December 30th of last year at the venerable age of 91. The memorial service is being held today at the Nie residence, number 2028 Jing'an Temple Road. Madam Chongde's virtuous words and exemplary deeds throughout her life are worthy of emulation by the present generation, and are too numerous to mention. This article only selects a few, to express admiration.

Madam Nie Zeng Jifen, the Old Lady Chongde, was the youngest daughter of Zeng Wenzheng Gong, a great figure of the late Qing Dynasty. She was born in Beijing on the thirtieth day of the third lunar month in the second year of Xianfeng (1852 AD), just as the Taiping Rebellion was breaking out in Guangxi. From a young age, she received the family education of Zeng Wenzheng Gong, and her subsequent thoughts and actions followed the traditions of Zeng Wenzheng Gong. In her childhood, she followed Zeng Wenzheng Gong as he moved from province to province, experiencing turmoil and gaining insight into the shortcomings of the country and society. She showed particular sympathy for the plight of ordinary people. Moreover, with the supervision of Zeng Wenzheng Gong, she was especially diligent, thrifty, and studious. At the age of twenty-four, she married Mr. Nie Zhongfang of Hengshan.

What makes the Old Lady Chongde most worthy of emulation is that all her efforts were not only for the sake of her own family's peace, wealth, and honor, but she always considered the peace, happiness, and honor of other families, possessing the virtues of "helping others in need" and "doing good to others." Since the founding of the Republic of China, she resided in Shanghai and gradually came into contact with people in the Christian community. Seeing their spirit of charity, medicine, and service to society, she believed that it was enough to correct the selfish and unpatriotic habits prevalent in society. She gladly accepted Christianity and was baptized in the fourth year of the Republic of China. Every morning and evening, she would kneel and pray to God, bowing her head hundreds of times. What she prayed for, however, was the early restoration of peace in all countries of the world, and the emergence of many wise men in the country and society, never involving her own personal affairs. I ask, how many women in the general intellectual class today can pray so devoutly for the world, the country, and society? We cannot help but particularly admire the Old Lady Chongde and hope that ambitious women in our women's community will rise up and emulate her.

The Old Lady Chongde's love for the world and the country, and her assistance to others, were by no means expressed only in kneeling and praying to God, but were truly expressed in practical life. Read her "Theory of Frugality and Thrift to Save the Nation." She said: "Greed for profit and pride in it is a common evil root in human beings. All the disasters in the world are due to this. Only the ancient sages of our country deeply knew the cause. Therefore, in their governance and education, they promoted virtue and righteousness, and degraded the rich and powerful. Confucius said, 'The gentleman understands righteousness, the petty man understands profit.' Mencius regarded those who are constantly pursuing profit as the followers of Robber Zhi. He also quoted Yang Hu's words, 'To be rich is not benevolent, to be benevolent is not wealthy.' He also regarded merchants who monopolize market profits as base men. Jia Yi and Chao Cuo of the Han Dynasty were great politicians of our country. They severely criticized the extravagant behavior of merchants and wealthy people, which harmed people's livelihoods, corrupted customs, and confused the ritual system, speaking with great pain. Therefore, for thousands of years, we have relied on ritual and education to maintain order, and the social criticism system has become an invisible law. The rich and powerful, even the poor officials, have been somewhat restrained. But today, with the import of European customs, especially from England, rich people are respected as superiors, extravagance is praised, and frugality is despised. Scholars even follow suit, the social atmosphere has changed greatly, and the country's affairs cannot be managed." If today's wealthy people read these words, can they not blush and feel ashamed in their hearts?

However, she never made loud noises to fish for fame and praise. She grew up in a thrifty family environment. Because Zeng Wenzheng Gong started with nothing and took on difficult tasks. At that time, the court and the public indulged in revelry and were accustomed to hypocrisy. Military affairs and governance were extremely corrupt. There were no funds to allocate and no soldiers to fight. Zeng Wenzheng Gong served as a local gentry to organize local militias, and then took overall command of military affairs in various provinces, commanding more than ten thousand soldiers. He led his subordinates with integrity and managed his family with thrift, vowing not to send a single penny from the army to his family. He was finally able to create a good atmosphere and encourage the officers and soldiers of the time to be honest and upright, so that they could work together in harmony and complete the great task of national rejuvenation. The Old Lady Chongde described her childhood life, saying: "My father often wanted to maintain the state of rural life. He did not allow us to use silk for our daily clothes. One day, when a guest came, I wore a gauze jacket with embroidery. After the guest left, Wenzheng Gong came in, looked at it, and asked my mother, 'Why is Man Nu (referring to the Old Lady Chongde) so fancy?' My mother quickly replied: 'I just saw a guest...' We spun yarn, weaved hemp, sewed, cooked, and prepared meals. We had a fixed schedule every day, and we had almost no free time." In fact, not only in her childhood, but even in her forties and up to the high age of eighty-one, she was still accompanied by a loom, taking pleasure in needlework, never seeking ease. Today's so-called modern women are probably far less noble than the Old Lady Chongde, but they have long only known how to enjoy banquets and regard needlework as lowly.

The old lady was so diligent and thrifty, which was closely related to her childhood family education. Wenzheng Gong had set a curriculum for her. After breakfast, she would make side dishes, pastries, wine, and sauces (meals). At noon, she would spin cotton or weave hemp (clothing). After lunch, she would do needlework and embroidery (fine work). At dusk (after 10 PM), she would make men's shoes, women's shoes, or sew clothes (rough work). The Zeng family, both men and women, could not lack any of the four characters: reading, writing, and composing; women could not lack any of the four characters: clothing, food, rough, and fine. A curriculum was set every day. Meals were tested every day, clothing was tested every three days, fine work was tested every five days, and rough work was tested every month. They had two slogans: "A diligent family prospers, a diligent person is healthy," "Those who are diligent and thrifty will never be poor." But she also worked hard to study. She said in her own chronicle: "Guangxuan, the eldest daughter of Hui Min Gong, was betrothed to Li Youxian of Hefei. Her husband's family wanted her to study, so Hui Min taught her Outline and Mirror of History every day, and I always listened from the side. Later, Hui Min did not have time to teach more, so I read it on my own. There was a very large globe made by the Manufacturing Bureau in the boat hall built by Wenzheng Gong in the office, about six feet in diameter. Therefore, we roughly knew geography. Su Cheng Gong had always liked mathematics, so he taught me Tianyuan Gougu Kaifang, which is the modern algebra geometry, and I was able to understand it. My sister-in-law, Madam Guo, also often discussed it with me. The joy of reading history at this time was the greatest." The old lady not only loved to learn and study on her own from a young age, but also continued to study diligently after her marriage. She said in her own chronicle: "Madam Hui Min brought back from abroad wool woven clothes and trousers, and thread woven clothes, which were not easy to see at that time. I asked her about the method of making them, and learned a little. Every time I had free time, I would infer from them and create new styles. Later, I often visited Madam Chuan Lan Ya Jun, and Mr. Chuan was the one who compiled and translated new books for the Manufacturing Bureau. His wife was refined and kind, and I got along well with her, so I learned all her methods. At that time, European and American women also valued family handicraft very much. I felt the importance of foreign languages and science, so I ordered my two sons, Qichang and Qijie, to learn from Madam Fu every day." What is even more commendable is that this spirit of learning was tireless until old age. She wrote the Diamond Sutra every day without tiring. And she did not think that self-study was enough. For decades, she always passed on what she had learned to others, even to her maids. This "knowing and passing on immediately," and "doing good to others" enthusiasm, is precisely the great spirit that our country needs to promote today, isn't it?

Finally, we want to explain that the old lady's unreachable place for ordinary women is that she is tireless in doing good. She often lived frugally herself, and when it came to helping others, especially public welfare, she always rushed to the front. In order to help the poor and sick, she often worked tirelessly, making medicine herself late at night. Isn't this the spirit of religious sacrifice of self to serve the crowd, which is most lacking in our country today? The biggest difference between us writing about the Old Lady Chongde today to express our respect for her and writing biographies and inscriptions for ordinary people is that we do not want to write flattering words for the dead. However, the spirit and actions of the Old Lady Chongde, who worked hard to learn, enthusiastically did good deeds, loved the world and the country, knew and acted immediately, and did so for more than eighty years as if it were a day, are truly enough to influence the end of the world. So how can we not write an article to praise her? Now, with the Old Lady Chongde's own words, I give this to the people of the East: "Gu Shilin said, 'The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every man.' I say, 'It is especially the responsibility of every woman.'" Rejecting gorgeous clothes and utensils, being diligent, thrifty, and hardworking, in order to encourage men, jointly creating a good social atmosphere, cultivating the vitality of the country, and ensuring the peace of the world, is this not the reality of our women? I hope that my female compatriots will not regard this as a platitude and ignore it! (See "Theory of Frugality and Thrift to Save the Nation")

### Second Phase of Per Capita Sugar Distribution to Begin the Day After Tomorrow

After the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office was approved by the military allocation authorities to implement per capita sugar control, the first phase ran from March 11th to March 31st. Recently, the second phase of sugar collection certificates has been approved and issued by the Public Works Bureau and the Food Administration Bureau, based on the retailers who re-registered with the cooperative. Therefore, in the future, those holding certificates can purchase sugar nearby. Retailers have completed procedures such as paying sugar payments. It was originally scheduled to start issuing certificates on April 11th, with a valid period until the 30th. It is now known that due to issues with the delivery of sugar in the second phase, it is impossible to clear the sugar on time, so it is bound to be delayed for a few days. It is reported that the nationwide distribution will begin on the 15th, with the quantity specified as half a catty per certificate, priced at two yuan and forty cents. As for the sugar needed for various industries, special allocations will be made according to the previous methods. It is reported that the special allocation of sugar for March has already begun. Those who have been approved for allocation can collect sugar from designated retailers with a sugar purchase certificate. The specific methods for the second phase of per capita sugar distribution will be announced by the cooperative in conjunction with the authorities.

### Planning to Improve the Vegetable Market System - Striving to Simplify the Distribution System - Clearing Supply Sources and Suppressing Prices - Inspecting Food for Hygiene

The relevant authorities of the two concessions are discussing the current system of vegetable markets. It is said that the reason is to suppress the prices of food in the vegetable markets and to improve the distribution and inspection methods. The details are recorded below.

Clearing Supply Sources to Suppress Prices

Although the authorities have tried their best to suppress the prices of vegetable markets, the sources of food in the vegetable markets themselves are uncertain. The procedures for vegetable market food to be officially sold by retailers after passing through the hands of rural transporters and wholesalers are more complicated, resulting in less effective results. However, the relevant authorities are now actively trying to make up for the above shortcomings. The approach is to simplify the distribution system and clear the sources of supply.

Inspecting Food to Prevent Transmission

At the same time, in order to maintain public health and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, the authorities have also decided to be meticulous and thorough in the inspection of food in vegetable markets. The health authorities have decided to implement a new food inspection system in various vegetable markets before the summer epidemic prevention campaign is held. It is understood that this new system has been formulated by the health authorities.

### Fire in the Straw Pile at the District Court Detention Center

A large amount of straw piled in front of the detention center of the Shanghai District Court, which was for the cooking needs of all the inmates, suddenly caught fire at around 11 o'clock yesterday morning. For a time, the fire was very fierce and the black smoke filled the sky. The West District Fire Brigade and the French Concession Fire Brigade all drove to the scene to put out the fire before it was extinguished. It was found that the cause of the fire was a cigarette butt left by a family member of an inmate after visiting the inmate, which was blown by the wind to the straw pile. The total loss was 20,000 yuan.

### Brief News

Inspection of Qingxiang in Nanhui: Colonel Quan, the liaison officer of the Shanghai Special Municipality, led his entourage to inspect the Qingxiang area of Nanhui on the 10th of this month and returned to Shanghai after completing the inspection that day.

Arrested for Posing as a Fundraiser: Recently, someone has been using the names of well-known social figures and charitable organizations to solicit donations from all walks of life by telegram, lining their own pockets. The Chinese detectives of the Xinzha Police Station arrested six suspects, Fan Bingkun, Huang Yinsheng, Guo Wenqing, Jin Baoqing, Xiang Yiting, and Jiang Yousheng, on Hubei Road the day before yesterday and sent them to court yesterday morning. The defendants have committed many crimes within the concession and will be investigated further.

Women's Welfare Association Free School: The first school of the Women's Free School sponsored by the Shanghai Women's Welfare Association officially opened yesterday (12th), and the second school is scheduled to open on the 15th. Both schools are divided into primary and secondary level courses. Uneducated women are welcome to register.

### Short Commentary: Remember the Rules of the Road

Yesterday was the first day of the fourth air defense exercise in this city. The entire city was in a state of exercise all day. The personnel participating in the exercise were all mobilized. At the sound of the alarm, they immediately performed their duties in accordance with the predetermined rules, with a tense mood in a calm response. This is commendable.

However, when we look at the pedestrians on the road, although there are ropes on both sides of the sidewalk, many people still do not walk on the left side of the sidewalk, and they cross the road everywhere like shuttles, even breaking the ropes. This kind of inability to obey order and rules is really unacceptable in today's wartime.

The purpose of the rope fences on both sides of the road is to restrict pedestrians to walk on the sidewalk. Originally, our modern citizens should have good habits of obeying order and rules, and there is no need for formal restrictions at all. Therefore, we can also say that this restriction is a kind of warning to us in spirit. Therefore, everyone should consciously abide by the rules of the road, but why can't some people do it, and are willing to receive this spiritual warning?

We hope that the heads of the neighborhood and the parents will earnestly explain to every old and young woman and child in their neighborhood and family that they must do this basic thing of abiding by the law. Remember: "Walk on the left side of the sidewalk, and do not cross the road at will." We must ensure that there are no fences on both sides of the road during future exercises, and that everyone obeys the law and walks on the road.

### Cholera Vaccination Will Be Strictly Implemented

The police stations in various districts of the Public Concession have recently issued implementation measures for preventive vaccination in each Lianbao area: (1) Please ask each Lianbao chief to instruct residents to implement the vaccination in accordance with the provisions of the cholera prevention vaccination notice issued. (2) Please ask each Lianbao chief to distribute residents of each Bao to vaccinate at the designated location from the start of the vaccination date to May 10th. (3) From May 12th, if there are those who do not vaccinate, the Bao chief will copy the list and send it to this police station. (4) From May 20th, if there are those who do not vaccinate, the Bao chief will bring the household's entire citizen certificate and household rice ration coupon to this police station. (5) Each household head is responsible for the above examples.

### Posthumous Calligraphy of Nie's Mother, Madam Zeng

Nie Zeng Jifen, the daughter of Zeng Wenzheng Gong, the mother of Layman Nie Yuntai, and later known as the Old Lady Chongde, passed away last winter at the age of ninety-one. Today, a memorial service is being held at her Shanghai residence on Jing'an Temple Road. In her later years, the Madam enjoyed calligraphy and never stopped practicing. Her handwritten family motto and couplet of Wenzheng Gong, "A diligent family prospers, a diligent person is healthy, those who are able to move and are healthy will never be poor," is powerful and precious. Now there is a Mr. Zhu who is willing to share this couplet with enthusiasts, print and sell it, and donate 100 yuan to entrust the Social Service Department of this newspaper to handle it.

### Sports: Zhen Dan Scholarship Charity Match - Donghua vs. Zhen Dan

Donghua has been invited to play against the Zhen Dan United Team. Tickets are divided into four types: 10 yuan, 20 yuan, and assigned seats for 30 yuan and 50 yuan. Advance sales will begin today at the Zhen Dan gatehouse.

Yesterday's newspaper broadcast time was 7:00 pm.

### Economic World

Since the government sent officials to start investigating hoarding and speculation in this city and reviewing the operations of various banks, the rising trend of commodity prices in recent days has been considerably curbed. In particular, the cotton cloth market has shown a trend towards stability, and people are downstream. Yesterday, the prices of leading fine cloths, Four Gentlemen Serge, and Peach Blossom Ladies' Fabrics were all lower than on the sixth, and there was a tendency for them to continue to weaken.

### Commentary: Loans from Silver Money Industry to Factories

Throughout history, the industrial development of various countries in the world is fully supported by the financial industry. Industry and finance are like the auxiliary wheels and teeth of a car, interdependent. The financial and industrial circles are like brothers and feet, who should support and cooperate with each other to facilitate the progress of business. In the past, the financial community had organized an industrial loan syndicate to support factories. Although it is a pity that it has not been implemented due to many events in the current situation. Recently, the Silver Money Industry Association, in order to prevent the use of commodity guarantees to finance the growth of hoarding and speculation, decided to limit commodity guarantee loans to members of various industry associations. In other words, from now on, loans from the silver money industry will focus on factories, and the guarantees will be the factory's products and raw materials. This is a normal method of lending in the financial industry, and it is worthy of advocacy and promotion. If we can adhere to this policy and implement it earnestly, then factories will be able to operate flexibly in terms of finance, and can develop as much as possible in terms of production. The revival of Chinese industry may have a hope of realization. I believe that the financial industry should pay attention to the following three aspects when lending to factories:

(1) Attention should be paid to the technical aspects of the factory, and technical experts should be dispatched from time to time to improve each factory, so as to reduce costs and speed up production, in order to achieve the goal of increasing efficiency.

(2) Attention should be paid to the safety of the factory. At the time of construction of the house, arrangement of the machines, and placement of raw materials and goods, attention should be paid to safety aspects at all times, so that loans can be avoided from being in danger.

(3) Attention should be paid to the source of raw materials for the factory and the way out for finished products, and funds should be provided at any time. Mortgage loans should be given more, or acceptance bills should be promoted, so that a part of the funds can do multiple businesses. This is the best way to support industry.

At the same time, I hope that the industry itself should know that in the future, business should be completely focused on the main business, without engaging in external trade and hoarding. Focus on quality improvement and quantitative increase in manufacturing; and strive for customer satisfaction in promotion and enthusiastic sales by dealers in various places, so as to increase business reputation and gain the trust of financiers. This is what industrialists need to work hard to achieve automatically.

### Deputy Minister of Finance Chen Zheshuo Summoned Yesterday - Silver Money Industry Leaders Talked - Explaining the Government's Intention to Thoroughly Investigate Hoarders

Central News Agency Shanghai Dispatch: In order to thoroughly investigate the general speculators and hoarders in Shanghai, the National Government specially dispatched Chen Zheshuo, Deputy Minister of Finance, and Yuan Yuquan, Deputy Minister of Industry, to Shanghai to discuss the methods of thoroughly investigating hoarders with Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government and Supervisor Chen Yunwen of the Business and Statistics Committee. It is learned that the investigation of bank and money shop lending operations has been clarified. If it is determined that there are speculative and hoarding activities based on the account holders of the funds pledged by banks and money shops, they will be punished according to law. According to sources familiar with the matter, Deputy Minister Chen Zheshuo and others also summoned leaders of the silver money industry for an informal conversation yesterday, explaining the government's intention to thoroughly investigate hoarders and the progress of reviewing bank and money shop lending operations, hoping that the money industry would work hard on its main business and focus on lending operations, and that there would be no impact on the financial community. This thorough investigation of speculators, hoarders, and profiteers is completely aimed at stabilizing commodity prices and ensuring the fundamental strategy of stabilizing living. It is reported that Chen, the Minister of Finance, will return to Beijing within days to report to the government authorities on the progress of the thorough investigation of speculators and hoarders in Shanghai, and then submit it to the Supreme National Defense Council for special punishment.

### Ministry of Food Urges Various Associations to Organize a Joint Association

Central News Agency Shanghai Dispatch: In order to promote the control work and improve the industrial and commercial organization of the food industry to adapt to the wartime system, the Ministry of Food has repeatedly urged the industrial and commercial groups of food and food under its jurisdiction to quickly organize a joint association. Now the Ministry of Food has completed the planning of the scope of organization of various industries, and will first sort out those related to the control of main foods. In addition to rice, which has a separate organization, it is divided into six categories: flour, miscellaneous grains, eggs, livestock, sugar, and edible oil. All the preparation directors of the joint associations have also been appointed. The Ministry of Food's Shanghai staff, in accordance with the Ministry's order, have been consulting with the preparation directors on the direction of progress. Those who have not yet determined the members of the preparation committee are still under negotiation. It is expected that the joint associations will be established one after another soon. In addition, the Ministry of Food's relevant food industries, in addition to the above-mentioned major categories related to control, have already been organized. Tea, fruits and vegetables, seasonings, beverages, canned foods, brewing, and other industries that are generally recognized as food and beverage in daily life will be sorted out in the second step and are currently being planned.

### Municipal Food Bureau Ordered to Take Over Municipal Agriculture

Central News Agency Shanghai Dispatch: After the Municipal Food Bureau was ordered to reorganize and establish, the Municipal Government decided to assign the Donggou Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Farm and the Donggou Agricultural Improvement Zone, and the Zhenru Agricultural Improvement Zone, which belong to the Municipal Government, to the jurisdiction of the Municipal Food Bureau for the purpose of increasing agricultural production in the urban area and facilitating supervision. According to the reporter's inquiry, the Food Bureau has now received the order from the government and is preparing to take over, and will take over within days to improve agricultural production in the urban area and increase production.

### Municipal Revitalization Bank - Increased Capital of 3 Million Yuan

Central News Agency Shanghai Dispatch: Since the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality Revitalization Bank two years ago, its business has developed and its reputation has grown.

More than 20 shareholders attended, including Municipal Government representatives Wu Zhefu and Yuan Houzhi, and business shareholders Chen Shaoyu and Sun Yaodong. Wu Zhefu, on behalf of Mayor Chen, served as the temporary chairman, and reported on the business conditions for the 31st year, the general balance sheet, and the allocation of surplus items. After the speech, the proposal to increase capital by 3 million yuan was discussed. The entire meeting unanimously passed the resolution, and after the revised articles of association for the capital increase were approved by vote, the meeting adjourned at 3:30 pm.

### Chinese and Japanese Egg Merchants in This City Planning to Organize a Joint Venture - This Year's Output is Double That of Last Year

In order to unify the egg business, Chinese and Japanese egg merchants in this city are currently organizing a joint venture. The Japanese egg merchants are mainly composed of Yangzi Egg Industry, Zhongzhi Egg Industry, and Neiwai Egg Bank. Chinese egg merchants are also planning to carry out this organization. According to an estimate by an egg merchant, about 1,000 cages (about 70 catties per cage) of eggs are imported into this city every day from various places. The total number of imports this year is estimated to reach about 40,000 cages. This number is double that of last year. The reason for the increase is that the egg prices increased significantly last year, and the number of chicken farmers in rural areas increased, so the egg production also increased.

### Registration of Noodle Product Businesses: Membership Reaches Over Two Thousand Households

The Municipal Noodle Product Industry Association, in order to adjust the membership of each group to avoid duplication and to facilitate the allocation of flour, applied to the authorities to conduct a general registration starting on the sixth of this month.

The cut noodle group has 331 households with flour cards and 57 households without cards. The special group has 36 households. The special group consists of those who have registered twice in the past and must be adjusted to determine which group they belong to.

### Second Batch of Cigarette Allocation: Available for Distribution This Week

Many cigarette shops in the city have recently refused to sell cigarettes individually, citing the exhaustion of allocated cigarettes, leading to high expectations for the early implementation of the second batch of cigarette allocation from the China Tobacco Company. It is now learned that the date for the second batch of cigarette allocation is expected to be realized this week, likely to be processed on Thursday (the 15th). As for the varieties, they are all products of Chinese cigarette factories, and the prices are the same as before.

### The Woolen Fabric Market Last Month

Looking back at the woolen fabric market in March, among all months of previous years, the market was the tightest. The first ten days were not as firm as the middle ten days, and the middle ten days to the last ten days were even firmer, due to different circumstances. The previously applied increase in price limits was officially approved by the authorities on the 12th of last month. The industry association printed and distributed the new price limit list to each member store. The price of goods from local factories increased by 30%, goods from the East increased by 35%, and goods from England increased by 40%. Now that the National Commercial Unification Association has been formally established, there is no need to issue transport permits for woolen fabric movement. At the same time, it is stipulated that those engaged in wholesale cannot also engage in retail, and retail stores cannot engage in wholesale. As a result, many new stores have joined the industry association. Due to busy operations and increased expenses, the industry association has changed the monthly fee to ten yuan and the membership fee to one thousand yuan. As for the woolen fabric market, due to the scarcity and high prices of raw materials such as wool yarn, there is a shortage of woolen fabric in stock. In addition, with the freedom to transport by car, people's minds have suddenly turned enthusiastic, and demand exceeds supply, causing prices to rise steadily. By the end of the month, the market was even tighter, and most of the circulating funds were in short supply. Most retail stores still hoard goods and refuse to display prices for sale. Although the price limits have been increased by 30% to 40%, some are sold for 70% to 80% to over 100% more. Therefore, it is difficult to purchase woolen fabric for clothing unless you ask a close friend to handle it for you.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Publishes Price Limit Table

The Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council announces that many of the price limits for various items approved by the Council have not yet been published. To remedy this, a detailed price limit table should be compiled, including the approved price limits for all items, for public reference. The Price Control Office has now completed the compilation and printing of this price limit table. The first type has already been published, and the second type, including the remaining price limits, will be printed within two weeks. To save paper and in view of the high printing costs, the Council has printed a limited number of price limit tables. Taxpayers who currently receive the Council Gazette on a regular basis and registered industry associations can apply to purchase this table from Office No. 177 of the Council, with a fee of ten yuan per copy.

### Nanking Economic Bureau Rectifies Industry Associations

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - In order to thoroughly stabilize prices and eliminate black market transactions, the Nanking Municipal Economic Bureau is actively investigating various inventories and their sources. It has also begun to rectify various industry associations, which is expected to be completed before May.

### Hoping to Eradicate Hoarding

The National Government has specially dispatched Chen Zhishuo, Vice Minister of Finance, and Yuan Yuzhen, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce, to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate speculation and hoarding by the entire industrial and commercial sector. Once the two officials return to Nanjing, it is expected that specific policies to prevent hoarding will be decided and implemented. The economic circles in the concessions are also taking this opportunity to assist the National Government in preventing hoarding, promoting stable livelihoods, and revitalizing the economy. At the same time, all parties hope that the National Government will not only take temporary measures in this intensive investigation of hoarding but will also carry out the following work to continue promoting the policy of eradicating hoarding.

(1) Establish a Thorough Investigation Organ for Hoarding in Shanghai

The resident Shanghai institutions that guide Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles include the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance, the Financial Institutions Inspection Office, and the Insurance Supervisory Bureau. However, these institutions are all weak, and their strength is not enough to guide Shanghai's economic circles after the war, especially the newly established Financial Institutions Inspection Office, which aims to manage finance, will feel even more difficult. To guide the complex Shanghai economy, at least an institution headed by a high-ranking official at the ministerial level should be established to inspect financial and industrial businesses. If such a long-term plan is not made, whenever major hoarding events occur in the future, dispatching officials from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Shanghai for short-term thorough investigations will not be enough to prevent the deeply rooted hoarding in Shanghai.

(2) Promulgation of the Hoarding Punishment Decree

According to the National Government's decree announced on the 7th, anyone engaged in speculative trading, manipulating market prices, or disrupting the market will be reported to the Supreme National Defense Council for special punishment once the investigation is verified, regardless of who they are. The seized materials will be confiscated. However, the general public believes that promulgating the punishment decree is the most important way to prevent hoarding and stabilize public morale.

### Translated Commentary: The Development of State Capital

Special Envoy Chen, who is visiting Japan, met with reporters at the Imperial Hotel on the 10th and answered questions raised by the reporters. In his answers, Chen explained that the Chinese national movement after the war is being promoted with three fundamental principles as its goals. The first of these three fundamental principles is to advance from individualism to nationalism, the second is to shift from free capitalism to state capitalism, and the third is to develop from narrow nationalism to national corporatism. These goals are completely the same as those stated by Wang Jingwei in the Outline of the New National Movement in January last year. Wang said that the reason why the Three Principles of the People could not be fully realized in the past was that nationalism forgot Pan-Asianism, democracy neglected the democratic centralism system, and the people's livelihood could not promote the development of state capital. In these few words, there is profound self-criticism and reflection.

We completely agree with the views of Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo, especially believing that seeking the development of state capital should be the focus of the National Government's efforts in the future. Dr. Sun Yat-sen had long noticed the development of state capital and wanted to use it to restrain individual capital. The development of state capital not only helps the social policy aspect but also relies on the publication of state capital to build a new China and increase production, which can be said to be the only shortcut to success. One of the biggest reasons why Japan was able to develop its economy rapidly after the Meiji Restoration was also due to the huge state capital. The achievements reflected by this fact should be reviewed at this moment.

The National Government should strive to mobilize national capital and give it full guarantees for its activities. At the same time, it should no longer cherish the old consortia who have been making eyes at the government and instead strive to revitalize their capital, create basic industries by themselves, and adopt a positive attitude. For industries that require huge capital, the state should operate them, or at least operate them jointly with private businesses, or provide guarantees during the start-up period. Only by implementing these measures can the government have the hope of rapid economic development. Moreover, it is also the best foundation for economic cooperation between China and Japan. We hope that the National Government authorities will show some courage and seriously engage in this issue in order to achieve its practice.

### Insurance Broker Registration Deadline Extended to June 5

Since the Insurance Supervisory Bureau implemented the registration of insurance brokers and notaries, all registration matters have been proceeding smoothly. According to reporters, the bureau's registration matters were originally scheduled to end on the 5th of this month. However, because there are many brokers, some may not be able to complete the registration on time. Therefore, the deadline has been extended by two months to June 5th. It is hoped that insurance brokers and notaries currently engaged in business will no longer hesitate.

### Intensified Takeover of Properties Where Owners are Absent, Deadline for Supplementary Documents

The Nanshi Office of the Land and Housing Management Committee for Properties Where Owners are Absent in this city has decided to start with sorting out the registration of properties where owners are absent in the entire district in order to effectively rectify them and ensure the rights and interests of the owners in the district. It will use streets as units to intensify the takeover of properties where owners are absent. All insufficient documents must be verified within 15 days; otherwise, the takeover will be carried out immediately so that the property rights of all absent owners can be protected.

### Miscellaneous Talk about the Environment

— Ru Ling

A friend left, leaving a letter saying, "The environment is not good, I decided to leave." Another friend, wrote from a faraway place, saying that the environment there is not good, and plans to come here. Leaving, coming, both saying that the environment is not good, is it strange, does the environment affect a person's career to this extent?

Speaking of the environment, one cannot help but think of the story of the Three Kingdoms, Wei had the favor of heaven, Shu had the support of the people, Wu had the advantage of geography, each had their own environment, but in the end, Sima Zhao took advantage of it. So, until now, I always believe that the environment is not enough to affect a person's life.

It is a commonplace to say that in a difficult environment, one can stand on one's own, work hard, and the more adverse the environment, the more one can stand on one's own feet. But if we carefully distinguish and chew it over, the ordinary commonplace has a steady thought after all. Not all great inventions and entrepreneurs come out of good and beautiful environments. Writers who wield pens all know the saying "文章窮而後工" [Wenzhang qiong er hou gong, "Literature is only perfected in poverty"]. Du Fu produced his great poems in the thorns of the Bronze Camel, I think there is no need to use this to compare the relationship between the environment and career. In popular terms, Watt invented the steam engine, first relying only on a teapot, Edison made inventions in a backyard shack when he was young, Mrs. Stowe used wrapped yellow paper as manuscript paper and created her masterpiece "Uncle Tom's Cabin", which is still a beautiful story in the literary world. Similarly, the great musician Chopin suddenly had an inspiration and wrote the well-known song "Listen, Listen! This Burlesque" on the back of an envelope. If it is said that a harsh environment cannot produce a great career, the above examples are enough to refute this statement.

Sinclair Lewis, in his novel "Arrowsmith," satirized a well-funded, well-equipped, and magnificent medical research association in New York, saying that any true scientist does not need any magnificent equipment in the instrument room, he can only use the attic under his own roof as a research institute, give him a few toothpicks and a few glass tubes, and he can immerse himself in research. Doesn't this further prove that the environment is not enough to hinder a person's will and career?

In today's world of "Entering the Table Together in Darkness, Ten Thousand People Lamenting Together," a land of war, let's stick to our fixed environment and work hard, and stop hesitating!

### Interest and Life

— Hu Ruoliu

From the perspective of graduation, "interest" for "life" is the driving force behind a successful career. No matter what you do, if you can avoid depression and use interest in your career at all times, you will work hard.

But on the other hand, many failures are due to a lack of interest, so you are depressed and bored with everything, and you give up the idea of "working hard to create a new career."

Liang Qichao once said: "The sentence that Chinese people like to use most when they meet is: "What have you been doing for entertainment recently?" I hate hearing this sentence, as if life is unbearable, and I am reluctantly looking for something to pass the time. If a person lives in this state, I advise him to jump into the sea as soon as possible. I only hate that 24 hours a day cannot be expanded to 48 hours, which is not enough for me to enjoy. I never rest all year round. If you ask me what I am busy with, I am busy with my interests."

The person Liang said is a depressed breather, and the result is that nothing is accomplished. What about Liang himself? I think he is worthy of our imitation because he uses "interest" to motivate his career completely, and the result is that he is respected.

However, many people have interests, but they are not used properly. As Liang said: "Gambling...drinking...being an official...and so on, although they seem interesting in the short term, the result will be "no interest comes together!" So we cannot admit that he is interesting. The nature of all interests must start with interest and end with interest, so the following items can be the subject of interest: (2) Labor and games (3) Art (4) Knowledge."

For all interests, we should also use them in the right things, at least they are helpful to our careers.

Therefore, we must understand its true knowledge; it does not come from outside, but from the heart, for example, eating a forbidden fruit, bitter at first, sweet later, we must work hard without stopping, get considerable success, and the interest will naturally be strong.

### The Depression of the Times

— Chuan Wo

There is a surging passion, as magnificent and magnificent as the waves of the sea, this is a force that cannot be ignored, this is the source of youth's vitality; but the reality of society is often a place to destroy youth and fool youth, it tries its best to suppress the release of youth's passion, and extinguish the fire of youth's vitality; it cannot guide youth to the path of striving, and even refuses them to step on the path of renewal! In this environment, youth's courage is tormented and reduced everywhere. It is really what is called "the higher the Tao, the higher the demon", however, there are certainly many young people who have the courage and perseverance to stick to the end, and will never be overcome by the demons of society.

In general, the elders who call themselves "experienced" are actually prisoners of the old society, and they "teach" the youth "Learn some skills to deal with people!" "Your attitude is going to hit a wall in society!" "Your methods should be more flexible, your attitude should be more sociable, this is how you will not suffer losses." "...," there are countless words like this, but to sum it up in one sentence is to order the youth to surrender to society, to bow their heads to the old forces, and fundamentally eliminate the ideals of the youth to improve society and the great selfless spirit of the youth! They are the sinners of youth, they "push themselves to others," trying to push their own cowardly failures to the next generation and let them bear them; although, on the other hand, it can also be said that it is for the "good" of the next generation, but is this "good" we can accept? Accepting this "good" is no different from becoming a useless "echoing bug" and a sheep to be slaughtered by thousands of people, accepting this "good" is also no different from abandoning one's own mission to society. But if you don't accept it? The coldness of society and the iron face of the crowd are enough to make you depressed and decadent, and enough to make you fall into a state of loneliness and helplessness: really, the ruthless blow of reality to youth is too great, making them feel great pain, so the shadows of the past that can be missed have invaded the contemplation, grab it, maybe you can get a warm and sweet comfort; at the same time, in despair, the stagnant heart may also be taken to the distant future, where you seem to see a glimmer of hope, it is not impossible to comfort the heart that has lost warmth by holding it vaguely. --But, this is a sad fact, the youth who have detached themselves from reality have lost their vitality in sighs and longing.

However, can youth's decadence be entirely blamed on society? No, half of this responsibility should still be borne by the youth themselves! No matter what, reality is a touchstone of human strength, in the training of each era, the strong will stand upright resolutely, while the weak will eventually be eliminated; moreover, without the baptism of difficult times, great people will not be produced. Therefore, the youth who were born today can be said to be a lucky one of the times, we should cheer and jump for joy!

### The Trilogy of Experience

— Bai Liao

Every day, I have to pass a road, in fact, I don't have to pass this road, but because people always like to take shortcuts, so I have to pass it every day. This road is not good, it is not worthy of being described with words such as flat and Kangzhuang; it can only be said to be rough. And uneven.

But I am not afraid of its roughness and unevenness, I simply took this road because it was close.

One day, two days, three days………

Today, this is already one day nearly a month later, and I walked this road again, for its closeness, for me to increase my footprints, but today I found that this road is unusually flat.

Unusually flat, of course, does not mean that it is as flat as a smooth asphalt road, but it is much flatter than at the beginning. It is flat because of my walking, my footprints? No, because there are many people walking, many people's footprints.

At this time, I remembered a sentence by Mr. Lu Xun:

The road is trampled out by people. Although I knew this sentence a long time ago, I only now realize this sentence.

Knowing experience is valuable, experiencing experience is even more valuable, and practicing experience is truly valuable.

Young friends! Strive to know your experience, strive to experience your experience in life, and strive to practice your experience in every part of life!

Experience is the most precious knowledge in life.

### Roots

— Xin Bo

Da Gen was watching the bamboo utensils and wooden utensils displayed for sale. He was studying them, which style was new and good-looking, which one was well-made, and which one was durable.……

Suddenly there was a commotion that came straight from the temple. Amongst it, he could hear bits like 'Fight!…… Fight!……'

"Another fight, this is quite fun, it happens every year." A-Wu, who was enjoying the scenery, said with a smile, obviously gloating a little. As he spoke, he casually bought two catties of water chestnuts and gave a string to Da Gen as a token of appreciation. Da Gen took the water chestnuts without saying anything, still looking at the wooden and bamboo utensils. But quite a few people had crowded into the temple.

The commotion grew louder and louder, and gradually spread from inside the temple to outside. Many people first crowded out of the temple, shouting as well, "Fight! Beat these sons of bitches to death!..."

A group of people pulling and shoving each other, punching and kicking, came out of the temple gate. As soon as they came out, the people on the side rushed up, obviously not to watch the fun but to participate. Thus, the scene of the fight expanded outside the temple gate.

"Haha, how interesting, a good fight!" A-Wu was laughing loudly. "It's best to rush up and give them a couple of blows, to join in the fun!"

The gradual expansion of the scene knocked over quite a few water chestnut vendors, sugarcane carriers, and others who didn't have time to run away. Interspersed in the clamorous voices were the cries of children.

A fifteen- or sixteen-year-old boy, running out and shouting angrily, "The people from Shanbei started it first, the people from Shanbei started it first! They want to avenge last year's grudge, they're beating the people from Shannan, the people from Shannan hurry up and go up!"

Da Gen saw that it was his younger brother Hu Gen, and shouted, "A-Hu, A-Hu, don't mess around!"

Hu Gen saw Da Gen and ran over to say, "Brother, tell A-Wu to go up quickly, several people from Chongwen Town have already been beaten badly."

"Excellent!" As soon as A-Wu heard this, he immediately buttoned up the buttons on his chest, rolled up his sleeves, and plunged into the crowd.

"A-Wu brother! A-Wu brother!……" Da Gen was shouting, meaning to stop him, but it was no use.

"Big brother should go too!" Hu Gen was pulling on the corner of Da Gen's clothes. (29)

### Fifth Place Winner of the February Essay Contest: How to Read and What to Read?

— Jing An

"Travel ten thousand miles" and "read ten thousand books." I believe that people like this must have a very rich life experience, and their knowledge and scholarship must be very profound.

However, how easy is it to become someone with rich experience and profound knowledge, whose intellectual progress is endless, and who always occupies an outstanding position in society?

In ancient times, many people, due to poverty, could not afford to study. When their "desire for knowledge" was very strong, they often "carved a hole in the wall to steal light," "collected fireflies to read by snow," or borrowed books from others to recite and copy. Such painstaking pursuit of knowledge is worth emulating. However, this is only the superficial behavior. Regarding the question of "how to read and what to read," we must have a deep understanding. Because if you read without a method, how can you achieve the goals of "richness" and "profundity"?

Before discussing this question, we must first clarify what the purpose of reading is. Simply put, the purpose of reading is to "benefit oneself and others" and to "utilize resources for the betterment of life." In other words, the purpose of reading is to help the world and seek the welfare of society. However, many people, during their school years, have worked hard, neglecting sleep and meals, and studying diligently. From the perspective of those students who prioritize "high grades" and "first place," they naturally feel qualified to occupy an excellent position.

However, once they step into the colorful social environment, they are at a loss when encountering problems. Not only is their hard-earned "knowledge not applicable," but they also encounter setbacks everywhere and are ridiculed as "bookworms who are useless." Then, in your own heart, wouldn't you feel a bit of the pain of "all previous efforts being wasted"?

Therefore, I believe that the spirit of studying diligently like a "bookworm" is good; but at the same time, we must also pay attention to practice and polishing in application, so that we can achieve the goal of "applying what we have learned." Because the goal of reading is to "benefit oneself and others" and "utilize resources for the betterment of life," and we live in a vast and complex society that is "new every day," many things cannot be ignored. Therefore, we must read and experience life at the same time so that we can enrich our wisdom and acquire practical applications. Then, what should our attitude and method of reading be? I believe that the most important points are roughly as follows:

(1) Have an understanding of the needs of the times.

(2) Have the vision to choose and understand.

(3) Have the perseverance to take notes and annotations.

(4) Have the spirit of research and discussion.

(5) Have the experience of observation and investigation.

Since the attitude of reading is as described above, then what books should we read? Regarding this question, I remember that Mr. Lu Xun once said that those who study social sciences may wish to read literature, art, natural sciences, and other books when they have the opportunity; similarly, those who study specialized technologies should also read philosophy, literature, psychology, history, geography, law, and other books that seem unrelated to their own field when they have the opportunity. In this way, on the one hand, you can regulate your interest in reading, and on the other hand, you can use the advantages of other subjects to supplement the deficiencies of what you have learned. Because the world is changing rapidly, we must seek knowledge from many aspects to adapt to the needs of the environment. This is the attitude that must be adopted in reading and self-cultivation in the present era.

### Remembering Children's Day

But how could Dad be so cruel? Every time Xiao Hong saw a small reed mat rolled up on the open space at the door, she would spit on it more than a dozen times. But now, her younger brother is also...

Thinking and thinking, Xiao Hong arrived at the entrance of the park.

There were even more people this time. Electric cars were fully loaded and unloaded their passengers here. The streets were also full of groups of students in fresh clothes and small leather shoes, making crisp sounds. Some were accompanied by adults, carrying large bags of candy, pastries, and other things. No one came to buy Xiao Hong's peanuts and beans.

Carrying her basket, she followed behind two adults and a child in Western clothes who had just gotten out of a rickshaw, involuntarily squeezing in.

"Get out of here, you little beggar!" A thunderous voice rang out from beside the iron railing.

She was startled and almost dropped her basket. She looked at the face of the police officer and took a deep breath.

"Damn it!" -- She cursed in her heart.

But the two adults and the child in Western clothes finally squeezed in. Others also squeezed in one by one. Large groups of elementary school students also squeezed in. The only one who couldn't squeeze in was Xiao Hong.

She returned to the fence and placed the basket on the stone in front of her.

On the lawn inside the fence, the children were still there, and they were playing! Twenty or thirty people sat in a large circle. A boy in a green suit was walking around the outside of the circle, dropping a handkerchief behind a girl in a pink dress. The girl immediately noticed and picked up the handkerchief to chase him, but he ran fast, ran around the circle, and snatched the girl's empty seat to sit down...

"Ha..." Twenty or thirty people, including two female teachers, clapped their hands and cheered.

Several adults and eight or nine children watching nearby also laughed.

Xiao Hong also forgot herself and laughed.

But the laughter suddenly turned into her younger brother's urgent voice: "Xiao Hong! ... Xiao Hong! ... Something terrible! ... Go back quickly! Jin Di was kicked by the police! ... His head is broken..."

"What happened?" Xiao Hong picked up the basket and ran.

The room was dark and crowded with people. Jin Di closed his eyes and slept in his mother's arms, his head and face covered in bright red blood.

"Fetch some cold water!" Her father's rough voice.

Xiao Hong immediately took a broken basin, jumped onto the road, and went to the pond beside the railway opposite.

After scooping up water, she raised her head and took a breath.

Five or six kites floated in the sky, probably released by the children in the park!

### Report on the Solicitation of Winter Clothing Donations by Public and Private Primary and Secondary School Students

Last autumn, students of Aurora University in Shanghai, in view of the rising cost of living and the difficulties of the poor, launched a winter clothing donation campaign. Led by the male and female departments of the university, they invited Xuhui Middle School, Xiaoming Girls' Middle School, and the Sino-French Academy, Nagela Primary School, Saposai Primary School, Louis Primary School, Potential Virtue Primary School, and Qiude Primary School to donate separately. They also invited the French Cultural Radio Station to report the names of the donors and the amount of donations every day. In addition, alumni Hu Guoqiao and Fei Xizhen, in addition to donating items for sale, also invited famous Peking opera performers for voluntary performances with Hu Fangming, Cao Shiying, Li Yang, Yan Zhi Zhao, Chen Xiangquan, Hu Guopei, and Ms. Wu. The university also performed a drama. A total of 138,647.65 yuan was raised, and 1,854 sets of winter clothing of various sizes were purchased. Together with cash, they were handed over to the male and female departments of the university, the Fujian Fellow Association, the 29 districts of northern Jiangsu, and charitable organizations outside the city for distribution. The campaign lasted three months before it came to an end. It is truly commendable that the students of the university can devote their kind hearts and accomplish this good deed during their spare time. The number and amount of donations, detailed income and expenditure accounts, etc., have all been posted at the university.

The China Amateur Library is located on the seventh floor of the Pudong Fellow Association at the intersection of Edinburgh Road and Chengdu Road. Since the establishment of the board of directors, it has actively adjusted its organizational structure, revised its regulations, and made significant progress in its library affairs. The number of readers has increased dramatically. Recently, it has launched a campaign to solicit books and readers, and the response from all parties has been very enthusiastic.

Small Loans: Anonymous Mr. Zhao 500 yuan, Qiu Wenqing 100 yuan, He Hongsheng and Liang Guangai 30 yuan each, Wang Qingyan 20 yuan, and Mr. Zai 15 yuan. A total of 695 yuan was collected in storage coupons, leaving a balance of 9,835 yuan.

### Disabled and Distressed Children Should Be Rescued First

— Wang Jingyuan

Your newspaper recently launched a children's welfare symposium to discuss issues such as funding and care for distressed children. I cannot help but express my opinion that the "issue of education and care for disabled and distressed children" also needs attention. The creation of distressed children involves countless tragic facts: families broken, people dead, displacement, and extreme suffering. In addition, being disabled, those without arms cannot work; those paralyzed cannot move freely; those who are blind are in a dark hell all day long; those who are deaf and mute cannot hear sounds or speak, and cannot express their sincere intentions, leading to a lifetime of depression and ignorance. How sad! If these disabled people are fortunate enough to have a family or receive the legacy of their fathers and brothers, they can receive appropriate education to compensate for their disabilities. Now that they are both disabled and distressed, and have suffered disasters, there is no more tragic event in the world. Everyone has a heart of compassion. I hope that we healthy people can demonstrate human sympathy and mutual aid to rescue them.

Shen Bao has launched a fundraising campaign of 100,000 yuan to commemorate this year's Children's Day, to be used for the emergency relief of street children. This act of benevolence is admirable. However, it is hoped that disabled street children should be rescued as a priority and distributed to special education and care institutions, where education and care are combined to alleviate their suffering and transform useless disabled people into useful citizens who can benefit the country and society. Today, on behalf of a group of pitiful disabled compatriots, I sincerely pray to Shen Bao and all philanthropists for their success in this endeavor, which will bring boundless merit. The Fuyu School at 33 Huangjiasha Garden Road and the Blind Children's School at 290 Hongqiao Road have a long history and excellent results in running education for the disabled. However, they have recently been greatly affected by prices and are in extreme financial difficulties. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will generously donate to support education for the disabled. For donations, please call 32946, and someone will be sent to collect them."
