### Improving the Judiciary

The judiciary, within the political system, holds a transcendent position, with its own independent and sacred mission. "Crimes must be reported, and judgments must be fair" represents the ultimate goal of the legal system. In a society where this principle prevails, there will undoubtedly be consistent peace and stability, and the people's interests will certainly be fully protected. This holds true for a nation as well. Therefore, the degree of rigor in the judicial system and the extent to which legal efficacy is achieved can reveal the order of a country and its society.

Our country has long been working to establish a modern judicial system. The number of people studying law in specialized schools accounts for the largest portion of all academic disciplines. In terms of the sheer number of judicial talents, it can be said that there are more people than positions. However, in terms of the effectiveness of the rule of law, there is still a considerable distance from perfection. What is particularly disheartening is that judicial organs, in political institutions, objectively seem to have become a cold and forgotten corner, almost forgotten by the general public, or at least viewed as unimportant. Furthermore, the national expenditures on judicial funding do not occupy an important position. Judicial organs are makeshift and inadequate, giving a sense of desolation. Judicial personnel are poorly paid, leading to a mindset of complacency. A few unscrupulous individuals are even tempted by material desires, engaging in improper schemes. Under these circumstances, the transcendent and independent spirit of the rule of law is obscured, and social order fails to be consolidated. While the entire responsibility cannot be placed on the judicial organs, they are certainly not without blame for failing to fully fulfill their mission of upholding the rule of law. We hope that those in the judicial field will rise up, take responsibility with courage, and strive for continuous improvement, so as to achieve the effectiveness of the rule of law.

Since Shanghai's concession was taken over, judicial power has been unified. For judicial administration and the adjudication of cases within the Shanghai area, progress should logically be made gradually, converging towards unity compared to the concession era. This would set a precedent for a new atmosphere after the takeover of the concession. Especially after various friendly nations abolish extraterritorial rights, improvements in the judiciary, in particular, will serve as a benevolent response to those nations.

Recently, the authorities in the Ministry of Judicial Administration have been actively rectifying judicial administration and personnel matters. They are overcoming sentiments and arresting and punishing those who are greedy and accept bribes. We deeply admire the judicial authorities' emphasis on legal discipline. At the same time, we call for the consolidation of the entire judicial system and the full realization of the effectiveness of the rule of law. Regarding future policies for advancing judicial administration, we would like to offer a few words for the authorities' consideration:

First, the allocation of judicial funding should be determined and included in the national budget, just like other important political departments. To strengthen the judicial system, all necessary expenses should be willing, and in principle, there should be no bias or disparity.

Second, once funding is established, adjusting the compensation of judicial personnel is an urgent and unavoidable task. It is already difficult for administrative officials to be incorruptible, but it is even more difficult for judicial officials to maintain integrity. This is because judicial officials exercise their powers directly and have a vested interest with the parties involved, making them most susceptible to bribery and corruption. Therefore, the salaries of judicial officials must, in any case, be sufficient to support their personal and family lives. As the judicial elder Zhang Yipeng said, what is the income of a low-level judge today? Less than a rickshaw puller's. What is the income of a mid-level judge? Less than a barber's. What is the income of a high-level judge? Less than a store manager's. With such compensation, demanding such important responsibilities, it is indeed difficult for them to fulfill their duties. Of course, we do not mean to imply that low pay justifies seeking illicit gains. However, it is undeniable that low pay is a contributing factor to corruption.

We would like to propose the above two matters as prerequisites for improving the judiciary. As for other technical improvements, there is no shortage of suggestions from judicial experts, so we will not discuss them here for the time being.

### Chairman Wang Announces Recognition of the Provisional Government of India; Sino-Indian Relations Grow Closer

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Provisional Government of Free India was established on the 21st of last month, and the National Government has declared its recognition. The Chairman has also issued the following statement:

Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Indian Independence League, led the Indian people on the 21st of last month to establish a provisional government, hoping to break the shackles of British imperialism and achieve the long-cherished aspirations of Indian independence and autonomy. We are truly admiring and excited to hear this news. The Indian people have made many efforts and struggles to achieve independence and autonomy before today. Although British imperialism has been extremely cruel, it has not immediately succeeded. However, the Indian people are not discouraged by this, and the resistance movement is becoming increasingly vigorous. This spirit of perseverance is sufficient to overcome difficulties and ultimately succeed. Now that the Greater East Asia War has erupted, the Allied nation of Japan has used its naval and land forces to inflict a major blow on the ambitions and atrocities of the British Empire. The Allied nation of Japan has also called for the liberation of East Asia and the assistance of East Asian nations in achieving independence, thereby building mutual prosperity. Inspired by this, the Indian people's independence movement has reached a climax. Mr. Bose, with his abundant wisdom and experience in overcoming dangers, has emerged as the leader of the Indian independence movement, and will surely work together with the Allied nation of Japan and the nations of East Asia to thwart British imperialism's domination of the East, and further crush the Anglo-American scheme to occupy the world, so that Indian independence and East Asian co-prosperity can be realized simultaneously. Since China and India began trading, they have valued cultural harmony in history. Now, with a consistent political direction, the relationship between the two nations will become closer day by day, jointly advancing towards a bright future. I express my sincere congratulations and joy.

### Telegram of Congratulations to Bose

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Provisional Government of India has been declared established, and the National Government sent a telegram of recognition on the 1st through Foreign Minister Chu to Chairman Subhas Chandra Bose of India. Chairman Wang of the National Government sent a telegram of congratulations to Subhas Chandra Bose on the 2nd. The original telegram is as follows: "To His Excellency Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, I am delighted to learn that Your Excellency established a provisional government on the 21st of this month, leading the people to fight resolutely for independence and autonomy. I express my deep sympathy and believe that the long-cherished wish of the 300 million people of India to seek freedom will surely be fulfilled, and the day of brilliant glory is coming soon. I send this telegram to congratulate you and wish Your Excellency good health. Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China."

### Japanese Foreign Minister Holds Banquet

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) –

Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu held a welcome dinner at his official residence at 6:30 p.m. on the 2nd, hosting Subhas Chandra Bose and Lieutenant Colonel Hoss, Chief of Staff of the Indian National Army, Minister of State Sahay, as well as Privy Councilor Ishii, Director General of the Information Bureau Amau, Chairman of the Japan-India Association Ota Shinanojo, Ambassador to Burma Sawada, and others. The dinner ended at 8:30 p.m. in a cordial atmosphere.

Japanese Foreign Minister's Speech

During the dinner, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu delivered a welcoming speech, stating that India has been groaning under British oppression for a long time, and the suffering of India is the suffering of all Asia. The sorrow of India is also the sorrow of Asia. He was deeply grateful that Mr. Bose had emerged to fight for the freedom of India. The influence of the Anglo-Saxons in East Asia has been completely driven out, and the situation in India has improved. Today, the Japanese army has arrived at the gates of India, and Asia has resolutely risen, determined to control its own destiny. We are fighting to liberate Asia from the Anglo-Saxons and to seek peace and prosperity in Greater East Asia based on political equality and economic freedom. Therefore, it is natural that the desire for Indian independence has become even stronger after the success of the Japanese military operations. At this juncture, it is most opportune for India to establish the Provisional Government of Free India under the leadership of Mr. Bose. All the people of Asia deeply express their joy at this. The Japanese government's immediate recognition of the Provisional Government of India is nothing more than an expression of the enthusiasm of the Japanese people. Now, we must unite and work together to win the final victory and liberate Asia.

Bose's Reply Bose replied, saying that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, we have repeatedly received the sympathy and assistance of your country. Now, we are deeply grateful for your country's recognition of the Provisional Government of Free India. I deeply feel the great responsibility of my Indian people. We must fight for freedom until we completely defeat the enemy. I am confident that with the strong support of your country, we will be able to achieve liberation. I am deeply ashamed that I cannot repay the sympathy and assistance given by your government and your people. I am confident that we will be able to stand on the battlefield and fight against the enemy, and we will be able to overcome all difficulties and endure sacrifices to show our gratitude. When we use our blood to achieve our common goals, Asia will be built on a truly lasting foundation. Only with the blood and enthusiasm of our Asian people can we exchange for the brightness of Asia.

### Subhas Chandra Bose Issues Statement Yesterday

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, met with a group of reporters on the 2nd and issued a statement expressing his gratitude to Japan for recognizing the Provisional Government of Free India. He also said that the morale of the entire Indian National Army to "Go to Delhi" will be even higher due to the birth of this provisional government. The main points of Mr. Bose's statement are as follows: After I assumed the position of Chairman of the Indian Independence League, I first strengthened the League and reorganized the Indian National Army. The main points I proposed to the League were total mobilization, and in response to the expectations of the Indian National Army, I directly assumed command of the army. "Go to Delhi" is the slogan of our army, and it has achieved great success in the army. Now, all of our soldiers are familiar with this slogan, and the only hope of all members is to start frontline work as soon as possible. After the reorganization and expansion of the Indian National Army, the Independence League was reorganized. We have reached the stage of making final preparations to begin the struggle for freedom. At this stage, it is necessary to establish the Provisional Government of Free India. The recognition of our government by the Government of the Empire of Japan has dealt a fatal blow to the enemy's propaganda against the new cooperative relationship between Japan and India. Now, we have gained the sincere trust of three million Indians residing in East Asia, and they are fully supporting our army. Moreover, we are now in close contact with the freedom movement within our country, so even the enemy cannot underestimate the importance of the Provisional Government. Since the Great Rebellion of 1857, it is the first time that the Indian people have risen up with weapons against the British under the leadership of their own government. There is no historical precedent for establishing a provisional government abroad. From our standpoint, it would be better to establish a provisional government within India. However, under today's circumstances, most of the well-known leaders of India are imprisoned, and the people within the country have been disarmed by the British. It is absolutely impossible to establish a provisional government within India and promote participation in the war under the leadership of the provisional government. Therefore, the Indians in East Asia must take on this important responsibility. The Provisional Government is not just for propaganda. The mission of the Provisional Government is to gain freedom and make a final struggle, expel British and American forces from India, and then establish peace and order in India. Therefore, the foundation for establishing a permanent, free Indian national government that integrates the will of the Indian people has been laid. Once this government is established, the current Provisional Government will immediately dissolve. The Provisional Government is a fighting organization, so it only has representatives necessary to carry out the struggle for freedom. When the Provisional Government advances into the territory of its home country, it will also decide to establish all the departments of a normal government. The mission of the Provisional Government is to begin and carry out the war for freedom, so the authority of the military representatives is greater than that of the representatives of the general administrative aspects of the cabinet. In short, from all aspects, the Provisional Government is an institution that implements warfare. Now, it has an army sufficient to protect the Indian people and the support of strong allies. Therefore, everything needed for future success has been obtained. From now on, only the final struggle will begin to obtain freedom. The anti-Axis countries all tout freedom and democracy and pay lip service to the Atlantic Charter, but they suppress the countries under their control and seize the freedom of countries such as Iran and Iraq. Looking at Japan, it has successively promised independence to the Philippines and Burma, and has recognized the Provisional Government of Free India. Since India accounts for one-fifth of the world's population,

Supporting the independence movement of India truly contains great significance and individuality. I believe that it is easy to judge who in the world is fighting for justice and morality.

### Minister Lin Xuan Broadcasts to the Nation: A Just Peace and an Alliance of Righteousness

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Minister Lin Xuan of the Department of Propaganda broadcast to the nation from 9:30 p.m. to 10:15 p.m. on the 2nd, with the theme "A Just Peace and an Alliance of Righteousness" on the Central Broadcasting Station. He first mentioned that the revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty was realized on October 30th. After everyone read the full text of the new treaty and listened to the Chairman's instructions, they gained infinite courage for the country's future and the overall situation in East Asia. Next, he explained the following three questions: Why can we obtain such just peace terms? What about Chongqing after obtaining just peace terms? Finally, he said that we must also work hard for the country's security and development, for the co-prosperity and liberation of East Asia, saving on clothing and food, and diligently performing our public duties. We must also loudly appeal here to practice the Sino-Japanese Alliance and realize a just peace, consolidate the alliance of righteousness, mobilize all manpower and material resources, implement the final battle, defeat the British and Americans, revive China, and defend East Asia.

### Minister Kishi Expresses His Impressions

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) –

Mr. Kishi Iwaichi, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in China, went to Japan on official business some time ago. Having completed his mission, he returned to Nanjing some days ago. The Central News Agency reporter specially paid a visit and was pleased to receive his impressions on various points that the reporter asked about, as follows: I originally wanted to come to Nanjing before the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty was concluded, but due to bad weather, the plane could not take off. I returned to Shanghai on October 31st and arrived in Nanjing on the 1st, failing to participate in the grand ceremony of the Sino-Japanese alliance, which I deeply regret. This trip back home was quite short, staying only ten days in a flash. The deepest impression of this trip is the enthusiasm of the general young students in the country for building Greater East Asia. Now, Japanese teenagers see the importance of the current situation and are unwilling to idle in schools, strongly advocating that they all rise up and give up their studies to join the military, serving the country and fulfilling the great mission of liberating the Asian nations. Their will is very firm. At the same time, Japanese women are also doing their best in the production sector in the rear. Now, most of the general work in Japan, except for those that must be operated by men under the age of 45, is done by women, and they are showing great efficiency. Whether they are talented ladies or ordinary women, they are united in their efforts to increase production. Therefore, Japan's wartime lineup is becoming stronger and stronger. Only young children are idle all day long. I predict that the new batch of reinforcements in Japan, coupled with the cooperation of the Allied nation of China, will definitely make the future of the Greater East Asia War very bright.

### Special Broadcast on the Sino-Japanese Alliance

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Today is the third day of the special broadcast on the Sino-Japanese Alliance. In order to make the people of the whole country understand the significance of the alliance treaty concluded between China and Japan, the Propaganda Department specially invited well-known figures from the cultural circles, news commentators, and critics in the capital to hold a broadcast symposium at the Central Broadcasting Station at 3:20 p.m. today. The broadcast stations from all circles.

### Telegrams from All Sectors Pay Respects to Chairman Wang

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Since the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new and epoch-making stage. The whole country enthusiastically supports it and sends telegrams to Chairman Wang to pay their respects. The names of the sectors are recorded below: Hubei Provincial Governor Yang Kuiyi and the heads of various departments and bureaus. Representatives of the New People's Society. The Chinese Youth Corps of the Anbei Provincial Party Department. Zhou Xuechang, Commander of the Nanjing Special City Corps, and Li Jinshi, City Youth.

### US Coal Miners in Serious General Strike; Roosevelt Ordered Acceptance of All Mines the Night Before Last

Akan City, Argentina, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from New York, the temporary resumption of work by coal miners in the eastern United States expired at midnight on the 31st. Now, a general strike has virtually occurred. Workers belonging to the Coal Miners Union left their workplaces between midnight on the 31st and the morning of the 1st. Although the Coal Miners Union authorities have not yet issued a general strike order, according to reports from coal mines across the country, 530,000 miners had left their workplaces within a day, and it is reported that the union branches in major coal mining areas, such as smokeless and smoky mines, have issued instructions to the miners who have left the mines to begin a strike. According to the United Press's survey of various locations on the morning of the 1st, 240,000 miners in the states of West Virginia and Virginia have expressed their determination to strike. In addition, the 22,000 miners in Alabama, who were the first to start the strike, have also stated that they will not resume work until a new contract is established. In addition, it is expected that 23,000 in southern Illinois, 12,000 in Indiana, 25,000 in Ohio, 33,000 in Kentucky, 18,000 in Virginia, and 75,000 miners in western states will participate in the strike. The Coal Miners Union General Assembly also convened about 200 representatives from various local branches on the morning of the 1st in Washington to hold a policy committee. The meeting may end in the afternoon. It is not yet clear whether it will decide to order a general strike or ask the striking workers to resume work immediately. However, judging from the current strike situation in various places, even if the General Assembly does not approve the strike, a general strike may be difficult to avoid. Therefore, the government may take a strong stance on this.

Akan City, Argentina, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Washington, Roosevelt ordered the seizure of coal mines on the evening of the 1st. At the same time, Interior Secretary Ickes also signed an executive order to accept all coal mines producing more than 30 tons of coal per day and appointed the mine owners as trustees of the coal mines. Roosevelt specified in the seizure order that the striking workers resume work before noon on the 3rd. If the workers refuse to resume work, they will be severely punished in accordance with the Anti-Strike Act. The Coal Workers Union authorities have not expressed their opinions on the President's move. It is believed that the Coal Workers Union will convene a policy committee at 4:00 p.m. on the 2nd to order the workers to stop the strike.

### Labor Unrest Spreads to Western Canada

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – New York News: The US miner turmoil has now spread to Western Canada. 1,400 miners in Knat Tuthum, Kim Guan, Vancouver, Bilingsiden, British Columbia, and other places have gone on strike due to demands for a day off and increased wages. The US Miners Federation's policy committee failed to decide on effective action at yesterday's meeting. During the negotiation period between mine owners and unions, the policy committee decided to hand it over to a subcommittee to decide. Its report is expected to be issued today.

### Japan's Imperial Headquarters Announced the Battle Situation on New Guinea Island Yesterday; Preparations for the Next Phase of Operations on the Yunnan-Burma Border

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Japan's Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 p.m. on the 2nd: The battle situation on New Guinea Island, near Finschhafen, our troops heavily damaged the enemy forces with a brave offensive and then reorganized their positions in preparation for another battle.

Since late September, the damage inflicted on the enemy has been no less than a thousand. On the Yunnan-Burma border, the war is progressing smoothly. The troops on our side have completely cut off the retreat route of the Chongqing army west of the Nu River, sweeping away the remnants of the enemy everywhere, and preparing for the next phase of operations. The main battle results obtained by our army from the first ten days of October to the 27th are as follows: 1,020 enemy bodies were abandoned, 110 prisoners were captured, and approximately 23,000 rounds of ammunition were seized.

### Macao Correspondence: The US Air Force Stationed in Chongqing Is Nominal

— Jian Ping

Anti-sentiment Arises Among Chongqing Soldiers and Civilians

The American Air Force stationed in Chongqing takes Kunming as its base, and sets up forward bases with Guilin, Chongqing, etc. as intermediary bases. It originally hoped to air raid the Japanese mainland and cut off the supply route to the south. Since the end of July to the beginning of this month, it has been continuously air raided by Japanese aircraft, and all bases have been severely damaged, especially with heavy losses in aircraft, equipment, and air force personnel. Therefore, Stilwell and other top leaders flew to New Delhi to discuss the reorganization of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the replenishment of personnel and equipment with the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Command. The continuous defeats of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing have greatly disappointed Chongqing, thus making the pessimistic view of the future of the war of resistance more profound and widespread. Chongqing originally expected the US Air Force to send cadres and supply aircraft and other materials to rebuild the Chongqing Air Force. However, the United States refused this request and dispatched its own air force to Chongqing, forcing the Chongqing army to bear the base construction and ground work. Regarding combat, it also refused to contact the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission. As a result, the "guests dominated the host," making Chongqing a subordinate of the US Air Force.

Chongqing still advocates slogans such as "The United States is helping China in the war, and all our soldiers and civilians should repay it with righteousness," providing various conveniences in operations, and undertaking local tasks such as construction, communication, and meteorological observation in a certain place. Soldiers and civilians in various places even set up banquets and treated the American Air Force with suspicion. However, the tyrannical American Air Force absolutely did not contact the Chongqing army in combat, so Chongqing felt disappointed and angry. This is not only due to the secretiveness of the US Air Force, but also due to the US Air Force's distrust of the Chongqing army and its adherence to egoism. Therefore, the US Air Force has not yet fought with the Chongqing army, and there is almost no assistance in its operations. For example, when Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing at the end of July, the US Air Force abandoned the Chongqing army's P34 fighter jets and fled in a panic. This egoism of the US military has aroused resentment among the soldiers and civilians of Chongqing. Although the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Command is currently discussing ways to strengthen the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, Chongqing's distrust of it is increasing day by day. (Mailed on October 24)

### Burma Front: Japanese Air Force Active, Shot Down 30 Enemy Aircraft

Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – After the rainy season on the Burma front, the air war has become increasingly fierce. Japanese aircraft squadrons in this area shot down 30 enemy aircraft in mid-October, including 22 unified P34 models and other large aircraft, and the rest were P34P34 and other types of fighter aircraft. At the same time, joint formations of Japanese fighter-bombers have bombed enemy ships and military facilities in the Arakan region several times in a row, achieving great results. During this period, four Japanese aircraft crashed or did not return.

### Enemy Aircraft Attacking Bougainville Island Shot Down Seventeen

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific on the 2nd, a total of 130 enemy fighter-bombers attacked the Japanese army positions on Buka Island, the northern end of Bougainville Island, twice on the morning of the 1st.

### Japanese Army Clears Communist Troops in Shanxi Province

Beijing, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese forces in Shanxi province, aiming to reduce the strength of the communist troops operating in the southern and northern parts of the province, launched a fierce attack on September 26th and are currently engaged in a clearing operation near Xingjing. Japanese troops reached the Yellow River area on September 28th, securing key river crossing points. Simultaneously, the main Japanese force shifted its focus, traversing treacherous mountain ranges to sweep through various areas, expanding their gains. As of now, the results achieved by the Japanese army are as follows: 605 communist soldiers killed, 7 communist facilities destroyed, 11 light machine guns seized, 4 grenade launchers, 136 rifles, and 15 pistols, including automatic rifles and a large quantity of other military supplies.

Beijing, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - On October 2nd, Japanese troops initiated an operation in the Taiyue Mountains, unexpectedly breaking through the communist forces’ defenses in the rugged terrain and launching a new offensive. They first moved south, decisively defeating the main communist force, completely destroying military facilities and economic bases in the area, inflicting heavy damage. Subsequently, they forced the defeated communist troops towards the north bank of the Yellow River, now beyond the areas of Lüxian and Zezhou. The Japanese operation to clear communist troops in the Taiyue Mountains is now nearing its final stage.

### Viceroy of India Seeks Military Solution to Famine

Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - It is reported that the Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell, in an attempt to address the escalating famine issue in the Bengal province, has effectively implemented military administration in the province, seeking a solution through force. Following his inspection of the disaster situation in the province, Wavell convened a relief strategy meeting in Calcutta on the night of October 29th, bringing together relevant parties to study countermeasures. Upon returning to New Delhi on the 30th, he appointed Lieutenant General Wickery as the Governor of Bengal province. Wickery has reportedly taken office, directing his subordinates to adopt a policy of military suppression to seek a swift resolution to the problem. Wavell's adoption of this emergency policy stems from the realization that the escalation of this issue is related to British domestic political problems and that he is trying to prevent the National Congress Party from exploiting this opportunity.

### Eastern Front Southern Sector Enters Third Stage, Fierce Battles for Crimea Erupt

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - A military commentator from the German News Agency reports: "The fighting on the Eastern Front has reached a climax. The second stage is over. Judging from various observations, the third stage is approaching, but this will depend on winter weather conditions.

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a report from the Huitong News Agency: "The battle for the Crimean Isthmus and Crimea must be viewed as part of the overall war. Although Soviet mobile units briefly penetrated our lines near the estuary, the enemy's advance towards Nikopol has not seen significant progress. However, their westward and southwestward advance is gradually gaining momentum. Nevertheless, the direction of the battle remains unpredictable, as the fighting between the enemy's mobile units that broke through the lower reaches of the Dnieper River and the Soviet mobile reserves continues. The gateway to Crimea remains in German hands, posing a constant threat to the flanks of the Soviet troops that have broken through. In short, the battles on the Nogai Steppe and in the Dnieper bend are closely related. In the latter area, Soviet attempts to attack the right wing of the German lines have been repelled. The German offensive against Soviet troops that broke through north and northwest of Krivoy Rog is progressing smoothly. Despite strong resistance, the German vanguard, reinforced by allied forces, is engaged in fierce fighting. In conclusion, while the fighting on the southern sector of the Eastern Front has reached its peak, no decisive outcome has yet been achieved. Both sides are concentrating all their efforts there, and the situation in other areas has gradually become calmer.

### German Forces in Italy Implement Delaying and Attrition Warfare, Complete Objectives and Defend New Front Lines

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German military authorities announced today that German forces in southern Italy have withdrawn from Guarone, located eleven miles east of Isernia. German forces on the western flank of this battle line continue to implement a delaying and attrition strategy. After inflicting heavy losses on the enemy through deliberate counterattacks over the weekend, German forces, as planned, retreated to new front lines located several kilometers behind. Although enemy forces have advanced to these new front lines, they have yet to grasp the German strategy. The enemy appears to be waiting for the effects of the advance of the main US forces in the central sector. These US forces, starting from the upper Volturno River, have turned west, apparently intending to attack Venafro and the Miletto Mountains. Conversely, the US military seems to have the intention of advancing north to attack Venafro and Monte Miletto. Enemy forces advancing towards Venafro from the Volturno Valley have been repelled. In the central Apennine Mountains, on the Venchiaturo-Isernia highway, and west of Campobasso, where the left flank of the British Eighth Army is operating, the situation has not changed significantly, and at least the enemy's pressure has not increased. The right wing of the British Eighth Army has gradually approached the upper and middle reaches of the Trigno River, but there is no sign of crossing the river. The bridgehead established by the coastal British forces on the north bank of the river is under constant threat from German artillery fire and has not been expanded.

Artillery Battle Occurs on the Western Coast

Berlin, 2nd (German News Agency dispatch) - Fierce fighting in the Volturno River basin continued on Sunday, while only scattered localized activity occurred in the Apennine Mountains. German coastal artillery units stationed near Gaeta on the western coast of Italy prevented attempts by British and American forces to bombard the city with naval artillery and drove away enemy warships. At the same time, military operations by German forces in the mountains on either side of the upper Volturno River and on the western coast have begun to show their effectiveness. The German forces there are utilizing the mountains as natural defensive lines and overcoming the various difficulties of the terrain with excellent skill. The German protection units in the southern mountainous area near the Volturno River, after completing their tasks in the fierce fighting of the past five days, have withdrawn to higher mountain positions, further increasing the enemy's supply difficulties. German forces withdrew from Pratella and Prata Sannita in the upper Volturno River area, while also abandoning the village of Carinola on the coast. British and American forces attempted to prevent the German withdrawal east of the Volturno River, resulting in fierce fighting. Although outnumbered, the German forces were able to hold their positions, and the German movements throughout the afternoon and evening were strongly protected.

### Turkey Has a Strong Determination to Safeguard Independence and Freedom, President İsmet İnönü Reaffirms Policy

Ankara, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Turkish President İsmet İnönü declared in his opening speech to parliament yesterday that the policy Turkey has adhered to over the past eight years is based on the principles of national independence and freedom. He stated, "Our foreign policy, since the crisis of 1935, has not changed. Our current view is still to uphold the principles of national independence and freedom to protect the foundation of our culture. Our political efforts tend to oppose those who attempt to undermine this culture. In order to avoid the scourge of war, we have unhesitatingly participated in actions that require the greatest courage. We have now witnessed the world's crisis gradually advancing on a destructive path, not only is the great work of culture frequently destroyed, but culture itself is buried in the rubble. This cruel and chaotic scramble for power has threatened the survival of all nations, and this chaotic war is intensifying and overturning all foundations built on humanitarianism. Our future course is clear. Although Turkey has not yet entered the scourge of war, it has been affected by the world crisis for four years and has made various sacrifices and efforts to overcome difficulties. For the sake of the whole world and for the sake of all mankind breathing free air, we are willing to endure all sacrifices. We wish that the victors in this war will be culture and humanity, and only in the unity with those who defend humanity and culture can we see the dawn of happiness and universal freedom." President İsmet stressed that defense should be strengthened at any opportunity, and parliament should trust that the Turkish army is sufficient to cope with any eventuality and task. The government's main task is to provide the army with excellent training and equipment.

Abstract Wording, Deep Meaning - Istanbul, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - President İnönü's speech to parliament explaining Turkey's foreign policy, based on maintaining the civilizational foundations of freedom and independence and rejecting the destructive forces of military politics and war, has attracted great attention as Turkey's attitude is being watched by the great powers. He did not use the word "neutrality" in his speech, which was especially emphasized by diplomatic circles in Ankara. The President also stated that Turkey rejects violent politics and is prepared to cooperate in maintaining order, which is also emphasized by diplomatic circles in various countries. It is generally believed that the President's use of such cautious language reflects the difficulty of Turkey's situation, and although the content of his speech is extremely abstract, it has very deep meanings.

### Special Rationing of Sugar Readjusted, All Rationing Stopped Except Those Approved by the Economic Department

Central News Agency Dispatch - Since the implementation of sugar rationing based on population, the stock of sugar of Shanghai's Chinese merchants has long been completely allocated. Although the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office has ordered a large amount of sugar, the supply of sugar within this year should not be insufficient. However, in order to save on sugar consumption, the Shanghai authorities have specially readjusted the special sugar rationing. This readjustment measure will be implemented in a uniform manner throughout the city. The details are as follows:

Re-establishing Rationing Methods to Conserve Sugar Consumption

Sugar is one of the main food sources for the 5 million citizens of Shanghai. In the past, the serious threat to the sugar supply was alleviated through the joint implementation of population-based sugar rationing by the Municipal Food Bureau and related parties. However, the stock of sugar in Shanghai is limited. Under the wartime system, conservation should be practiced. In order to conserve sugar consumption, the Economic Department of the authorities has, based on the principle of reviewing the legitimate needs, re-established the rationing method for special sugar in the first and eighth districts. The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office is required to strictly comply with the implementation. It is also hoped that other districts will take the same steps to promote the strengthening of the wartime system and support the government's aim to save resources.

Special Sugar Rationing Requires More Than One Million Jin Per Month

In the past, the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office rationed the following amounts of special sugar each month: pharmacies, 54,000 jin; hotels, restaurants, and cafes, 100,000 jin; confectionery factories, 620,000 jin; companies, firms, banks, temples, schools, and government agencies, 56,000 jin; hotels and other stores, 240,000 jin; foreign firms, shops, and factories, 66,000 jin. In total, the actual amount of sugar rationed each month reached a massive 1,136,000 jin.

The Economic Department Reviews the Need for Special Rationing

Regarding the interim measures for the readjustment of special sugar rationing established by the Economic Department, all special sugar rationing for companies, firms, banks, temples, schools, hospitals, government agencies, and foreign firms, shops, and factories will be completely stopped in the future. The rationing of sugar to pharmacies and hotels will also be temporarily stopped. In addition to preparing an application for sugar, each of these businesses must also provide a detailed report to the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, including the total amount of sugar used for their products, a description of sugar usage, and the amount of sugar in stock at the end of the month. After careful discussion with the Health Department, those deemed necessary or those that can be reduced will be selected. After review and approval by the Economic Department, a notification will be issued. The rationing of hotels, restaurants, and cafes will also be handled in accordance with the above regulations. For the sugar supply of confectionery factories, each manufacturer must clearly state the various quantities of sugar used for their products and the quantity of goods sold, as well as a description of sugar usage and the inventory of finished confectionery, and submit a separate report. This will also be reviewed and determined by the Economic Department before the quantity of sugar supplied is rationed.

Proper Sugar Supply Can Eliminate the Black Market

This measure by the Economic Department will not only ensure an adequate supply to legitimate businesses and promote the general conservation of sugar consumption, but it will also eliminate the black market for sugar. Since businesses are receiving a normal supply of sugar, there will be no surplus sugar to supply the black market. The first and eighth districts have already complied with the implementation, and other districts will also take the same steps to promote conservation.

The distribution date for the eighth phase of sugar for households is set from today until the 12th. Citizens in the first and eighth districts can purchase sugar with the eighth sugar purchase certificate. Retail stores, upon receiving each eighth certificate with the store number, should sell half a jin of refined white sugar, priced at 2.4 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, excluding packaging costs. The retail tax is temporarily waived. The district offices of both districts have notified merchants accordingly.

### Concrete Plan for Coal Briquette Rationing Drafted, Expected to be Implemented This Month

The coal briquette problem remains extremely alarming. Illegal retail stores, seeing that coal briquettes will soon be rationed, are ramping up their speculative activities to reap illegal profits. Currently, stores are secretly trading factory shipments on the black market, greatly harming legitimate users. It has been learned that in addition to severely investigating illegal stores, the authorities are intensifying efforts on rationing. Once rationing is implemented, the black market can be fundamentally eliminated. The relevant authorities have now completed a concrete plan for the implementation of coal briquette rationing and have obtained accurate household counts from the Baojia system. The monthly demand has also been calculated. Preliminary decisions have also been made regarding the division of retail merchant districts. With the efforts of all parties, rationing is expected to be implemented this month.

### After Watching "Gone with the Wind"

- Tianxiao

Generally, when adapting a novel into a play, it is important to carefully cut and reduce it, condensing it into several acts, but without losing its essence. I think adapting a novel into a play is more difficult than writing a play from scratch. If a foreign novel is adapted into a Chinese play, there will inevitably be many compromises and contrivances, which is even more difficult compared to adapting a Chinese novel. Mr. Zhu Fan adapted Ms. Mitchell's American novel "Gone with the Wind," which depicts the situation during the American Civil War, into a Chinese drama with considerable skill and thought. For example, Scarlett O'Hara married two husbands before marrying Rhett Butler, and he combined the two husbands into one.

Regarding the performance of "Gone with the Wind": it can be said to be a play with Lan Kai as the central character. Lan Kai is very capable of portraying a woman with a strong personality who is constantly oppressed by men. Ms. Mitchell's novel not only writes about racial inequality but also about gender inequality. Scarlett O'Hara is the protagonist of the play, while Rhett Butler and Ashley Wilkes are the more important characters. Shi Hui's role as Ashley Wilkes is simply inconsequential, and even with talent, he cannot show it. I think if Shi Hui played Rhett Butler, perhaps he could develop it a little? That is my personal thought.

Any play that can move people is a good play. "Gone with the Wind" is enough to move people. However, I think the last scene should be slightly changed and made brighter. When Rhett Butler angrily leaves and Scarlett O'Hara asks to go with him, the audience will not say that Scarlett O'Hara has realized the truth but will say that Scarlett O'Hara is subservient (especially the female audience). This is not a question of the drama itself but of Scarlett O'Hara's personality.

### Report on Scholarship Donations

The following is a list of the Shen Bao scholarship donations received yesterday: Kang Na Xin Confectionery Factory, 1,000 yuan; Pei Bingxi (transferred from Mr. Li Runtian's 50th birthday celebration), 500 yuan; Mr. Wang (savings from daily thrift), 200 yuan; Mr. Chen Xinbo, Mr. Jun, 100 yuan each; Mr. Bian, 40 yuan; Mr. Tang, Pu Jiting (praying for health of relatives and friends remotely), 10 yuan each; total received, 1,960 yuan. The remaining balance is 2,448,704 yuan.

Yesterday's broadcast time was 7:40 PM.

### Unified Fundraising for Welfare Expenses: Central Government and Shanghai Establish Committees, First Joint Meeting Held Today

There is a general desire for the unified fundraising of social welfare expenses. The Ministry of Social Welfare of the National Government, after collecting opinions from various parties several months ago, drafted the "Essentials for Unified Fundraising of Social Welfare Expenses in Provinces, Cities, and Counties," which was submitted to and approved by the Executive Yuan meeting and has been promulgated and implemented by the Executive Yuan. Hereafter, it will be more convenient for provinces, cities, and counties to raise welfare funds based on this.

In the past, privately run social welfare undertakings often arbitrarily solicited donations from outside to subsidize themselves. From now on, in addition to complying with the "Essentials for Unified Fundraising of Social Welfare Expenses in Provinces, Cities, and Counties," there will also be "Regulations for Fundraising Expenses for Privately Run Social Welfare Undertakings," which have been submitted by the Ministry of Social Welfare to the Executive Yuan for approval and will be promulgated and implemented soon.

Shanghai Committee Members Determined

According to the "Essentials for Unified Fundraising of Welfare Expenses in Provinces, Cities, and Counties," each province, city, and county should establish a local Welfare Expenses Fundraising Committee. It is learned that the Shanghai Special Municipality Committee will be established soon. The organization and membership of the committee have been carefully discussed by the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Shanghai Municipal Government and have been determined. The chairman of the committee is usually concurrently held by the director of the local Social Welfare Bureau. However, due to Shanghai's special circumstances, Director Sun Mingduo expressed his reluctance. It has now been decided not to appoint a chairman, and the standing committee members will be responsible. The names of the standing committee members are listed below:

Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, , Wen Lanting.

The names of the committee members are as follows (in order of the number of strokes in their surnames): Wang Boyuan, Shen Siliang, Wu Yunzhai, Zhou Zuomin, Sun Mingduo, Ling Xianwen, Xu Tieshan, Tang Shoumin, Qin Runqing, Chen Bin , Huang Jinrong, Xiang Kangyuan, Ye Fuxiao, Pan Da, Pan Sanxing. The committee will have one secretary-general, responsible for handling daily affairs, concurrently held by Director Sun of the Social Welfare Bureau for convenience. The office will be located within the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

Central Committee Also Established in Shanghai

It is also learned that the Ministry of Social Welfare has also established a Central Social Welfare Expenses Fundraising Committee, responsible for fundraising for national welfare expenses. The chairman of the committee is concurrently held by Minister Ding. The standing committee members and committee members are completely consistent with the Shanghai Welfare Expenses Committee. In the future, it is planned to recruit some celebrities and gentry from other provinces and cities to participate as committee members. The Central Fundraising Committee will have one secretary-general, concurrently held by Committee Member Sun Mingduo. The office will also be located in Shanghai, so that the central and Shanghai committees can work together seamlessly, unifying authority and facilitating overall planning. Minister Ding has put a lot of effort into this.

Joint Meeting Held Today

After consultation between the central government and the Shanghai Social Welfare Expenses Fundraising Committees, it has been decided to hold the first joint meeting at 3:00 PM on the 3rd, at the former French Club in the Eighth District. Minister Ding will personally preside over the meeting, and Secretary-General Zhao will represent the Shanghai Municipal Government. All standing committee members and committee members will attend enthusiastically to discuss everything and work hard to promote the cause.

### Minister Songdao Discusses Wartime System in Japan; Japanese People All Have Unwavering Belief in Victory

Central News Agency Report: Colonel Songdao Keizo, the naval attaché of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, recently returned to Tokyo on official business to investigate the realities of Japan's wartime system. Now that he has completed his official duties and returned to Shanghai, Colonel Songdao met with a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday and made a statement on the current situation, saying: "This time, I returned to Tokyo on official business and witnessed the reality of the wartime system in Japan. In short, the entire Japanese population has an unwavering belief in victory in battle. There is no sign of fatigue or weakness anywhere in Japan. I am confident that even if the Greater East Asia War is prolonged, there will be no cause for concern. Of course, there are considerable restrictions on food, but this is an inevitable measure for a country establishing a wartime system. In other words, it is in preparation for future battles. Therefore, it is a mistake to make erroneous comments. Compared with the extreme dissatisfaction with food shortages in enemy countries like England and America, we can feel much more victorious. Women in Japan are all wearing short clothes, preparing for fearless air defense combat deployment. Students are also participating in suicide squads to go to the front lines, and the rest are also full of enthusiasm, hoping to serve the country after school. Seeing this situation, I am deeply grateful. A certain young man said to me: 'We will do our best to win the war. What we hope is to shout 'Long live the Emperor' at the last minute and die. We have no other request than to die in the right place.' I hope that the peoples of East Asia, who share the common goal of defeating England and America, can embody Japan's unified fighting spirit."

### Cigarette Evaluation Committee to be Established; Efforts to be Made to Suppress the Black Market

Although the Shanghai cigarette black market has been suppressed by the authorities, it is still extremely rampant. It is learned that in order to completely eliminate the cigarette black market, the authorities will take further measures. For cigarettes with fixed prices, all small retailers and retailers must strictly abide by the fixed prices. For other cigarettes without fixed prices, which can be hoarded and manipulated by unscrupulous merchants, the authorities will also evaluate and fix prices. A Cigarette Evaluation Committee will be organized for evaluation. Therefore, in the future, all cigarettes on the market will have a standard price.

Appealing for Assistance from Police Authorities

In order to make the crackdown effective, the authorities will, in addition to implementing various necessary measures, also appeal for assistance from the police authorities. Currently, the authorities have dispatched personnel to various cigarette shops to secretly investigate any illegal activities. At the same time, personnel have also been dispatched to entertainment venues, restaurants, and hotels to investigate. Street vendors will also be strictly prohibited.

Economic Commentary

### Weaving and Spinning

Since the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, our greatest hope is, on the one hand, the early announcement and implementation of a reasonable yarn and cloth allocation plan, so that the supply of clothing for the people is not scarce, and on the other hand, to continue to strive for the manufacturing of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, so that the supply of products is not interrupted. Both - allocation and production - must go hand in hand, and then we can talk about an inexhaustible supply of materials, creating a wartime economic prosperity.

On the eve of the imminent announcement and implementation of the yarn and cloth allocation plan, we can be optimistic about the future of yarn and cloth production because the facts tell us that the operating status of Chinese-owned textile companies in August of this year was only 12.6% of their production capacity. However, since September, due to the fair and certain allocation of cotton raw materials, the operating rate has increased by 10% to 25%. It is expected that from October onwards, due to the dissolution of the Cotton Industry Association and its replacement by the Cotton Department, and coinciding with the period when new cotton is coming onto the market, it is generally believed that the common output will increase further. Currently, there are 33 Chinese-owned textile factories, and 16 of them are completely operated by Chinese merchants. The lineup of Chinese-owned textile factories cannot be said to be not quite strong. Moreover, with the recently approved and promulgated "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Allocation of Cotton" by the Executive Yuan, the raw material problem for manufacturing cotton products should no longer be a question. Therefore, the weaving and spinning movement in the future should be promoted more smoothly, so that it can better cooperate with the cotton yarn and cloth control policy, and make a greater contribution to the important task of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. This is what we expect from the Chinese-owned textile industry, which is responsible for production, and it is also what we expect from the government authorities, which are responsible for encouraging production.

### Special Donation Office for Sericulture Construction to Handle Registration of Licenses; Methods Promulgated and Deadline Set for Completion Before the 10th

The Special Donation Office for Sericulture Construction in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions of the Ministry of Finance, in order to adjust the situation of licenses held by silk mills, silk weaving mills, and merchants in the region, specially presented an order from the Ministry to formulate methods. Before the assessment of donations for autumn silk is determined, the old licenses held by merchants should be registered uniformly to prevent malpractices. Therefore, registration methods have been specially promulgated, ordering all silk and silk fabric manufacturers to promptly register all types of silk licenses they hold with the local special donation collection agency in accordance with the law before November 10th of this year. The original text of the fourteen articles of the method is recorded below:

Registration Method

This office has specially formulated this method in order to adjust the situation of licenses held by silk mills, silk weaving mills, and merchants in the region. All merchants such as silk mills, silk weaving mills, or customs declaration transportation companies (hereinafter referred to as "license holders") who hold licenses with the prefixes Tianjia, Tianyi, Tianbing, Caitianyi, thread donation licenses, Cai Zhi direct finished product donation licenses, Caitian single pure weaving mill thread and weaving separation licenses, and sub-transportation licenses must uniformly apply for registration from now until November 9th. All license holders must fill out the registration form with the prefixes of donation transportation licenses specified in the preceding article within the deadline and submit it together with the licenses held to the local collection agency for special donations on sericulture to apply for registration. All license holders under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai District should apply for registration with this office. Those under the jurisdiction of Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other regions should register with the respective branch offices. License holders who hold various donation transportation licenses who fail to apply for registration after the deadline will not be registered, and all licenses held will be invalidated. When this office and its branch offices receive the registration forms and licenses held by license holders, after registration, they will stamp "Registration Completed" and the date of registration on the licenses and immediately send personnel to verify the forms. If the licenses and goods are found to be consistent, they should stamp "Goods and License Consistent" on the licenses and return the original licenses to the original license holders. The licenses stamped with "Registration Completed" and "Goods and License Consistent" in the preceding article must bear the name and seal of the director of each branch office and the personnel handling the registration and verification. The above name seal and stamp should be submitted to this office for record.

Large and small Western clothing stores on this street and in other ports have been vigorously sourcing them because they are very much to the liking of Allied personnel. As a result, the tailors who specialize in making clothes for Allied personnel are purchasing Western suits and coats made entirely of grey and dark purple, creating a trend of brisk sales of plain woolen fabrics.

Artificial : Yesterday saw a slight increase, because cargo owners were unwilling to sell cheaply, leading to a price increase.

### Strengthening Japan's Production Capacity

Measures to Strengthen the Domestic Situation

On September 22nd, the Japanese government, in a regular cabinet meeting, decided on "Measures to Strengthen the Domestic System." This is because, in order to cope with the intense final battle phase, it is urgently necessary to truly establish a domestic posture for the decisive battle. The purpose of these measures, as Prime Minister Tojo broadcast that day, is to "make decisive reforms in the operation of state affairs, further strengthen the relationship between the supreme command and state affairs, in order to carry out vigorous war guidance, and to implement swift and decisive foreign policies, while at the same time thoroughly strengthening the domestic strength and accelerating and dramatically enhancing war capabilities." The government's aim in strengthening the domestic situation is to rapidly increase military production with the strong force of the entire nation, especially aircraft production, and to establish a situation of absolute self-sufficiency in food, while thoroughly strengthening the domestic defense situation, so that this great war can be completely won.

Regarding these points, the government authorities have long attached importance to various decisive measures. Considering the importance of the war situation, they believe that the measures taken must not be delayed in the slightest, and therefore decided to implement them rapidly and forcefully.

Moreover, this "measure" adopts a special approach to strengthen the domestic situation, proposing a decisive transformation of administrative operations, so that the execution of government affairs is thoroughly swift and efficient, the duties of central government agencies are thoroughly transferred to local governments, and local administration is simplified and enlivened. In addition, the functions of local administrative councils are strengthened. Furthermore, simplification of the budget and streamlining of official affairs are sought, permission and approval matters are handled, and the document supervision system for important enterprises is abolished, in order to simplify the supervision system. Unnecessary administrative affairs during the decisive battle are strictly prohibited, and all administrative organs are reorganized, with a view to simplicity and efficiency. This will prepare a perfect system for carrying out the decisive battle administration.

On the other hand, this "measure" also lists detailed measures for thoroughly mobilizing the people and strengthening the domestic defense situation. In addition to the goal of increasing carrying capacity in the first article, second paragraph, it also establishes a responsible production system in the second article, fourth paragraph, listing the standardization of land transportation, strengthening taxes and national savings, thoroughly simplifying the price and rationing system, and thoroughly reorganizing and updating the second-line production sectors. Based on these measures, each provincial and state-level policy was drafted by September 26th, and formally decided by the Cabinet meeting by the end of September, to be implemented from October. There will be much to look forward to in this rapid and thorough practice. According to the Information Bureau, the full text of the measures is as follows:

Information Bureau Announcement (7:30 PM, September 22nd): Since the beginning of the Holy War, the government has implemented various necessary measures to carry out the war. However, in view of the current domestic and international situation, in order to adapt to vigorous and active operations, the following measures are implemented to further strengthen the domestic situation, so as to achieve the purpose of the Holy War.

First, the goals of strengthening the domestic situation are as follows:

To thoroughly understand the true meaning of this Holy War for all officials and people, to realize that this war is by no means an easy undertaking, to maintain an unwavering belief in victory, and to devote themselves to serving the country with loyalty.

To use the power of the whole country to rapidly increase military production, especially the rapid expansion of air power.

### Suggestions on Improving the Rationing of Eggs

— Wang Boming

Rice is the main food for the people, and eggs are extremely nutritious. Eggs are also listed as important materials for food and industry. The output from other places is extremely important. Is the transportation of eggs to Shanghai easier than other items? I personally find that the daily egg imports amount to about a thousand. Our side accounts for about six-tenths. Averaging this to 108 egg merchants, each merchant gets about six hundred. The transaction price is about 10,000 yuan. Calculating with a 5% interest rate, there would be 500 yuan. Daily expenses would be sufficient. The selling price of eggs has always been lower than other goods. Recently, some egg merchants have manipulated the market. They secretly raise the selling price of the goods they get. The black market in recent months is shocking. Starting from the 25th of this month, sales at the door are taxed at 20%, and wholesale is also taxed. This is a very heavy burden on each of our egg vendors, and it further increases the burden on the people's food. I feel it is unfair. Consider:

are also not listed as industrial materials. Egg nutrition is superior to and cannot be afforded by ordinary people. Yet there are no taxes. Taxation is originally an obligation and responsibility that every citizen should bear. I am not against the authorities levying taxes, but I sincerely hope that the authorities can thoroughly collect this tax so as not to mislead the citizens.

I will briefly list the malpractice and black market prices of the five-day micro-tax as follows: (25th) selling price plus tax 27.5 yuan, without tax 28 yuan; (26th) plus tax 28.5 yuan, without tax 29 yuan; (27th), (28th) plus tax 31 yuan, without tax 31.5 yuan; (29th) also similar. In short, even if a small number of people pay taxes, they do not have any proof. There are also a few egg merchants who use tricks to set up separate accounts and embezzle tax money. I think other businesses are probably the same.

Pay attention to the following points in the future:

A. Eradicate embezzlement in retail:

The authorities should issue an order to add retail tax investigators and liaison personnel to investigate on the streets.

Limit each customer to obtaining a tax receipt before leaving the store.

Police officers and assigned investigators can check customers' receipts and store ledgers at any time to see if they are the same.

The authorities should also announce that receipt holders must keep the receipts, and when they have accumulated 100 receipts, they should hand them over to the tax office, which will then issue bonuses or certificates to show encouragement.

B. Improve the allocation of eggs

The authorities should issue an order to order the Egg Guild and the Egg Association to jointly establish three major distribution groups in this city: 1. Hongkou District. 2. West Shanghai District. 3. Fenxing Street in the Central District.

Regarding the receiving group, one receiving group can be set up in each township in the egg-producing area. In addition to the distribution group's receiving group, two more receiving groups can be set up in the local receiving group: 1. Wharves in other places. 2. Train station.

Regarding the funding case, each egg merchant can subscribe for stocks.

Seventy percent of the staff is drawn from each egg business.

The salary of the five staff members is issued jointly and has nothing to do with the egg merchants.

There are two types of allocation methods: 1. Egg merchants in the city. 2. Egg vendors and part-time egg small businesses.

There are also two types of receipt procedures: 1. Egg merchants appoint representatives to collect the goods. 2. Vegetable market egg vendors also send representatives to collect the goods according to the size of the vegetable market, and part-time egg shops also pick them up near the vegetable market.

The distribution price must be the same for egg merchants and vendors.

If the above cooperation system can be realized, it can be used as a general import collection for retail taxes, which would be a blessing for the people. (Move to help education)

### Health Association Launches Lung Health Check-Up Campaign Free Check-Ups for 10,000 People

The China Health Association is carrying out the three major goals of medical cost savings, relieving the poor and sick, and social welfare, and is working hard to promote various preventive check-up work. Because lung diseases are extremely rampant in this city, according to the disease statistics reports released by the past Health Departments, lung disease always ranks first, threatening the health of millions of residents in Shanghai, which is extremely serious. In order to combat tuberculosis, the Association has decided to step up tuberculosis prevention work and launch a large-scale lung health check-up campaign starting from today. To increase efficiency, it has specially increased 10,000 free X-ray check-up vouchers, which will be distributed by the following locations.

The entire Shanghai education community will be packaged and distributed by the Social Service Department of the Xinwenbao Newspaper. The entire Shanghai business community will be distributed by the Social Service Department of the Shenbao Newspaper. (A certificate letter is required to obtain the voucher) Doctors give out vouchers to the general poor and sick through the Doctors' Association. Donors will have the vouchers sent to them by the Association for redistribution in order to popularize them. It is hoped that early diagnosis can be popularized to obtain early treatment and restore production capacity as soon as possible, so as not to be trapped by poverty and disease and to achieve the goal of stabilizing society. The number of people in this year's anti-tuberculosis campaign is the highest on record.

### Yao Heqing Hospital Establishes a Free Clinic

The Yao Heqing Respiratory Hospital sent a letter yesterday saying: Lung disease is extremely harmful, but there are very few good treatments. According to ancient medical books, there is a prescription for Chen Baiguo mustard dew. Ten years ago, I conducted an on-site test and distributed it on a large scale in Ningbo, with obvious results. Later, I suspended it after practicing medicine in Shanghai because it was inconvenient to make it. However, my ambition remains unchanged. Therefore, I entrusted my old friend Mr. Tang to make it in Daishan according to the method. It has been more than three years now. Today, I am grateful to my old friend for transporting part of this dew to Shanghai to benefit patients. Those who suffer from this disease can bring a small bottle to our Association to collect it. Furthermore, someone who has experienced the suffering of past illnesses, from today onwards, a special free clinic will be set up from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM every day. No fees will be charged. The clinic is located at No. 80, Baek Road.
