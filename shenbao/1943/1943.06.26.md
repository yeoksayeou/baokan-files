### Urgent Need for Unified Promotion of Charitable Undertakings

Charitable undertakings are endeavors that utilize the voluntary power of the people to assist the government in implementing social policies. They are also the highest expression of humanity's spirit of universal love and mutual assistance. However, there are often people in society who hold mistaken views about charitable undertakings, thus hindering their development and the progress of society. The first type of mistaken view is the theoretical denial of the necessity of charitable undertakings. If there were no charitable undertakings in society at all, then everyone would know that they must struggle to survive, and there would be no more inequality among people. This viewpoint is similar to what Lao Tzu said, "If sages do not die, great thieves will not cease; if measures are destroyed, the people will not contend." It sounds reasonable but is an impractical high-flown argument. Where does it leave social progress and human civilization? Of course, in our ideal world of Great Harmony, "people will not only love their own parents and cherish their own children," and there will be no need to run charitable undertakings. But at present, we cannot sit idly by and watch our compatriots cry out in hunger and cold, lingering in misery and drowning, while just talking about "Let's all struggle!" On the contrary, the world of Great Harmony can only rely on the development of charitable undertakings, extending the spirit of universal love of charitable undertakings, and then it can be gradually realized. The second type of mistaken view is that charitable undertakings are extremely important, but China's charitable undertakings have not achieved any results. On the contrary, we see tearful appeals for donations every day, and at the same time, we see the number of poor and suffering people in society increasing every day. Therefore, they believe that past charitable undertakings have been a failure. This argument is also quite well-founded and reasonable, so it is deeply rooted in people's hearts. We believe that there are inevitably a few charitable careerists in charitable undertakings, but we cannot generalize. If you go to inspect in person, you will definitely see many people who are genuinely engaged in charitable undertakings. We must not give up eating because of choking. As for the third type of mistaken view, it is that the charitable undertakings of the past have not seen any actual results, which shows that a cup of water is useless to a cartload of firewood. Therefore, we do not want passive charitable undertakings, we want to actively transform society. But the reason why past charitable undertakings have not achieved results is due to being scattered, unorganized, and unplanned. If we blame charitable undertakings for this, why can't we blame the reforms of the past few decades for how far they have transformed society? We believe that actively transforming society is naturally necessary, and charitable undertakings must also be carried out with a revolutionary spirit and method. Mutual assistance and support are necessary to transform society and build an ideal world.

The need to develop charitable undertakings does not need further explanation. However, as pointed out by those who criticize charitable undertakings, past charitable undertakings do have many shortcomings and weaknesses, which have affected their actual results. The main shortcomings are: first, each charitable organization acts independently, without regard for each other, lacking not only contact and mutual assistance, but also having deep-seated sectarian views, hindering work. Second, charitable undertakings are scattered and weak, without a sound organization, without a unified plan and steps. One organization launches a certain donation campaign, and another organization launches a certain fundraising campaign in the same area at the same time. The people who donate money are still a minority, so there will be no good results. Third, each charitable organization has its own sectarian prejudices, unwilling to integrate with the general public, and usually only knows to circle around a few particularly related or particularly famous people. Often many organizations take the same path, hold on to the same people, making these few people exhausted to deal with, and view those who run charitable undertakings as debtors, and just give a little bit or appeal on their behalf. As a result, charitable undertakings have gotten into a dead end. As for the weaknesses of general charitable organizations, the first is that they do not know how to make their real situation public to society. Some are even unwilling to be known to the general public in order to avoid suspicion of fanfare, thus the impact is not great, and the undertaking is not easy to develop. The second is that the organization, management, employment, business planning, and financial accounting are not scientific, so often the result is half the effort. Due to the above shortcomings and weaknesses, the charitable undertakings of the past, with a few exceptions, have generally not been satisfactory.

We believe that charitable undertakings must be developed, this matter is very important to the country and society, and we must work together with one heart. Therefore, we respectfully offer a humble opinion to the advanced people who are currently engaged in charitable undertakings and enthusiastic people in society, that is, we hope that charitable undertakings can be unified, organized, and planned. For example, in this city, there are no less than three hundred charitable organizations, large and small, new and old. They can cooperate with each other and take care of each other. In particular, some small organizations, their manpower and undertakings, seem to be able to merge into similar organizations according to their nature and actual situation, and large organizations, with history, achievements, business foundation and talents, should especially support small organizations, and provide them with manpower, material resources and technical assistance. In order to realize this requirement, we hope that there will be a unified design organization, guided by the competent government authorities, and jointly planned by social leaders, experts and various charitable organizations for future charitable undertakings. The Shanghai Poverty and Disease Relief Association was established last year, its organizational purpose and content are generally in line with this ideal. It is best to expand the scope, from poverty and disease relief to all charitable undertakings, and strengthen its investigation, design, fundraising, review, and supervision departments. If it can be realized, then the future of charitable undertakings in this city will definitely shine and become a model for the whole country.

Charitable undertakings are active, they are the practice of transforming people's hearts and transforming society. Especially today, in the era of war and preparing for post-war construction, it is even more urgent to promote this special role of charitable undertakings, to preserve the vitality of the nation, to eliminate inequality in society, and to fill the gaps for the people. But all of these, the most fundamental problem, lies in whether future charitable undertakings can change the past passive, scattered, unorganized, and unplanned ills, and actively move towards the path of unified unity and cooperation.

### Japanese Military in China Announces Weekly War Situation

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Dispatch Army in China announced the weekly war situation on June 25th as follows: The elite of the Japanese army once surrounded the 92nd Army of the Chongqing Army in northern Anhui Province in late January of this year, and severely damaged it. In order to completely eliminate them, they began operations on the 22nd. After a fierce attack, within two days, they had achieved their intended purpose. The results of the battle were: 1,714 soldiers of the Chongqing Army were killed, 74 were captured, and 29 light and heavy machine guns were seized. The comprehensive results of the summer campaign were announced on the 22nd, but the difference from the past is that the number of heavy firearms seized by the Japanese army has slightly increased compared to rifles. Considering the difficulty of moving heavy firearms, it shows that the Chongqing Army loses its will to fight in every engagement and seeks to retreat urgently. Also, in this operation, the Japanese army's land artillery shot down as many as 14 enemy aircraft, which also shows the enemy's air force's will to fight and the Japanese army's excellent shooting skills. The Japanese army is currently guarding strictly against the enemy air force's moves, and the air defense is extremely solid. The Japanese army in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has now returned to its original state. According to recent claims by Chongqing spokespersons, they also admit that the granary area in northern Chongqing has been severely damaged. This can be said to be a fatal blow to the Chongqing side, which shows that the Chongqing side is increasingly worried about this operation.

### Japanese Mainichi Shimbun Donates Three Gliders

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) The friendly Mainichi Shimbun donated three gliders to the New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee. Mr. Shizuru, a glider instructor who is responsible for glider training and teaching, broadcasted on the Central Broadcasting Station at 9:00 p.m. on the 25th, explaining the performance of the gliders and the importance of glider training in the construction of the air force in great detail.

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) In order to promote a universal understanding of gliding among young people and preliminary technical training, the New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee will hold the first glider training course from the 3rd to the 12th of next month, using the three gliders donated by the friendly Mainichi Shimbun. Young people from all over the country came to register and request to participate in the training very enthusiastically. The training course held oral exams and physical examinations for the registered students at the auditorium of the New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee at 10:00 a.m. yesterday (25th). Secretary-General Lin Miansheng of the New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee gave a speech. A total of fifteen people passed, and two people audited.

Glider Content

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) The three advanced and primary gliders donated by the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun to the New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee are scheduled to hold a donation ceremony in Nanjing on the 28th. It has been found that the glider is a type of aircraft without an engine and has attracted the attention of the world after the First World War. Gliders were quite active in Germany. Because the German air force was restricted by the Treaty of Versailles, they actively engaged in glider sports by studying gliders. The world record for gliders is "fifty" hours for staying in the air, "seven hundred" kilometers for flight distance, and "eight thousand" meters for altitude. Regular students in Japanese junior high schools have primary glider training, and this sport is also very popular in other schools. Germany lists glider sports as one of the physical education subjects, selling it as a preparation for today's air force. The foundation of the elite air force that Germany has today can be said to be caused by glider training. Not only that, during the Second World War, the glider units also participated in the parachute units in the attack on Tarit Island, and fought together. Therefore, it has great significance in the military. Gliders can be divided into primary, intermediate, and advanced. Primary gliders have a simple structure, are easy to operate, and are not dangerous, but they cannot fly high. The flight of primary gliders is pulled by rubber bands, the purpose is to recognize aviation, and pay attention to mental training. This is the main subject of Japanese junior high schools. If pulling the rubber band requires twenty people, only one person can ride the glider, and must perform in order, and because the driver is one person, considerable attention must be paid. Intermediate gliders can rise to a height of about "two hundred" meters, and can be operated, and can be towed by car to fly. Advanced aircraft need to make records of staying in the air at a certain height and distance, so the so-called streamlined, the wings are longer, and can fly at high altitude, forming an air train, which can carry dozens of people. Gliders do not have engines, the reason why they can fly in the high air for a long time is to stimulate the air and rely on the updraft. There are two types of updrafts, one is the updraft caused by heat, that is, the airflow of dry air rising from the ground, and the other is the airflow caused by the wet ground, and the airflow that rises along the slope of the mountain when the river encounters wind. Gliders are most active when they encounter these airflows.

### A Veteran Diplomat Talks About the Implementation Policy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Which Will Be Actively Rolled Out Throughout the Region

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) A veteran Japanese diplomat said that Prime Minister Tojo's "Greater East Asia Declaration" at the 83rd Extraordinary Diet expressed Japan's firm determination to complete the Greater East Asia War, and at the same time clearly declared Japan's fundamental policy of adapting to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. The concrete expression of Japan's new policy towards China after China's participation in the war in January of this year has shown this general policy. In this sense, Prime Minister Tojo's announcement of the Greater East Asia administration is being fundamentally revised. The Japan-China Treaty, which is unfolding with the new policy towards China as its center, will be expressed throughout the Greater East Asia region. The trend of fundamental revision of the Japan-China Treaty has extremely important significance in the concretization of Japan's Greater East Asia administration. When the Republic of China and Japan concluded the Basic Treaty in the 29th year of the Republic of China, British and American forces still existed in China. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, British and American forces have been eliminated, and China's participation in the war has brought China and Japan into close cooperation, striving to complete the common front of the Greater East Asia War. In the future, the fundamental revision of the China-Japan Treaty will break through the various shortcomings of the past, and the revision of the treaties between China and Japan will be based on the fundamental spirit of China-Japan cooperation, based on equality and mutual benefit, and adapt to the reality of the true return to the original face of China and Japan, and express the fundamental relationship between China and Japan and implement it. Ambassador Tani Masayuki, the Japanese ambassador to China, returned to his post on the 20th of this month after consulting with the Japanese central authorities, and immediately held consultations with the heads of Japanese local agencies in China and held important talks with the National Government authorities. It can be said that the development of the new situation in China-Japan relations has entered the right track. Last time, Japan's new policy towards China was expressed only three days after the Japanese government issued a statement, in the return of the exclusive concessions in China, the transfer of a large number of enemy properties, and the abolition of extraterritoriality. The Japanese government has given sincere cooperation to China's autonomy, integrity, and strengthening, and it is still progressing. Therefore, it is expected that the fundamental revision of the Sino-Japanese relations will be realized quickly. Also, because Japan has returned the concessions, the Axis countries and neutral countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Denmark have also taken the same steps as Japan and successively announced the return of the concessions and other privileges in China. This is also enough to prove that various countries have understood Japan's ideal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, Japan's Greater East Asia administration and Japanese diplomacy, centered on the fundamental revision of the Sino-Japanese treaty, will actively unfold on this basis. In this way, it not only shows Japan's true intention to fully assist China's restoration and strengthening, but also what Foreign Minister Shigemitsu said will surely make the enemy Britain and the United States completely surrender.

### Counter-Axis Countries to Change War Aims, Plan to Establish Supreme Command in East Asia, Amery Claims British Policy Towards India Remains Unchanged

The report also stated that Indian Secretary of State Amery will be dismissed due to complete failure, and his vacancy will be filled by the current Leader of the House, Attlee. Political observers in London are paying close attention to the increasingly close relationship between the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Eden, believing that the Prime Minister intends to continue his activities on the political stage after the war. Churchill and Eden are striving to maintain the power of the Conservative Party, as otherwise, it will be replaced by the Labor Party after the war. The Labor Party will propose a large-scale social reform program after the war, which will win the hearts of many people, it can be asserted.

A Re-examination of North China's Economy

  The Movement of Supplies in North China

  Since the end of last year, grain prices have skyrocketed, causing concern for the future. Fortunately, they have generally stabilized recently. Here, we will attempt to provide a simple review of the changes.

  Originally, the surge in grain prices since the autumn of last year exceeded the actual situation. However, speculators took advantage of the National Government's participation in the war and the opportunity to strengthen the National Government's political power, spreading rumors of currency unification between Central and North China, deliberately creating anxiety about the Federal Reserve Bank of China notes. Thus, the initial speculative buying was limited to grain, then shifted to cotton cloth, and then spread to general daily necessities. Local military and political authorities and residents paid close attention to the development of the situation. The issue of strengthening the political ties between Central and North China was also largely formed through the decisions on the regulations of the North China Political Affairs Commission and various General Departments and Halls, the participation of North China in the New Transportation Commission, and the inauguration of Xinminhui as honorary president.

  Regarding the temporary currency anxiety, Wang's financial supervisor emphasized in his statement on February 25th the insistence on the parity between the Japanese yen and the Federal Reserve Bank of China notes. At the same time, Japanese Ambassador to Beijing Shiozawa also issued a statement, strongly urging assistance in maintaining parity with the yen. The Japanese Bank's loan of 200 million yen to the United Reserve Bank of China on March 10th was generally seen as an indirect support for the policy of maintaining parity between the yen and the yuan, and the market gradually calmed down. On March 24th, Wang's financial supervisor announced that the exchange rate for military notes and the exchange rate for currency carried by travelers were determined to be 18 yuan of Central Reserve Bank of China notes for every 100 yuan of Federal Reserve Bank of China notes, echoing the statement that military notes would no longer be issued in Central China. This corrected the previously uneven market conditions, where 18 yuan of Central Reserve Bank of China notes equaled one Japanese yen, the Japanese yen equaled the Federal Reserve Bank of China notes, and the official exchange rate for the Federal Reserve Bank of China notes against Central Reserve Bank of China notes was 30 yuan. The clarification of the authorities' policy was reflected in the black market exchange rate in Tianjin: it fell from 26.2 yuan to 33 yuan on the afternoon of March 24th, which immediately increased the transparency of the previously obscure currency sector.

  At the same time, since February, North China and Mengjiang have experienced rain and snow, which is unprecedented in previous years, providing timely rain for the rural areas before the planting season. A rare bumper harvest of spring crops such as cotton and wheat can be predicted this year, and the future of grain supply and demand is also promising.

  Due to these positive news in the currency and material sectors, it is foreseeable that general commodity prices will eventually rise in view of this situation. The Tianjin cotton yarn market has already taken this into account, showing a nearly threefold surge since the beginning of the year. The vicious cycle of rising grain prices does not stop there. Due to increased wages, the prices of goods supplied to Japan will inevitably have to be raised. Thus, the general commodity prices in North China, with grain as the mainstay, not only threaten North China but also Japan itself. In this regard, we deeply hope that a more active and powerful institution will be established locally as soon as possible to suppress commodity prices in North China. Today, commodity prices in North China are only separated from commodity prices in Japan by a piece of paper. Loopholes in North China's price policy will cause great obstacles to the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and we must deeply consider this now.

  Although the situation remains unchanged, the future supply and demand of materials and the issue of prices cannot be viewed optimistically and left to their own devices. Because due to the rise in wheat and other miscellaneous grains, an increase in grain planting this year can be predicted, which may directly affect the planting area of cotton. Now, the purchase of cotton is still limited to 300 yuan.

  The Tasks After China's Participation in the War

  After China's participation in the war, the compression of the needs of the people of North China has reached a considerable degree, which is natural. For example, with grain, although a considerable harvest is expected this year, in order to prevent the production of important materials from falling during the lean season, the supply of grain must be carefully planned. Therefore, the consumption of the general consumer class may have to be thoroughly restricted. The question then becomes whether Central China is prepared with a strong determination in the face of this temporary imbalance in supply and demand. Naturally, without this determination, China's participation in the war is almost meaningless. Sharing joys and sorrows, living and dying together, should be more than just diplomatic rhetoric. To make the Chinese masses, in the war experiences they feel day and night, keep in mind the position and mission of China and North China in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere without causing unexpected chaos: the task of the Chinese leadership is extremely important.

  Secondly, the issue of reorganizing the distribution mechanism must be raised sooner or later. Regarding this point, not to mention the Chinese masses, do the cadres have sufficient confidence and preparation? Since the policy change, the military authorities in North China have announced a rather grand policy, stating that the Japanese army is solely responsible for combat and security. Therefore, the work of the Materials Circulation Committee is also gradually being transferred from the hands of the special affairs agencies to the Chinese agencies. In these areas, we have great expectations for the creativity and responsibility of the Chinese side.

  In this sense, I think the meaning of the phrase "stabilizing people's livelihood" has changed significantly since the participation in the war. Naturally, "stabilizing people's livelihood" is the foundation of the National Government's platform, and there should be no change in its spirit. However, for China, which has joined the Greater East Asia War, while "stabilizing people's livelihood," it is impossible to forget the supreme mission of completing the common war goals. Japan is implementing its basic policy toward China after returning concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality, which only has historical significance after the Chinese masses correctly grasp the purpose of this war.

  For this reason, we must give China many things that can have an impact. This is especially true in Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. Even in the administrative aspect, there is much room for improvement in the organization of government officials, the police system, etc. Furthermore, in the economic sector, issues such as reorganizing guild-style trade associations to strengthen purchasing and distribution mechanisms must be treated as topics for serious re-examination. In this way, on the path to establishing a wartime economic system, the administrative institutions of the new China can naturally develop rationally, and ultimately, China's participation in the war can have its national significance.

Re-examination of Qualifications of Registered Tobacco Merchants; Those Who Fail to Meet Standards to Be Demoted; Establishment of Allocation Deliberation Committee by Tobacco Association of Central China

  In order to reorganize the allocation mechanism, the Tobacco Allocation Association of Central China has recently formed an Allocation Deliberation Committee to re-examine the qualifications of 300 wholesalers and 6,000 retailers who have been registered and receiving goods on schedule. If it is found that the qualifications do not meet the regulations or that the manner of obtaining the qualifications is suspected of being improper, their rank will be lowered, and the amount of each allocation will be reduced. In addition, the qualifications of stores that have been registered but have not yet received goods and newly opened tobacco stores are also being strictly examined. It is understood that tobacco stores registered with the Tobacco Allocation Association of Central China are divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. The total value of the quantity allocated each period adopts a ratio of 8:4:2:1, i.e., A=8, B=4, C=2, and D=1. However, this method, although extremely reasonable in principle, may easily breed malpractices in practice. Recognizing this, the Allocation Association has decided to re-examine the qualifications of registered store numbers. It is reported that the ranks of several registered stores have been lowered after examination due to non-compliance. In addition, in order to popularize allocation and avoid partiality, the Association has established eight branches in major cities and counties in the Central China region, which are conducting allocation under unified command.

Director of Information Bureau, Hirota, Discusses the Indian Question

  The joint press conference of the three Japanese authorities stationed in Shanghai for Chinese news reporters was held as usual yesterday. Director of the Information Bureau, Hirota, expressed his views on China and the Indian question:

  British Attitude Towards India

  First, regarding the Indian question, he clarified the following two points: (1) Britain transferred the Governor-General of India, appointing Wavell as the new Governor-General, succeeding Linlithgow; (2) Indian independence movement leader Bose went to Tokyo. Bose had left India for Berlin, Germany, for more than a year before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and only recently went to Tokyo. We should recognize the significance of Wavell's succession as Governor-General of India and Bose's visit to Tokyo. The British attitude towards India and the Japanese attitude towards India are fully expressed. Recalling that Britain occupied India 300 years ago, it has always implemented a policy of oppression against India. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the British government asked India to support Britain's wartime policy, but the revolutionary leaders of the Indian independence movement, based on national consciousness, responded with a surging tide of independence movement. However, the British government made false promises to India again, expressing its willingness to allow it to obtain the status of Indian national autonomy after the war. While Britain used sweet words to deceive India, it also adopted a violent policy of suppression.

  Japan's Policy

  He then described Japan's attitude, saying that since the development of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has been fully engaged in the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia, and can be said to be one of the two major pillars of the construction of a new world order. The ultimate goal of Japan's construction of a new order in East Asia is to fight for the liberation of one billion people in East Asia. The one billion people in East Asia include one hundred million Japanese, four hundred million Chinese, one hundred and fifty million in Southeast Asia, and three hundred and fifty million in India. We must expel the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States from East Asia. When India launched a fierce independence movement against Britain, the Japanese government repeatedly stated that it would provide assistance, and after occupying Burma and the Philippines, it granted them independent status based on its determination to liberate the nations of East Asia. Before the Indian nation regains independence, Japan will definitely provide as much assistance as possible.

Jianghai Customs to Change Transit Tariff Starting Next Month

  Abolish ad valorem duties and collect ad valorem duties

  The Customs transit tariff has traditionally been divided into ad valorem duties (calculated by the pound, piece, or head of livestock) and ad valorem duties (calculated as a percentage of value). Recently, due to rising prices, ad valorem duties have not been affected, but ad valorem duties have been slightly affected. The authorities, in view of the fact that ad valorem duties are not in line with current practice, plan to abolish ad valorem tariffs from July 1 and collect ad valorem duties in general. A notice will be issued to the public soon.

Citizen Welfare Association Hosted a Tea Party for Ambassador Ishisha and Minister Mori Takashi Yesterday

  Ambassador Ishisha Jutaro and Minister Mori Takashi recently came to China to inspect on the orders of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Citizen Welfare Association of this city specially held a tea party at the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Association Hall yesterday (the 25th) at 5 pm to welcome them. The guests included Ambassador Ishisha, Minister Mori, General Manager Okazaki of the Public Concession, Director of the Press Department Hirota of the Embassy, Director of the Finance Department Hanasui, Consul Iwai, Deputy Consul Fukumon. From the Chinese side, there was Ambassador Wu Kaisheng, Director Pan Da of the Municipal Government, Director Lin Jiong'an of the Education Bureau, Director Yuan Jufan of the Health Bureau, Director Zhang Enlin of the Public Works Bureau, Section Chief Cui Jingyu, Director Sun Wuqi of the Social Welfare Bureau, and representatives from the press such as Jin Xiongbo, Yan Jiabao, Lu Feng, Cheng Zhongquan, Liu Yunfang, etc. From the association side, there were Chairman Wen Lanting, Vice Chairman Lin Kanghou and Zhao Jinqing, Standing Directors Yuan Ludeng, Ye Fuxiao, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Directors Li Sihao, Zhang Yipeng, Pei Yunqing, Chen Shaoqi, Wang Boyuan, Sun Ruihuang, and members Wang Shuxian, Wang Haibo, Wang Jian'e, Ren Xiaoshan, Wu Shaoting, Wu Boseng, Shen Yongruo, Di Jiuhua, Song Zhuozai, Zhou Xingchu, Zhou Mengbai, Jin Zongcheng, Shao Shisheng, Shuai Bochun, Tang Zhiliang, Chen Riping, Chen Huisun, Chen Hongquan, Chen Chengyin, Chen Binhe, Xu Jingfu, Huang Jiangquan, Dian Xianzhi, Zhao Rutiao, Pan Zhiwen, Pan Yangyao, Zheng Hongyan, Yan Fuqing, Yan Qingxiang, Gu Songling, Gu Kemin, Gu Nanqun, etc., totaling over a hundred people. Chairman Wen Lanting of the association presided over the meeting, and Vice Chairman Lin Kanghou delivered a welcome speech, followed by reply speeches from Ambassador Ishisha and Minister Mori. The event concluded happily at around 7 pm.

  Lin Kanghou's Speech

  In his welcome speech, Mr. Kanghou said: "Ambassador Ishisha is an outstanding talent in the diplomatic circles of our friendly nation. During his tenure as Consul General in Shanghai, he worked extremely hard to promote Sino-Japanese friendship. Minister Mori Takashi served as the Director of the Cultural Bureau of the Asia Development Board and made many contributions. Both are good friends of China. This time, they have been ordered to come to China for inspection, and we are very fortunate to have them come and give us guidance. Since your government announced its new policy towards China this spring and took the lead in returning concessions, our people have been deeply impressed. As far as the Shanghai concessions are concerned, in the past, the British and Americans treated our citizens very unfairly. We hope that the authorities of our friendly nation will treat everyone equally in the future, eliminate all past malpractices, and we hope that the two gentlemen will report to the government the true sentiments of the Chinese people that you have seen during this inspection, so that the relations between the two countries will be even more satisfactory. Today, we are holding a simple tea party to extend the respect of the citizens of Shanghai to the two gentlemen, and we ask for your guidance."

  Ambassador Ishisha's Speech

  Next, Ambassador Ishisha gave a reply speech, saying: "I have not been to your country for a long time. This time, coming to China is like returning to my hometown. When we set off for China, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu told us that this trip required observing all aspects of China's situation, but my observation will not only focus on the surface, but I also hope to have more contact with leaders from all walks of life in your country and exchange opinions at any time. This time, your country is implementing a policy towards China, assisting your government in recovering concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality, which is of great significance to China. I have long felt that it is necessary to return the concession issue of various countries in China, and I have suggested this to the authorities of my country's government. Shanghai is the political, economic, and cultural center of China, and everything can affect other places, so how to build Shanghai in the future requires the leaders of all walks of life to take great responsibility, and at the same time, I earnestly hope that you will pay great attention to this. I have understood the purpose of the Citizen Welfare Association and what you hope for today, and I will convey it to the authorities after returning to my country. At the same time, I hope that your association will take responsibility and move forward towards a broad goal, so that Shanghai will become an even more perfect center. Although this matter is not so simple, it is precisely because it is not so simple that everyone must work hard."

  Minister Mori Takashi's Speech

  Finally, Minister Mori Takashi replied, saying: Five years ago, I was ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be responsible for cultural work. At that time, it was the end of the Meiji Restoration government and the government had returned to the capital. I still remember that you gave me a lot of help in cultural matters. I am very happy to be here in China today and to be treated so warmly by everyone. I have always adhered to the principle of Sino-Japanese friendship, and I hope that everyone can be friends with me and work for Sino-Japanese friendship forever.

Economic Circles' Translation: Recognizing the Focus of Investigating Materials

  The last investigation of hoarding ended up being a lot of noise and little result, disappearing without a trace. The so-called "a lot of noise" refers to not understanding the essence of the problem and only knowing how to complain, and the investigation of hoarding finally ended in disappointment. Some people said from the beginning that seeing the current political, economic, and social situation in China, hoarding is an inevitable phenomenon, and no matter how you investigate, it will be useless. Not to mention catching big fish, even catching a small fish is not bad.

  In our view, it is important to avoid a sensational attitude of three-minute enthusiasm when dealing with this issue. Why? Because hoarders are too cunning. When you are sensational, they hold their breath and do nothing. As long as they see that the storm has passed, they will stir up trouble again. Hasn't the storm already passed? Hoarders and those who are generously enthusiastic may be thinking this way. To be honest, an active countermeasure to deal with hoarding in Shanghai must start now. We only need to cite one point, such as the Materials Investigation Committee organized by Mayor Chen as the chairman, which includes Chinese and Japanese members, to see the authorities' deep intentions. The committee held its first joint Sino-Japanese meeting on the 19th and began preliminary concrete activities. Later, Chairman Chen issued a statement saying, "If materials can leave the hands of a few hoarders and circulate, prices will naturally fall. This is a very natural principle, and only this point is the purpose of this committee, the task of this committee."

  Dealing with this matter is an extremely delicate and important issue. Should the countermeasure to investigate hoarding be punishment first? Or should it be the return of materials? In fact, the two are inseparable methods. The practical problem is what Chairman Chen said: materials must leave the hands of a few people and circulate. This is the countermeasure to investigate hoarding.

  If hoarders returning materials is not effective through mere accusation and impeachment, then both soft and hard tactics must be used. On the one hand, we must crack down according to law, and on the other hand, we must make their hoarded goods available. If we can achieve this step, then not only the so-called hoarded materials, but also the entire huge inventory of Shanghai, can be smoothly circulated.

Wheat Purchasing and Transportation Still Handled by the Same Trade Merchants in Accordance with the Law
Business Regulation Council Stipulates Three Key Points for Registration Procedures

  The National Business Regulation Council believes that the matter of wheat entering the market and purchasing needs to be handled urgently. It has ordered the Flour and Grain Professional Committee to formulate a unified wheat collection plan, which has been approved and announced for implementation. It has been recorded in various newspapers. According to the person in charge, this committee is an internal institution of the Business Regulation Council, and its task is to strictly manage and register the flour and miscellaneous grain joint associations in various regions. Its main purpose is to make both parties' buying and selling tend to reasonable supply and demand, balance the allocation, and obtain accurate statistics, so as to thoroughly prevent speculation and hoarding and achieve the goal of stabilizing people's food. Some outsiders mistakenly believe that the committee has established branch offices in major areas as purchasing and transportation agencies, which is not true.

  From now on, the purchasing and transportation of wheat will still be handled by merchants of the same trade in accordance with the law. This point should be noted. In order to determine the steps to be taken, the association has repeatedly invited directors of relevant trade associations to hold cordial talks, and they reached a consensus and stipulated the following registration procedures: (1) Wheat firms in centralized areas should report to the branch offices in various areas through the local trade associations. (2) Vendors should register with the trade association in the purchasing area after obtaining a certificate from the trade association in charge, and then register with the office. (3) Commissioned merchants should submit directly to this committee for review after obtaining a certificate from the trade association in charge. In addition, three registration procedures for buying and selling are stipulated

### Japan Establishes Wartime Student Mobilization System Outline

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government, during its regular cabinet meeting on the 25th, decided to establish an outline for a wartime student mobilization system. The Ministry of Education formally announced it that evening. According to its provisions, students should primarily focus on their studies, but in this time of extraordinary decisive battle, they should receive comprehensive education combining academic training and labor. The key points of the outline are as follows: (1) Although students have been receiving national defense training and engaging in labor projects in the past, these will now be further enriched and strengthened to establish a system that meets the needs of the nation, in order to fulfill the students' aspirations as much as possible. (2) National defense facilities will focus on increasing food production, essential supplies, and strengthening transportation capacity. (3) Training and labor will be planned and implemented according to the type and level of school. Key points of the implementation plan: (1) Strengthen the organization of school patriotic corps to enable immediate mobilization and defense of the homeland. (2) Establish a student aptitude registration system to enhance training in aviation, maritime, mechanical, electrical, political, and communication fields.

### The Sound of Cannons Will Replace Verbal Sparring; Decisive Moment for the European War Approaches; The South May Soon Become the Focus of Offense and Defense for Both Sides; Germany Will Await Calmly Whatever Happens

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) – Military correspondent Hannes of the German News Agency declared: The recent relative calm on the sea and land battlefields may lead some people to believe that the war has reached a standstill. However, behind the localized battles of varying importance, events are occurring on both sides that could create a different situation tomorrow. The moment for a major European decision is approaching. On the Eastern Front, Soviet forces have once again gathered in front of German strongholds, from Leningrad to the Kuban steppes. Both sides are awaiting the signal to launch. It is a mistake to think that the early arrival of winter leaves no room for large-scale military operations. However, no one can say for sure when and where these large-scale operations will begin. German publications do not reveal Germany's intentions. Military figures in Berlin continue to question which side will launch the major offensive. Germany currently has ample well-rested troops stationed on all European fronts, awaiting deployment. These German troops are elite units, equipped with new weapons, and their main objective is certainly not limited to defense. In addition, the increased deployment of the German air force makes the situation even clearer. At the same time, a new sea and land battlefield has been established in Southern Europe and will soon become the focus of offense and defense for both sides. The current verbal sparring will soon be replaced by the rumble of cannons. However, the current aerial warfare is truly unprecedented, especially the United States' indiscriminate slaughter of women, children, and the elderly, as they have no interests to defend in Europe. The cruelty of their methods is truly unparalleled. It seems that the British have not yet abandoned their theory that air warfare can achieve victory. They believe that they can achieve their goals by adopting current terror tactics. This new attitude of the British and Americans clearly stems from a growing awareness of the difficulties they are now preparing to face. In addition, there is another reason: the Soviet Union is once again pressing for the immediate establishment of a second front. German military figures criticize the possibility of invasion, saying: The Germans not only have strong nerves but also maintain all the necessary material prerequisites. If the enemy dares to attempt this, they will be met with fierce resistance. At the same time, Japan, our ally in East Asia, is strengthening its position to an insurmountable level. Japan's war potential can develop independently, without fear of enemy interference. Our East Asian ally was revered as a military power before joining the war, but its strength has greatly increased in the eighteen months of war. In short, Germany, at this stage of the World War, will await calmly whatever may happen in the future.

### In the Southeastern Solomon Islands Area, Japanese Planes Bomb US Battleships; Axis Aircraft Attack the Gilbert Islands; Many Shot Down by Japanese Anti-Aircraft Guns

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch: A Japanese aircraft fleet attacked three US battleships in the southeastern Solomon Islands. The date and details were not announced.

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch: Yesterday, a group of Japanese bombers attacked US positions in the Southern Solomon Islands, and acknowledged slight losses as a result of the attack.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – Unified heavy bombers of the anti-Axis forces ventured to attack Japanese positions in the Gilbert Islands on the 18th of this month, taking advantage of the twilight. The Japanese army immediately responded with heavy anti-aircraft fire, shooting down one aircraft, setting another on fire, and the rest fled. On the same day, three Boeing (6117) heavy bombers attacked the area at night, dropping bombs from a height of several meters. The Japanese side used searchlights to locate them and shot down one with anti-aircraft fire. The Japanese side suffered no damage.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – A naval correspondent of the Domei News Agency commented on the air war situation in the Southwest Pacific as follows: The air war in the Pacific is becoming increasingly fierce, with the waters east of the Bismarck Archipelago as the focal point. The Southwest Pacific operations are currently characterized by three aspects: First, the air war in the Solomon Islands is in a stage where Japanese aircraft engage in combat with enemy fighters escorting bombers, which have been engaging in combat with intercepting enemy fighters. Now it is a decisive battle of total fighter strength, and the goal is to seize control of the airspace over enemy bases. Therefore, the battle has gradually become a fierce war of annihilation. Second, the battlefields are extremely far from the central bases of both sides, so the disruption of reinforcement routes has a great impact on the maintenance of combat power. Whenever the Japanese army learns of enemy reinforcement activities, it immediately takes urgent measures. In recent air battles near Longa Bay, New Guinea, Milne Bay, and Guadalcanal Island, many enemy transport ships have been sent to the bottom of the sea. Third, the enemy's combat power, both in terms of quantity and quality, should not be underestimated. Due to the emergence of new enemy aircraft, air combat and destructive warfare have become increasingly fierce. In response, the Japanese Army Air Force, with its brave spirit, superb technology, and the excellent performance of its aircraft, has shot down many of the enemy's latest giant-type or Lockheed "1138" fighter planes. The Japanese army has consistently maintained its advantage.

### Japanese Air Force Demonstrates Its Strength

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – Lieutenant Colonel Sasaki of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Army Press Corps has written an article on the air war, published in the Yomiuri Newspaper here. It discusses the damage inflicted by the Japanese military and the enemy air forces of Britain and the United States. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the ratio of damage between the Japanese and enemy air forces is roughly as follows: From December 1941 to the end of April 1942, one Japanese aircraft for every 8.5 enemy aircraft. From May 1942 to the end of August of the same year, one Japanese aircraft for every 3.5 enemy aircraft. From September 1942 to the end of the same year, one Japanese aircraft for every 6 enemy aircraft. From January 1943 to the end of the same year, one Japanese aircraft for every 8 enemy aircraft. It can be seen that the ratio of one to three and a half is gradually increasing to six to eight, and will continue to rise to "10," "50," and even "100." This proves that the Japanese air force is demonstrating its strength day by day.

### Fierce Skirmishes Erupt Between German and Soviet Forces

Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency) – The entire Eastern European front has been volatile in recent days. From Leningrad in the north to Novorossiysk in the south, a battle line of approximately 1,800 kilometers is in a state of extreme tension everywhere. Fierce skirmishes have erupted daily in the areas of Volkhov, south of Lake Ilmen near Tikhvin, Smolensk, Orel, the Donets and Mius Rivers, and Kamenka. Both sides seem to be waiting for the opportunity to move, and the situation is like the calm before a storm. German News Agency military reporter Hannes reported that the German army's combat preparations on the Eastern Front have now been completed. The Soviet army is also gathering new troops, watching for the opportunity to strike. Therefore, today's localized battles may become tomorrow's full-scale war. The so-called "the season is over and summer operations cannot be launched" is completely wrong.
