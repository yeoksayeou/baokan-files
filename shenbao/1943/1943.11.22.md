### On the Allocation of Resources

Decreased production and transportation difficulties are the reasons for wartime material shortages, the inability of supply and demand to balance, and the gradual increase in prices. In peacetime, price increases are enough to stimulate production, so supply and demand are quickly balanced, and prices then fall. However, during wartime, production and transportation are restricted in every way, supply and demand cannot be balanced at all, and speculators and consumers add fuel to the fire, competing to hoard and purchase goods. As a result, the lack of materials becomes more severe, and prices soar, making daily necessities unattainable. Implementing a rationing system requires the use of political power to eliminate this inequality and maintain the order and tranquility of society as a whole. After the implementation of rationing, the enjoyment of a few people will inevitably be restricted, but the lives of the majority will be guaranteed. The country is built on the foundation of all its people, and it should naturally be based on the interests of the entire population. If we only consider the special class of a few, and people are starving while I am well-fed, how can overeating last long? In the end, wouldn't it be a common ruin? Therefore, the implementation of rationing measures requires not only the government to take decisive action, but also all levels of the people to sacrifice the small self for the sake of the greater self and give it enthusiastic support.

The purpose of implementing rationing is to regulate supply and demand, stabilize prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods. In the world during wartime, Japan is an example of a country that has successfully managed rationing and achieved price stability. According to the Japanese wholesale price index published by the Bank of Japan, domestic wholesale prices in Japan at the end of June this year were still less than double what they were before the incident. No one can deny that this is a success of implementing a resource rationing system.

In view of the soaring prices in recent years, which have become a serious social problem, our authorities have resolutely implemented a resource control policy, and have successively adopted rationing measures for several items that are most important to people's livelihood. It is argued that after the purchase of rationed goods, prices should gradually fall back, but the opposite is happening. For example, rice rationing has been implemented for more than a year, but recently the black market price of rice has actually exceeded five times the price at the time of the implementation of rationing. Why can rationing measures achieve the effect of stabilizing prices in other countries, but not in our country? This is of course because there are still imperfections in the rationing measures. In that case, we should conduct a thorough review of this point and find ways to improve it.

Strictly speaking, after the implementation of rationing, first, all materials are under government control; second, the people have already obtained the necessities of life, and there should be no black market at all. As a step back, even if there is still a black market, it is not of great importance to society and people's livelihood. However, to achieve this step, there is an important condition: the amount of rationed goods should not be too far from the actual amount needed; otherwise, in order to maintain their survival, people will have to rely on the black market, which will only give the black market greater opportunities for manipulation. Unfortunately, our country's past rationing has suffered from this problem. Taking household rice as an example, the rationed amount is on average less than one-third of the actual amount needed. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to eliminate the black market and stabilize rice prices, whether in terms of reason or law. If the authorities are determined to implement the rationing method, they must first re-examine and reasonably stipulate the rationing amount of various materials. Otherwise, rationing will be rationing, and the black market will be the black market, as is the case with today's rice market. The result will only be to increase disturbances and damage credibility, which is truly a loss for the government.

Whether the amount of rations can be increased depends first on the results of controlled purchases, and ultimately on the amount of production. These three are closely related. If the results of the purchase are not good, then rationing cannot be used. If the amount of production is insufficient, then the purchase cannot be used. In the future, if we want the amount of rations to be commensurate with the actual amount needed, first, we must formulate a production plan based on the actual amount needed, gather the strength of the government and the people, and move towards this goal together, aiming for success. Second, we must improve the previous purchase methods and purchase prices. Using political power to forcibly buy, arbitrarily lowering prices to force farmers to sell at a loss below cost, and picking faults and deducting payments to make farmers dare to be angry but not dare to speak, will not only affect the purchase, but also affect production. If these past mistakes are not thoroughly corrected, it means that the control agency has failed to fulfill its responsibilities, and at the same time, it is misleading the lives of the people.

Finally, there is an even greater requirement: both producers and consumers should recognize the times, understand the meaning of national resource control, and everyone should embrace the spirit of sacrificing the small self for the sake of the greater good, with the public interest as the premise. Then the future of the rationing system will surely be twice the result with half the effort.

### Funds Needed to Purchase Materials Are Raised by the Business Control Council, and Chen Caizi Elaborates on Various Economic Issues

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram) Chen Zhishi, Vice Minister of Finance, met with a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday and explained in detail the issue of funds for the Business Control Council to purchase various materials and financial institutions. The details are as follows: Question: "Regarding the huge amount of funds needed by the Business Control Council to purchase various materials, will the financial authorities allocate them, or will the council raise them on its own?" Answer: "The amount of funds needed to purchase materials is relatively large, and the quantity of materials to be purchased must have precise planning and statistics. Therefore, each council should raise its own funds, and the government will guarantee them so that they can proceed according to plan in order to achieve proper distribution." Question: "Recently, there have been a large number of newly established small banks around Beijing and Shanghai. Will this trend affect the financial institutions? Does the Ministry of Finance have any countermeasures to crack down on them?" Answer: "Banks are the hub of financial institutions, and their establishment and closure are naturally related to several financial institutions. The Ministry has issued a statement on December 18 of last year to terminate the registration of newly established financial institutions in Shanghai. All applications submitted to the Ministry after the above deadline will be completely rejected. However, among them, there are those that have been approved for registration by the Ministry before the deadline but opened later, and those that were originally partnership money shops that reorganized into companies in accordance with the Ministry's regulations and continued to operate. The Ministry has made a public announcement in May of this year. As for the newly established financial institutions in Nanjing and other places, the Ministry will also make a statement at the same time, and will handle them separately in consideration of the local situation. If there are too many newly established banks, which are related to the national economy and social finance, the Ministry will investigate the situation at any time and restrict them separately. Those who have established them without approval should be cracked down on in accordance with the law."

### German Army Has Air Superiority in the Aegean Sea, British Troops on Samos Island May Not Be Able to Hold Out for Long

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) A dispatch from Huitong News Agency: The recent developments in the Aegean Sea can at least prevent the Allied forces from launching a large-scale landing this year. Almost all the islands in the Aegean Sea are controlled by the German army, with only Samos Island still occupied by the British. The determination of the war in this area should be based on the air superiority of both sides, and the inability of the Axis forces to have a closer air force base is a major disadvantage. In terms of the strength of the garrison on Samos Island, it is about 10,000 people. If the German army wants to land on the island, the environment is far better than that of Rhodes Island, one is a cliff, and the other is mostly flat beaches. Moreover, the garrison on Samos Island also has difficulties in supply, and its supplies rely only on air transport. The British also admit that the German side has air superiority there. In terms of sea transport, since the German army occupied the main islands, the British naval superiority has also been difficult to maintain. For the sake of reputation, the enemy has to defend Samos Island with all its might, and the situation on both sides is so disparate. Therefore, it is a tragedy for the enemy. The surrender of the Badoglio regime is of no benefit to the enemy in the Aegean Sea. The situation in the Adriatic Sea is also the same. Although the Allied forces now have the Strait of Otranto, they may land at the teaching points on the east coast of Italy. However, the enemy troops have already suffered a lot in the war in southern Italy. Whether they intend to create a similar situation in the Balkans is still a major question.

### Lebanese Incident Basically Resolved

At the same time, he denied that he had signed any announcement confirming the unrestrained independence of Lebanon. It was also reported that Germaine had expressed his opposition to the establishment of an international anti-Axis committee to resolve the matter, saying that this would only increase the difficulty. He also stated that Lebanon could not be made independent before discussing it with the League of Nations, because the matter was not only an issue between France and Lebanon, but also an issue between Britain and France. It was also reported that the arrested officials of the Lebanese government will be released but will not be reinstated.

### German Counterattack Progresses West of Kiev, the Nivil River Bend Line Shortens

### Minister Matsushima's Speech at the Propaganda Conference

(Yesterday) The battle in the South Pacific is looking fiercer, and the enemy is continuing a desperate counterattack. As a result, our interception operation is making it impossible for the enemy not to carry out a bloody battle. However, the enemy still does not change its ways, and thinking of some successes in the past, they continue their resistance. However, the operational experience of the last half month or so can confirm how meaningless this counterattack of the enemy is.

Now, let me tell you the key points. In the past, on October 27th, which was the U.S. Navy Day, in the morning, an enemy unit landed on Mono Island, south of Guadalcanal Island.

Prior to this, our naval aviation unit discovered on the northeast sea of Mono Island, the landing point, a fleet of transport ships and large landing craft with a total of ten ships equipped with cruisers, destroyers, and escort ships. Therefore, without avoiding the opportunity, it launched a decisive attack on that ship, and the battle result was to sink two cruisers, destroy two cruisers, sink two transport ships, and destroy one transport ship. Among them, one cruiser was actually sunk by one of the three self-detonating aircraft of our side using the fuselage.

However, the enemy stubbornly continued their island-hopping operation, and continued to forcibly strike Guadalcanal Island and Rabaul with air force formations of about 100 aircraft every day. On the morning of the 28th, a large formation of 79 aircraft attacked our military position on Balale Island, east of Bougainville Island. At that time, our garrison shot down 27 of them. Afterwards, our navy keenly monitored the enemy's movements, and on the morning of October 30th, it discovered a powerful enemy merchant fleet, divided into several squadrons, heading north from the sea south of New Georgia Island. At this time, the imperial naval aviation unit and maritime unit immediately began to intercept the aviation troops. From the night of the 31st to the morning of November 2nd, they attacked the enemy transport ships and maritime unit equipped with some aerial direct assaults on the sea east of Mono Island and the sea west of Bougainville Island. On the night of November 1st, they engaged in battle with the enemy's powerful cruiser and destroyer fleet outside Kasserine Bay on Bougainville Island. The overall battle result of this battle was: nine cruisers bombed and sunk or sunk, two destroyer ships, four transport fleets, more than forty boats, and ten aircraft destroyed. Our side's losses were only one destroyer sunk, two cruisers slightly damaged, and a total of fifteen aircraft that did not detonate.

In the meantime, an enemy unit landed near Cape Torokina, off Bougainville Island, on the morning of November 1st, and landed from the Haiso area on the morning of the 2nd. However, our army immediately launched an interception against them, and at that time the naval aviation unit and maritime unit also cooperated in annihilating the enemy's landing unit.

In the meantime, the enemy supported the landing operation on Bougainville Island with air warfare, and launched a fierce attack on our Rabaul base. On November 2nd, our side cooperated on the sea, land, and air to fight against 210 aircraft from the enemy in Rabaul. As a result, 201 aircraft were shot down, and most of them were damaged. Our side also lost 15 aircraft.

As for the tragic situation of this air battle, we can also infer from the phrase "tragic and indescribable" said by an enemy air raid team member.

Also, on Buka Island, north of Bougainville Island, about 135 enemy aircraft attacked on November 2nd. At that time, our ground troops shot down 39 of them.

Since mid-October, the air raids carried out by the enemy in the northern Solomon Islands and New Britain have been very tragic. The damage ratio is thirteen or four to one, which is really a number that has never been seen in world records. In the naval and air battles before and after this, the enemy's personnel losses are probably no less than 10,000, which is really chilling for the enemy.

On the morning of the 4th, the enemy attacked Buin on Bougainville Island with a large squadron of 150 fighter-bombers. At this time, our side shot down 15 enemy aircraft. (To be continued)

### Chairman Bose Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday; Mayor Chen Hosts Grand Banquet

Central News Agency Report: The Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, Subhas Chandra Bose, after attending the Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo, Japan, took a trip to China on his way back to his country. First, he went to our national capital to pay his respects to our leader and had a cordial conversation.

To welcome the Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, Subhas Chandra Bose, to Shanghai, people from all walks of life in the city held a grand welcome rally at the Grand Theater on Jing'an Temple Road at 3 p.m. sharp. Mayor Chen Gongbo accompanied Chairman Bose to the venue on time. The entire audience stood up to pay their respects. Also present were Mr. N. G.

Mayor’s Speech

Briefly stated: "Ladies and gentlemen, today I represent the people of Shanghai in extending a welcome to Chairman Bose. The citizens of Shanghai welcome Chairman Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, with the utmost enthusiasm, and even more welcome Bose, the leader who is fighting for the independence and freedom of India. Although Chairman Bose's visit is short, I firmly believe that it has united our leader and the masses of China into an inseparable friendly entity between China and India. The British policy of oppression in India is a policy of 'divide and rule,' which has caused immeasurable sacrifices to the Indian people. Throughout history, countless Indian people have sacrificed themselves for liberation, with their great achievements clearly documented. However, Britain not only fails to grant India independence but also seeks to divide India, because without division, Britain would have no way to rule. Chairman Bose is leading 300 million people in India to seek the unification of India and to seek India's freedom and independence. The Provisional Government is the vanguard of the official government of free India. The Allied nations of Greater East Asia have recognized the Provisional Government. In the recent Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo, all Allied nations pledged to fully support India's independence. The freedom of the Indian people is imminent. Today, we welcome Bose, the Indian revolutionary leader who is a revolutionary comrade. We hope to achieve our common goal as soon as possible, overthrow Anglo-American imperialism, and build a Greater East Asia where we can coexist and prosper together."

Bose's Speech

Briefly stated: "Today, I feel very sorry that I cannot speak to you in my national language. Today, I am deeply grateful for the warm welcome from the Mayor, officials, and all of you. I am truly unable to express my gratitude with mere words. I see Shanghai today as a unified Shanghai, and this is something to be celebrated. Under the leadership of Mayor Chen, Shanghai is fully implementing the future of China, and soon it will be completely unified. We revolutionaries take construction as our motto. The necessary war is for construction and revitalization. If anyone asks who hopes for China's unification, I will say decisively that it is Japan. On the contrary, it is Britain and America. We currently have a new task and a common goal, which is to hope that all the nations of Greater East Asia will rise together and unite. If China can achieve unification and liberation, then India can also achieve freedom, independence, and liberation, because the two are interconnected. Every Indian hopes for China's unification. I am a friend of China, and I wish China success in establishing permanent peace and cooperation in the construction of Greater East Asia. On behalf of the Indian government and the Indian people, I extend my gratitude to you."

Indian Community Meeting

The five thousand Indian expatriates in Shanghai, in order to enthusiastically welcome the visit of Chairman Bose of the motherland's government, gathered at the Jinmen Hotel at 4 p.m. yesterday (the 21st) to pay their respects to Chairman Bose.

Finally, Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India delivered a speech. At the end, representatives of the Indian expatriates presented Chairman Bose with flowers and a military sword, with emotions running high. The meeting concluded with shouts of "Long Live Indian Independence."

Hirota's Speech

Central News Agency Report: Mr. Hirota, the Director of the Intelligence Department of the Japanese Embassy, stated in his speech at the Grand Theater yesterday afternoon, at the Indian community's welcome rally for Bose, that "the united front organized by the people of East Asia to oppose Britain and America is our guarantee of ultimate victory. The Free Indian Army, with this confidence in victory, can advance towards New Delhi to liberate your motherland from British tyranny." Hirota also congratulated the Indian people on the excellent opportunity they have now, and "forcefully stated that India is about to rise up against Britain, which has long oppressed the Indian people. In the past, Indian people have repeatedly attempted to free hundreds of millions of people from the shackles of the British, resulting in the blood of many loyal patriots. Their grievances can be avenged today. You can get the full assistance of the Japanese army and advance towards New Delhi to obtain the freedom and independence you have long desired. You can absolutely trust Japan and the Japanese people, who are brave and fearless and will never retreat in order to realize their ideals. They will assist you everywhere to overthrow Anglo-American imperialism. Your struggle for freedom is not an isolated battle. Japan and other countries in East Asia are fighting alongside you, and this alone is a guarantee of your absolute victory. Indian patriots, following the wise leadership of Chairman Bose, are marching towards victory. Support the Chairman with your lives and blood, and you will surely receive my sympathy and support, which is also the sympathy and support of the entire Japanese people."

### Seventh Phase of Household Oil Rationing; Universal Sale Expected by the End of the Month; Sales Price Still Being Adjusted

The seventh phase of household oil rationing in the city will continue to be handled by the Oil and Fat Professional Committee. 600 tons of edible oil have been shipped to Shanghai and are expected to be rationed around the end of this month. The rationing method is as follows: residents in districts 1-8 can purchase the oil with oil purchase certificates. Residents in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong districts will continue to purchase the oil from designated oil stores according to past methods. The quantity remains at four ounces per person, and the price is still being adjusted by the authorities.

Household Oil Rationing Will Not Be Interrupted

According to the Thai Duzhi Bao, the Oil and Grain Committee under the General Commercial Control Association has taken decisive steps to stabilize the edible oil supply and has begun to implement them. The First Public Office can announce the sale of household oil within this week. Every Chinese resident can purchase the oil with the first phase of oil purchase certificates issued by the former Engineering Office in February of this year. According to their explanation, there is no reason for the long-term interruption of household oil rationing, and they guarantee that it will not be interrupted. The implementation period has arrived. At the same time, they believe that the quantity purchased from retailers with the first phase of oil purchase certificates is sufficient to meet the needs of residents. The authorities have decided to continuously implement the household oil rationing system, because the raw materials for oil production are being shipped from abroad in a steady stream.

### Adjustment of Cigarette Rationing; New Certificates Issued with Caution; 19th Phase of Goods Distribution and Payment

After strengthening the cigarette rationing mechanism, the Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association has adjusted the grades of wholesale and retail merchants. It has thoroughly cracked down on the black market for cigarettes, strictly implemented price controls, and is very serious about supervision.

### Chairman Bose Meets with Reporters

Delivers Speech: East Asians Must Achieve Two Things: China's Unification and India's Liberation

Central News Agency Report: The Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, Subhas Chandra Bose, met with reporters from Chinese, Japanese, and foreign newspapers in the city at 2 p.m. yesterday at the Cathay Hotel, 8th floor. Chairman Bose attended the meeting on time, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel N. G. Swamy and Secretary Hassan. Also present were the head of the intelligence department of the Japanese Embassy, Mr. Kishi, the director of the intelligence section of the Shanghai Office, Mr. Hirota, the head of the army reporting department, Major Izubuchi, Lieutenant Nakagawa, Lieutenant Sakamoto, Captain Nagashima of the fleet reporting department, Director Liang Xiuyu of the municipal propaganda office, Dai Zhenjiang, the chief secretary of the Xin Kai Joint Association, Ren Yunting, and the head of the information department in Shanghai, Mr. Korth. First, Chairman Bose gave a speech on his participation in the Greater East Asia Conference and his feelings about this trip. He then answered questions raised by the Chinese, Japanese, and foreign reporters in detail, which lasted for half an hour.

Bose's Speech

Mr. Bose first expressed his gratitude for the welcome from the political and news circles in Shanghai, saying that he had worked in the Indian news industry for many years, so he was very pleased with the work of the reporters. He then said that he attended the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo as an observer and was deeply impressed. The Greater East Asia Conference symbolized that the work of building Greater East Asia had actually begun. He declared at the Greater East Asia Conference that the principles contained in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration were the only principles for building a new order in East Asia, and the impact would not only affect East Asia, but the whole world would also be affected, as the prelude to building a new world order. The two things that East Asians must achieve in the future are: first, the full unification of China, and second, the liberation of India. Regarding China's unification, we must first seek peace between the Chinese and Japanese people. Although China and Japan have had disagreements from time to time in the past, these things have become the past, and now it is possible. China's unification is not only a blessing for China, but also a blessing for India. Gandhi stated before entering prison that the Sino-Japanese incident could increase the war machine of the East Asian people against Britain and America. He continued: India's liberation war has received the support of the countries of East Asia. From a revolutionary standpoint, the prerequisites for success have been obtained. He predicted that the winter counteroffensive propagated by Britain and America would be difficult to succeed, and there was a possibility of being driven out of India! However, India's liberation war is not easy, and the Indian people must prepare for a long-term war, but at the same time, they must have the determination to win.

### Welcoming Jiangtela Bose

— Nan Xiao

The leader of the Provisional Government of Free India, Jiangtela Bose, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 21st) by plane from Tokyo after visiting Nanjing.

Before our eyes, we see the jubilation of the Indian people. This is probably the first time that the Indians living in Shanghai have been so happy! Since they came to Shanghai, they have often been manipulated by the British and Americans, acting as their running dogs. They have tried to stand up on their own several times. But they could not withstand the blow from Britain and America and fell again, until today. However, now, the nations of Greater East Asia are liberated, and the leader of Free India, Bose, has come to Shanghai. The Indian people are ecstatic. We believe that the joy of the Indian people today will accumulate permanently in the future.

Bose appeared in Zhaonan in early July. In the past four months, he has been traveling between Thailand, Burma, and the Malay Peninsula, without a moment to spare. His efforts have been rewarded, and he attended the Greater East Asia Conference as a leader of the liberation of Greater East Asian nations. For 170 years, whether as the supreme crown of the British colonial overlord or as the milch cow of the British Empire, sometimes as laborers and soldiers for Britain, what India has contributed to Britain is innumerable. However, the evil deeds that Britain has repaid India are often criticized even by the British themselves, and it is impossible to list them all. In Britain's view, India is the center of the British colonial empire. Therefore, Bose's declaration of independence on Zhaonan Island was a fatal blow to Britain. India has been plunged into an unprecedented famine because of Britain's policy of division. But British dignitaries have stood idly by, offering no assistance. If they recall what they have done to the Indian people in the past 170 years, then what is happening today is naturally to be expected.

Britain Has Suffered Two Blows

Since becoming the overlord of the modern colonial movement, Britain has suffered two fatal blows to date. One is the independence of the United States, and the other is the independence of India this time. Although the independence of the two is different in nature, they are the same in terms of the enormous impact on all mankind. The thirteen states of the United States openly declared independence from Britain and entered a state of decisive battle. Britain had already received a major lesson on human liberation at that time, but it still indulged in the exploitation of colonies. At the time of American independence, it loudly called for the freedom of the Indian people to Britain, but now Britain and the United States have become birds of a feather. They have united against East Asia and engaged in a decisive battle. The abused (the US) and the abuser (Britain) have become kindred spirits. The American Declaration of Independence states:

"All men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. (Omission) That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."

That is how the United States became independent. The current situation in India is even more profound than that of the United States at that time. In this sense, India's independence is natural. Moreover, India's independence is a natural sequence.

The reasons for independence have been stated above, but when we compare the independence of India with the independence of the United States, we find a great difference. That is race. The difference between colored people and white people.

Bose's Passionate Broadcast

Judging from the phrase "Asia is one family," Bose also seemed to agree in his passionate forty-minute broadcast to Chongqing at the guesthouse on the 20th.

Among the ten hundred million people of Greater East Asia, China and India are not yet fully independent. Therefore, our fervent hope for Bose's independence movement gives great inspiration to the Chinese people.

When it comes to Asia's independence, Bose declares that "first, China must be unified, and second, India must be free." And the ones hindering China's unification are Britain and America. Japan, which Chongqing says is hindering China's unification, is already hoping for the solidarity of East Asia.

Chongqing is still resisting without the name of resistance. As the only alien element in East Asia, it is leaving behind eternal regrets.

Bose said: "Who are you fighting against?" The more you continue to resist, the more you fall into the trap of Britain and America, and the greater your debt becomes." "For the sake of the selfish instincts of Britain and America, you end up being food for them." "If the Chinese people want unification, it can be achieved within twenty-four hours." "But the unification that brings happiness and prosperity to the Chinese people cannot be achieved with the help of Britain and America."

With the tears of half a lifetime fighting against Britain, Bose passionately called on Chongqing to reflect!

Hearing these words, we can know that India now has even more profound reasons for independence than the United States at the time of its independence. At this stage, India's independence is really discovering India's position as a link in the liberation of the Asian nations. In this sense, Bose's broadcast to Chongqing has a very profound significance.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: I have read the Central News Agency report in your newspaper on the 17th, which states that the temporary rules for entrusting the district map chiefs in the city area have been approved, and that the map chiefs should act as witnesses for land transactions. This is not in accordance with the facts. The temporary rules are currently being reviewed by the Finance and Land Administration Bureaus of the Municipal Government. Before the incident, the transfer of real estate in this city only required the parties involved to fill out an application form at the bureau. Now, in view of the unsettled situation, in order to be cautious, it is specially stipulated that an official contract must be signed with the names of witnesses. The witnesses should be impartial people trusted by both parties and are not limited to land registry map chiefs or wardens. We make this special statement to clarify. Shanghai Special City Land Administration Bureau.

Yesterday's news was broadcast at 7:50 p.m.

### Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange Considers Cash on Delivery; Implementation Requires Proper Planning

Since the Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange opened on the 8th of this month, the trading of Chinese stocks has been limited to cash transactions with next-day delivery. It is reported that the telephone line has been installed in the market, and in order to promote business, it is planned to resume afternoon trading and implement a new "cash on delivery" system. The "cash on delivery" system means that for the Chinese stocks traded every day, the settlement will be made every Monday, and the previous next-day delivery system will be abolished. For example, customers who buy or sell stocks can temporarily not pay or deliver the goods until the following Monday when the settlement is completed. It is said that it has been internally decided to implement it starting today, and the commission paid by the exchange to the brokers will be temporarily collected at 0.0625, and in the future it will be slightly increased to 0.125. However, the commission charged by the brokers to the customers is 0.5%, and the transaction tax is additionally collected at 0.06%. A reporter learned from relevant parties yesterday that all sectors hope that the exchange's so-called "cash on delivery" will be carefully considered and implemented, because the so-called "cash on delivery" is similar to a disguised form of spot futures trading, which can easily be manipulated by speculators or create situations such as buying and selling short. It is reported that the exchange has solemnly stated that the exchange is considering the issue of "cash on delivery". If it is implemented, proper measures must be taken in advance to prevent speculation and manipulation and avoid affecting the stock market.

Smooth Transfer of Leather: No Obstruction—Leather Industry Association: Regarding leather, which can be freely transferred in three provinces and two cities, the association has received reports from members about frequent cases of detention by the police within the city. It has petitioned the municipal government for relief, which the mayor has approved, instructing the affiliated First and Second Police Bureaus to allow the transfer of leather without obstruction in the future, to alleviate difficulties. The bureaus have also been instructed to notify all affiliated branches for unified knowledge and enforcement.

Allocation Plan

Household allocation will still be handled by the responsible district supervisors, while general allocation (i.e., special allocation) will be handled by the office’s separate allocation department after clarification by various industry associations or organizations. Regional allocation will be implemented gradually based on the conditions of each district, such as Chongming.

Collection of Great Victories in the South Pacific

### Escorting a Transport Convoy: One of the South Pacific Naval Battles

The second major victory near Bougainville Island was the second major blow struck by the Japanese Navy after Pearl Harbor during a long period of silence, sinking as many as twenty-four enemy warships and vessels to the bottom of the South Pacific! This major victory was entirely due to the efforts of the officers and men who worked day and night on aircraft, torpedo boats, and resupply operations.

Departure of the Merchant Convoy

[Month and Day redacted] The merchant convoy was scheduled to depart at 00:00. Our ship, acting as a patrol vessel, departed first, raising signal flags and directing several anti-submarine patrol boats to leave the harbor. The South Pacific [Location redacted] Base. Our naval aircraft patrolled the sea. At 00:00, the convoy formed into a defensive formation and began a zigzag pattern. On the bridge of the escort vessels, in the command post, and on the conning tower, the watch was set up. A sickle-shaped crescent moon peeked through the clouds. Due to the enemy submarines’ activity both day and night, the number of lookouts was increased from [Number redacted] to [Number redacted]. The recent enemy submarine activity was just as the lookouts had said: “Five minutes before moonrise,” “Five minutes before sunrise,” appearing and disappearing as the color of the sea surface changed. This merchant convoy was carrying many southern resources. If these resources could safely reach our country, they would be fully loaded with war materials for the first line of battle. Now was a time when not a single merchant ship could be allowed to sink. How important was the responsibility of the escort vessels!

[Month and Day redacted] “Prepare for aerial defense!” Just after 11:00 on the [Number redacted] day, this order was suddenly heard. Five enemy bombers were approaching to attack our convoy. At that time, our ship was already sailing at high speed. A white wake appeared, and the ship moved in a rapid curve, beginning to sway from side to side.

“Bearing right thirty degrees, altitude [Number redacted] thousand!”

The command post’s order was clear. Rat-tat-tat… Rat-tat-tat… the guns fired at the enemy planes, and at the same time, the enemy planes dropped bombs. The enemy’s bombs fell around the convoy, landing in the sea, and our ships’ bows moved forward calmly in the water spray. The enemy planes, fearing the firepower of our escort vessels, could not fly directly over the ships. They only dropped bombs and flew away.

“Thank you for your valiant fight!”

Each merchant ship raised this signal flag.

Sinking an Enemy Submarine

[Month and Day redacted] The northward route became increasingly winding. That night, our ship’s lookout spotted an enemy submarine surfaced in the rain.

“Prepare for anti-submarine defense!”

The enemy submarine surfaced unexpectedly, no more than [Number redacted] meters from our ship. Seeing our ship, it panicked and hastily submerged.

“Ready!” “Hard a starboard!”

“Begin depth charge attack!”

Soon, the sound of explosions rang out in the sea.

“Confirmed!” “Confirmed!”

The officers and the captain spoke confidently.

“The convoy is safe!”

The convoy continued its voyage silently, unharmed.

Stormy Weather

[Month and Day redacted] From daybreak, the waves surged, and the ship shook. The weather report indicated a risk of a typhoon.

“Prepare for the storm!” the order came.

Double and triple ropes were hung on the motor launch. Ropes were also stretched across the deck for use when moving around. The shelves and chairs in the officers’ room were also tied down to prevent them from shaking. Just after noon, a strong wind rose, and the waves were higher than the ship’s side, obscuring the horizon. However, our convoy’s ears and eyes remained sharp. According to intelligence from a submarine, an enemy submarine was reported to be forty miles from our convoy. Before nightfall, the submarine circled the convoy once and positioned itself ahead of the convoy. The waves grew higher and higher, and the ship sailed as if in the middle of a mountain range, in a valley thousands of feet deep. From 4:00 AM, the low-pressure line of the barometer began to drop sharply at a right angle, dropping 731 millibars in an hour. The waves became triangular, the wind speed was ten meters per second, and the electric wires and flag ropes whistled. The convoy was shrouded in thick fog, and nothing could be seen. The triangular waves crashed against the bottom of the ship. It didn’t feel like seawater.

“Intelligence came in that there was a submarine, and a typhoon struck just as we were about to pass through dangerous waters. It’s a divine wind! The submarine definitely can’t surface.”

The [Rank redacted] soldier in the command post said this.

“The weather is changing! The weather is changing!”

The lookout in a black raincoat shouted, his eyes glued to his binoculars.

Torpedoes Arrive After the Typhoon

[Month and Day redacted] Around 6:00 AM, we passed through the center of the typhoon. Seawater hit the ship’s deck and flowed to the flag deck. It was a terrible typhoon.

“What will happen to the convoy?”

The captain said, “We can break through the typhoon circle after noon. We have already instructed the convoy to gather at [Number redacted] degrees after passing through the typhoon.”

Our ship discovered two merchant ships after passing through the center of the typhoon. But because of the headwind and high waves, it was like descending from the top of a mountain to the desolate sea, approaching the merchant ships. The merchant ships were the [Number redacted] and [Number redacted] ships of the convoy.

“The whereabouts of the other merchant ships are unknown.”

The two merchant ships responded with signal flags. Our ship escorted these two ships to the gathering point at [Number redacted] degrees. The typhoon passed, and the waves gradually subsided. Suddenly, a thudding sound was heard from the [Number redacted] ship.

“Torpedo attack!”

In a split second, our ship’s propeller rotated to full speed, and it turned sharply towards the place where the sound came from. Depth charges dropped from the stern of our ship detonated in the sea.

“Is that a torpedo?”

The soldiers laughed loudly inside the ship. Because our ship was there, it couldn’t have been a torpedo attack. In that situation, a ship like ours, fully loaded with gunpowder and heavy artillery, was more dangerous than a merchant ship.

Mission Accomplished

[Month and Day redacted] The sea gradually calmed down. After the calm, the anti-submarine patrol had to be even more vigilant. The lookouts stared intently at the sea. Just then, the position of several submarines was discovered, closing in on our convoy.

“Prepare for anti-submarine defense!”

Our ship used signals to inform the convoy of the position of the submarines and sped towards that direction. The enemy submarines fired seven torpedoes in a fan shape towards the convoy. The pale white trails, like several belts, were faintly visible on the sea surface. Our merchant ships skillfully evaded them. Two timed torpedoes exploded behind the convoy. We dropped depth charges towards the submarines where the torpedoes had been fired.

“The enemy has submerged. The outer hull is probably broken, and seawater is flooding into the ship, sinking it to the bottom of the sea! Or perhaps the electrical equipment is damaged, and it can’t move. Most of them are buried in the fish’s belly,” the electrician laughed. Thus, from departing from [Location redacted] on [Date redacted], for [Number redacted] days, thanks to the tireless activity of the escort ships, the convoy returned safely to [Location redacted] port. (Reported: Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, November 13th)

### Blitzkrieg Triumph: Destroy Ten Enemy Ships in Five Minutes

Eliminating obstacles and destroying the enemy along the way, the battlefield of the South Pacific, where the fruits of victory are gradually becoming clear, makes people deeply feel that "the great war is behind us!" Detailed reports of the glorious air battle over the waters of Bougainville Island continue to arrive, and amid the enemy’s blind bombing and the explosion of anti-aircraft shells, the reporter hastily recorded the following account of the attack by a member of the dive bomber squadron who participated in the attack that day.

Ready and Waiting

The dive bomber squadron and the fighter squadron received orders to sortie on the morning of November 8th. They had been waiting for an opportunity to attack, but there were no convoys to attack, and they were lamenting that their heroism was going unused when they received a report that a large convoy had appeared near the enemy’s landing point on Bougainville Island. The crew members rushed to their planes, ready to "blow them to smithereens!" At this [Location redacted] air base, the rainy season was approaching, and the heat was extreme. For more than ten days, there hadn’t even been a drizzle. The weeds growing on the vast airfield were scorched by the sun. When the engines of the formation aircraft started spinning, a cloud of dust was immediately kicked up, making it impossible to open one’s mouth or eyes. It was as if a heavy smoke screen was being spread. Amidst this sky-obscuring smoke, the dive bombers, clutching [Number redacted] kg bombs, took off one every few seconds.

Embarking on the Journey

The bomber squadron and the escorting fighter squadron, filling the sky above the base, spread their wings and set off in formation. Everyone was filled with ambition. It was a powerful surprise attack by a large mixed formation of fighters and bombers! Twenty minutes, thirty minutes, the time passed quickly. Captain H, leading the [Number redacted] squadron, led [Number redacted] dive bombers forward, flying towards the skies where the enemy convoy was located. Fortunately, the weather was clear. Through the gaps in the broken clouds floating under the wings, one could see the calm, blue sea. At an altitude of [Number redacted], the needle on the speedometer pointed to [Number redacted] and remained still. The engine roared, and the propeller spun rapidly. In the distance to the left, the giant form of Bougainville Island could be seen through the broken clouds. Mount Balbi, over three thousand meters high, was faintly visible among the clouds. After another [Number redacted] minutes, we arrived at the battlefield. Looking around, the following planes in formation maintained a magnificent formation. The fighter squadron suddenly reduced speed and flew down to the northeast at full speed, their sharp eyes flashing, on the alert for enemy aircraft. Five, ten minutes passed, and suddenly a loud voice came through the speaking tube from the spotter: “There, enemy convoy!” Indeed, below the left wing, near Torokina off the enemy’s landing point on Bougainville Island, there were patrol boats, destroyers, and X number of transport ships, traveling north at a speed of fifteen knots under strict escort.

Launching the Attack

The escorting fighter squadron suddenly left the formation and flew down to the northeast at full speed. Looking over, enemy fighter planes in various formations were rushing towards the bomber squadron from among the clouds. “Here they come!” While thinking this, they began to dive, leaving the enemy fighters to be dealt with by the friendly defense aircraft. The bombers broke through the clouds and pointed their noses towards the sea from an altitude of [Number redacted] meters. In an instant, the enemy’s defensive fire erupted. The enemy convoy’s high-angle guns and pom-pom guns fired furiously. Suddenly, the sky turned dark, and a barrage of shells surrounded the bomber squadron. Bright red tracer bullets flashed through the barrage, dazzling the eyes. The attacking crew members gritted their teeth, widened their bloodshot eyes, and began their masterpiece of dive bombing. Ships in the bombing squadron caught fire. Some listed to the left and right, about to sink; some were running at full speed, trying to escape. In an instant, the calm sea turned into a hellish scene of wailing ghosts and screaming demons. The following squadrons continued to attack relentlessly. There were also friendly planes that were hit directly by enemy defensive fire while pulling up after dropping their bombs and self-detonated. There were also planes that were dive bombed again after enemy fighters stole through the gaps between the friendly fighters. Thus, the extremely fierce, do-or-die attack was completed in five minutes. Three enemy destroyers and four transport ships sank in an instant; two cruisers and one transport ship were damaged; fifteen enemy aircraft were shot down. Thus, the fighter-bomber mixed attack squadron returned triumphantly to the [Number redacted] base.

Singing Triumphantly

The moon on the tenth day shone like silver in the blue sky. The southwest horizon was filled with cumulus clouds, thunder rumbled, and the clouds flashed, but it didn’t rain. The setting sun still shone with a strong red light, and the earth was like fire. When the dive bomber squadron, escorted by fighters, returned to the skies above the base, another attack squadron was preparing to depart, as a force including combat ships was reported to be sailing northward forty-five nautical miles southwest of Bougainville Island.

### News of Victory Comes from the Air Raid Shelter

That night, we walked into the air raid shelter, the shrill sound of the enemy twin-engine bombers between the layers of [redacted], and the deafening roar of the friendly high [redacted] and the sound of launching, it was simply impossible to breathe.

Danger, Danger

"It's falling!" Someone whispered. In an instant, suddenly felt the shaking of the earth. Illuminated by searchlights from all directions. And the anti-aircraft guns, like fireworks, continuously exploded around it, the enemy plane was probably blindly dropping bombs again, just like what [redacted] had done. On the hillside behind, there was a sudden explosion, and a blast [redacted] probably the attack group of several planes that had come down to strafe with machine guns." I was thinking this. Unexpectedly, with one hand waving an empty cigarette box, he happily said to the officer:

"The accurate results of the Bougainville Island naval battle are now clear, and I'm here to report them to you."

This sentence. Instantly made everyone in the shelter forget the enemy planes above their heads, filled with joy and excitement, their chests filled to the brim.

In the twilight of the seventh day, a urgent telegram came from a reconnaissance plane, saying that a large mobile unit centered on four enemy warships had been discovered near the Cape Torokina off Bougainville Island, [redacted] was immediately filled with murderous intent.

Thus, on the dawn of the eighth day, we stood outside the dormitory to send off the warriors. The roaring engine, shaking like a [redacted], sounded overhead, flying south. The signal lights of the fighter planes and bombers, proudly [redacted], shone in the starry sky of dawn, gradually disappearing towards the horizon. I waved my hat, devoutly silently [redacted] success in this trip.

Two hours, three hours—time passed slowly in anxiety. In the [redacted] sunlight, we stood among the coconut trees, [redacted] the distant southern sky, waiting for [redacted] Hawaii [redacted] [redacted] the enemy's large fleet that had not been there since the head.

In the Sound of Great Victory

It was already [redacted] o'clock, and we waved our hats frantically again at the blue sky, welcoming the large formation that had set out in the morning. When the black dots of the formation appeared on the horizon, our hearts [redacted] jumped to our throats. However, one hour, two hours, several more anxious hours passed, and still not much news of the battle came from the distant airfield. Walking into the street, the soldiers I met all asked, "Reporting team, is the result of the battle still unknown?" Later, news came of two warships sunk, four warships bombed, and all kinds of other information, but it was not accurate. However, everyone believed that [redacted] must be the only result since Pearl Harbor, so everyone raised their glasses to celebrate [redacted].

Since Sergeant Major's news was the telegram that was about to be quoted, of course it would not be wrong. With this premise, quietly listened to him reporting loudly:

"Three battleships sunk, two cruisers (bombed), three destroyers, four transport ships, one herbivorous ship caught fire and was badly damaged, three or more large cruisers were badly damaged, three cruisers and large destroyers were also on fire and badly damaged, and one large transport ship was on fire and badly damaged, and twelve enemy planes. This is the part that has been ascertained so far, plus what will be ascertained later." (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, November 17th)

### Life

— Ru Zhijuan

Who says life is hard?

A few small words in the want ad section, "A certain fashion company is hiring several female employees," reflecting in Qinhen’s tired eyes, are as big as a rice bowl. She changed into her most fashionable blue cotton cheongsam as quickly as possible. Her ordinary face in the mirror was flashing. The door slammed. She grabbed her college diploma, which she had obtained with years of brainpower and effort, and, harboring a hopeful heart, rushed out of her kitchen.

In the gentle autumn breeze, Qinhen finally squeezed into the group of gaudily dressed girls. The cloying fragrance of powder drilled straight into her nostrils. She barely managed to get to the office to make contact. One hand held her diploma, and the other didn't know where to put itself. The muscles on her face tightened. Taking unnaturally strange steps, she walked to the desk in the center and saw a middle-aged man with a fat head and big ears sitting opposite her. Several people dressed in Western suits were also sitting on the sofas around the room, their sharp eyes scanning her body. The questions vibrated in her ears. She answered awkwardly. Disappointment gradually permeated Qinhen’s heart, slowly climbing onto her ordinary face. On the bright floor, her blurred shadow was moving towards the door. Raising her head slightly, she saw a dazzling bouquet of flowers coming towards her.

The office door closed gently. In the crack of the door, was the man sitting in the center nodding to the gardener named Cai Daoyun?

Who says life is hard?

A long street stretched out in front of Qinhen. She wandered in the gentle autumn breeze, wandering, wandering…

The kitchen door slammed shut, hitting the wall. The oval-shaped scale hanging on the wall also trembled incessantly. Qinhen’s ordinary face flashed again in the swaying mirror.

The newspaper lying still on the table remained motionless. The small words printed on it, "A certain fashion company is hiring female employees…" Below were even smaller words, "Must have high moral character and refined appearance…" They gradually grew larger in Qinhen’s eyes, growing larger… The diploma for a rice bowl was torn into two pieces. A series of "chi chi chi" sounds. It had become dozens of small white butterflies, flying proudly in the air, as if mocking its mistress.

Who says life is hard?

### Scavenger

— Shui Yi

Morning stars are dim and sparse,
Morning mist is dim and sparse,
The scavenger is also dim and sparse,
Spread out on the street.

— A cold painting of the morning dew,
Paper, discarded objects, and discarded cloth…
— From the garbage can
Something remains intact.
The scavenger sympathizes;
Picks it up,
And puts it into the basket on their shoulder.

Benevolent one in a group of evildoers,
Have you awakened?

When you look at this cold morning painting. (Move to assist students)

### Farewell Friend

— Zichun

Now, parting in Jiangnan,
Is the season for chrysanthemums.
If we meet again someday,
Will you remember what we said today?
Remember? Remember?
Finish this cup of clear wine! (A poem)

### Homesickness

— Huo Mu

Seven years as a guest in a foreign land,
October is a time of heartache.
My home is on the bend of the Yangtze River,
Faintly, I hear joyful inquiries.
Dusk is already approaching,
Why is the setting sun so slow to set?
I’ll channel my homesick heart,
And entrust it to an eight-line poem. (A poem)

### Opening of the West Tsing Basketball Tournament Tonight - Analysis of the Strengths of Group A Teams - The Giant Team is Ambitious, Hoping the Chinese Teams Will Strive for More Than Just the Championship and Focus on Sportsmanship

The current Four Tsing Basketball Tournament will open tonight (the 22nd). This time, there are twelve teams participating in Group A and as many as forty-two teams in Group B. It can be said that it is a general mobilization of basketball teams in Shanghai, and one can foresee a grand occasion on the banks of the Rue Brenier. Taking advantage of this pre-opening, this article records past events, hoping that each team will adopt them. It also provides an analysis of the strengths of each team in Group A as a reference for fans! One of the important aspects of a basketball team is excellent difficulty, which is also a hidden worry for the Chinese teams. What is lacking is the patience to perform; it is by no means a random coincidence. Winners of past championships have their own conditions! The main points are: the team members must have abundant energy, pure and skilled techniques, cooperation within each team, and constant changes in strategies during combat, with precise adjustments before changes. After the game, research should be conducted on collecting winning points. In addition, it is more important to obey the coach and maintain the same spirit throughout. If this can be achieved, a wonderful performance can be presented, and the true meaning of sports can be understood. However, observing the teams in Shanghai, many only decide on personnel close to the opening date, which inevitably leads to suspicions of being a hastily assembled group, and they all lack good coaches, often leading to situations where success or failure depends on a single opportunity, which is very regrettable. Therefore, the reporter humbly offers some suggestions, hoping that each team will not regard them as clichés and will repeatedly consider my words, then it will not be difficult to achieve better results, how fortunate! Now, a brief analysis of the strengths of each team in Group A is as follows:

Giant Team – In the trial matches, its achievements were somewhat noticeable, defeating various teams one after another. Although this cannot be used to make a final judgment, its advantages are quite noteworthy. The entire team is strong, and its man-to-man marking is quite effective. Playing at home gives it an advantage. Its offensive guards use blocking tactics to attack, and it utilizes its tall player, Funic, who stands under the opponent's basket to await follow-up opportunities. I still remember how the pirate Ryan also used this to defeat others, making him a dangerous figure. Moreover, with the command of Kevin Love from the middle, the entire team advances and retreats very quickly. A victory.

Central North Team – It adopts a five-man zone defense. Because the team members are all veterans, their performance is still brilliant. However, the team's scoring keys, Lan Xuechong and Shen Fenggong, sometimes act as they please, and when they don't, they are completely clueless. Therefore, success or failure often depends on the team's luck on the day. And its only shortcoming is that the reporter always feels that their play is not seamless. Lan Xuechong is accustomed to using man-to-man marking, which sometimes leads to conflicting performances. In short, the team believes that it is still a promising team.

Ren Yu Team – Its only advantage is that its players have the best physiques, which is worth mentioning. Its tactics are particularly tight in defense and use high speed in attack. Unfortunately, its players are short in stature, which is a significant disadvantage. This year, it is cooperating with the Bing team, and its two forwards are using new players, which should be surprising. We will wait and see!

Hua Lian Team – Its players are average in talent and are all strong enough. It adopts man-to-man tactics and shows considerable skill. The entire team has had several years of silent understanding, and its coordination is pure and skilled. Unfortunately, it is passionate but also reckless, and prone to committing fouls. If it can overcome this point, it can reach the pinnacle of perfection, keep striving!

Monaco – It is a team promoted from Group B. Its tactics are the same as the Giant team. The entire team revolves around the black player Curry, who is good at learning from others' strengths to compensate for his own weaknesses, but lacks experience.

Hua Ying Team – It is composed of film industry employees who are active in the basketball scene in their limited spare time and are listed as a Group A team, which is truly commendable. General opinion predicts that it will be at the bottom of the pack, but watching its trial matches, it seemed to defeat the Giant team in the first half, so it should not be underestimated. Its characteristic is absolute obedience to the coach. Its game time is often the same as filming time. Therefore, its exquisite five players may not be able to attend every game, which is a shortcoming that cannot be compensated for. In the reporter's opinion, the team's performance can be in the middle.

Eastern and Amateur – Both are incarnations of the Paramount Ballroom. Eastern has Du Bensheng joining the team, assisted by Bao Songyuan, plus Zhang Shaoqing, Wang Jinghu, and Guo Qichang, a famous general newly arrived from Qingdao. Amateur has Xiang Long, A Kui, Zhou Zhi, and Tao Shaosheng and He Xiaoguang from the Red Team. Both teams adopt man-to-man tactics. A slight disadvantage is that their physical strength is not sufficient, but looking back at their glorious war record in the Four Tsing Tournaments, it is not difficult to achieve good results.

Hua Nan and Tong Ren – Both are brother teams, and their cooperation has the beauty of butterflies dancing among flowers. It can be described as light, fast, and pleasing. Hua Nan is especially good. Its forward Hu Jinkui's floor skills are similar to Feng Nianhua's, so although Hua Nan's performance cannot be among the best, it has several wonderful highlights that can be enjoyed. Tong Ren's players are short in stature, which causes injuries. They can't measure distances well and can't get the ball under the basket. Everything depends on floor passes, which is really difficult. Nature is unfavorable, what can be done?

Da Hua and San Lun – Da Hua was organized by Shen Ji'en and others. It has its own court on Da Dian Road, hence the name. The team's coordination is still good, but it rarely faces strong enemies, and it often panics and becomes disorganized. With a few days of strict training, it can become a capable team. San Lun is composed of former Fudan veterans Ren An and Xiang Rui. Due to their lack of physical strength, they adopt man-to-man marking, which is extremely disadvantageous. Moreover, their will is not unified. That's all for their battles! (Jie)

[P>Group A Football League Strength Divided, Dong Lian and Police Form a Triumvirate, Portuguese Merchants and Overseas Chinese Still Have Potential, Jewish and Three Provinces a Step Behind<P]

There is still one game left in the Group A Football League, the Police vs. Overseas Chinese match, which the reporter has already written about. There were three performances yesterday and the day before yesterday, and I have recorded them. It is not difficult to follow the clues!

Dong Hua Easily Defeats Jewish – Played at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 PM on the 20th (yesterday). Although it was known that it would be a one-sided situation, the enthusiastic audience still braved the biting wind, which shows the love for Dong Hua.

This year, Dong Hua's military strength has been greatly strengthened with the return of Tan Fuzhen, Sun Jinshun, Zhang Lin'gen, and Zhou Ji, and there is hope for a championship. Jewish's main general, Tuofu, is absent, so it was predicted that it would be one-sided. However, it was not easy for the "dark horse" Jewish to score two goals.

Dong Hua's attack still retains its characteristic of short passes, which is captivating. Dai Maisun in the middle has considerable coordination, and the activity on both wings utilizes effective wing passes and accurate crosses! It can be said to be perfect. Lao Tan's versatility can be compared to Song Lingsheng. Lin Gen, Long Hai, and Shu Tang's experience has solidified the defense. The defense of Zhuang and Li Zi should be impeccable, but Zhou Ji is still inexperienced.

What I feel is lacking is that Long Hai has just recovered from a new illness and his strength is still insufficient. Lin Gen sometimes pushes too far forward and sometimes falls too far back, but fortunately, his broad physique can still cover his shortcomings. If he can stand his position well, he may become a good midfielder.

The new players on both wings are worth discussing. Wang Xisheng has more than enough running ability, is also alert, and his crosses are impressive. In this battle, he provided Lao Sun with three appropriate balls, allowing Lao Sun to display his wonderful long-range shots. He can be considered a successful masterpiece. What is lacking is that he hesitates in excellent scoring positions! Li Yao on the left wing can be said to be a good talent at a time when Shanghai lacks such talents. His speed and power of passing have reached a considerable level. What is especially commendable is his extremely skillful ability to score goals. Some fans say that he is gradually showing arrogance. The reporter sincerely hopes that Li will correct it if he has it, and encourage himself if he doesn't, and place high hopes on him!

Jewish's performance was not as disorganized as ideal. In difficult circumstances, they always shook in the past and scored two goals. Lai Zhe and Wen Tuo are strong and sharp, but the team's overall technical level is poor and it is not difficult to lose momentum. Their collection is also appropriate!

Lianyi Defeats Three Provinces by a Large Margin

Yesterday (the 21st) at 10:30 AM at Yiyuan, facing south, the sunlight was full, and watching the ball was very comfortable.

Lianyi's offensive was like a hot knife through butter, winning with an overwhelming score of ten to one, which was not expected. Before the game, Li Yichen was absent, and everyone thought that Lianyi would win without dispute, but it would inevitably be a hard fight. Unexpectedly, the Three Provinces team also had strong players absent, and the enemy was vulnerable.

Lianyi's scorers were Yuan Yongfu with three goals, Sun Jiaohao with two goals, Gao Baosheng, Song Louheng, Fei Chun, and Yu Nidai with one goal each, and an own goal from Three Provinces, totaling ten goals. Taking this battle blood as a lesson, Lianyi's difficulty lies in responding to changes at will under the excellent and relaxed conditions, and the performance seems to have no gaps. Therefore, we have to make a plan for it!

Yichen is said to have followed his father-in-law's instructions and will no longer run on the field, so Yong is now assigned to the forward position. Although he is lively, his shooting ability is not as good as Yichen's, so the offensive power is reduced a lot. Moreover, the left wing lacks Jing Jing and Yu Zhengyue are not worthy of important tasks. Qian Lao is arrogant, Yu lacks experience, and A Bu inevitably has moments of leisure. Bao Zheng is too brave and loses his position. Fei Chun also likes to add too much flourish, so there are many worrying points in the offensive power. Moreover, with Yongfu out of the center back line, replaced by Cai Sheng. The difference cannot be measured. The burden on the general will inevitably increase a lot. Therefore, the defense is also greatly strained. The reporter believes that it cannot be determined by a big win, and the future needs to be taken seriously, so there is hope.

The Three Provinces originally came to join Group A to learn from each other. Moreover, with Mr. and Mrs. Pan's vigorous encouragement to pay attention to spirit, borrowing other people's football skills for their own adoption, and using the virtue of spirit to promote the meaning of sports, their deep intentions are admirable. In terms of talent, the rest of the team are all young people. The connection with Xu Hui's comrades is also considerable. The overall lack of experience and unfamiliarity with the routines. Mai Liangsen and Zhou Wenkui's performance has the demeanor of a great general. The right winger Xue Pengkui can shoot from about twenty yards from the baseline, which can be called heroic.

Overseas Chinese Defeats Portuguese Merchants Yesterday

Portuguese Merchants had veteran players such as Costa and Nikola this year and were ambitious. However, they lost to Overseas Chinese by three to five yesterday on the banks of Jiaozhou Road, hurting the spirits of the Portuguese generals!

After Overseas Chinese suffered a major defeat to a police team last week, they decided to reorganize. David Peters played several games, with Victor Tait as the defender and Fafan laughing as the inner forward, and Carol directing the central army. With such a change, the defense and attack are well-balanced, and the team's past style has been restored. Fafan laughed and received someone's guidance, scoring four goals alone. The skills of a general are still extraordinary. Goalkeeper Ivanov's performance was outstanding, saving more than half a dozen dangerous balls. If he were replaced by Boriman, I'm afraid it would be more ominous than auspicious. Looking at the lineup of Portuguese Merchants, it is neat and impressive, and its performance still fully embodies delicate work. Unfortunately, coach Gaines was injured and left the field in the middle of the first half, which was a fatal blow. And Colassa's shots often use high balls, which are suitable for Ivanov's appetite. Great opportunities were lost because of this, which is very regrettable. If he could attack more with low balls, the outcome would not be like this. The entire team is the most ferocious with Oliveira, who advances and defends in an orderly manner. Costa and Schmidt, although experienced, could not stop Fafan from rampaging. How strange!

Looking at the above situation in general, combining the previous battle, the strength of the Group A line is already obvious. Abandoning China, Lianyi, and a surprise, the tripod is set at three. Portuguese Merchants and Overseas Chinese still have some potential, and Jewish and the Three Provinces will inevitably be dwarfed by comparison, competing for the bottom spot. The survival of the fittest is the public law of nature. The emergence of upsets is not due to our inappropriate comments, but to special circumstances (Mei Bixian)

### Trivial Records of the Re-Formal Practice of the China Film Women's Basketball Team - Interest Increasing, Skills Improving

Zhang Minzhu said: "The team has considerable time to practice every day, and now it is stipulated that there are two formal practices every week, and Mr. Qian is invited to guide them." Indeed, the interest of the female stars is increasing day by day, which is really a good phenomenon!

The team's second formal practice was on the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. The reporter had nothing to do in his spare time, so he was able to appreciate it again. During the practice, Wu Wenchao strictly prohibited outsiders, so the field always appeared quiet. It is said that the special guests on that day were Miss Huang Mingyuan, the captain of the Green Team, and Mr. Xie Yitai, the director of the team, as well as male stars Sun Min, Xi Dui, Nong Liuqiong, Guan Hongzun, and more than ten other people.

The various aspects of the first practice have been mastered within a few days, so this time, the next step is to practice team cooperation. First, try court rotation and passing, rotating like a weaving shuttle, then practice triangular passing, forward dribbling, sudden shot, ground passing, attacking, and other items. This time, the focus is on the attacking aspect. The stars practiced diligently for an hour, and their progress was very rapid. It is said that the next practice is to practice the defensive skills of goalkeepers, and then the team can be divided into competitions. In about a short time, the lively scene of the stars on the court can be seen!

The players who arrived were Wang Danfeng, Wang Xiao, the Hu Feng sisters, Chen Juanjuan, Wu Zengying, Yi Yuejuan, Zhang Min, Feng Feng, and Murong Wan'er, ten red stars in all.

Laughter on the Court

Tong Yuemou came, and everyone called her "Old Mother." During the practice, the old woman, although eating a few pickled radishes, still clenched her teeth and practiced harder and harder. People praised her for having guts! She smiled and nodded.

Wang Hu's hat was so big that Sun Min looked a bit like Zhang Fei. Someone nearby said, does Zhang Fei have such rosy lips, white teeth, and a delicate face? Everyone laughed.

Juanjuan passed the ball to Hu Feng, slightly heavier. Hu Feng caught it and bounced it on her face. With a sound of "Ouch!" Juanjuan was busy comforting her. Hu endured the pain and forced a smile.

Several photographers took pictures of Wang Danfeng after the practice. One photographer said: Smile a little more. Wang replied, how can I smile if I can't smile? But before she finished speaking, she already had a beaming smile.

Before each practice item, Yue Feng and Tao Ji'ao demonstrated. Yue was short and small, and Tao was slender. From a distance, it was almost impossible to tell the difference between men and women. Everyone laughed (Skinny Rememberer)
