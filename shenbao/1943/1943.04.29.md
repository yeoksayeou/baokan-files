### "High Profile" and "Low Profile" Are Both Undesirable

"Wholeheartedly supporting" the government's decision to improve people's livelihood policies, and "sincerely urging" the government to implement policies to improve people's livelihood – this is the natural duty of public opinion, a responsibility that cannot be abandoned. Therefore, we will not shy away from loudly advocating for and repeatedly discussing issues related to people's livelihood. Our hearts are open, our attitude is sincere, and driven by a sense of responsibility, we will speak the words the masses want to say, without fear of taboo, and without hesitating to offend, we will express our views directly. Thus, it is unavoidable to offend the "dignity" of a few, who say we are "abusively singing a high profile." Originally, "facts speak louder than words," and we disdain making unnecessary arguments. However, we are willing to take this opportunity to elaborate slightly, in order to correct the misunderstandings and distortions of a few.

What is a "high profile"? Anything that is actually not capable of being done, or impossible to do, but is insisted upon being done, resulting in it not being done, is a "high profile." To simply "exaggerate," to "brag," to disregard reality, and to break promises, is also a "high profile."

What is a "low profile"? Anything that is capable of being done, or possible to do, but is abandoned, with excuses made, is a "low profile." Lacking self-confidence, lacking self-respect, and unable to muster spirit, is also a "low profile."

Any political or economic proposition that is absolutely beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and that can surely be achieved as long as there is determination and perseverance, is definitely not a "high profile." For example, the National Government's recent advocacy of "thoroughly investigating speculation and hoarding" and "strictly prohibiting gambling"; for example, this newspaper's advocacy of "separation of officials and merchants" and "establishment of a people's participation system," etc., are all absolutely beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and can surely be achieved as long as there is determination and perseverance. Such propositions are definitely not a "high profile."

To give a more recent example, such as Chairman Lin Sen, who is old and of high virtue, whose birthday on May 4th was celebrated by various parties, but the Chairman, in order to correct customs, declined birthday celebrations, while a senior employee of a certain bank in Shanghai, who is still young, reportedly sent a special plane to Beijing to bring famous actors to Shanghai for a private performance to celebrate his birthday. Comparing these two events, some people may say that the former is a "high profile." However, we see that Chairman Lin Sen, in his own writing on the 24th, declined everything; and on the 27th, he further used a National Government order to strictly prohibit offering money in the name of birthday celebrations, and cited the shameful example of the bear before the Xi'an Incident as a warning. Facts like this, where words are followed by actions with determination, we absolutely cannot consider a "high profile." In this extraordinary period, the leader of a country, leading by example, can all the more have the effect of refreshing the people's views. If the government can extend this meaning and expand upon it, then the talk of "high profile" will surely disappear from now on.

Furthermore, for a certain proposition, even though completing the ideal and achieving the goal is beyond the current strength and environment, such a proposition does not count as a "high profile." For example, the National Government's advocacy of the Sino-Japanese peace movement, whose ideal and goal is undoubtedly "comprehensive peace," even though it is beyond the current strength to achieve, we absolutely cannot misunderstand it as a "high profile." For the same reason, this newspaper's advocacy of "thoroughly investigating speculation and hoarding," "strictly prohibiting gambling," "separation of officials and merchants," and "establishment of a people's participation system," its ideal and goal are the same as the government's advocacy. There is no distinction between "high profile" and "low profile" in this, and it cannot be misunderstood as a "high profile."

Here, we can give a definition: "Any proposition that can possibly complete the ideal and achieve the goal, even though it is beyond the strength to achieve for the time being, does not count as a high profile." However, this definition still has a prerequisite, which is "to do it with determination and perseverance," and not to stand idly by waiting for the realization of the ideal and the achievement of the goal. Therefore, even if there are very good ideal propositions in politics and economics, such as "comprehensive peace movement" and "thorough investigation of hoarding," etc., if they are not done with determination and perseverance, then what was originally not a "high profile" can easily become a "high profile." Another example is that the government has already issued an order prohibiting gambling, but there are still gambling dens in Shanghai. The government has not achieved its own proposition, which is an example of something that was originally not a "high profile" but will become a "high profile."

We must cautiously prevent our propositions, which were originally not a "high profile," from becoming a true "high profile" because we do not use determination and perseverance to do them. At the same time, we must pay special attention to the fact that anything that should be done is not done; that is, anything that is capable of being done, but is abandoned, and excuses are made not to do it, this will even turn from a "low profile" into "no profile," which is the most dangerous phenomenon.

When we open the history of ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, a country, a ruling government, in times of political abnormality, those in power often like to sing a "low profile," or even "no profile." And the voices of the people are often misunderstood as a "high profile." But, what era are we in now? We must open our eyes. Our country today is at a critical moment of striving for survival. We must be united from top to bottom, be down-to-earth, and with determination and perseverance, complete our ideals and achieve our goals. Absolutely no "high profile" or "low profile" is allowed.

Therefore, we believe that the government and the people urgently need to become one. The people absolutely cannot criticize the government's propositions and performances as a "high profile" or "low profile"; only by wholeheartedly supporting the government, supporting the government, urging the government, implementing propositions, implementing policies, and completing political ideals. If the government wants the people to be silent, or wants to hear flattering words, then what basis will the government have to truly make a fresh start with the people? "Honest advice jars on the ear," originally referred to what "ordinary" people cannot accept. In this extraordinary period, we expect "extraordinary" leaders to accept "honest advice" that "ordinary people" cannot accept. As for others who are in a leading position but do not have the "extraordinary" spirit to accept honest advice, we have no expectations of them.

Finally, anything that benefits the country and the people, the government must do it without hesitation; conversely, anything that is harmful, must be thoroughly eliminated. This is the only way for the government and the people to become one.

### Japanese Government Officially Announces Tani Masayuki Appointed Ambassador to China The Ambassador Has a Deep Understanding and Sympathy for China Relations Between the Two Countries Will Surely Become Closer After Arrival

Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, at 3 p.m. today, in the Phoenix Pavilion of the Imperial Palace, with Prime Minister Tojo attending, held the ceremony of personally appointing the new Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki. After bestowing the imperial rescript of personal appointment to the new ambassador, Prime Minister Tojo conveyed the official seal and official stamp. At the same time, it was officially announced that Tani Masayuki, with the rank of Jusanmi, would be appointed as the Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador to the Republic of China.

Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: After former Ambassador to China Shigemitsu was honorably appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese government carefully weighed the candidates for the post of Ambassador to China. In order to adapt to the world war situation, and based on a grand ideal, in order to complete a new policy towards China, the Japanese government considered former Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki to be the most suitable. After obtaining Mr. Tani Masayuki's agreement, the Japanese government followed the procedures stipulated in diplomacy and sought the consent of the National Government of the Republic of China. The official letter of consent from the National Government was sent to the Japanese government on the 26th of this month, and the ceremony of personally appointing the Ambassador to China was formally held in the Imperial Palace at 15:00 today.

Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: The new Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, after completing the personal appointment ceremony today, met with a group of reporters at the Greater East Asia Ministry and spoke at length about his aspirations for strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation. The gist of his speech was that after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese side's awareness of the common enemy of East Asia has also been increasing day by day. As a result, the National Government resolutely joined the war on January 9, formed a common front with our country, and worked hard to defeat Britain and the United States, liberate East Asia, and build a co-prosperity sphere. The Imperial Government, in order to adapt to this new situation, and with the aim of assisting the National Government to strengthen its political power, resolutely implemented the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions. China's long-cherished wish for sovereignty and integrity has been fulfilled. The co-existence and co-prosperity of China and Japan has also embarked on its natural track. In the future, our country will thoroughly implement this new policy, which is already firm and needless to say. This is of great significance in building a new order in Greater East Asia. Therefore, its results, which will affect the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia and even the world, are difficult to estimate. I have been entrusted with this great mission, and I will be dedicated like a front-line soldier, deeply understand the government's policy, stand up to strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation, and be aware of the importance of the current Sino-Japanese relations. I plan to depart as soon as possible and arrive in Nanjing in mid-May to take office.

Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: Former Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki was appointed Ambassador to China less than a month after resigning from the post of Foreign Minister in the previous cabinet reshuffle. At a time when Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage, the appointment of former Foreign Minister Tani as Ambassador to China will undoubtedly further strengthen Sino-Japanese relations. At the same time, it can also be seen that Japan is determined to cooperate and cooperate with China. The traditional friendly relations between China and Japan have become increasingly complicated since the Sino-Japanese Incident. Later, the National Government returned to Nanjing, and Sino-Japanese relations became clearer again. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States at the beginning of this year, and the Japanese government also implemented a new policy to promote Sino-Japanese relations, assisting China in restoring its national rights. Thus, Sino-Japanese relations entered a new stage. In the future, Japan's implementation of policies to promote Sino-Japanese relations will become even more important. When Ambassador Tani served as Foreign Minister and President of the Information Bureau in the past, he and Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia jointly planned and promoted the essentials of Sino-Japanese relations in the central government. It is most appropriate to appoint him as Ambassador to China. It can also be seen that the Japanese government is determined to promote new Sino-Japanese relations through this change of personnel, with Shigemitsu and Tani switching posts. In this way, China's cooperation can be further strengthened to crush foreign forces and assist China in construction, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War.

Nanjing, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: After China joined the war, Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage. Japan is making more active efforts to implement its policy towards China. During his tenure, former Ambassador Shigemitsu completed goodwill and friendly diplomatic measures such as the first return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. Our country, both the government and the public, are grateful for this. Now that Ambassador Shigemitsu has been transferred to the post of Japanese Foreign Minister, the Japanese government has recently appointed former Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki to succeed Shigemitsu as Ambassador to China. The welcome and expectations of our government for the new Ambassador Tani have been seen in the speeches of Minister of Propaganda Lin and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou. The government and the public are eager for Ambassador Tani, who is shouldering responsibility, to take office as soon as possible. However, we should pay special attention to the fact that Ambassador Tani is taking on this important position at a time when Sino-Japanese relations are becoming increasingly close. He is also the direct supervisor of Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia. Based on his experience, it can be seen that he is a person who has the most knowledge of China, and who must have understanding and enthusiasm for the relationship between the two countries, and the spirit of the two peoples sharing life and death. Although former Ambassador Shigemitsu completed great deeds such as the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions during his tenure, it is precisely because of this that Sino-Japanese relations have advanced to a higher level, and future policies are even more worthy of expectation. We can further predict that after the arrival of the new Ambassador Tani, Sino-Japanese relations will become closer, and the cooperation between the two countries will be further expanded, and the various policies that should be implemented after the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights will be completed as soon as possible.

### Statement of Welcome from the National Government Authorities

Nanjing, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: After the Japanese government announced the appointment of Tani Masayuki as the successor to the Ambassador to China, Minister of Propaganda Lin Bosheng specially responded to reporters' questions and issued a welcome statement as follows: "After Ambassador Shigemitsu was honorably transferred to the post of Foreign Minister, the outside world paid close attention to the candidates for the successor. Since our country joined the war, Sino-Japanese relations have become more harmonious in order to adapt to the needs of wartime; and to lay the foundation for the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the successor must be a capable person who can strengthen diplomatic relations, and who is in line with the fundamental policies of Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia. This is no need to speculate. Now that Ambassador Shigemitsu has been transferred to the post of Foreign Minister, and Foreign Minister Tani has been transferred to the post of Ambassador, it can be clearly seen that the diplomatic relations between the two countries will continue the development of the past and become more strengthened. Not only are the colleagues of the National Government extremely welcome, but also the general political commentators are happy to have found the right person. Last autumn, I went to friendly countries to study the training of youth organizations. At that time, Ambassador Tani had just taken office as Foreign Minister. He treated me kindly and gave me various kinds of assistance. I was able to receive instruction and accomplish my mission. I am grateful and will never forget it. I remember that I once mentioned that although there is a body of water, the Pacific Ocean, between China and Japan, standing on the position of the entire East Asia, the natural relationship between the two countries cannot be blocked by the ocean. In order to build an iron bridge across the Pacific Ocean between the two countries, I am deeply willing to spend the rest of my life with the Chinese youth to follow the advanced countries and engage in the construction of this iron bridge. Ambassador Shigemitsu and Foreign Minister Tani will do their best to work hard for this great project. Now that Ambassador Shigemitsu has been transferred to the post of Foreign Minister, and Ambassador Tani has been transferred to the post of Ambassador, it can be seen that the construction of this iron bridge is being stepped up, and the date of success is not far away."

Nanjing, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: The Japanese government has now announced the appointment of former Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki as the successor to the Ambassador to China. Zhou Longxiang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, specially issued a statement on this matter as follows: "This time, the friendly country of Japan appointed former Foreign Minister Tani as the Ambassador to China. I am very pleased to hear about it, and I express my sincere welcome. Ambassador Tani is senior and highly respected, serving in the Japanese diplomatic community for nearly thirty years. He has extensive experience and is famous at home and abroad. He has served in important positions in embassies in various European and American countries. He has been the Director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for many years. He once resided in Shanghai as a Minister. He has always had understanding and enthusiasm for Sino-Japanese cooperation. Last year, I accompanied the delegation to visit Japan. I personally heard Ambassador Tani's high-level discussions and great aspirations regarding the overall situation in Tokyo, and I was deeply moved. I remember that in the past, Ambassador Tani, during his tenure as Minister of Foreign Affairs, shouldered the heavy responsibility of planning Japan's wartime diplomacy. At that time, our country declared its participation in the Greater East Asia War. During this period, he made many contributions to Sino-Japanese relations, such as the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. He sincerely assisted in everything. This time, he was ordered to be the Ambassador to China, which proves that Japan's diplomatic policy towards China has not changed in the slightest, and will be further implemented based on Ambassador Tani's efforts, so that Sino-Japanese relations will become more harmonious, and the policies of the National Government will be more concretely realized. The Greater East Asia War is now winning victory after victory, and has completely eliminated the colonialism of Britain and the United States in East Asia for a hundred years. The liberation of the East Asian nations and the construction of a new order in East Asia have laid a solid foundation. In the future, ensuring this victory and consolidating the foundation of this construction will depend on the sincere unity of the East Asian nations. I remember that when I accompanied the delegation to visit Japan last year, Ambassador Tani said in his welcome speech that the cooperation between China and Japan has reached a perfect realm, which is truly gratifying. However, the cooperation between the two countries is not only a matter of temporary interests, but also a matter of basic Sino-Japanese relations. The provisions of the treaty are based on the common ideal of building a new order, and have the characteristics of spiritual unity. We firmly believe that Ambassador Tani's mission to China will enable the two great nations of China and Japan to make further progress in sincere unity, so as to contribute to the Greater East Asia War, so that the final victory can be achieved and the construction of the new order can be completed as soon as possible."

### The Jingnan Japanese Army Expands its War Gains

Nanjing, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: Since the elite units of the Japanese army occupied Linqi, the base of the Chongqing army's "24th Army Group," they continued to mop up the remnants of the Chongqing "New 5th Army" and "40th Army," about 20,000 men, entrenched in the western mountainous area, and most of them have now been wiped out. On the 27th, the Japanese army turned its offensive and began to encircle the main force of the Chongqing "27th Army," a direct descendant of Chiang Kai-shek, under Liu Jin, near the Huogzhen Hengshui Village south of Lingchuan. The Japanese army units maintained close contact and launched a fierce attack on the enemy, gradually shrinking the encirclement. In addition, the "106th Division Commander" Li Zhenqing, who was entrenched in Dongyaoji, southeast of Linqi, was captured. More than 2,000 Japanese troops also began to attack fiercely on the 27th. The war is now in its final stage. The mopping-up operation of the Japanese army against the Chongqing "24th Army Group" has gradually come to an end. Therefore, the only surviving force of the Chongqing army in North China has been almost completely wiped out.

Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: According to the front line of the Taihang Mountains in southern Shanxi, the main force of the Chongqing 24th Army Group was suddenly plunged into chaos due to the Japanese army's intrusion into Linqi. Its remnants were forced to flee to the western area of the Linqi Basin, a steep mountainous area of the Taihang Mountains. The Japanese army detected that the Commander-in-Chief of the Army Group, Pang Bingxun, the Commander of the 27th Army, Liu Jin, and the Commander of the 40th Army, Ma Buwu, had escaped with a small number of guards and fled into the Taihang Mountains. They began searching in the mountains on the 25th, overcoming difficult mountain roads and bravely attacking. As of the 27th, the war gains of the Japanese army units were as follows: (1) From the 25th, the Japanese army units that attacked Pang Bingxun and Li Yuntong's Department of the 29th Division of the 40th Army, wiped out more than 600 remnants of the Chongqing army 30 kilometers southwest of Tianjiajing on the 27th. As a result, 200 people were captured, and 40 light machine guns and 50 rifles were intercepted. They are still pursuing them. (2) On the morning of the 27th, the Japanese army units severely attacked the Chongqing New Fifth Army, which was retreating to the west of the Linqi Basin, near Nanling, 23 kilometers west of Linhong, and completely defeated it. In this battle, the Chongqing army left 31 bodies, and 110 people were captured. The Japanese army intercepted 1 heavy machine gun, 30 light machine guns, 50 rifles, 15,000 rounds of ammunition, and 20 military horses. In addition, other Japanese army units attacked the Chongqing 40th Army near Bingxicun, 35 kilometers west of Linqi, captured 145 Chongqing troops, and intercepted 330 rifles and 17,000 rounds of ammunition. (3) After destroying the military facilities of the Chongqing army in Zejiecun Hexizhen, the Japanese army intercepted 2 mountain guns, 2 heavy machine guns, 101 rifles, and 2124 rounds of machine gun shells on the 27th. They have now broken through the provincial border to Xiaguan Linhong, 20 kilometers southwest, and turned to attack the remnants of the Chongqing army in Jin Province.

Beijing, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: Okamura, the Supreme Commander of the Dispatch Army to China, personally inspected the battle situation in which the Chongqing 24th Army Group was wiped out this time. He flew to a certain place by plane on the 26th to listen to the battle report from a certain unit commander of the Japanese army. On the 27th, he patrolled the battle situation in Lingchuan on the plane and flew back here in the evening of the same day.

### Sun Dianying's Talk

Taiyuan, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: According to the front line of the Shanxi-Hebei provincial border, Sun Dianying, the commander of the Chongqing New Fifth Army, led all his troops to surrender. The reporter specially interviewed Mr. Sun in a certain place on the night of the 27th. The reporter's questions and answers with Mr. Sun are recorded as follows: (Question) What are your thoughts on this war? (Answer) At present, the combat strength of the Chongqing army is several times weaker than when the incident occurred. This is because the people's thoughts and will to resist Japan have disappeared. (Question) What is the internal trend of Chongqing after the National Government joined the war? (Answer) The opposition between the opinions of resistance and peace within Chongqing is very obvious, especially the relationship between Chongqing and the Chongqing Party is even worse. This can be fully evident in the First War Zone. There are often internal conflicts within the 20th West Army Group. (Question) What is the friction between the Chongqing and Communist armies? (Answer) The Chongqing army is actively on guard against the Communist army. Moreover, due to the poor harvest last year, there is a great shortage of food. Therefore, it sent guerrillas to sneak into the base of the 24th Army Group to seize food, so conflicts often break out between the two sides.

### Internal Strife Occurs in Yu Xuezhong's Department

Beijing, 27th, Central News Agency telegram: Since General Wu Huawen joined the peace camp in January of this year, there have been internal strife incidents in the department of Yu Xuezhong, the Commander of Chongqing. Recently, it was reported that Zhang Buyun, the commander of the Second Security Division directly under Yu Xuezhong, led his troops, a battalion of 4,000 men, to attack the position of Sun Huancai, the commander of the 111th Division, at Xujiagou on April 15. As a result, they failed, and one regimental commander and 600 soldiers were captured, and many were killed in battle. It is said that Yu Xuezhong has ordered Sun Huancai to pursue Zhang Buyun's department. Han Deqin, the Deputy Commander of the War Zone, was released after agreeing to wipe out the New Fourth Army. He was deeply afraid that his department would waver. On March 6, two brigades of his department were surrounded and wiped out by the New Fourth Army in the Siyang area (Jiangsu Province), suffering a great loss. On April 1, a small team under his direct command, the 89th Army, fled with light machine guns, rifles, etc. On the same day, the soldiers of the Kuku service stole many rifles, and the supervising officers fled with a large number of military salaries and confidential documents, etc.

### Allied Powers' Pacific Strategy - Each Seeks Its Own Interest, Opinions Diverge - Britain's European Focus Neglects Australia's Plea for Help

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the anti-Axis forces have repeatedly been defeated in the Southwest Pacific, the Australian government has repeatedly requested reinforcements. At the same time, the Chongqing side also, due to the retreat of British troops in Arakan, mobilized the Ta Kung Pao and other official newspapers to repeatedly appeal, strongly advocating the necessity of a counter-offensive in East Asia. Therefore, the "Europe first" strategy of the Casablanca type has become the focus of debate in the anti-Axis camp. Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner in London, recently addressed the issue when attending a luncheon hosted by the Australian Journalists' Association on New Zealand Army Memorial Day, stating Australia's position. The London Times responded in an editorial the following day, strongly advocating the "Europe first" strategy. The antagonism within the anti-Axis camp is thus evident. Bruce's speech, in essence, stated that Australia's situation after the fall of Singapore was similar to that of Britain after the fall of France. In early 1942, the urgent crisis facing Australia and New Zealand's equal position in the Pacific anti-Axis alliance was not fully understood by Britain. More than a year after Japan's entry into the war, Australia has been hampered by insufficient manpower, and the situation in the East Asian war has been extremely unfavorable. However, the Australian government has not withdrawn the Australian troops remaining on the Middle East front. In 1940, the Australian government also sent a division to the Malay Peninsula. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, Australia's air force strength was extremely weak, with not a single modern military aircraft. In the previous Great War, Australia's air force personnel numbered only 600, but now it has reached 100,000. 25% of Australia's available merchant tonnage has been used to transport steel to the United States to meet the absolute needs of Britain. Out of 2.5 million Australian men aged 24 to 65, 500,000 have been enlisted for military service. If calculated at the same ratio, it would be equivalent to Britain conscripting 4.5 million people and the United States conscripting 4 million people. Australia's military production in 1939 was insignificant, and major weapons such as tanks, armored vehicles, and military aircraft for combat were not produced at all. Regarding the Malay Peninsula and Singapore, the British government had made reassuring guarantees, but the result was the opposite. The Australian government, considering that the British navy should fully reinforce the area, also pointed out the need to strengthen the air force, but this suggestion was not accepted by the British government. Judging from what happened afterward, even if our sacrifices had been great, we could not have prevented the Japanese army from occupying the territory they now control. In this area occupied by the Japanese army, the main products are rubber, oil, and tin, and more importantly, quinine. Today, these resources will be fully utilized by the Japanese army, and it is a confirmed fact that the anti-Axis forces cannot get their hands on them, and so on. Bruce's speech clearly criticized Britain's selfishness, and the British Times also expressed its selfish views in an editorial, pointing out the reasons why it could not send reinforcements to the Pacific. In particular, it abandoned its usual verbal aid to Chongqing and openly declared its inability to help, saying that the expeditionary force on the North African front requires a well-protected merchant fleet of 20,000 tons, and 100,000 tons of ships are needed to maintain the supply of the landing forces. Therefore, even if the anti-Axis forces could allow the dispatch of the same force to the Pacific, as far as the current situation is concerned, it is obvious that it is impossible to transport this army by sea. Britain has mobilized 9 million troops, including men and women's auxiliary forces, and the United States has reached 10 million or 11 million. If the European war comes to an end, the troops of Britain and the United States will reach at least 20 million people. Although the anti-Axis forces have such a huge force, it is actually impossible to send 5 million people to the Pacific. Moreover, the most important thing for fighting the Japanese army is air and sea battles, so it seems that there is no need to send such a large army to the Pacific, but to strengthen the air force. Furthermore, Chongqing has been at war with the Japanese army since March 1937, so it believed that it would receive British and American aid when the Anglo-Saxon countries joined the war. However, since the outbreak of the Pacific War, it has been a year and a half, and it is still suffering the tragedy of misgovernment and fantasy. However, witnessing the difficult situation of Britain and the United States, it can be fully understood that this difficulty is not unreasonable, but the anti-Axis forces have also deeply realized from their difficult experiences that it is difficult to obtain other better strategies except to concentrate all their efforts on the most important battlefields. Britain's manpower is indeed insufficient to complete a large-scale operation 8,000 miles away from its own country. Moreover, Germany is still watching covetously 20 miles away from Dover. Therefore, it is inevitable that the German army should be defeated before attacking Japan around the globe.

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The National Government presented the highest order, the Tongguang Grand Medal, to His Majesty the Japanese Emperor, which was presented by Special Envoy Chu on the 26th. It is now known that His Majesty the Japanese Emperor immediately sent a telegram to Chairman Wang of the National Government to express his thanks and wish China prosperity and the close cooperation between the two countries to complete the Greater East Asia War.

### How to Strengthen Sino-Manchu Solidarity - Zhou Fohai's Radio Address in Xinjing

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Zhou Fohai, our country's special envoy to Manchukuo, delivered a radio speech in Xinjing on April 12, entitled "How to Strengthen Sino-Manchu Solidarity"? The original text is recorded as follows: "Citizens of Manchukuo: I am very happy and excited to have the opportunity to express some personal observations and opinions to you. Before coming to your country, I had already heard that Manchukuo's construction in recent years has made rapid progress. Whether in politics, economy, military affairs, or culture, there has been a leap forward and good results. When I stepped into your country's territory, I saw the stability of society, the establishment of public security, the progress of production, and the expansion of education, which made me have unlimited admiration for the vision and perseverance of the ruling officials and the hard work and cooperation of the citizens. At the same time, I am very happy that Manchukuo is already a strong partner in the East Asian Axis. Manchukuo's prosperity is the prosperity of the East Asian Axis, and the strength of the East Asian Axis can determine the victory of the Greater East Asia War, which can symbolize the bright future of Greater East Asia. The increasing strength of China and Manchukuo on the Asian continent is enough to help our friendly country Japan quickly complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War and quickly carry out the construction of East Asian co-prosperity. This time I came to visit your country, first to investigate the actual situation of your country's economic construction in the past ten years, and second to enhance the friendship between China and Manchukuo and strengthen the unity between China and Manchukuo. China and Manchukuo have inseparable close relations in geography, history, economy, culture, and even the daily life of the two countries' citizens. Because the national conditions of China and Manchukuo are so similar, the methods and techniques used by your country in economic construction can naturally be used as a reference and model for China. I have decided to visit your country this time to try my best to investigate your country's existing construction achievements and have frank discussions with all walks of life in your country to serve as a mirror for China's economic construction. Because China must vigorously carry out economic construction, whether it is to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War or to carry out post-war construction. If China's national strength is not strong and the people's strength is not strong, it is a lack of a strong link in the East Asian Axis, which has an adverse impact on the establishment of the East Asian Axis and the progress of East Asian construction. We believe that China's needs are also East Asia's needs, so we are carrying out economic construction with the strength of the whole country. On this point, we fervently hope that your country and our friendly country Japan can give us as much and more assistance as possible.

The second thing to say is how to enhance the friendship between China and Manchukuo and strengthen the unity between China and Manchukuo. Since the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo was issued, China and Manchukuo have restored their inherent friendship and established the friendly relations between China and Manchukuo. Since our friendly country Japan launched the Greater East Asia War on December 8 of the year before last and raised the banner of building the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, the responsibilities of China and Manchukuo, which are also members of the East Asian Axis, have been increased and heavier due to the occurrence of the Greater East Asia War. On January 9 this year, the Republic of China resolutely joined the war and shared life and death with our friendly country Japan. China's responsibilities and tasks in East Asia are heavier and more numerous than before. Manchukuo is a link in the East Asian Axis, and its responsibilities and tasks in East Asia are no different from those of China and Japan. Especially this Greater East Asia War is not only to drive out the evil forces of Britain and the United States in Asia by war, but also to build East Asia into a paradise shared by East Asians after this war. Therefore, I often say that the Greater East Asia War is not just a war. We must fight and build at the same time. Without war, we cannot eliminate the obstacles to construction. Without construction, it is not enough to carry out a long-term Greater East Asia War, and it is not enough to ensure the victory of the Greater East Asia War. We need active construction and continuous construction to make East Asia a paradise of co-prosperity for East Asians and a new world of co-existence. As for winning the war and carrying out long-term construction, both require strength. Where does strength come from? It comes from the solid unity of China, Japan, and Manchukuo. One of my tasks in visiting your country is how to enhance the existing friendship and strengthen the existing unity. Strengthening the unity between China and Manchukuo means increasing our common strength, and then we can effectively assist our friendly country Japan in winning the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

Strengthening unity can be said to be our common requirement. What methods can be used to achieve the goal of strengthening unity? I think the first is spiritual unity. The foundation of spiritual unity can also be said to be the principle, which is to love one's own country, love one's neighbors, and love East Asia together. The citizens of China and Manchukuo must have the determination to love themselves and love others in order to achieve true spiritual unity. This unity is based on morality and aims at everyone's freedom and equality, just as the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo said: "It is hoped that the three countries will respect each other's inherent characteristics and closely cooperate as good neighbors under the common ideal of building a new order based on morality in East Asia, so as to form the axis of permanent peace in East Asia and hope to contribute to the peace of the whole world with this as the core." This kind of spiritual unity based on morality is an indispensable principle and method for realizing East Asian co-prosperity and building the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is the opposite of the combination of interests based on utilitarianism by Britain and the United States. For example, in the past, Britain and the United States used imperialist forces to oppress East Asians and exploit East Asians. At that time, they also used hypocritical words to talk about humanity and peace to East Asians. In fact, they wanted to eliminate the resistance to exploitation and eliminate the struggles caused by East Asians' resistance to oppression under the guise of humanity and peace. Now, most East Asians have become aware that it is no different from surrendering and waiting for death to talk about humanity and peace with the profit-only British and Americans. Therefore, they have all risen up to follow our friendly country Japan in the struggle to defeat Britain and the United States, or hope that the spiritual unity that China and Manchukuo will implement is a unity based on morality, with loving one's own country and loving one's neighbors as the starting point of unity. Use this method of unity to achieve the goal of loving East Asia together and uniting together. Only this kind of spiritual unity is a true and permanent unity, can exert common strength, and can maintain permanent friendly relations.

In addition to spiritual unity, the second is economic unity. China and Manchukuo are connected by land. For a long time, the economy has been intercommunication. Now, as members of the East Asian Axis and partners in building the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, we must, of course, make the economic relations of intercommunication and complementary strengths and weaknesses more close and smoother. In the future, China should supply the shortage of Manchukuo with surplus products, and at the same time, it is hoped that Manchukuo will do the same. The two countries should not only exchange what they have and make up for each other's shortcomings in terms of products, but also be able to further form thorough cooperation in production and trade to achieve the goal of economic unity. If this can be done, not only China, Manchukuo, and our friendly country Japan will benefit, but all countries and nations in East Asia and European friendly countries can benefit greatly from the economic unity of China and Manchukuo. The work of this kind of economic unity is naturally complex and difficult, and cannot be achieved overnight. It is hoped that the talented people of China, Manchukuo, and our friendly country Japan can contribute more opinions and study more methods to make the relationship between China and Manchukuo stronger and closer due to the implementation of economic unity. If this is the case, the East Asian Axis can also become stronger, and our contribution to the Greater East Asia War will certainly be more than it is now. In addition to the method of spiritual unity and economic unity, there is cultural unity. A country has a country's special customs, habits, cultural relics, and systems, which is to say that a country has a country's culture. Therefore, it is more difficult to implement cultural unity and cultural integration between countries, but this difficulty does not exist in China and Manchukuo, because China and Manchukuo have a long history of relations and a long-term racial mixture, which has created a common culture between the two countries. If we can develop this point and promote it, then China and Manchukuo will not only be mutually communicating cultures, but also jointly developing culture, and jointly developing the same culture. Being of the same culture and the same race is enough to promote close unity between countries, and the same culture is more likely to integrate the relations and feelings of the two countries' citizens, making unity more consolidated and friendship more enhanced.

What I have talked about above is nothing more than methods to increase unity. The purpose of my visit to your country this time is to hope to implement these methods to enhance friendship and strengthen unity. The Greater East Asia War that is currently underway is related to the life and death of all ethnic groups and countries in East Asia, and we cannot but strengthen unity. Moreover, there is even greater work to be done in the future to build the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, which requires even greater unity, and to create permanent unity. The more solid the unity, the stronger the power to build East Asia. The stronger the power to build East Asia, the sooner the date of realizing the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia will be. The citizens of China, Manchukuo, and other countries in East Asia naturally need to unite with neighboring countries in order to restore their own countries; in order to protect East Asia and prosper East Asia, it is even more necessary to strengthen mutual unity. As long as all ethnic groups and countries in East Asia can become a unity as solid as iron, they can generate a force as hot as fire. Only this kind of force can destroy the old forces dominated by Britain and the United States and create a new East Asian order in which all countries and ethnic groups get what they deserve."

### Allied Front Encounters Major Rift - Britain and Poland Primed to Collude for Countermeasures - Rumor has it that Britain Agrees to Soviet Stand and Requires Polish Cabinet to Reorganize - Soviets May Organize Free Polish Army with Poles in Soviet Union

Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - When the Soviet government declared its severance of relations with the Polish government-in-exile, it did not notify Britain, the United States and other countries in advance. Therefore, when Moscow broadcast the matter, the anti-Axis countries were very surprised. The British government also consulted with the US government and decided to mediate. The Polish government-in-exile convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the morning of the 27th to discuss countermeasures, but did not issue any statement after the cabinet meeting, only saying "a new situation has occurred." On the afternoon of the 27th, Polish Prime Minister Sikorski and Foreign Minister Raczynski visited British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden, respectively, and the four of them continued to negotiate at the Prime Minister's residence. At the same time, US Ambassador to the UK Winant also met with Churchill. According to reliable sources, Churchill pointed out at the meeting of British and Polish leaders that a major crisis had occurred between the anti-Axis countries, and strongly advocated a united front, requesting the Polish government-in-exile to exercise self-restraint. After the meeting, Churchill reported the decisions of the meeting to Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky. It is generally believed that Churchill will take a second step, and it is believed that the British and Polish governments may issue a statement today. Reuters has also been vigorously promoting the British government's mediation, and Soviet-Polish relations have eased slightly. According to a Reuters report, the German-language newspaper in Moscow reported on the 26th that the Soviet Union and Poland had severed diplomatic relations, but by the night of the 27th, the words "severed" had been changed to "suspended," and it was said that Poland had not yet formally decided to withdraw its ambassador to the Soviet Union.

Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - It is rumored that the Polish government-in-exile convened a cabinet meeting on the morning of the 27th and resolved to issue a statement, which was submitted to the British Foreign Secretary by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is generally believed that in order to ease the crisis in the anti-Axis camp, the British government will require the reorganization of the cabinet of the Polish government-in-exile and the dismissal of anti-Soviet nationalists.

Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Stephani News Agency reported that, according to Swedish newspapers' receipt of news from London, qualified British sources have not shown partiality since the Soviet-Polish severance of relations. It seems that the Polish side has no other way but to organize a new government, hoping to restore relations with Moscow and make considerable concessions in order to reach an agreement on the various outstanding territorial issues between the two countries. Although the British side obviously does not want to favor any party in order to avoid aggravating the already serious situation, the London government seems to want to agree with Moscow's position in accordance with the principle that "might makes right." What is even more noteworthy is that on the day before the Soviet-Polish severance of relations, Czech President Benes was still broadcasting on the radio that "the Czech Republic trusts in the unity of British-Soviet relations."

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to an Associated Press report from Moscow, the Soviet Union has not received any news about which country will take care of all Polish interests in the Soviet Union after the Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations with the London Polish government-in-exile.

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - An Associated Press reporter in Washington claimed that political figures in Washington yesterday expressed the opinion that Moscow's decision to sever relations with the London Polish government-in-exile may imply that Stalin hopes that Britain and the United States will officially recognize the Soviet Union's right to seize some territories on its western border on the day of the anti-Axis victory, and that the Soviet Union is now attempting to pressure Britain and the United States to open a second front in Europe. Some people in Washington even said that the Soviet-Polish severance of relations was a diplomatic failure for British Prime Minister Churchill, saying that Churchill should have taken a more realistic attitude towards the Polish government-in-exile. The reporter believes that the Soviet Union may organize a "Free Polish Army" with Poles in the Soviet Union and declare that only Poles who are willing to join the Red Army to fight for the liberation of Poland have the right to return to Poland.

### America Feels Unease Over Soviet-Polish Rupture; Hull Has No Comment Yet

Central News Agency, Washington, April 28th - Diplomatic circles in Washington are deeply concerned about the severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland, as both countries are members of the so-called Allied nations. The State Department expressed regret, but due to a lack of understanding of the actual situation, it did not mention the nature of the Soviet-Polish discord. Yesterday, at a press briefing, when asked about reports from London that Britain and the United States would mediate, Secretary of State Hull replied that he would not comment extensively before the matter had developed definitively, but that the State Department would make a statement once the situation evolved. After meeting with Under Secretary of State Welles, Polish Ambassador Ciechanowski told reporters that he had not received official confirmation of the Soviet action and could not comment. Qualified political observers speculate that the next step will be action taken by the United States. At that time, the fundamental differences between the United States and the Soviet Union will become clearer. Observers said that Prime Minister Eden's attitude is particularly intriguing at this time, because if Eden sides with the Soviet Union, the governments of many countries occupied by the Axis powers will likely rise up and fight in alliance against the Axis, and Eden will be unable to cope. Observers continued that since the Soviet-Polish agreement is effectively invalid, it is questionable whether the Anglo-Soviet agreement will follow suit. It is reported that the Soviet-Polish rift began brewing as early as February, when Moscow authorities told foreign reporters that certain Eastern European regions incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1939-40 would never be returned. By the end of February, Polish government-in-exile officials said that Poland's borders should be based on the regions where Polish forces alone withstood the German offensive in September 1939. However, the immediate cause of the Soviet-Polish discord was the Polish government's request for the International Red Cross to investigate the serious case reported by the Germans of Soviet forces murdering Polish prisoners of war near Smolensk. The Soviet side replied that the rumors were clearly fabricated by the Hitler faction, and that the Nazis were responsible for killing the Polish officers, and that the Germans were engaged in propaganda to create discord between the Soviet Union and its allies, into whose trap the Polish government had fallen. At the same time, various circles in the United States are deeply concerned about the legal status of thousands of Polish nationals residing in Soviet territory, which may lead to serious disputes.

### German Foreign Ministry Comments on Soviet-Polish Incident: A Disgrace Among the Entire Anti-Axis Alliance

Central News Agency, Berlin, April 28th - The German Foreign Ministry stated yesterday that the recent incident between the Soviet government and the Polish government-in-exile in London is a disgrace among the entire anti-Axis front. This matter is sufficient to show that Britain has no chance to use its power to curb Soviet territorial demands. The British comments on the Soviet-Polish break can already be regarded as the British government's inability to implement its will on Soviet policy. The international political spokesman of the German Foreign Ministry, when meeting with the press yesterday, first read out Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's note of severance. The spokesman summarized the German comments on this development, saying, "Stalin has severed relations with Poland because he does not want the Polish ambassador to the Soviet Union to stay and raise unpleasant questions. The Polish ambassador has raised extremely unpleasant questions for the Soviet Union regarding the Katyn Forest massacre and the whereabouts of 1.5 million Poles deported by the Soviet Union." The spokesman added that 694,000 Polish prisoners of war in German hands are still alive, but the fate of 1.5 million Poles in Soviet hands is unknown. The German view is that Stalin's severance of relations with Poland is actually intended to let Britain and the United States know that he does not want to participate in British and American discussions on territorial issues. Stalin still regards Poland as a country within the Soviet military border. Stalin's attitude towards General Sikorski has shown that he does not want to participate in any agreement that would change this situation. The spokesman mentioned the Soviet claim that Germany was cooperating with General Sikorski, saying that he had no suitable words to deny this preposterous statement. Many countries and nationalities in Europe, as well as some neutral countries, should take Poland as a lesson and understand that only the victory of German and its allies' weapons can protect European countries and nationalities from suffering the same fate as Poland in the hands of the Soviet Union. If Britain cannot do anything about its reputation, then it is unbelievable that it can stop the Soviet Union from excessively entering Europe.

### Fierce Fighting Continues East of Cape Bon; British Forces Attempt Breakthrough Towards Tunis

Central News Agency, Berlin, April 28th - According to a special military correspondent from the Overseas Chinese News Agency, the battle for the Tunisian bridgehead continues, its intensity fluctuating, which is a characteristic of the war. On Monday morning, there was fierce fighting on the entire western front, but from afternoon to evening, the fighting clearly eased slightly. On Tuesday, the fighting became active again, and the fighting in several decisive areas gradually intensified, especially in the coastal area east of Cape Bon, where General Anderson is fighting with mixed French forces. The American forces are attacking eastward and northward on the roads from Sejnane and Djebel to the Gafsa region. Reports from the anti-Axis side that American artillery has already opened fire on German positions in Mateur are still premature. On Monday, the American forces had not yet reached the Sidi Nsir station. The operational plan of the American Second Corps may be to not only launch a frontal attack on Sidi Nsir but also to turn south towards the Medjez el Bab-Tebourba road or attack the mountains on that road. In the past few days, British forces have also launched multiple attacks on this mountain range from the south and southeast, but it is not yet known how much progress they have made. An important part of the mountain range must still be in German hands, otherwise the British forces would have made greater progress towards Tebourba. Further south, a British tank column advanced almost to Pont du Fahs on Saturday, but was repulsed by German forces on Sunday and suffered heavy losses. Its remnants have been reorganized in the area south of Medjez el Bab and around Goubellat, with significant reinforcements of infantry. Between Djebel Ang and Djebel Mansour, the central division of General Anderson's forces, although suffering heavy losses during the Easter holidays, still possesses significant striking power and numerical superiority. This preparation is largely composed of elite British troops. The central division of the British First Army alone has nine divisions. The British forces may attempt another breakthrough towards Tunis, either towards Pont du Fahs, Djebel Zaghouan, or directly through Tebourba. This attempt will be as fierce as the one repulsed by the Axis forces on Sunday. Although the German forces were able to defend successfully during the Easter holidays, it cannot yet be said that the tension of the battle has eased. Although the British Eighth Army was quite quiet during the holiday, it must be using this time to strengthen its combat power in all aspects and will still play an important role in future operations. On Sunday, General Montgomery only launched local attacks in the area between Enfidaville and Takrouna, with the aim of seizing several peaks in the mountains held by the Axis forces. In the past few days, General Montgomery has reorganized his troops and may shift his main force to the left flank. Axis reconnaissance teams report that a large number of powerful British and American tanks are concentrated in the Djedeida area, which may indicate that General Montgomery will attempt to break through northwest towards Pont du Fahs in cooperation with the central division of the First Army.

### Only Minor Land Contact on Eastern Front

Central News Agency, Stockholm, April 28th - On the Eastern Front, in the Kuban River estuary region, German-Romanian forces have established a victorious position, and Soviet forces have suffered heavy losses, making it impossible for them to recover. There has been no large-scale land combat in recent days, only small-scale air combat. However, German forces in the Leningrad region suddenly launched a counter-offensive in a certain area on the afternoon of the 26th, penetrating deep into Soviet lines, forcing the Soviet forces to retreat. To recapture this position, Soviet forces counter-attacked twice on the 27th, but were repulsed by heavy German artillery fire. In addition, German forces around Leningrad shelled important military facilities in the city on the 27th, achieving significant results. In addition, the offensive launched by the German air force, centered on the Kuban River region, has become increasingly fierce. On the 27th, the Soviet newspaper also stated that the German air force repeatedly bombed from the Kerch Peninsula and the Taman Peninsula. Soviet forces in Krasnodar are urgently requesting the deployment of a large number of fighter aircraft for reinforcement.

Central News Agency, Berlin, April 28th - It is reported that German forces shot down 17 Soviet aircraft on the Eastern Front on the 26th, 12 of which were shot down by the air force and 5 by anti-aircraft artillery. All German aircraft returned to base.

Central News Agency, Helsinki, April 28th - Stefani News Agency reports that Finnish military communique says that on the land front, for the last twenty-four hours, there has been reconnaissance activity and occasional shelling. In the evening, one Soviet bomber attempted to fly over the Finnish capital, but was repelled by Finnish anti-aircraft fire.

### Japanese Naval Aviation Bombards South Pacific Islands; Japanese Aircraft Fully Utilize Superior Tactics, Shooting Down Six American New-Type Fighters

Central News Agency, Tokyo, April 28th - Since the beginning of this month, Japanese naval aviation units have been fiercely attacking American air bases in Guadalcanal, New Guinea, Oro Bay, and Milne Bay, crushing enemy attempts to counterattack. On the night of the 23rd of this month, naval aviation units launched a long-range bombing raid on Funafuti Island, the main island of the British Ellice Islands, for the first time, dropping heavy bombs on American airfields, warehouses, and various military facilities, causing nine fires that burned fiercely. All Japanese aircraft returned safely after completing their mission. The US Navy also admitted that the area was heavily damaged. This Japanese bombing of Funafuti Island is of great significance for threatening communications between the United States and Australia. On the 25th, Japanese aircraft encountered new-type American fighters over Kukuru Island, south of New Georgia Island, and shot down six of them. In this battle, Japanese aircraft fully utilized their superior tactics.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, April 28th - Japanese General Headquarters announced at 12:00 today: 1. Japanese naval aviation units attacked enemy military facilities on Funafuti Island in the Ellice Islands on the 23rd of this month, inflicting heavy damage. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. 2. On the 25th of this month, during an air battle over Kakugai Island in the Solomon Islands, Japanese naval aviation units shot down six enemy aircraft. There were no Japanese aircraft losses.

Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, April 28th - According to a Washington report by the Stefani News Agency, the US Navy announced on the 26th that Japanese aviation units bombed American positions on Funafuti Island in the British Ellice Islands on the 22nd of this month. American troops and military facilities were damaged. It is reported that the British Ellice Islands are located 800 nautical miles southeast of the Marshall Islands, between 5 and 10.5 degrees south latitude and 176 and 180 degrees east longitude. The total area of the islands is 14 square miles. According to a 1936 survey, the population of the islands was 4,113. The archipelago is composed of nine small islands with a very low elevation, only a few meters above sea level. The archipelago was discovered by the Spaniard Maurelle in 1781, and the southern part of the islands was discovered by British Captain Peter in 1819. It became British territory in 1892. In Funafuti Island, which was bombed by Japanese aircraft this time, there are British colonial government and American military bases.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, April 28th - The US Navy announced that Japanese naval aviation units bombed Funafuti Island. At the same time, a US Navy spokesman also stated that American forces had occupied the Ellice Islands without bloodshed. The US Naval Headquarters in the South Pacific announced that a strong fleet of American naval cruisers and destroyers had sailed into the Ellice Islands and that the British islands southwest of the Kandavu Island, north of Fiji, were under American control. However, the US Navy did not notify Britain or obtain the British government's consent for this action, so the British Navy was deeply surprised after learning about this matter.

### Announcement to the Italian People by Hidaka

Central News Agency, Rome, April 28th - The new Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Shiro Hidaka, upon arriving here yesterday to take up his post, issued a message to the Italian people, stating in brief that although Japan and Italy are far apart, he comes to Italy with the sincere hope of further strengthening the close ties between the two countries. Our two countries are now fighting shoulder to shoulder with unwavering determination to defeat the common enemy and achieve victory, and to promote a just and prosperous peace. Japan, Italy, Germany, and other countries participating in the Tripartite Pact will forever form an unbreakable union to strike at those with ambitious plans. We are confident that with our joint efforts, we will achieve final victory.

### Enemy Submarine Attacks Japanese Red Cross Ship

Central News Agency, Tokyo, April 28th - According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base, a Japanese Red Cross ship was attacked by an enemy submarine with torpedoes at 3:35 PM on the 25th of this month while sailing in the South China Sea. Fortunately, the captain and crew responded calmly and escaped the danger. The ship returned to a certain location that night. The Red Cross ship was clearly marked with the Red Cross symbol and it was daylight, so the enemy's illegal attack can be said to be the height of brutality. Previously, Japanese Red Cross ships had been bombed by enemy aircraft and attacked by enemy submarines one after another. Recently, there have been enemy aircraft bombings. This attack is the sixth one. Such barbarity of the enemy is truly an abomination to both gods and men.

### Medan Muslims Hold Prayer Meeting to Destroy Britain and America

Central News Agency, Medan, April 28th - The million Muslims of all of Sumatra deeply understand the liberation of them from Dutch shackles by the Japanese army and are especially grateful for the moderate policies of the military government, which has allowed Islam to restore its original position. To express this gratitude and to pray for the completion of the war, a prayer meeting of Sumatran Muslims to destroy Britain and America will be held in the square in front of the Medan government. It is also scheduled to invite Governor-General Nakajima Tokaishu and other relevant officials to attend for guidance. Tens of thousands of Muslims, including leaders and representatives from various provinces, will participate. The agenda of the meeting will begin with a congratulatory speech by Governor-General Nakajima, followed by a resolution to be presented to the Japanese government and the headquarters of the Muslim League. Finally, there will be a prayer for the complete destruction of Britain and America and the completion of the Greater East Asia War, emphasizing the mission that Muslims should bear.

### Serious Food Shortages in the United States

Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, April 28th - The Stefani News Agency quoted Washington reports that although the US government has taken restrictive measures, the food problem throughout the United States is becoming more serious. A lack of essential goods is now felt in all aspects. Competent government officials declare that the lack of essential products has increased by 30% in the past nine months.

### Overview of Europe's "Second Front"

(Special Dispatch from Reuters Correspondent in Lisbon, 16th) As the Tunisian campaign intensifies, the European war situation has finally entered a critical period. The recent meeting between Hitler and Mussolini can be seen as a preparation to discuss how to properly handle any situation that may arise regarding the Tunisian front. The British and Americans also believe that the opportunity to land on the European continent has finally matured and are eyeing it intently. The Anglo-American offensive on the European continent can be seen as potentially unfolding towards Italy, namely Sicily or Sardinia, and it can also be anticipated that it may unfold towards Crete, Greece, or the Black Sea coast. However, in any case, the new phase of the European war, which is sure to come, will center on the Eastern Front and how the Anglo-American Second Front issue is related to it. Therefore, the Axis's countermeasures, and their primary efforts, are also closely aligned with these two. Putting the former aside for the moment, if the latter, as boasted by the British and Americans, can occur in the near future, then what kind of situation do the various countries that are candidates for the Second Front have? A general overview is provided below:

(1) The Balkans

Axis intelligence frequently reports Anglo-American military offensive preparations on Cyprus. On the one hand, intelligence from Ankara also states that what the Axis is most concerned about is the Balkans. Recently, special air force units composed of German, Hungarian, and Romanian troops have been formed, and it is planned to deploy a new division of ○ troops in the Balkans to strengthen countermeasures against an American landing. However, there is no acknowledgment of the fact that German troops are moving back to the Balkans. It is only said that air forces are being sent to Bulgaria, and artillery units are concentrating along the Black Sea and Aegean coasts. The British, on the other hand, believe that there are ○ divisions stationed on Crete. In addition, there are also considerable strong defenses in various ports along the Greek coast and the Bulgarian Black Sea coast.

Since the meeting between Head of State Hitler and King Boris III of Bulgaria, Bulgaria's movements have been closely watched. However, the country has not changed its policy of cooperating with the Axis to defend the Balkans.

After the start of the German-Soviet war, Germany entrusted the control of Greece to Italy, focusing its own efforts on the Eastern Front. However, in recent months, Germany has been responsible for coastal defense, while the Italian army has generally been responsible for the interior of Greece. Furthermore, regarding the anti-Axis Greek guerrillas, the ones commanded by Major Deoulas in the Macedonia area are the most powerful, repeatedly challenging the Bulgarian army. It is said that they even have liaison officers with the anti-Axis Yugoslav guerrillas of Mihailović. In addition, there are also Greek troops scattered in the Pindus, Olympus, northern Sparta, and Crete, totaling about 30,000 armed soldiers. It is said that there is also a plan to establish a unified general staff.

The former Yugoslavia is a nest for Mihailović's army, guerrillas, communist guerrillas, etc., and the situation is extremely complex.

In Albania, there are also considerable anti-Axis guerrillas secretly active, and there have recently been reports of attacks on Italian troops. It is also reported that Italy has recently replaced its governor, established a new party called the "Greater Albania Defense Corps," and is forming an Albanian self-defense force, consolidating Albania's new defense system.

With the progress of the North African campaign, the defense of the Italian coast has been particularly strengthened. Although the British and Americans are clamoring to seize the opportunity to wage war against Italy, they are fully aware of the operational difficulties.

(2) The Italian Coast and the French Coast. Due to the urgency of the Tunisian war situation, the defense of the Italian coast and the two islands of Sardinia and Sicily is considered the most important. The recent meeting between Hitler and Mussolini can be seen as focusing on strengthening Italy's defense. On the one hand, the British and Americans are trying to stir up the hearts of the Italian people and intensify the alienation between Germany and Italy. However, they ultimately feel that there is no anti-fascist force within Italy that can be exploited.

The defense of France is under the command of General Rundstedt as the supreme commander. As for the border area of Romagna, it is under the jurisdiction of the Belgian occupation authorities. General Rundstedt is mainly responsible for the defense of the English Channel, the Bay of Biscay coast, and the Mediterranean coast. In administrative terms, the whole country is under the supervision of German officials, while formally, French officials implement it. However, since the deployment of German troops, the distinction between occupied and unoccupied zones has disappeared, but the political difference remains, and the German army respects it. The German and Italian troops stationed in southern France are called the "operational army," not the "occupation army."

In relation to the Second Front, the most important area on the northern French coast is the English Channel coast from Dunkirk to Saint-Nazaire. Germany is now making every effort to consolidate the fortifications for defense against landing. It is said that the defenses extend from the coast to the interior, reaching a depth of 120 to 150 miles, preparing for an immediate counterattack when Anglo-American forces land.

On the Mediterranean coast, the fifty miles of coastline between Narbonne and Montpellier is considered the most dangerous. It is said that the residents of this area have all been ordered to evacuate, and it is reported that the defenses of the ports of Marseille and Toulon have been particularly strengthened. Regarding the domestic situation, the British are difficult to make arbitrary speculations. However, there is no organization whatsoever for anti-German forces.

For example, British newspapers also admit: "It is wrong to say that they like the British and Americans because they dislike the Germans. Therefore, even if the Anglo-American forces land, the French will not automatically become friends of the Anglo-Americans." This was proven by the Dieppe raid last year. Furthermore, the resistance of the French to the Anglo-American forces in Syria, Madagascar, and North Africa, the self-destruction of the French Navy, and the refusal of the French fleet in Alexandria to merge with the anti-Axis forces are all clear ideas.

(3) The Netherlands and Belgium

The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung reported on the German defense installations in the Netherlands and Belgium as follows: "In order to set up strongholds, minefields, tank ditches, etc., the German army has demolished civilian houses along the coast. Therefore, even if the Anglo-American forces land, they will not be able to use any cover." It is said that the residents of The Hague coastline have been ordered to evacuate, and civilian houses and roads have been almost completely obliterated. It is said that the delta area of the three rivers Rhine, Maas, and Scheldt, from North Holland to Vlissingen, is the most heavily defended. The German civil affairs officer stationed in the Netherlands is Mr. Seyss-Inquart. Initially, he adopted a form of military occupation, but recently he has concentrated all administrative powers in his hands.

The German military defense on the Belgian coast is no less than that of the Netherlands, and it is being gradually strengthened. Residents on the coast are prohibited from going more than three miles out to sea, the depth of the defense line is being extended, and the restricted area has been expanded from the coast twenty miles to Zaltbommel. Furthermore, it is said that the old fortresses of Namur, Liège, etc., have been completely restored. German administration in the occupied territory, unlike in the Netherlands, is directly managed by General Halgensen under Marshal Rundstedt.

(4) Norway and Denmark

The American forces entered Iceland the year before last, and the Anglo-American gaze has long been focused on Norway. Therefore, Germany strengthened the defense of this country earlier than other occupied territories. The coastal areas of cities such as Oslo, Stavanger, Bergen, and Narvik are particularly heavily fortified. In particular, it is said that large cannons and other weapons have been moved from the Maginot Line to the interior, forming a strong fortress comparable to the Siegfried Line. The civil affairs officer is the thorough Nazi Party member, Terboven, and is assisted by the National Union Party, headed by the famous Major Quisling. The party has 40,000 members and an army of several thousand called the Hird Party.

In Denmark, in addition to the mainland of Jutland, the most important of its 500 islands are Zealand and Funen. The German army has ○0,000 in Jutland, ○0,000 in Zealand, and ○0,000 in Funen. The supreme commander of the German army is General Hanneken, who was appointed last October. In civil affairs, the minister stationed in Copenhagen, Werner Best, acts as a consultant to the Danish government.

Germany's policy towards Denmark is to make the country a model for the new order. Therefore, unlike other occupied territories, it strives to realize Danish autonomy. The representative of the pro-German faction in Denmark is the current Prime Minister Erik Scavenius. (Ding: Translated from the April 19th Asahi Shimbun)

### Thoroughly Investigate Speculation and Hoarding in Shanghai; Original Text of Investigation Report; Han Gongbei's Purchase of Materials Disrupts the Market; Management Methods and Bank Accounts Are All Verified

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) In the past, in order to thoroughly investigate general speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, the National Government specifically ordered Minister of Finance Chen Zhishuo, Minister of Industry Yuan Yuquan, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Zhao Shuyong, and Supervisor of the National Commercial Control Association Chen Yunwen, etc., to jointly investigate impartially. Regarding major officials of financial institutions who engaged in speculative transactions, if they were government-run, they were to be temporarily suspended from business and immediately reorganized. If they were privately run, they were to be closed down immediately. Regarding those who engaged in speculative transactions, manipulated market prices, and disrupted the market, regardless of who they were, they were to be reported to the Supreme National Defense Council for a special sentence, and the seized materials were to be confiscated in full. After receiving the order, Chen and others went to Shanghai to conduct a strict investigation and reported the results of the investigation truthfully on the afternoon of the 13th of this month. After the Chairman received the report, he immediately ordered a punishment. Han Gongbei was severely punished by the court for hoarding a large amount of important materials, manipulating prices, and disrupting the market through an unregistered company. Futong Bank was suspected of major involvement and was temporarily suspended from business and personnel were sent to investigate. Other matters that have not been investigated will continue to be carried out by the competent departments, so that unscrupulous merchants will know how to restrain themselves and prices can tend to be stable. Details have been seen in previous reports.

Original Text of the Report

The original text of the investigation report is extracted below: "Regarding the confidential report, Zhishuo and others were dispatched to thoroughly investigate the case of hoarding important materials for speculation in Shanghai. We have followed the instructions and gone to Shanghai for on-site investigations and listened to opinions from all parties. The results of the investigation are presented in detail below:

(1) Regarding the case of Han Gongbei, general manager of Zhenhua Company, hoarding a large amount of cotton yarn, according to the accounts of the Shanghai branch of the Jiangsu Local Bank, there are three accounts listed under the names of Hua Ji, Zhenhua Company, and Kejia Gongbei. From March 15th to April 1st, a total of 26.71 million yuan was paid out. An investigation of the accounts of Jianghai Bank also revealed two accounts under the names of Hua Ji and Han Gongbei. During the above-mentioned period, a total of 21.73 million yuan was paid out. According to Han Gongbei, the company is still in the process of being established and is planning to engage in the silk and cloth business after it is established. Therefore, from March 19th to 25th, he successively purchased 870 pieces of cotton yarn and 515 pieces of cotton cloth on the black market, worth approximately 28 million yuan. He still plans to continue buying in order to use them for the operation of the company after it is established.

(2) Regarding the case of Futong Bank, an investigation of the bank revealed a temporary overdraft account, which listed 12 million yuan under the name of Zhenhua. In addition, there was a 2.2 million yuan remittance of artificial silk mortgage from Zhenhua to Qingfeng in the mortgage account. Regardless of whether it involves Han Gongbei's speculation, the responsibility for violating the bank's business regulations cannot be avoided.

(2) Regarding the case of Limin Bank, an investigation of the bank revealed that its capital was 3 million yuan. From March 25th to April 1st, payments of more than 86.4 million yuan were made, which seemed to be suspected of fueling speculation.

Among the above-mentioned completed investigations, Han Gongbei purchased important materials through Zhenhua Company, which is still in preparation and has not been registered, disrupting the market, and there is solid evidence that he should be punished according to the law. Futong Bank accepted mortgages and accommodated temporary overdrafts, all of which are related to Han Gongbei and are suspected of major involvement, so it seems that it should be temporarily suspended from business for investigation. Limin Bank has a capital of 3 million yuan, and more than 80 million yuan has been paid out in 16 days since March 15th. After inquiring, most of them were payments for withdrawals by depositors. Whether there is any suspicion will be further investigated. Regarding the other cases that should be investigated, a plan for thoroughly investigating and handling speculation and hoarding of important materials in Shanghai has been drawn up and submitted to you for review. We are now proceeding with the investigation, but the scope is large and it will take a long time to complete it in a short period of time. The spreading rumors have caused panic in the financial and industrial circles. The trend of withdrawing cash has increased, and the funds have become shorter day by day. The banks are already feeling the difficulty, and the impact is even more worrying. It is proposed that the above-mentioned clearly investigated cases be submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for separate discussion and punishment, and announced to the public immediately to maintain law and order and warn the cunning. This is our duty and we should submit it for your review and implementation.

Temporary Conclusion

The investigation progress of Zhishuo and others has come to a temporary conclusion. Regarding the remaining cases that should be investigated, we will continue to handle them or hand them over to the competent authorities for separate action in accordance with the plan for thoroughly investigating and handling speculation and hoarding of important materials in Shanghai. Please merge and submit them for your guidance. Respectfully submitted to the Chairman. Minister of Finance Chen Zhishuo, Deputy Minister of Industry Yuan Yuquan, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Zhao Shuyong, and Supervisor of the National Commercial Control Association Chen Yunwen, April 13th, 32nd year of the Republic of China.

### Banks and Money Shops Closed Today

Today (29th) is the Spring Festival, and the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank and the member banks and shops of the Shanghai Bankers Association, as well as the trust companies, are closed for one day as usual. Business will resume as usual from tomorrow (30th).

### The True Meaning of Civic Welfare

— Zhang Yipeng

Shen Bao recently published an article "A Discussion on the Application of the Wealth Preservation Method" written by Mr. Yang Yusheng. It should be based on the Wealth Preservation Method written by Mr. Nie Yuntai, and it aims to promote and supplement its meaning. However, the article quotes my lecture on civic welfare twice, and contains a lot of excessive praise, which I dare not accept. My lecture is nothing more than promoting the understanding of citizens from the perspective of legitimate welfare. Therefore, there is a conclusion of "no disaster is happiness, no harm is benefit." These are all old clichés. In terms of the word "happiness," the Four Books, except for Mencius's quotation of the poem "Seek more happiness for yourself," have no such word. The most obvious one is the saying in the Book of Documents "Five Blessings." The so-called five blessings are: First, longevity. How long does a person have to live to be called longevity? According to custom, it should not be called longevity until the age of sixty. Moreover, there is no difference between the longevity of life and the longevity of reputation. Therefore, Yan Hui's thirty-two years is also longevity, and the great age of Robber Zhi is not longevity. Aren't those who celebrate their thirtieth or fortieth birthdays now taking their thirtieth or fortieth years as satisfaction and stopping there? Second, wealth. Wealth does not only refer to money. More reading means rich knowledge, good friends mean rich emotions, sufficient books mean rich collections, and virtuous descendants mean rich population. If you only know how to be a miser, can those who have fallen from ministers to servants and those whose mansions have become overgrown with weeds be called happiness? Third, health. Health is certainly the ultimate joy of being free from disaster and illness. However, if hands and feet are healthy but lazy to move, and the body is strong but accustomed to fighting, disasters will inevitably arise and become useless. Fourth, love of virtue. Why is the love of virtue included in the five blessings? There is indeed a wonderful reason for this. For example, if I have the ability to help the poor and sick, then I am blessed. Conversely, I am not blessed. Those in the world who have the ability to help others but abandon it are no different from cutting themselves off from happiness. Fifth, a good end. There are two reasons why people cannot die well. One is encountering disaster, dying with grievances. The other is causing disaster, dying from wrongdoing. Neither can be called happiness. However, people like Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa, one was killed and the other committed suicide, because they were voluntary, and although their bodies died, their names will last forever. Their names are immortal, and their happiness is greater and longer than those who die of old age. Furthermore, in terms of the word "benefit," Confucius rarely speaks of benefit. Mencius said: "Why must you say benefit? There is also benevolence and righteousness!" Why did Confucius and Mencius despise benefit? Because benefit has two meanings: narrow and broad. The narrow sense of benefit is called self-interest, and the broad sense of benefit is beneficial to both others and oneself. Moreover, the essence of benefit varies with people's positions. Scholars take cultivation as benefit, farmers take harvest as benefit, workers take manufacturing as benefit, and merchants take trade as benefit. Therefore, Confucius said: "Benefit them by what they consider beneficial." For example, if a beggar earns ten gold coins in a day, other beggars who do not earn ten gold coins will definitely consider him to have great benefit. However, if a rich merchant who earns more gold coins every day sees it, ten gold coins are not worth his glance. People in the world do not measure their own abilities, forget their duties, and eat greedily. Do they know how to return? The above is an excerpt from a section of my lecture, which I would like to share with readers.

### Celebrating Tencho-setsu (The Emperor's Birthday)

Today is Tencho-setsu, a day of national celebration in the friendly country of Japan.

Tencho-setsu is the anniversary of the birth of the Emperor of Japan, so the date of Tencho-setsu is determined by the birth date of each successive emperor. April 29th is the birthday of the current Emperor Showa, so this day is designated as Tencho-setsu. This holiday is equivalent to the Wanshou Festival (Emperor's Birthday) in our history.

On this day, all parts of the country, all agencies, organizations, schools, etc., take a holiday to celebrate the Emperor's birthday.

### Programs for Shanghai Japanese Residents to Celebrate

Today, the programs for the celebration of resident Japanese decided by the Shanghai General Force of Japan Residents' Patriotic Association will first hold a celebration ceremony in Hongkou Park, followed by a Great Assembly for Strengthening Physical Strength for Certain Victory, a Celebration Martial Arts Tournament, and a Celebration Evening Party, among other programs, to celebrate the festive season.

The celebration ceremony will be held at Hongkou Park, starting at 7:55 a.m. The order will be remote worship of the Imperial Palace, singing the national anthem, reciting celebratory words, singing the celebratory Tencho-setsu song in unison, and shouting "Long live the Emperor," followed by the closing of the ceremony. 8:00 a.m. will be the time for national celebration.

### Promotion of Naval Captain Oya, of the Japanese Embassy Office

Naval Captain Goichi Oya of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office has been ordered to be promoted. During his tenure, he has made many contributions. He first served in the China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, and then served in the reorganized Embassy Office. He has worked diligently in politics. It is said that he will soon go to take up his new post.

It is reported that he arrived in October of the 15th year of Showa (1940), and successively assisted Chief Tsuda, Chief Ota, Minister Tajiri, and Vice-Ministers Oyama and Ochiai, sparing no effort in promoting the construction and administration of Central China. Mr. Oya is of a quiet nature, not good at socializing, and full of work spirit. Even when he was ill, he would definitely force himself to work. His colleagues were amazed by this.

Mr. Oya also often handled official business on weekends and holidays, and was very enthusiastic about the construction of Central China. On the 26th, before receiving the order, Mr. Oya gave a short speech at the Embassy Office, saying:

"I am diligent by nature, but I have made no special contributions during my service. In general, the advocacy movement and cultural administration here are on the right track, so I hope that everyone will be able to fully promote this work after I leave in the future."

### Establishment of the West District Banking Association

After the branches of the Central Reserve, Shanghai, Jiaotong, Jincheng, and Zhongnan banks initiated the establishment of the Shanghai West District Banking Association, after careful organization, it has been completed. Thirty banks, including Zhejiang Xingye, China, Continental, and Xinhua, participated. A first luncheon was held at the liaison office of the Yuhua Salt Company on Tonglu Road the other day. More than 30 managers from various banks attended, toasting each other, and the event was extremely grand. After the meal, a symposium was held to exchange opinions on the current Shanghai financial business and study the dynamics of the social economy. A board of directors was also established, with Yu Shudong (Central Reserve), Ding Anzhi (Shanghai), Xi Yuanzhu (Jiaotong), Wu Zhongfu (Jincheng), Ren Yuanzi (Zhongnan), Wang Shenggen (Zhejiang Xingye), Yao Ximin (Continental), Hong Pinliang (Siming), Li Gunian (Juxingcheng), Qin Youhe (Asia), and Fan Shaoshan (China Tobacco) as directors. It is heard that the association is scheduled to hold a luncheon every two months to study various economic measures.

### Second Major Merger in the Film Industry; China Film United Company to Be Established on Schedule; Three Film Companies to Be Dissolved at the End of the Month

In order to expand their strength, the Shanghai film industry will merge and reorganize China Film Company, China United Film Production Co., Ltd., and Shanghai Theater Company. All of the above three companies will be dissolved at the end of this month. The name of the new company after the merger will be "China Film United Co., Ltd." and the inaugural general meeting will be held on May 15. China Film Company has a total capital of 5 million Japanese yen, with the aim of introducing Japanese films to China. It was established in April last year, at the same time as China United Film Company. China United Film Production Company was formed in April last year by merging Xinhua Film Production Company, Yihua Film Production Company, and Guohua Film Production Company. The initial capital was 3 million yuan, which was increased to 13 million yuan in October last year, with a total of 13 million yuan. There are more than 500 film employees, and there are five film studios.

### Oil Sales in Recent Days; Each Person Can Purchase Four Ounces; Total Sale is 5 Yuan and 1 Jiao

Central News Agency, Shanghai: The second phase of oil purchase based on household donation tickets in this city has been approved by the military allocation authorities to continue.

The allocation of cooking oil in this period is still four ounces per person, and the selling price is calculated according to the newly established price approved by the military allocation authorities, which is 5 yuan and 1 jiao per four ounces. As for the methods for citizens to purchase oil, they are exactly the same as in the previous period. Furthermore, the date for the allocation of special cooking oil required for businesses such as restaurants and tofu businesses has not yet been determined. It is expected to be processed after the purchase of oil based on household donation tickets is completed.

### Shanghai Clearing Association Announcement: Encouraging the Public to Report Crimes Confidentially; Procedures for Confidential Reports Established and Handled by Political Work Groups

### After the Adoption of a Rationing System for Rice and Fuel, Life in Shanghai Gradually Returns to a State of Stability; the Overall Situation No Longer Shows Signs of Turmoil

Well-informed sources believe that since the authorities adopted a rationing system for food and fuel in this city, the overall situation has transitioned from turmoil to stability. There have been no signs of any shortages in supply. Not only is the source continuously replenished and the reserves abundant, but the selling prices are also frequently declining, now presenting a stable state.

110,000 Bags of Rice Consumed Monthly

Yesterday, a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency learned from relevant sources that the two concession authorities have already completed the thirty-third phase of the grain rationing program, with a total of over 1.17 million bags of whole and broken rice sold. However, since September 21st of last year, household rice distribution has been changed to once every ten days. If calculated at two sheng of rice per person per period, the monthly rice consumption of the two concessions is 140,000 dan, equivalent to over 110,000 bags. Recently, the free transportation of rice and grain has been permitted, and the extra supply has increased sharply. The market situation has become extremely stable, and because citizens are accustomed to mixing grains, there is no longer the same intense demand for purchasing rice.

Fuel Supply Should Be Sustainable

Regarding the fuel needed for daily cooking by residents, such as coal, firewood, and charcoal, as well as the bituminous coal needed by various factories, the authorities have long been providing sufficient rations on a regular basis. Therefore, the trading situation is significantly different from the past. Currently, the authorities are actively clearing channels and finding ways to increase reserves, as well as fully rationing to various users. There is no fear of fuel shortages in the future. The fuel industry's organizational structure has now been adjusted, and it is expected that the market situation can be sustained and stable thereafter.

### Information Minister Hirota Delivers a Speech on the Future Progress of the Axis Powers in Warfare

Yesterday (the 28th) at 3:00 PM, Information Minister Hirota of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office held a regular meeting with the Shanghai Chinese Press Corps on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel, where he presented his observations on the global situation and the vigorous progress of the Axis powers in the future.

Reasons for Defeat

Information Minister Hirota first discussed the global war situation, paying particular attention to Tunisia in North Africa. "While the German and Soviet forces are engaged in fierce fighting, the recent severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland has suddenly occurred. Although this represents a development in the overall global war situation, the results of the Pacific war and its future development require special attention. Regarding the recent observations of the situation in the Greater East Asia War, the war in Burma and India has developed. Japanese troops are pressing the British forces from Burma and India, while the Japanese air force has long controlled the islands of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands in the south, posing a major threat to the US Navy." Minister Hirota then discussed the situation of the enemy countries, stating that General Wavell, the commander-in-chief of the British, American, and Chongqing allied forces, had explained the reasons for the British defeat in Burma and India as being due to unfavorable weather and a large number of British soldiers suffering from fatigue and illness. In the South Pacific operations, the Japanese forces have repeatedly achieved victories, posing a major threat to Australia. General Macarthur, the commander-in-chief of the Australian, British, and American allied forces, and General Blamey, along with Australian Prime Minister Curtin and Foreign Minister Evatt, jointly appealed to the United States to provide active assistance to defend Australia, otherwise it would be subject to major attacks by Japan.

Erroneous Views

He continued, "If we look at the current situation of Britain and the United States, their defensive position in the Pacific has not only not been strengthened, but the situation is becoming increasingly dire. We can see from the so-called global war strategy flaunted by the anti-Axis war command that they have no intention of strengthening the Pacific defense. They claim that the global war will be resolved after the European war is resolved first, attempting to win victory with full force. This point is a major error. Because the Allied countries have failed to recognize the reality of the war and underestimate the Axis powers, but in our view, this is not the case. If Britain and the United States can fight with full force, it will actually provide the Axis powers with a good opportunity to wait for work at leisure and deal them a head-on blow. At that time, the entire Allied front will collapse, without a doubt."

Controlling Weaknesses

"The biggest mistake of the anti-Axis powers is that they pride themselves on armchair strategy and are mutually wary. However, this is not the case on the Axis front. If the strategic right wing in Europe is under control, the left wing, Japan, will stand up to provide assistance and overcome all difficulties. This is a common practice in warfare to avoid being individually defeated by the Allied countries. Therefore, the Allied lineup is on the verge of splitting. In addition, there are countless problems in military equipment, and weaknesses are exposed without reservation, as clearly demonstrated in the South Pacific. In places such as India, Australia, and Chongqing, we will, in accordance with the common practices of warfare and the obligations of the Japan-Germany-Italy alliance, unanimously control the weaknesses of the Allied forces and rise up to fight. Therefore, there will be vigorous developments in the spring and summer. This point can be asserted."

### Sports: Chinese Mixed Football Team to Play St. Friends Team Today at 5 PM in Xuhui

The Shanghai Chinese Mixed Football Team, in preparation for its expedition to North China, will hold a practice match with the strong Western team, St. Friends. Originally scheduled for a few days ago, it was postponed due to rain until today at 5 PM at the Xuhui Middle School field in Xujiahui. The referee is He Chunzhao, and the linesmen are Zhang Le and Chen Jixiang. The Chinese Mixed team gathers the best of Donghua and Lianyi, and boasts World Games representatives Li Tiansheng and Jia Youliang, as well as first-class players from Hong Kong and Shanghai such as Liu Xianhan, Li Ning, Zhuang Huren, Zhang Lingen, Song Lingsheng, Qu Yongfu, Dai Linjing, Li Yichen, Han Longhai, and Wu Qixiang. With such talent and a well-organized lineup, it is no less than a transformed Hualian team. St. Friends is also not to be underestimated, with many brave and skilled players such as Fuen, Carroll, and Schultz, all well-known in the football world.

### Economic Affairs: Commentary on the Resumption of Business by Chinese Stock Firms

The issue of the resumption of business by Chinese stock firms has been a matter of much anticipation since the Municipal Economic Bureau announced the handling of registration procedures for various Chinese stock firms and the issuance of business licenses to some stock companies. Everyone thought that the resolution of this long-pending issue was just around the corner. However, as news spread day after day, it eventually left people waiting in vain, and there has been no definite news of the formal resumption of the Chinese stock market.

Originally, the authorities, in view of the activities of speculators, temporarily banned the trading of Chinese stocks in order to prevent improper operations. This was a wise measure. After the ban, they actively engaged in the examination and registration of Chinese stock firms in order to promote the recovery of legitimate stock firms and the realization of a formal Chinese stock market. This was also a wise measure. Because the former was to prevent improper speculative behavior in society, and the latter was to safeguard legitimate investment activities in society. In fact, a stock market is almost a market possessed by any industrialized country in the world. In theory, the stage of modern economic evolution has already progressed from the era of materialism and monetary capitalism to the era of securities capitalism, because holding securities is tantamount to holding capital or property. Unfortunately, due to China's backward pre-war production and the semi-colonial nature of its economic structure, national enterprises and the Chinese stocks that supported them never really emerged. Since the Greater East Asia War, the situation of Chinese enterprises usurping the limelight has changed dramatically. Thus, Chinese national enterprises have begun to rise, and stocks of banks, pharmaceuticals, public utilities, culture, textile mills, department stores, and other industries have all flourished, almost as prosperous as the Tokyo stock market during the war. This is a manifestation of the development of national enterprises and an important factor in urban prosperity.

Therefore, the authorities' efforts to examine and register Chinese stock firms in order to establish a formal and legitimate Chinese stock market, and not to give up eating for fear of choking, is indeed another wise measure. What we hope for is the thorough implementation of all wise measures, and not to allow any obstruction in any level of the executive agencies to prevent the thorough implementation of their wise intentions.

### Authorities Prevent Speculation and Hoarding by Supervising the Business of Trust Companies

However, with special approval from the Ministry, they may also engage in the following ancillary businesses: (1) Receiving deposits, (2) Providing loans, (3) Discounting bills, (4) Remittances or export financing, (5) Buying and selling securities and real estate, (6) Warehousing. At the same time, it is stipulated that trust companies shall not be shareholders of stores, banks, or other companies. When banks concurrently engage in trust business, the assets and liabilities of the trust department and the banking department shall be separately independent, and the assets of the trust department or the banking department shall not be affected by the bankruptcy of one party.

### Various Banks Organize a Syndicate to Provide Rural Loans

In order to promote rural revival and increase the production of materials, the Ministry of Finance has decided to gather more than ten powerful banks, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Jin Cheng Bank, the Y盐业 Bank, and others, with the Central Reserve Bank as the center, to organize a rural revival lending syndicate to concentrate large sums of money for low-interest lending to rural areas. The specific plan is being drafted by the Ministry of Finance. It is understood that rural loans are intended for agricultural tools, plowing cattle, seedlings, farm warehouses, and rural pawnshops, and rural cooperatives are the target of the loans. Farmers' agricultural products such as rice, grains, beans, etc., may be stored in farm warehouses in various places and apply for mortgages from various banks and shops. Rural pawnshops are allowed to accept pledges, with the aim of regulating agricultural finance and reviving and reorganizing rural areas.

### Demand for Temporary Suspension of Active Deposit Reserve from Banking Industry

In accordance with the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions and the Detailed Rules for Implementation, various banks and money shops shall, in order to protect the interests of depositors, legally deposit reserve funds with the Central Reserve Bank: (1) Term deposits and special current deposits shall be 5% or more, (2) Current deposits shall be 10% or more. The reserve funds for term deposits and special current deposits have already been fully paid, but it was agreed that 5% of the current deposit reserve would be paid first, and the remaining 5% would be paid by the end of April. It is now learned that the banking and money industries, after a joint meeting, at the request of the member banks and shops, given the current emergency in the money market, have requested that the payment of the 5% current deposit reserve due at the end of April be temporarily suspended for accommodation. It is reported that the banking and money industries have not only sent representatives to contact the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, but have also jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to approve the temporary suspension of payment.

### Reorganization of Ten Industry Associations; Businesses Not Joining Associations to be Shut Down from May 1st; Coal Briquette and Cotton Weaving Factory Associations to be Established Soon

In order to adjust the old industry associations in this city that are not suitable for wartime economic institutions, the Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau has designated the initiators of ten industry associations, including the Cotton Industry Association, to convene and organize their establishment within a specified period, and ordered all companies and businesses in various industries to register and join as members of the respective industry associations, otherwise they will be shut down from May 1st.

The Coal Shop Industry Association is scheduled to convene its founding congress on May 1st. The Coal Briquette Industry Association and the Cotton Weaving Factory Industry Association will convene their founding congresses in the near future. It is reported that companies and businesses in the above ten industry associations that are found not to have joined the association as members after the following day (May 1st) will be ordered to shut down.

### Ministry of Food Withdraws the General Rules for the Organization of Joint Operating Societies

In order to actively control food throughout the country to suit wartime food policies, the Ministry of Food had promulgated the General Rules for the Organization of Food Joint Operating Societies. The rice industry in this city is currently preparing to organize one. It is now learned that the Ministry of Food believes that the previously promulgated General Rules for the Organization of Food Joint Operating Societies were not thorough and are not applicable. Therefore, a request has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval to withdraw them. In addition, the organizational rules for city and county joint operating societies will also be revised and then announced again. The Municipal Food Bureau has already received instructions from the Ministry and immediately informed the Shanghai Rice Industry Association.

### Ministry of Food Issues a Circular to Investigate Food Industry Associations

In order to implement wartime food policies, the Ministry of Food has issued a circular to food bureaus in various regions, ordering them to investigate the various industry associations engaged in the food industry in their respective regions, as well as their original departments and the types of food they operate in, and to report in detail for verification, so as to make the food institutions in various regions more substantial and the supply of food for the people more stable.

### Special Silk Donations Showing Improvement

Since the establishment of the National General Association for Commercial Control, our country's control institutions have been unified. According to the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on the Prohibition of Wartime Material Movement promulgated by the government, materials in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two special municipalities of Shanghai and Nanjing that are outside the scope of the prohibition can be freely moved! Due to the convenience and smoothness of material transportation, the tax revenues of various tax authorities have increased compared to the past. It is reported that silk is not included in the controlled materials, and raw silk and silkworm cocoons in the interior can also be freely traded. Therefore, the tax revenue of the Silk Construction Special Donation Office in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui area, which is under the Ministry of Finance, is showing improvement.

### Translated Commentary: The Current Problems of Financial Control

In order to establish China's controlled economy, it is necessary to first establish the fundamental problem of financial control. The crux of various economic problems in Central China can be traced back to the incomplete implementation of financial control. Everyone believes that if financial control can be completed, most of the various problems currently faced can be resolved.

The three key tasks of financial control are: (1) Reorganizing and merging small banks (2) Reorganizing silver houses and money shops (3) Strengthening the control power of the Central Reserve Bank. If the above problems can be resolved reasonably, then the current phenomena of hoarding, high prices, and sluggish production can be reduced by half, and the economy of Central China can be more normal. If we want to treat the root cause rather than the symptoms, then the National Government should focus on completing financial control.

However, it must be known that these problems, at first glance, seem simple, but are actually difficult to say and even more difficult to do. For example, the existence of small banks is actually due to the various social conditions that allow them to exist. Even if they are merged using mechanical means, the actual effect of the merger cannot be achieved. Because the problem is so difficult, the authorities must deploy capable personnel to deal with it effectively when implementing the reorganization and merger of financial institutions.

Reorganizing silver houses and money shops is now absolutely necessary and is a problem that the public hopes to resolve. Since the Greater East Asia War, the business of general money shops has almost lost its proper scope. Especially after the military halted the issuance of new banknotes, they have completely lost their reason for existence. Therefore, they are all looking for a way out in hoarding, and together with the silver houses, they are the cancer of the Central China economy. Therefore, no one will object to the reorganization of silver houses and money shops. However, in this regard, consideration should also be given to changing industries and other issues. In short, this cancer will harm one day if it is not removed one day. I hope that the authorities will think deeply about it.

The fundamental problem of financial control is that we earnestly hope that the National Government authorities will strengthen the control power of the Central Reserve Bank. If the Reserve Bank can complete its natural tasks within its authority, then the financial world of today will be completely renewed. It is hoped that the National Government authorities and the person in charge of the Central Reserve Bank will give more consideration to this matter, so as to achieve the perfect completion of financial control.

### How We Can Know People

— He Xu

As the saying goes, "It's not so scary to be illiterate, but it's terrifying not to know people." This saying indeed holds some truth.

Often, after reading or hearing a "writer's" patriotic essay or an orator's impassioned speech, we almost worship them, falling to our knees in admiration, even shouting "Long live!" After reading a touching novel, it's also common for young women to secretly develop a one-sided infatuation with the author. However, once we meet them or spend some time with them, we realize they are ordinary people, as the saying goes, "A hero becomes an ordinary person upon seeing him daily." This leads us to believe that "the human heart is unfathomable."

Is it really true that "the human heart is unfathomable?" No. The reason people say this is because they have a problem with their understanding of "people," or they lack some understanding in certain areas.

We believe that humans are part of the universe and members of the animal kingdom. Although humans are said to be "the most intelligent of all creatures," they still retain the habits and nature of animals. Therefore, when you analyze a person's life, never forget that they are a "person" (even "sages" are). Then it becomes easier to understand.

Furthermore, people grow up in society, and their thoughts, habits, behaviors, and preferences are all subject to the rules and consciousness of the society in which they live. Therefore, to understand a person, we cannot simply assess their strengths and weaknesses from head to toe, treating them as an isolated entity. It is extremely inaccurate to weigh their importance in this way. We must strip them bare and observe how they exist in today's society.

Some people who usually consider someone a world-class hero are surprised to hear their wife, secretary, or tea boy say that he is a gluttonous king or a lazy idler. Those who are usually displeased with him then use this as a weapon to attack him, adding fuel to the fire by announcing his ten major crimes. All of this is often used as a weight on the scale when evaluating "people" today. Is this fair? No. It is extremely wrong to abstractly refer to him as a "superman" on ordinary days and then emphasize and exaggerate his private life, ignoring the fact that he also possesses "human" nature and failing to weigh his contributions and merits to society. Isn't it true that he is also made of flesh and blood? Shouldn't he be allowed to have all the material desires of a "person"?

For example, thrift and endurance are our "golden rules" in private life. We often sympathize with and admire someone's plain clothes, simple food, shaved head, walking twenty miles every day (without taking a rickshaw), and reading for six hours without watching Xun Huisheng's performances. However, we overlook the social implications of these actions. His "praiseworthy actions" of frugality are actually for the purpose of accumulating private wealth, making him a complete miser. There are many people in the world who use thrift and endurance to seek fame and reputation. They often use these minor details to gain sympathy from others, wanting people to forget the crimes they have committed in society. These originally good "praiseworthy actions" have instead become tools for evildoers and a disguise for deception. We often see people who have amassed tens of millions of dollars and killed countless civilians (like Sun Chuanfang) then put on old cloth robes, hold prayer beads, chant "Amitabha," and pretend to be devout Buddhists. Can this be used as a weight on the scale?

There are also some people who have made great contributions in politics or literature, and they always act for the public good. Although they may not be very strict in their private lives, having several girlfriends or going to the movies often, can this completely negate their contributions and label them as unpardonable lecherous villains?

Although we do not deny that private life can affect public life, especially in terms of personal development, we should value private life. Extravagance easily leads to corruption, and laziness easily leads to decadence… However, we always value the evaluation of public life more than private life—considering public life as the primary weight in evaluating a person's worth.

### About "Selflessness"

— Qing Jun

"To eliminate troubles, one must be without self," this is the first line of a couplet by Mr. Yu Quyuan that I saw in a friend's study. Recently, I also happened to read a short "filler" article—"Selflessness"—in this publication, which stirred something within me and made me want to say a few words.

"To eliminate troubles, one must be without self" and "selflessness" are essentially the same, only differing in wording. While it embodies a spirit of great courage, forgetting the small self to serve the greater good, it also carries a certain degree of negativity, defensiveness, and decadence. Sometimes, if it continues to develop in this way, it is very possible to "see through the world" and "enter the Buddhist gate."

Of course, the achievements of many great figures in the world are undoubtedly due to "selflessness," but here we overlook another aspect—while the great figures' selflessness for the public good is a good example, the creator of this model is ultimately the "small self" that plays the most fundamental role. Without this "self," the world's "selfishness and self-interest" might be greatly reduced, but the "self" that works diligently is the original driving force for creating everything that cannot be forgotten.

Therefore, while "selflessness" and "forgetting oneself" are a spirit that humanity needs, "being without self" in order to "eliminate troubles" is ultimately too extreme. However, the content of the spirit of great impartiality and selflessness in "selflessness" is a superior aspect that can be retained, but the essential basic spirit is still to start with the "self."

At the same time, let me further clarify that the proactiveness of "having self" and the great spirit of "selflessness" are the essential basic elements for both to be possessed in a creative career. And there is no conflict between the two, although they appear to be contradictory, they must be unified to have hope of success.

We must eliminate the negative elements in "selflessness" and allow the proactiveness that starts with the self to fill its deficiencies.

### Valuable Experience

— Jia Xue

Before leaving the school gates, a person often believes that he already knows a lot and can cope with any difficult situation: or he believes that he can solve problems with courage and enthusiasm without much effort. When he comes into contact with the real society, the whole situation is very different from what he had imagined and described. So he collects his regrets, uses another new method to deal with society, and uses another new knowledge to solve the problems. After many years of this, he becomes familiar with the reality of society, feels the value of experience, and the knowledge he learned in books in the past also becomes useful again. He does not completely lose confidence as he did at the beginning, and he realizes that knowledge and experience can eventually be connected.

A person who has lived in the real situation of society since childhood, of course, accepts very little knowledge from books, but what he learns is practical and useful skills. After many years of this, he is already very skilled in his own industry, his experience is hidden in properly dealing with things and calmly dealing with problems, but he does not need to reflect, and it is not easy to think about how the experience came about, because his experience is knowledge.

Both of these two types of people benefit from experience, but the former is conscious and the latter is unconscious, and the value of experience is an undeniable fact. When it comes to how to develop after gaining experience, the latter is more likely to maintain the status quo and become stubborn, while further progress and creation often belong to the former.

### An Old Fisherman Talks About Fish Nets

— Wen Zhong

I met a familiar fisherman by a small stream—a kind old man with twinkling eyes, a red nose, and a few silver strands of beard fluttering on his chin, with faded blue cloth clothes wrapping his solid body.

I sat next to him on a blue stone. I saw him skillfully casting the fishing net with his strong hands, causing ripples on the water's surface.

"Your net," I said, "seems to be very dense, and the ropes are very strong, right?" I felt that my question was too naive and too boring.

"Yes!" the fisherman replied earnestly, a smile appearing on his face. "The fishing net must be like this! If the net is dense, small fish won't leak out." He paused for a moment and continued, "But if it's only dense and not strong, when a big fish gets caught, because the fish is strong and powerful, after struggling for a while, it may break out of the net, and those small fish, needless to say, will also slip away behind it…"

"That's right, absolutely…"

"Young friend!" the fisherman said to me in a gentle and deep tone, his attitude appearing very sincere, "Don't dismiss what I said about the fishing net, thinking it's too ordinary and unremarkable. You must know that when we handle any events, big or small, we must be precise and decisive. You are still young…"

I listened intently, nodding in understanding.

### Reflections After Watching "'For Whom Are You Toiling and Laboring?'"

— Kui Yi

In order to make money, the content of the scripts is confined to a narrow circle of love affairs to cater to the tastes of the audience. The slogan "Educate through entertainment" is shouted loudly, but what about the reality? The number of films produced by China Film Union in the past year is not small, right? But as far as I know, there are only three so-called educational films: "Universal Love," "Mother," and the recent "For Whom Are You Toiling and Laboring?"

The China Film Union authorities are indeed clever. Knowing that educational films do not sell well, they have to insert some "gimmicks" into this educational film "For Whom Are You Toiling and Laboring?" They added a few scenes of Bai Guang singing big drum ballads.

There are some things worth discussing, such as: Mei Xi, feeling Bai Guang's charm, gets entangled with her and does not go to the company to work for several days, but he would not be so extreme as to forget his own son (who is only about ten years old), whom he lives with day and night, and disregard his son's life. Furthermore, it is too unreasonable for Mei Xi, such a righteous gentleman, to change so quickly. For example, it is too coincidental that Mei Xi met the manager Xu Xinyuan at Bai Guang's house. At that time, Bai Guang's sudden change of attitude towards Mei Xi, which had been admired in the past, was quite unexpected.

The director also does not pay much attention to small details, such as: Da Chuan, played by Mei Xi, is only in his thirties or forties, while the遺像 of his wife looks like she is in her fifties or sixties. Also, Ji Chuan—Da Chuan's son—was drenched in the rain, and of course his face was covered with rainwater, but when Mei Xi saw him, he asked, "Are you crying?" How could he tell that there were tears in addition to the rainwater on his face?

In order to emphasize the atmosphere of sorrow, Ji Chuan was made to encounter a heavy thunderstorm after school. Instead of hurrying home, he stood there in the torrential rain, lost in thought, and then Da Chuan waited impatiently and went out with an umbrella to find his son in the rain. When the two met, Ji Chuan had to tell his father that he did not want to study and wanted to find a job, regardless of being drenched in the rain, which seems a bit forced.

But regardless of whether the director is successful or not, this film can be said to be an "educational film" and is worth watching, especially for those who are children. After watching it, they will be very moved!

### Think About It

— Yi Wei

If one can think carefully before doing something, while doing something, and after doing something, then one can enrich experience, be thorough in observation, and have reasonable, quick, and systematic thoughts. When encountering such a thing for the second time in the future, one can increase much smoothness and convenience.

Many people never bother to think about something before doing it, while doing it, or after doing it; therefore, many of the things they do can be used as material for sighing.

Some people are very willing to use their brains. Every time they do something, they first think about whether I should do it, whether I have the ability to do it, what effect it will have, and what impact it will have on various aspects of reputation, personality, and body. If, after considering it, it is indeed beneficial or should be done, then they make a decision to implement it and never hesitate. If the advantages and disadvantages are half and half, and it can be done or not, then they still do not do it; because the same time spent doing this thing can be transferred to other more beneficial work. If it is not beneficial, of course, they restrain themselves and decide not to do it, no matter how great the threat is.

When the research result is that it is necessary to do it, when implementing it, they must add another consideration, putting many methods together, comparing them, and thinking about which step to take to get twice the result with half the effort and have no risk of failure.

Human history is full of the tragedies caused by the recklessness and carelessness of those who have not developed the habit of thinking. If everyone had the habit of thinking, I dare to believe that not only the loss of life and the failure of careers can be greatly reduced, but also people's character and morality can be greatly improved.

Therefore, we must strive to develop the habit of "thinking," so that every thing is considered. This is our urgent task at present.

### Orphan Education Should Have a Comprehensive Plan

— Lin Chongzhi

There should be various improvements in the education, production, and future prospects of children to solve the difficulties in the work of relief organizations. The methods are: (1) Overall planning, that is, completely changing the mixed education method of orphans to various different education methods that are comprehensive or separate according to the children's age, gender, and intelligence. If the children are of excellent temperament, they should be sent to public or private middle schools or universities, and the required expenses will be allocated by the fund on a regular basis. At the same time, the schools will be requested to provide free education so that they can receive a complete education. If the children are of rough temperament and are indeed incapable of further education, then experimental factories or farms should be set up to provide them with technical training so that they can become independent after mastering a skill. (2) Thorough investigation. A thorough investigation should be conducted on the existing orphans, such as the economic conditions, environmental equipment, and management of the organization, which must be completely clear to serve as the basis for adjustment. If the environmental equipment of a certain organization really does not meet the educational conditions, it will only be asked to stop operating and merge its financial and human resources with a better organization. On the contrary, if the environmental equipment of a certain organization is indeed suitable for the education of a certain type of children, even if the economy or equipment is insufficient, then the expenses for enriching it will be provided, and then its responsibility will be increased. If there is no suitable organization to place a certain type of children, an independent hospital should be set up separately to meet certain needs. At the same time, a "Orphan Fund" should be established in the society to be responsible for raising funds for various organizations and allocating or assisting them according to the budget of each organization. (3) The implementation method should be simple and effective. You may wish to ask the Shen Bao authorities to be responsible for launching and organizing the "Orphan Welfare Committee," hiring seven to nine members, who are subordinate to the Social Service Department of the newspaper, to be responsible for all progress matters. At the same time, organize the "Orphan Fund" to be responsible for the fundraising, distribution, and management of the educational nature of orphans. At the same time, a special request is made to the Shanghai Municipal Social Welfare Bureau to provide necessary assistance for future adjustment work, so as to reduce the difficult work of orphan education at present.

### Song of a Poor Scholar

— Lan

In old age, I encountered war and chaos, and returned to live in seclusion, hiding my shadow. The vicissitudes of life are like dust dreams, and my life is like the ashes of a calamity. I have no share of the land outside the city, and my skills of hoarding are even more lacking. I cry with my wife in a cowhide coat, and the flies profit is cut off from my children's clothes. I patch up the broken house with vines, and bask the worn-out fur coat in the sun. My destiny is trapped in Capricorn, and I am like a dried-up fish in a dry rut. I can enjoy poverty in a humble alley, and I can still be relaxed on a poor road. I read by the fire of the screen window at the third watch, and I have hundreds of cities' worth of books in my horse tent. The mansions have become solid fortresses, and the high-rise buildings are all ruins. I listen to the Tartar flute all night long, and I look at the war chariots in military uniform. My proud bones are still as before, and my heroic ambitions have lost their beginnings. I am moved by the tears of the flowers and birds, and I am bitter to part with the emptiness of friends. I have experienced the hardships of the world, and I have eliminated the illusion of Zen. I indulge in tea leaves with a broad mind, and I fill my stomach with the joy of garden vegetables. It is difficult to harmonize with the customs in my old age, and the millet dream has already matured. I spend my years in leisure吟, and what else can I do but this?

(Note) Life in Shanghai is extremely difficult. If one cannot engage in commerce and hoarding, or if one's family is not wealthy, it is simply difficult to support oneself. Therefore, most poor scholars are forced to return to their hometowns. The above poem reflects the recent situation of poor scholars. If domestic scholars are willing to bestow harmonious chapters, it would be even more fortunate. Also, poor scholars often suffer from lung diseases due to malnutrition. If you have any doubts or questions about prolonged coughs and bloody sputum, please send a sincere letter for a reply, and I will do my duty. Contact address: Mr. Yang, Youzhu Medical Society, Shanghai Sacred Heart Hospital Road (at the intersection of Route Pu Shi).

### Dr. Liu Offers Preferential Treatment to Teachers
