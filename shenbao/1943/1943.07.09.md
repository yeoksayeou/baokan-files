### Advice to the Economic Delegation from Friendly Japan

The economic delegation from friendly Japan arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is about to exchange opinions with various parties. Our government and people are expressing sincere welcome and great expectations. Because China and Japan have always been brotherly nations, and in the recent Great East Asia Liberation War, they have had a close relationship of sharing weal and woe. Good or bad in any aspect of politics and economy is enough to affect the other. Therefore, when the economic delegation from the friendly nation comes to China, they naturally cannot only work on superficial, partial, or written words and speeches, but must truly and practically observe all kinds of realities. At the same time, our government and people, in particular, should not harbor a psychological fear of admitting their faults and avoiding treatment. They must tell the truth and show the true situation to the friendly nation's delegation, so that it will not fail their ardent intention of traveling a long distance. It is precisely for this reason that we yesterday selected the main points of our country's current economic maladies and listed them one by one, speaking truthfully to express our loyalty, in order to achieve genuine cooperation between China and Japan in the economy. Our sincerity will surely be understood by everyone. Today, we earnestly point out that our country's economic illness is already very deep. If the governments and people of both countries do not devise remedies as soon as possible, the future crisis will be severe, with serious consequences for China, for the friendly nation, and for the entire Great East Asia Liberation cause.

However, if we only know the sick and the illness, without investigating the source of the illness, then the remedial work will inevitably be empty or achieve less than half the effort. As for where the root of the economic illness lies in the peace zone of our country, to be honest, it is inseparable from politics. Political illness is the cause, and economic illness is the result. Therefore, to cure the economic illness, we must first—at least simultaneously—cure the political illness; otherwise, it will ultimately be futile. The biggest root cause of China's economic illness today is that Chinese politics is not on the right track, and politics is not sound. Some leaders are failing in public expectations. In terms of political programs and policies, in recent decades, they have followed foreign policies without adapting them to the actual conditions of the country and the practical needs of the people. Therefore, they drift with the tide, and orders change frequently. At the same time, those in politics also rotate like revolving lanterns, coming and going, responding perfunctorily, without seriously and practically having a way to do things. And in reality, it is also impossible, resulting in the formation of unsound politics in China, affecting the economic illness. And the foreign forces that dominate behind the scenes only obtain a certain degree and form of semi-colonial "rights and interests" in China on the surface. These rights and interests are mostly one-sided, partial, and temporary, and they have nothing to do with the long-term interests of the international future. When another international force rises, there is a danger of being forced to retreat completely. Today's Britain and the United States can serve as a clear example. The bitter fruit of their failure to help improve Chinese politics, win people's hearts, and establish the foundation of state relations is precisely today's lesson for us.

Besides the above, what affects China's economy the most and makes it morbid is the lack of unity in the functions and powers of political institutions. There is no need to cite many historical examples. In terms of facts that have just passed, the functions and powers of political organs and control institutions related to the economy are also not unified or clear. It is commonplace for the Japanese side and the Chinese authorities to form overlaps, as well as overlaps within the Chinese institutions themselves. As a result, the economic circles and the general public suffer from not knowing what to do, hindering the improvement of the economy and its normal development. In addition to the duplication of institutions and the lack of unified powers, there are also many unreasonable and inhumane "principles" and "laws," "regulations," and the like. The motives may all be good, but because they are not prescribing the right medicine and have not undergone detailed, comprehensive, and in-depth research, they are drafted hastily and implemented rashly, and the result is the opposite of what was expected. In addition, there are many systems, from politics to economics, that are not suitable for China's national conditions, not suitable for the special conditions of various regions, and even less suitable for the different customs of different regions. Some systems may indeed be very good in Tokyo and achieve excellent results, but when they come to Shanghai, they may get completely different results. If we don't talk about saving China's economic ailments from now on, otherwise, we must first carefully study the above points. Our words may be too earnest and straightforward, but for the sake of the economic future of China and Japan, we have to say them.

The salvation of China's economic ailments and the improvement of China's economic undertakings should begin with Shanghai. No one needs to doubt this. And the genuine cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese economies should be initiated by Shanghai, which is the common opinion of knowledgeable people from China and Japan. We should also point out that whether the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can be fully realized depends on whether the local economy of Shanghai can be brought back on track. However, the economic illness of Shanghai is a typical example of the economic illness of the whole country, and its close relationship with political morbidity is particularly obvious. All the evil phenomena, such as hoarding, speculation, reduced production, sharp opposition between sudden wealth and extreme poverty, must be solved simultaneously from both political and economic aspects. As the Shanghai concessions are being returned and the economic delegation from the friendly nation is visiting China to investigate, we cannot help but sincerely look forward to the recovery of Shanghai's economy, the development of China's economy, the more practical and comprehensive cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese economies, and the final completion of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere economy!

What we have said in the past two days is about the symptoms and sources of the disease, in the hope that the members of the delegation will refer to it before prescribing a prescription. In addition, we will also convey the active and concrete opinions of the Chinese people and the Shanghai business community to the members of the delegation, in order to obtain the right medicine.

Editorial

### Promoting Economic Cooperation between China and Japan

The Japan-China Friendship Economic Delegation, led by Mr. Masatsune Ogura, is visiting China, which is of great significance to the advancing new relationship between China and Japan.

The return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality have made China a truly independent country. If China wants to adapt to this new national status, the revitalization of its economy is an indispensable condition. And for the revitalization of the economy, external assistance is indispensable. In this regard, there is no other place to seek help but Japan. The arrival of this economic survey team is precisely in line with this inevitability.

The participation of the National Government in the war indicates that China and Japan are working together to complete the war and build the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The road for China to complete this important task mostly lies in the economic aspect, which is universally recognized. Therefore, economic cooperation between China and Japan is of even deeper significance. Chairman Ogura said: "Judging from the nature of the current world war, the Greater East Asia War cannot be completely won, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is impossible. If the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is not successful, how can we seek the welfare of the East Asian nations?" These words are indeed profound.

What, then, is the specific mission of the delegation? First, the delegation should frankly exchange opinions with Chinese economic people on the mutual relationship between the economies of China and Japan. Second, the delegation should frankly and publicly disclose Japan's experience in controlling the economy. Sincerely guide the Chinese economic community. Third, the delegation should also strive to promote the smooth communication of wills between the National Government and the Chinese economic community. In other words, the delegation should fully understand the opinions of both parties, so that the views of both parties are consistent, developed, and can contribute to the revitalization of the Chinese economy.

### Japanese Troops on New Guinea Island Launch Counterattack Against Landing Enemy Troops Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Cooperate to Launch Three-Dimensional Attack, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 pm on the 8th: The Japanese garrison near Salamaua in southeastern New Guinea Island has been conducting counterattacks against the American troops landing at Nassau Bay and the Australian troops advancing from Wan since June 30th. On July 5th, they ambushed the enemy's rear near Bobdubi, causing them to collapse. The Japanese air force also attacked the enemy at Nassau Bay on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th, inflicting great losses on the enemy's boat groups and landing points. Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) According to military experts here: Since June 30th, in order to carry out a counterattack in the Pacific waters with powerful troops, the American troops landed on the Solomon Islands, Lombard Island, and New Georgia Island to carry out a counterattack. They are currently engaged in fierce three-dimensional battles with the Japanese army, navy, and air force on land, sea, and air, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters at 3:30 pm on the 8th. On the day the American troops landed on Lenteba Island, they also landed at Nassau Bay in southeastern New Guinea Island. At the same time, the Australian troops cooperated with the American troops and advanced from the Wan side. The Japanese garrison in Salamaua immediately launched a counterattack against the enemy. Especially on the 5th, they ambushed the enemy's rear near Bobdubi, causing them to collapse. At the same time, the Japanese air force also cooperated with the ground forces and bombed the American troops in Nassau Bay fiercely for three days on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th, sinking a large number of American boats and severely damaging their docks. In the ten-day battle, many American aircraft were shot down. The landing of American troops on Lenteba Island, New Georgia Island, and Nassau Bay, and the advance of the Australian troops on the Wan side, are obviously carried out under a joint operation. The enemy's counterattack this time, judging from their combat intent, troop strength, and equipment, should not be underestimated. However, the Japanese garrison has integrated with the army, navy, and air force and is launching fierce counterattacks. Since June 30th, the Japanese troops in that area have shot down more than 128 American aircraft and sunk many of their ships. The loss of their personnel has actually reached more than 11,000.

Penochi Allez, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 7th: (1) The Japanese air force bombed the Anti-Axis forces' positions in Penapena, New Guinea Island, (2) The Japanese army attacked an Anti-Axis convoy in the Heraflara Sea.

### Indian Independence League Announces Establishment of Indian National Army Determined to Fight for Independence

Shaofu, 8th (Central News Agency) The headquarters of the Indian Independence League announced at 3:00 pm on the 8th the establishment of the Indian National Army, expressing the determination of the Indian people to fight for independence. The main idea is: The Indian Independence League in East Asia established the National Army on the 8th, called the "Indian National Army." The Indian National Army is determined to achieve the complete independence of India. The Indian soldiers are also determined to drive the British army out of India in order to complete the sacred and great cause of building "India for Indians."

Prime Minister Tojo Personally Inspects

Shonan, 8th (Central News Agency) The Indian National Army here was inspected by Jiangtela Bose on the 5th. On the 6th, Prime Minister Tojo also inspected the army again. On that day, at 11:20 am, the Indian National Army gathered in front of the city hall square. Indian people welcoming Prime Minister Tojo also gathered. The new leader of the Indian people, Mr. Kangtela Bose, arrived first. Soon, Prime Minister Tojo, followed by Mr. Jiang and other independent volunteers, entered the arena amid cheers and shook hands with Mr. Jiang and others. He also greeted the entire body. The Indian National Army elite and the people all looked at Prime Minister Tojo with grateful eyes. Then, Mr. Jiang stood up and delivered a welcome speech, saying, "We are deeply grateful to Prime Minister Tojo for personally coming to guide us, so our determination to achieve independence is even stronger." His tone was full of enthusiasm and determination to achieve independence. After Mr. Jiang's speech, the inspection began, and a march-past was held.

Prime Minister Tojo then had a cordial talk with Mr. Kang in a separate room. Finally, the Indian national anthem was played, and Mr. Jiang and others withdrew from the arena amid cheers from the people.

Commander Bose Encourages Officers and Soldiers

Shonan, 8th (Central News Agency) Jiangtela Bose, chairman of the Indian Independence League and commander-in-chief of the Indian National Army, delivered a speech to the officers and soldiers of the National Army on the 8th when the Indian National Army was announced to be established, encouraging them to work hard. The main idea is as follows: Soldiers of the National Army, today should be one of the most proud days of my life. God has happily instructed me to announce to the world the glorious establishment of the Indian National Army. The Indian National Army has now completed its organization in the ancient battlefield of the Singapore Fortress, which was once the stronghold of the British Empire, and is now the new Shonan. This army should not only break free from the shackles of Britain and strive for liberation, but also be the foundation for building a free Indian army. All the people of India are proud that this army is composed of people under the full guidance of India, and that they will rush to the front line when the major historical moment comes. When the Japanese army began to attack in December 1941, it rushed to Singapore. In the future battles, we should shout to Delhi. At that time, it is still unknown how many of our troops will be able to survive, but I can assert today that the final victory will belong to us. The most regrettable thing about the Indian resistance work so far is that although the atmosphere of Indian independence has gradually formed in all aspects, the first condition is still lacking, that is, there is no army for the liberation of India. But now, thanks to your lead in participating, the Indian National Army has been formed. This is your privilege and honor, and the last obstacle to the future of India's freedom and liberation has also been eliminated by your hands. Therefore, you should be proud to be the pioneers in achieving this sacred goal. I would like to explain here the two major missions of the Indian people in today's war. One is that Indians should not hesitate to make any sacrifices to use force to fight for India's freedom. The second is that they should organize a regular army that is sufficient to permanently ensure India's freedom and independence. In the future, we should build a strong fortress in national defense. You should especially take honesty, duty, and sacrifice as the creed of soldiers, and you must practice it. The most praiseworthy thing in my life has been as described above, and I believe that today, Indians can gain the highest honor in addition to participating in the national liberation war, but I believe that gaining this honor also has a great responsibility. I vow to share my fate with you at all times, and what I ask of you is only active advancement and no sacrifice. If you are willing to follow me forward regardless of life or death, I am sure that you will lead you to victory and freedom. Our only wish is not only to fight for the freedom of some Indians, but to seek the complete independence of India, so we have to prepare all sacrifices for the independence of India.

### British Indian Army Commander Arrives in New Delhi

Stanford, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from New Delhi: The new commander of the British Indian Army, Auchinleck, arrived in New Delhi on the 6th and immediately took office. When meeting with reporters, he said, "India is now a base for the Anti-Axis Air Force, but the crisis in India is deepening."

### Japanese South China Army Press Officer Discusses the Brutality of American Aircraft Attacking Guangdong

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) The Japanese South China Expeditionary Force announced at 11:00 am on the 8th that 20 American-stationed Chongqing Air Force fighter-bomber joint formations invaded Guangzhou airspace at 3:05 pm on the 17th, blindly bombing the Dongjiang area and the vicinity of Huangpu. The Japanese air force immediately took off to intercept and shot down two enemy aircraft (one unconfirmed). The remaining enemy aircraft fled to the northwest. The Japanese side suffered no losses in this battle.

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) The Japanese South China Expeditionary Force press officer gave a speech at 10:00 am on the 8th regarding the American aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of Guangzhou, the main idea being: On May 8th, the American-stationed Chongqing Air Force indiscriminately bombed Guangzhou city,尽尽暴之能事 (exerting all possible brutality), and this matter is still deeply imprinted in the minds of the people. The United States constantly shouts for justice and humanity, but American aircraft arbitrarily and indiscriminately bombed prosperous streets in the city during the day, injuring more than 1,000 civilians. This kind of brutal behavior is outrageous to both humans and gods. The Chinese people now not only know that the American-stationed Chongqing Air Force's intention is to take advantage of the name of aid to achieve its ambition to dominate China, but they have also personally experienced it. The headquarters of the American-stationed Chongqing Air Force, fearing that its own country and Chongqing would know that it was powerless, announced on July 4th, the anniversary of the establishment of the American-stationed Chongqing Air Force, that the loss of American personnel stationed in Chongqing in the past year was only nine people, and only three people were missing. This kind of fact is completely inconsistent. Even if the American air force personnel who died over Kunming and Zilin are not discussed, the number has already exceeded this number in Guangzhou alone. It is estimated that in October last year, four people were captured in the American aircraft shot down on the Pearl River: Lieutenant Alas, Lieutenant Lunos, Captain Mayup, and Captain Young. In November last year, two people, including Lieutenant Tang Er, were captured in the American aircraft shot down in the Guangzhou area. In the American aircraft shot down in Guangzhou on May 8th of this year, six people, including Lieutenant Plaeman, were captured. Judging from this fact, the intentional concealment of damage by the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing is already very obvious.

### American Air Force Major Shot Down by Japanese

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) According to news from Chongqing, the headquarters of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing announced on the 7th that Major Robard, the squadron leader of the fighter squadron of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing, was shot down by Japanese ground fire while flying alone on a reconnaissance mission over Shishou Huarong on the north bank of Dongting Lake on the 1st.

### Pearl River Navigation Curfew Lifted

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) The Pearl River night navigation, which was previously stipulated to end at 10:00 pm, has been lifted due to the restoration of public order and to increase the shipping capacity. The Guangzhou Japanese Naval Martial Arts Office announced on the 8th that from the 10th of this month, ships traveling to and from the river can freely navigate in the Pearl River, regardless of day or night.

### Japanese Economic Delegation to Go to Nanjing Soon

They will also pay respects to Chairman Wang of the National Government and visit various authorities of the National Government to sincerely discuss the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in the future.

### Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Battle Results of Japanese Troops on Hainan Island

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at noon on the 8th: Since February 21st of this year, the Japanese naval forces in the Chinese Hainan Island area have attacked the enemy troops entrenched in the mountainous area in the northwest of the island. The battle results obtained up to the end of June are as follows: (1) Abandoned corpses: 9,500, (2) Surrendered: 3,600, (3) The Japanese army captured 1,200 rifles, 152,000 rounds of ammunition, 290 machine guns and pistols, 1,866 hand grenades, 30 landmines, and 90 captured ships.

### National Government Declaration of War

— Wang Zhaoming

At the beginning of the Great East Asia War on December 8th of the year before last, the National Government 据中日基本关系条约之精神 (according to the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty) declared its determination to share weal and woe with the friendly nation of Japan. Since then, it has started the New National Movement and engaged in safeguarding public security and improving people's livelihoods, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Great East Asia War. However, countries such as Britain and the United States still follow their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified it to the point of colluding with Chongqing elements to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India to allow East Asians to kill East Asians. Recently, due to the fact that the 共暴力 (communist violence) has been successively defeated by the armies of the friendly nation Japan, and the bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost, they are even more cunning. They are also jealous of the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the National Government, instigating Chongqing elements to constantly harass them to hinder the progress of various constructions, and even using their own aircraft, using Chongqing as a base, to repeatedly bomb places such as Wuhan and Guangzhou, killing civilians. The Chongqing elements are willing to be driven by Britain and the United States and personally become traitors to East Asia, which is shameful. Britain and the United States, with ulterior motives for East Asia, have done everything possible to sow discord in order to achieve their final desire for annexation. They are especially enemies to the East Asian nations. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States and will do its utmost to cooperate with the friendly nation Japan to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two countries of Thailand and Thailand have always maintained friendly relations, and they are especially of one mind in their efforts to create East Asia. In the future, they should work together to jointly build a new order in East Asia based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been dealing with British and American forces in the West for several years and have repeatedly won the glory of victory. Our country is now participating in the Great East Asia War and should echo each other in order to make a practical contribution to the just new order of the world as a whole. All our people should know that this is the only time to realize the Father of the Nation's Greater Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of 世界全体义义和平 (universal justice, righteousness, and peace) all depend on this. Let us be of one mind and heart, and work together from beginning to end, to carry out the great mission of this great era!

### General Commander Hata Releases Impressions of His Trip to Shandong

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - General Commander Hata of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army previously inspected Japanese military units in Shandong Province on June 21st. After completing his official duties, he returned to this location on June 28th. On the 8th, he hosted a press corps and released his impressions of the inspection, conveying that the spirit of Japan's new policy towards China has been implemented in all aspects of the Japanese military, and is being concretely put into practice. This endeavor has been reflected in the Chinese side, namely, that recently the Chinese side has gradually understood Japan's true intentions and is cooperating with them. The efforts of the current Chinese military and police in maintaining local security are extremely earnest. The provincial and county governments are deeply aware of the importance of their administrative responsibilities and are making every effort to fulfill them. Their communication with the Japanese side is also becoming closer. Recently, there has been a sharp increase in Chongqing's military defecting to support the National Government. The crops in various parts of Shandong Province have grown well this year, promising a bountiful harvest, and the security in various places is extremely solid, which is deeply gratifying. During my inspection trip, I also made a detour to Qufu to pay respects at the Temple of Confucius, and learned that the area has been repeatedly subjected to war for more than a thousand years without being destroyed, which deeply impressed me with the greatness of the latent power of Confucianism.

### Tank Battle Unfolds on the Kursk Front; Germany Claims to Have Broken Through the Main Soviet Defense Line

Stockholm Capital, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The largest tank warfare since the opening of the Eastern Front has occurred today. Berlin announced that yesterday the German army destroyed over 400 Soviet tanks and 193 aircraft. Moscow reported that the battles in the Belgorod and southern Orel regions were unprecedentedly fierce, with massive tank attacks and incessant air battles continuing to intensify. Berlin stated that both sides were fully engaged in air combat in the Kursk area, with an unprecedented number of aircraft being used. The Soviet army has also joined the battle with a huge number of tanks never used before. It is said that the four hundred tanks lost by the Soviet side were destroyed by the German army's anti-aircraft artillery units and dive bombers and fighter planes. The Soviet army lost 830 aircraft in three days of fighting, while Berlin claimed that only 54 aircraft were lost. Berlin further claimed that the Soviet Union's strong defense system was broken through by the German army after yesterday's fierce battle. German dive bombers and fighter planes provided great assistance to ground combat units at any time and place. After enduring the Soviet offensive for two days, the German army switched to a counter-offensive and broke through several main Soviet lines in a fierce war.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Huitong News Agency's military correspondent stated: On the third day of the Kursk battle, as a result of the German army's penetration into the Soviet army's strong echelon defense positions, the front lines north of Orel and south of Belgorod have been greatly shortened. Although this semi-circle, where 400,000 elite Soviet troops are located, is still supported by extremely powerful tanks and artillery units, it is strategically the most dangerous position for the enemy. Currently, the German army has broken through the Italian army's front line between Orel and Mtsensk, while another German unit has also attacked the Soviet defense line further south of Belgorod. The Soviet position is showing an increasingly unfavorable trend, so the Soviet army is currently attempting to attack the German front line in the west of the semi-circle to avoid the German army's flanking maneuver. The focus of the fighting on Wednesday was still on the north and south flanks, and the Soviet offensive was repelled by the German army in many places. The fact that the Soviet army has gathered such a large number of elite troops in the Gulf of Donets shows that it intends to launch a large-scale offensive there to improve its military strategic position. Currently, Soviet airfields in Kursk are crowded with aircraft, so it can be concluded that the ultimate goal of the Soviet offensive is to recapture Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk.

There is no doubt that the Kursk battle has not yet reached its peak. The Soviet offensive has achieved nothing this time. In fact, this is the third time the German army has changed from a defensive to an offensive position on the Eastern Front. The first time was in May 1942, when Marshal Timoshenko's offensive in Kharkiv caused a German counter-offensive. The second time was still in the Kharkiv area, in March of the 3rd year of Showa, when General Manstein led elite troops in a counter-offensive in the Donets Basin and Poltava, and finally recaptured Kharkiv.

Before the German army launched its offensive in Kursk this time, it had already detected the Soviet army's intentions, so it had gathered sufficient forces in Orel and Belgorod. The German army in this area is well-equipped, and the enemy is also using new tanks in combat. Both sides are using new weapons, so the development of the Kursk battle this time can test the effectiveness of the new weapons. At the same time, both sides are using strong artillery and large air forces in combat, which is also a feature of this battle. Currently, the intensity of the air battle in the Kursk area is unprecedented on the Eastern Front. The German army has deployed more aircraft than the British and Americans used in Tunisia, so the German air force has a great advantage in Kursk, and air supremacy fell into the hands of the German army yesterday.

### Materials Investigation Committee Conducts Regional Investigations into Hoarding

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the Supreme National Defense Council approved the organizational regulations and list of members of the Materials Investigation Committee, the committee has now opened an office in Shanghai. A total of 15 investigators have been selected and dispatched separately by the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Japanese Consulate General, the Japanese Military Police, the Public Concession Work Bureau, and the French Concession Municipal Council. The Mayor of Shanghai serves concurrently as the chairman of the committee to investigate important hoarded materials, and has held meetings to discuss specific investigation plans and the legal disposal of investigation results. It is reported that the investigation principles are: (1) Chinese and Japanese investigators will investigate their respective nationals separately, so the work is progressing quite smoothly; (2) the urban area, the Public Concession area, and the French Concession area will be investigated separately, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. If evidence of hoarding of important national materials is found, it will be dealt with in accordance with the regulations on punishing hoarding.

### Famous German General Commands Battle with Over a Million Troops on Both Sides

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the announcement of the German Chief of Staff Headquarters at noon on the 7th, the offensive and defensive battle in the Kursk salient has been fiercely fought for three days. The characteristics have now been determined: (1) After the winter battle, the German and Soviet armies gathered large forces in this area. It is estimated that the strength of the German and Soviet armies gathered in this area is over one million, with about a thousand tanks. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the German army has an absolute advantage in armored and air power compared to the Soviet army. This is evidenced by the fact that the Soviet Union lost 190 tanks on the 7th alone, which shows that this is indeed the case. (2) In terms of air supremacy on the front line, this can be seen from the fact that the Soviet army lost 140 aircraft on the 7th alone, while the German army lost only 8. The air supremacy on this line has completely fallen into the hands of the German army. According to the German military authorities, the ratio of the German air force to the Soviet air force is 14 to 1. (3) Both sides have used heavy and light artillery fire to the maximum extent in this operation. The German military authorities also said, "The scale and intensity of the artillery battle are unprecedented." (4) According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the German commander directly directing the battle in the Kursk salient is Marshal Kluge. Kluge established special merit in the Battle of Flanders in 1940. In 1941, he appeared on the Eastern Front and demonstrated his super special mobile tactics in the battles of Bialystok, Minsk, and Smolensk. Therefore, Marshal Kluge is the first-class famous general of the German army.

### Axis Powers Still Maintain Air Superiority in the Mediterranean; Fierce Air Raids on Port Said

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency, German military personnel believe that the fierce air battles in the Mediterranean in recent days, especially in Sicily and Sardinia, have sufficiently proven that the Axis air force still holds an advantage there. The British and Americans also admit that repeated attempts to destroy the Italian airfields in this area have had the opposite result. The Axis powers' defenses are becoming stronger as they fight. It is estimated that the British and Americans lost 52 aircraft in the above two places on the 3rd of this month, 56 on the 4th, and 51 on the 6th, most of which were four-engine bombers. The Axis powers only lost 16 aircraft in these three days. Britain now also admits that the Axis powers' defenses are extremely strong. When 30 Allied aircraft attempted to bomb Gampini in Sicily, they were intercepted by more than 100 Axis fighter planes. As for the losses suffered by the Axis air force claimed by the enemy, eyewitnesses have been able to prove that they are false and purely fabricated.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A special correspondent of the German News Agency commented on the battle in the Mediterranean region: According to observations made by German reconnaissance aircraft personnel on Wednesday, strong units of German bombers launched a fierce attack on the port of Said on the evening of June 6, causing major damage to the enemy. A portion of the German aircraft flew low over the entire port to attack, causing a serious blow to one of the most important artillery batteries of the Anglo-American fleet. In addition, several enemy ships moored in the port or outside the breakwater were also directly hit by heavy bombs and suffered heavy damage. Most of them can be considered lost. At the same time, the Anglo-American air force continued to bomb Sicily yesterday. Seventeen enemy aircraft were shot down by German and Italian fighter planes and anti-aircraft artillery units. The reporter Song claimed that the Anglo-American air force has lost no less than 176 aircraft in the past four days of bombing Italian cities, most of which were four-engine bombers.

### Anti-Axis Forces Concentrating to Prepare for the Invasion of Europe

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A special correspondent of the German News Agency stated that according to reliable sources, the Anglo-American fleet, including several ships of the British King George class, has sailed westward from the Port of Gibraltar. It is not yet known what relationship this move has with the invasion of Europe. What is known is that the strength of the anti-Axis fleet in the Mediterranean has indeed greatly increased in recent weeks, including several American battleships and aircraft carriers. The number of ships transporting troops to North Africa and the Far East and supply ships has also greatly increased. However, the trend of modern warfare has pointed out that air power alone is not enough to achieve the success of an occupation. Therefore, General Vincent Howard has been trying his best to replenish troops and munitions for eight weeks. The strength of the anti-Axis forces in the Mediterranean, from North Africa to Syria, has gathered 44 divisions of infantry and 15 to 20 tank formations, including two divisions of Anglo-American paratroopers and airborne landing troops, whose mission is obviously to create bridgehead fortresses. This force also includes small tank units attached to motorized infantry units. Bassi said that the above figures seem very daunting at first glance, but after detailed study, it is known that half of this military force must remain stationed in its original locations, especially in Algeria, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and Italian North Africa, because the anti-Axis group must station a strong army in order to maintain its ruling power. Furthermore, a portion of the anti-Axis forces includes Greek, Czech, Serbian, and Syrian troops, whose combat effectiveness is not considered high even by the British and Americans, and the combat effectiveness of this mixed and disorganized army is also questionable. On the other hand, the transportation and transfer of war materials in North Africa must be handled by the anti-Axis forces themselves, because the local workers are insufficient. Furthermore, the roads and railways in North Africa must also be built by the military, and General Eisenhower must also specially train the American army, whose combat effectiveness is not strong. The combat effectiveness of this American army has been proven in the Tunisian campaign. From this perspective, when the anti-Axis forces in the Mediterranean region want to attack Europe, only a portion of the force is available, and this available force must be the best members of the anti-Axis forces. Currently, the Axis powers' defenses have made the anti-Axis powers' tentative invasion of Europe even more dangerous. The anti-Axis powers' attempt to launch an invasion of Europe at the same time as the Eastern Front war is a dangerous move, because the power of the German air force in the Mediterranean is still sufficient to inflict great blows on the invaders.

### German Mail Ship Becomes a Girls' Camp

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The former German luxury liner "Cap Arcona," which served on the South American route, has now become the home of 400 German girls in the naval auxiliary force. They not only sleep on the ship, but also spend most of their time on the ship, especially enjoying the large deck sports field provided by the ship.

### Recent Developments in North China

Since Japan implemented its new policy towards China, it has been followed by the return of concessions, the transfer of enemy property to the National Government for management, and the withdrawal of Japanese instructors from local administrative agencies, as well as accelerating the transfer of occupied area management businesses to China. In North China, measures are being carried out, including the easing and abolition of restrictions on the movement of materials, the abolition of special service agencies, the large-scale withdrawal of Japanese instructors from the New People's Society, and the transfer of the main bodies of livelihood agencies and the Anti-Communist Committee to the jurisdiction of the Chinese side. This proves that Japan's new policy does not distinguish between Central China and North China, but targets the entire China. The existing facts in the North China area, which were built up under the "special nature of North China" by previous policies in North China, are completely concentrated on being a supply base for cooperating in the Greater East Asia War. On what point should the operation of the new policy be adjusted? Below, let's look at various recent situations from what has been seen and heard locally:

(1) Price, Food, and Fuel Problems: The North China Political Affairs Committee previously established a Food Management Bureau under the Price and Materials Adjustment Committee, and established Food Transport Associations in various provinces and special municipalities, in order to establish purchasing institutions and maintain food supply. Furthermore, on the 5th, in order to prevent hoarding, it promulgated regulations on food prices, and implemented a public price system from the 20th.

These measures have all been effective, and food prices have fallen back since the 6th, and are now lower than the prices in March of this year. Furthermore, according to a survey at the end of May, this year's harvest has increased by 20% compared to previous years. This is one point that the food problem can be said to be resolved.

(2) The CCP Problem: As shown in the previous conversation with Commander Ohito of the Japanese army, the Anti-Communist Committee guided by the Japanese side has been dissolved. A new Anti-Communist Committee has been established under the North China Political Affairs Committee to discuss anti-Communist countermeasures in cooperation with the Political Affairs Committee and the New People's Society.

Anti-Communist Committee branches have now been established in various counties, and a fierce struggle has begun against the CCP's political offensive. Si Zhi, the Governor of Shanxi Province, replied to a reporter's question about the CCP as follows:

"The CCP is still continuing its work of three parts military and seven parts political. The CCP's politics, due to its propaganda, truly has considerable charm for the people. This is an undeniable fact, but the existence of corrupt officials and clerks within the CCP is indeed undeniable. They encourage the people to cultivate opium, which is a poison to the people. We strictly prohibited the cultivation of opium in February, and we maintain clean and honest politics against the CCP's corruption. They use opium to poison the people, and we strictly prohibit it. In mid-June, I personally inspected the entire province by plane, and did not see any farmland cultivating opium. This is a barometer of the penetration of the province's political power."

On the one hand, Shanxi Province has also formed a youth team with the nature of a people's self-defense organization, building anti-Communist fortresses and collecting intelligence, which has achieved considerable results.

(3) Labor Problems: Regarding the labor problems of developing important resources such as coal, iron, and stone in the Jin Si and Jinbei areas, North China has always been a world-famous labor supply market, so there is no difficulty.

For example, in the Datong Coal Mine, Chinese and Japanese workers have jointly started increasing coal production in mines hundreds of feet deep, and have already broken the planned amount, but unfortunately the transportation capacity cannot keep up.

(4) Security: Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying, the former commanders of the 24th Army of the National Army, resolutely participated in the peace movement and defeated the Chongqing forces based in the Taihang Mountains. The CCP forces in eastern Hebei, northern Shanxi, and western Shanxi have also been annihilated, and security is improving day by day.

Therefore, the mission of strengthening security in North China has been temporarily completed. From July, a new construction movement in North China will be launched. This movement will thoroughly implement Japan's new policy towards China on the Chinese side. At the same time, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, how to construct North China and how to make it a military base will be the focus of the future.

(5) New National Movement: Since Japan began its new policy towards China, the National Government has comprehensively launched the New National Movement as a step towards building a unified country. From this point of view, it is urgent to break the special nature of North China in order to strengthen the central political power.

Since Chairman Wang's visit to Beijing last autumn, such as the Chairman's assumption of the honorary presidency of the New People's Society, the New People's Society's adoption of the New National Movement, the adoption of the Blue Sky White Sun flag in North China, the participation of the Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee in the Supreme National Defense Council of the National Government, and the amendment of the organizational regulations of the Political Affairs Committee, all are measures to centralize North China. North China also responded to this with the enthusiasm of "no North China, no center; no center, no North China," and moved towards completing the war.

North China originally had two aspects: the first line of anti-communism and the economic core of China, Japan, and Manchuria. The backbone of the new cooperative relationship between China and Japan, including this special North China, should be the principle of equal sharing centered on the efficiency of both countries. In any case, North China should not emphasize its special nature to the National Government, nor should it stand in a special position towards Japan. China, which participates in the war, should develop its special nature in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, in other words, to fulfill the powerful position of a supply base for completing the Greater East Asia War, and work together with the southern peoples to win this great war. This is what North China, the National Government, and Japan should all remember and never forget. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi of June 26)

### Director Tang's Welcome Speech

Director Tang of the Commercial Control Association delivered a welcome speech, saying: "Today, all the directors and supervisors of the National Commercial Control Association sincerely welcome His Excellency Mr. Ogura, the head of the Japanese Economic Inspection Group, and all the gentlemen. We are very honored by your presence. His Excellency Mr. Ogura and all the gentlemen are powerful authorities in the financial and economic circles in Japan. At the same time, they are responsible for various important tasks in the country. This time, they have temporarily put down their own work and come from afar, which shows that they attach great importance to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and various economic issues in China. We are very grateful for this opportunity to express our opinions on economic issues. Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has been established as a national policy by the governments of both countries. However, how can it be realized? It all depends on the mutual understanding and cooperation between the financial and economic circles of the two countries. China has always been a country with backward production. Whether in industry or agriculture, there is a phenomenon of insufficient production. This is the case in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. Therefore, increasing production is the most important task for China at present. However, if all the conditions are not met and the methods used are not appropriate, not only will the desired increase in production not be achieved, but the opposite result may be obtained. The most important condition for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is that China first has a solid economic foundation, and a solid economic foundation is based on production. Therefore, we hope that the advanced financial and economic circles of friendly countries will help China as much as possible to solve the prerequisites for increasing production, and study various methods for increasing production, especially how to stimulate producers' interest in increasing production. During wartime, it is a matter of course that people should economize on food and clothing. However, the minimum living standards of the people must be maintained, otherwise, not only will production not increase, but it will even decrease. Therefore, with regard to distribution, whether it is the distribution of materials between the two countries or the distribution of daily necessities to the people in the country, a rapid and reasonable adjustment should be made. This is a realistic issue and the basic condition for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.

Material control has been implemented in name since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association on March 15, but in fact, because the lower-level institutions have yet to be organized layer by layer, and have not yet been perfectly organized until now, the promotion of work still needs to be improved. Material control is an innovation in China. The colleagues who are responsible for the control work lack the knowledge and experience of control, so they are not very confident about the future of the control work. Your country partially implemented material control before the incident and has gradually improved it in recent years, becoming more complete and thorough. This time, experts in trade control are also participating in your country. If you could give us your advice and guidance, so that we can obtain guidance, we would be very fortunate."

### Speech by the Head of the Japanese Delegation

"I am very grateful for the grand welcome meeting held by the National Commercial Control Association tonight. On behalf of all my colleagues, I would like to express my thanks.

Recalling that the people of our two countries, China and Japan, are not only neighbors in East Asia, but also ethnic groups with the same script and culture. Since ancient times, we have had a relationship of interdependence. Unfortunately, after the invasion of East Asia by Western Europeans, all kinds of complex relationships unknowingly arose between the two countries due to their instigation and counter-espionage, which led to unfortunate events. This is really a matter of regret. Fortunately, Chairman Wang understood the situation, resolutely left Chongqing, moved to Nanjing, and decided to cooperate with Japan to save China from danger and move towards the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. In January of this year, he further declared war on Britain and the United States, expressing his determination to live and die with Japan. China and Japan thus stood on the same front, working together to resist foreign enemies. This is truly unprecedented. Now, in Europe, there is a mutual death struggle between the Axis powers. This can be said to be a major transition period in the history of building a new world order. We are in this environment, and we should do our best to achieve certain victory. We know that to build a new world order, we must first build the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. In other words, before the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is built, the new world order cannot be rebuilt. However, the construction of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere necessarily requires the comprehensive cooperation of China and Japan as the central axis. Among them, economic cooperation is particularly important. This is also what you have already understood. Therefore, the historical mission that our two countries bear in economic cooperation is extremely important and great. The enemy dares to believe in the sincerity of the economic cooperation between China and Japan and the sincere cooperation of economic people. If Chinese and Japanese economic people can trust each other and unite strongly, no matter how difficult the future is, it can be solved easily. If so, the construction of the East Asia Economic Co-prosperity Sphere will be successful, and the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia can also enjoy peace and live happily, and at the same time, a brilliant new world order can be completed at this time. Furthermore, how can economic people in both countries sincerely trust each other? Of course, it is from using an equal attitude, mutually understanding each other's position, respecting personality, and starting with frank discussions. The purpose of our visit to your country this time is nothing more than the above-mentioned points. We are able to meet with authoritative people in the economic circles of your country and express our sincere congratulations to your country for breaking away from the shackles of Britain and the United States for a hundred years due to the recovery of concessions, and for the bright China. We also have the privilege of listening to various frank opinions, hoping to strengthen the foundation of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Therefore, we in Shanghai hope to exchange views with all parties as much as time permits. We are very grateful for the grand banquet tonight. Now, I would like to borrow the host's wine to wish the National Commercial Control Association development."

### Restaurants and Hotels Without Rice Allocation Permits Not Allowed to Serve Meals

The Public Works Department recently issued a notice stating that from the 9th of this month, all restaurants and hotels that have not obtained a rice allocation permit from the Public Works Department to serve customers are strictly prohibited from selling meals to customers in any way. Violators will be severely punished.

### Opportunity for Rehabilitation Given to Arrested Grain Merchants; 200,000 Stones of Joint Venture Rice Soon to Arrive in Shanghai

On the 5th, the authorities learned that a large number of "rice bugs" were gathering at the Deyi Building in the City God Temple in Nanjing, engaging in illegal trading. They were immediately arrested, numbering more than 100. Except for a small number who were released on the spot, the rest were detained for investigation. They were still trying to justify their actions and escape punishment. After the authorities examined their identities one by one, they proved to be grain merchants and were given severe punishment. Now, the authorities are giving them an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, so they have all been released yesterday. According to a Shanghai News reporter, more than 30 staff members sent by the Rice and Grain Joint Venture to rice-producing areas such as Suzhou, Wujiang, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Changshu, Huzhou, and Yangzhou a week ago are contacting the authorities in these areas day and night to negotiate purchases. About 200,000 stones from Suzhou, Yangzhou, Huzhou, and other places are already on the way to Shanghai and should arrive in the market in the coming days.

### Eight Oil Mills Have Started Production

Since the wholesale office of the edible oil industry implemented average allocation, various parties have been expecting an increase in supply. It is now heard that the oil mills in this port are stepping up efforts to increase production in order to promote smooth supply. In addition to undertaking the oil raw materials of the military allocation group, they are also directly purchasing oil raw materials from various production areas. Currently, the companies that have started production include Yoshida, Manyu, Nikka Coating, Kawaminami Oil & Fat, Lisheng, and Taishan, totaling eight. There are also Dayouyu and Dadexin on the Chinese merchant side, which are also preparing to start production once the raw materials arrive in sufficient quantities.

### 10,000 Tons of Coal Bricks to Be Shipped to Shanghai from Production Areas; Fuel Market Situation Gradually Stabilizing

The fuel market situation in this city has gradually improved, and residents can purchase the fuel they need daily in the vicinity. According to coal industry news yesterday, a large number of coal bricks will be shipped from the production area to this area in the coming week, with a quantity of about 10,000 tons. At that time, the number of spot chips in the market will inevitably increase sharply, and the bottom line is expected to gradually increase. Therefore, there is no shortage of fuel supply in this city.

### Ningbo Ship Begins Service on Shanghai-Ningbo Route

Although there are Xin Ningshao, Changshan, Wanji, and Hualin ships sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo, due to the large number of passengers and the crowding of passengers and cargo, tickets are still in short supply. The Dongya Shipping Company has specifically requested the authorities to stop the Changshan and use the "Ningbo" ship that sails on the Shanghai-Hankou route. It is now known that the Changshan ship will stop sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo after sailing to Ningbo on the 9th, and the "Ningbo" ship is scheduled to begin its first voyage on the 20th. Ticket sales will begin tomorrow, and the ticket price will be the same as Xin Ningshao, and the ticket purchase method and procedures will also be handled as before.

### Ancient Tomb from the Ming Dynasty Discovered at the South End of Xietu Road; Whether the Tomb Owner Gu Xinquan, Whose Family Was Poor and Unable to Make a Living, Was a Descendant of Gu Dingchen Is Still Difficult to Ascertain

It was rumored the day before yesterday that someone had discovered an ancient tomb from the Ming Dynasty behind the Xieji Rope Factory in Nanfu Xinli, south of Xietu Road in Dapuqiao, Nanshi. It was said to be the burial place of Gu Dingchen of Kunshan, a high-ranking official of the Ming Dynasty, and his wife and two concubines. There were countless funerary objects in the coffin, such as gold and silver ornaments, jade jewelry, diamonds, and antique treasures. When the coffin was opened, the deceased's appearance was unchanged. The male corpse wore a gauze hat and python robe, and the female corpse wore a phoenix coronet and robes, with a face as white as jade. After being exposed to the air, it immediately turned black and decayed. The coffin was made of ebony, about a foot thick, and the tomb was very strong. It took the grave robbers two weeks to dig it open. The outside was made of bricks and stones, and the outline was also very strong. When the lid was opened, a stone tablet was revealed, but the words were blurred and unclear. Only the numbers "built in the second year of Hongwu" were slightly clear. It was also heard that the head of the male corpse was fitted with a gold helmet (one said that the corpse was a first-rank official in the court before his death, and was beheaded for a crime, so his children and grandchildren fitted it with a gold helmet and buried it. His wife and concubines all died for him and were buried in the same place.) As a result, rumors spread everywhere in the Xietu Bridge area, with everyone saying something different.

After rushing to the site for inspection, we arrived at the destination and saw a tomb that had been excavated, with four holes in the middle. The holes were full of purple sewage, and the spectators were packed like sardines. The four coffins that had been dug out were temporarily buried in an open space about forty or fifty steps east of the original site. There were also six holes excavated at the east end of the tomb, and it was heard that those buried there were servants of the Gu family. After conducting a detailed investigation, we learned that the tomb owner was Gu Xinquan, 70 years old this year, from Kunshan, No. 29 Caodang Street, Jialiyuan Road South. Recently, due to poverty, the buyer ordered him to relocate the tomb within a time limit, so Gu hired workers to excavate it. According to him, the person buried in the tomb was nine generations away from him, and he only knew that it was a female champion in the Ming Dynasty. The clothes worn by the corpse were a phoenix coronet and robes, and the complexion did not change. The land price was 16,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan was divided equally among the five families, with each family receiving 2,000 yuan. 6,000 yuan was intended to be used for relocating the coffin. The police bureau believed that it should be investigated whether Gu Xinquan had the right to excavate this tomb, and Gu Xinquan has been detained and sent to the court for decision.

### Propaganda Office Recovers Concessions; Propaganda to Be Expanded Within Days; People in Hongkou Hope the French Concession Will Be Accepted at the Same Time

The Propaganda Office of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government has already started working, and has an entire plan for expanding propaganda on the recovery of concessions, and has decided to implement it within days. Furthermore, the Hongkou District Party Department, in gratitude for the perseverance of friendly Japan, which scheduled the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, specifically convened a meeting of the executive committees of various branches on the 7th of this month and solicited the opinions of the people in the entire Hongkou District. According to the reports of the executive committees of various branches, millions of people in Hongkou deeply hope that the government will follow the teachings of the National Father and quickly formulate a plan to recover the French Concession on August 1st. Millions of people in Hongkou will provide support. After receiving the report, the Hongkou District Party Department specifically requested the Municipal Party Department to forward it to the Central Government.

It is said that Feng visited Beijing a few days ago to ask for instructions and returned to Shanghai, and then proceeded to close the office. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited him, and he announced the following remarks: "The Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department was ordered to close. From now on, the propaganda activities in Shanghai will be handled by the Propaganda Office established by the municipal government. I recall that I came to Shanghai at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War and ended at the time when the concessions were decided to be returned. During this period, I was very happy to be able to participate in the work of this sacred and great era for more than a year, and I am especially grateful for the assistance of the authorities of friendly countries, the cooperation of people in the press and cultural circles, and the cooperation of people from all walks of life, which enabled me to complete my tasks.

Since the start of receiving registration forms for the primary school group for the fifth Shen Bao Scholarship, nearly 1,000 students have registered in just three or four days.

The Number of Applicants is Close to 10,000

The purpose of this newspaper's scholarship program is to reduce the suffering of poor and outstanding students who are unable to attend school. It has been warmly supported by readers in previous sessions. At the beginning of the launch of this street, it coincided with a period of extremely high living standards. Ordinary families still find it difficult to cope with daily expenses. Not to mention the cost of children's education. This newspaper's scholarship movement is what poor children are looking forward to, so the number of young people applying for scholarships is close to 10,000. Although we have the idea of universal relief, the amount of donations has not yet been as desired. We hope that people from all walks of life will cherish the idea of nurturing talents and quickly donate generously so that this scholarship program can achieve satisfactory results. It is also the luck of society.

The Enthusiasm of All Circles for Generous Assistance Is Appreciable

### This Newspaper Hosts Charity Art and Calligraphy Exhibition - Registered with the Authorities - Shen Bao Cup Fundraising Ends

For the sake of the disaster victims in North China, this newspaper previously appealed to all sectors for fundraising and disaster relief, collecting funds and savings certificates totaling 861,327.70 yuan, plus 1,000 yuan in United China Certificates, which were deposited with the T'ung-Jun Bank and received as receipts, as previously reported. This time, in conjunction with the YMCA, we co-organized the Shen Bao Cup Basketball Tournament for emergency disaster relief in North China, and we are grateful for the enthusiastic contributions from all sectors and industries. We are deeply touched. The fundraising for the basketball tournament has now concluded as of yesterday. The donations received, up to the day before yesterday, have been half-sent to the T'ung-Jun Bank, and the remaining amount will be sent together after yesterday's receipts are collected. A comprehensive compilation and publication will be made to ensure transparency.

This newspaper's North China emergency disaster relief charity art and calligraphy exhibition has received generous donations of treasured collections from all sectors. Over the past month, we have received more than 600 pieces of calligraphy, paintings, fans, oil paintings, and pastel drawings, and we have invited Mr. Wu Hufan, Liu Haisu, Zhao Shuru, Zheng Wuchang, Wang Jimei, Ding Huikang, and other gentlemen to review them. We have registered with the Police Headquarters and originally intended to hold the exhibition earlier to meet the expectations of all parties, but we have been delayed due to the difficulty in finding a venue. We feel deeply ashamed. It is now scheduled to be held from the 12th to the 18th of this month, at the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association on the 4th floor of the Xingya Building at No. 12 Bund, with public charity sales. Admission is free, and all sectors are welcome to visit and participate. We would be extremely grateful.

### Consumer Cooperative Society to Distribute Goods

The "Shanghai Citizens Consumer Cooperative Society," initiated and organized by the city's industrial and commercial leaders, is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on Saturday, the 17th of this month. However, the society's future method of distributing goods may not be based on district distribution, as this method may cause trouble for each member. It is currently under research, and it is planned that suppliers will directly deliver goods to the society's members. However, whether this method will be officially implemented is still to be decided. As for the society's current distribution of goods, it will be temporarily limited to essential items, such as rice, flour products, cigarettes, matches, candles, soap, coal and briquettes, sugar, soy sauce, cooking oil, salt, silk and cotton products, tea, firewood, meat, vegetables, eggs, fresh fish, preserved meats, leather shoes, knitwear, stationery, and paper. In the future, the market price will be lower than that sold on the market. Once these goods are distributed, they are strictly limited to personal use, and resale for profit is strictly prohibited. If such a situation occurs, membership will be revoked, and no further goods will be supplied.

### Special Alert in This City to be Lifted This Midnight

The various police authorities in this city have been implementing special alerts since the 4th of this month, for a period of five or six days. Today (the 9th) is the last day. During this alert period, the police have also taken special alert measures, increasing the number of guards and maintaining watch all night, and have also implemented district lockdowns. It is reported that if there are no special incidents today, these measures will be lifted at midnight.

### Business Association Promotes Unified Purchase of Wheat

The unified wheat purchase plan previously set by the Business Association has now entered the implementation stage. The wheat purchase and transportation work in various regions is being actively carried out. In addition to sending letters to the food bureaus of various provinces and cities to assist in the implementation, three measures have been stipulated for the movement of wheat: Those moving into Shanghai must have a permit issued by the association. Those moving within the jurisdiction must have an invoice from a member firm of the local chamber of commerce. Those moving within the territory of the three provinces and two cities (excluding Shanghai) should have a certificate from the industry association and the local office of the association's flour and wheat professional committee, and a permit issued by the food bureau of each province and city. If it is a Japanese merchant, the permit will be transferred from the consulate. Furthermore, regarding the funds needed by the association to purchase wheat, repeated discussions have been held with various banks, and it is reported that a syndicate for wheat purchase loans has been organized and a loan contract has been signed. These funds can be used, and it is expected that the wheat purchase work this year will have satisfactory results.

### Procedures for Applying to Move Flour Sacks

The number of flour sacks used each year is very large. For the sake of prudence, the Business Association has strictly stipulated the following procedures for applying to move them: Flour sacks, regardless of whether they are new or old, must be printed with trademarks and the names of companies and firms, and must be sewn completely. If they are new bags, a purchase invoice must be provided, indicating the date of purchase and the factory that produced them, as a basis for verification. Flour sacks, in addition to being certified by the Silk Industry United Association and the Flour Industry United Association, must also be sent to the Cotton Products Industry United Association for careful inspection and certification. The procedures for moving other industrial fabrics are also handled in accordance with this principle.

### Measures for Moving Edible Oil

Regarding the movement of edible oil and various oils in and out, according to the regulations of the Business Association, certificates are issued temporarily limited to edible oil. All edible oil moved from the three provinces and two cities to North China and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River must be certified by the Edible Oil Industry United Association of each region to ensure that the applicant is a member firm before an acknowledgment letter can be issued.

### Authorities Thoroughly Investigate Speculation, and the Black Market Calms Down

Recently, some speculative merchants have been spreading rumors and acting wildly, causing prices to soar and severely affecting people's livelihoods. Since the authorities have strictly investigated and banned them, things have calmed down slightly. The heat of cash transactions has become particularly intense, and illegal money houses, banks, and speculative merchants are all engaged in speculative trading, resulting in a rampant cash black market. In order to actively stabilize the financial situation and thoroughly eliminate cash speculation, the authorities have sent personnel from the Municipal Council's Materials Control Bureau to inspect the account books of illegal banks and money houses to thoroughly investigate the truth about speculation. It is reported that the account books of several illegal banks and money houses have been taken away for verification to facilitate investigation, and secret personnel have been dispatched to investigate. Therefore, yesterday, the cash black market has calmed down, and the financial situation is expected to become more stable day by day.

According to a letter from the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association yesterday: Regarding the news in your newspaper yesterday about "the authorities cracking down on disguised handling fees," it is inconsistent with the facts. The cash black market was not created by our industry, but is entirely manipulated by general speculators, who engage in speculative transactions with each other. However, in order to maintain our capital and the livelihood of our employees, we have submitted a request to the authorities to increase handling fees to subsidize our operations. Our industry also hopes for this. Therefore, we have specially prepared a letter to make corrections.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks plummeted and then suddenly soared, making rapid progress. Gold and yarn and other industries also stalled. Funds are flowing in. Department stores are the most concentrated target of new and old investors. The New-New Company soared after seeing low prices, and its increase was greater than that of Wing On. National products had little trading. Underwear was squeezed. King Lun shirts and jackets rose again. The trading price of King Fook was the same as the previous day. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile had a difference of 50 points on the day, but it finally rose after being squeezed. Small denominations of Da Guangming, Xinhe, Xinfeng, Guoguang, Guoxin, Da Zhonghua, Meilun, etc. were all favored by investors. Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories were reaffirmed to be firm. Rongfeng Textile rose the most sharply. The new pharmaceutical industry also saw prosperity. Zhongfa returned from outside Guanwai, and Xinya rose significantly. Wuzhou, Zhongxi, and Xinyi all presented a stable situation, but trading was scarce, and it was temporarily forced by sellers. The cultural industry was relatively flat. The Commercial Press and the World Book Company both saw declines. Zhonghua still stood at the original price. Nanyang Tobacco Company was stable and firm. Da Zhonghua Match rose sharply. Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric returned to the same level as the previous day after falling. Jiuan Industrial, Da Zhonghua Industrial, Tongyixin Trust, Defeng Knitting, Zhongxing Wood, Xinya Construction, and Huafeng Enamel were all in greater demand than supply, and the market was very firm.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Cotton Yarn: The market was sluggish, and almost no yarn was traded, forming a situation of having a market but no trading. The price of 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix remained unchanged. The 32-count double-strand Fairy Peach was slightly higher. The 32-count double-horse bank order and the 20-count red double-horse were slightly lower.

Daily Necessities: Today's rise came too quickly, causing sellers to suffer more losses than profits, so they maintained a wait-and-see attitude. Solid Soap was slightly lower. Scissors Bai Xiangmao remained the same. Yang Candle Bai Lishi was firm. Monk Hat was slightly lower. Miscellaneous brands were unchanged. The cigarette market continued to rise because the customer gang still had Nawei, and the price continued to rise. British American Tobacco has exceeded the barrier.

### Return of Concessions and Shanghai's Economic Problems - Eradicating Political Speculation and Economic Speculation

It is still unknown what attitude the Chongqing side and the CCP have expressed regarding the return of the concessions. However, according to reliable sources, the CCP's opinion on this is as follows:

We have always been able to make correct estimates of Japan's military power, political power, and the political power of the Nanjing government. Perhaps only we can make correct estimates of Japan's return of the concessions. Some people think that the return of the concessions is the beginning of Japan's defeat in China, because Japan must advance to Australia, the Soviet Union, and India. Therefore, the return of the concessions can be regarded as a symbol of Japan's defeat in China. We strongly oppose this view. We know that Japan will continue to strengthen the Nanjing government in terms of politics and economy on the Chinese front. The political power of the Nanjing government cannot be ignored. The Chinese citizens of Shanghai are more concerned about the international political situation than the domestic situation. They believe that Japan will be defeated immediately, or that the Nanjing government has no power over the people in this international situation. In short, they are happy and worried because of the international situation. They look on coldly yesterday, cooperate today, and rebel again tomorrow, adopting a political speculative attitude. However, we absolutely do not adopt this political speculative attitude in our work. It should be known that the war of resistance may drag on for twenty or thirty years. We should correctly estimate the enemy's strength, and we must not be happy and worried because of the changes in the international political situation. We must rely on our own strength to build an unbreakable anti-Japanese base. This is our basic attitude towards Japan and the Nanjing government.

The above paragraph is the attitude of the CCP, and what it criticizes is political speculation and economic speculation, which absolutely should be noted. Economic speculation has been experienced by both China and Japan for several months, but after the return of the concessions, if political speculation does not disappear, its impact on Shanghai's economy will be significant. What kind of countermeasures will the National Government take in the future to ensure the sound development of Shanghai's politics and economy is extremely noteworthy. When Chairman Wang attended the Suzhou Clearing the Countryside Work Commemoration Meeting, he expressed his determination to eliminate speculative thinking in Shanghai on the way. To eliminate speculative thinking, it is necessary to establish clean politics and eliminate corrupt officials in order to achieve great results.

### Eagerness to Learn is Akin to Wisdom

— Sorokin

Wisdom is genius. Genius is a talent bestowed at birth, expressed through the inducement of the environment. However, it is very unfortunate that there are often many people in the world who, due to unfavorable environments, cannot express their innate talents and are therefore frustrated throughout their lives.

Humans – are the masters of the world, so we must not allow our lives to be dominated by the environment. We should strive to carve out a new path in an unfavorable environment.

Romain Rolland once said: "Genius cannot avoid obstacles, because obstacles create genius." Eagerness to learn is the only way to eliminate obstacles and is also the greatest reason for achieving success.

As the saying goes: "Our achievements are the result of our blood and sweat." Regardless of whether we lack innate talents, we should always make use of our untapped acquired resources - eagerness to learn, because Edison once said: "Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration." In other words, genius is created by effort, so as long as we work hard, we are geniuses.

### National Music Art in Our Country

— Pan Yangyao

Music can cultivate emotions and transform customs, and its use is extensive and its effect is profound. Since the Eastern expansion of European culture, many scholars have been fascinated by Western music, and have largely neglected national music, which is related to the quintessence of the country, to the point of almost disappearing. It is worrisome to seek in the wild what is lost in ceremony. Professor Wei Zhongle, an expert in national music, is an authority in the field of national music in our country. Mr. Wei has had an artistic talent since childhood. In his youth, he studied ancient music with Mr. Zheng Jinwen, a senior in national music, for more than ten years. His understanding is rich and his attainments are deeper. He has reached the state of perfection in pipa, guqin, and other instruments. He has served as a music professor at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, Hujiang University, and the music director of the Datong Music Society, cultivating talents and earning a reputation in all walks of life. He has traveled to Nanjing, Hunan, Hubei, and Hong Kong to hold solo concerts. Each time he went, he was welcomed by all walks of life, and he always returned with great praise. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, refugees came to this area, and their clothing and food were worrying. Mr. Wei organized a music team to perform in the United States, and all the income was used to relieve refugees. He traveled to major cities in the United States and held more than one hundred concerts. The audience was enthusiastic and welcomed him. The New York Times commented that Mr. Wei's acting skills were comparable to those of the world-famous violinist Kreisler. Major radio stations in the United States competed to recruit him. Mr. Wei broadcast national music. Mr. Wei can be regarded as the pioneer in winning praise from European and American people with national music. Now, North China is suffering from famine and starvation is rampant. The Boy's Department of the Chinese Christian Youth Association, the Qing Tuan Qi, and the alumni association of Aurora High School are deeply concerned about this. They held a music conference, and all the proceeds were used for disaster relief funds for the victims of North China. Their enthusiasm is commendable. The gentlemen of Aurora and the Joint Medical University discussed with Mr. Wei and invited him to co-organize a performance of national music to fulfill the desire of Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai to enjoy Mr. Wei's art. This move will not only greatly benefit the disaster victims in North China, but also has great significance in promoting and popularizing national music.

### Review of "The Elopement"

— Lu Guang

"The Elopement" is the debut work of Yan Huizhu. As a Peking Opera actor, she retained some of the qualities of Peking Opera in her acting. In the past, Wang Xichun's speech on the screen was completely "Peking Opera-ized," which was a clear example. Yan Huizhu is certainly no exception. "The Elopement" reveals Peking Opera-ization everywhere. Therefore, the excessive acting skills give the audience a novel feeling.

"The Elopement" tells the story of a brave woman who fights for marriage, goes through many tortuous joys and sorrows, and achieves the result of lovers finally getting married. The story has a sense of reality. In this era of great collision of new and old ideas, such stories often occur around us.

Because the story is tortuous, if Zheng Xiaoqiu handles it with a purely comedic directing technique, I believe there will be greater success. Now, under extremely economical editing, the story is explained clearly. The location is shot at the Thin West Lake in Yangzhou. The natural scenery and beautiful pictures are active in the eyes, as if visiting a painting exhibition.

The actors are best with Yan Huizhu. Every move imitates Chen Yunshang's liveliness and innocence, but the voice wave has a Beijing accent, and the pitch of the voice does not seem to express the flow of emotions. Shu Shi is solemn and humorous, and is the most recent performance. Ouyang Shafei is also a very promising actor, with natural expressions and unlimited potential. Jia Ziqiu still needs to work hard, and Yue Wei is old and lacking.

In short, Yan Huizhu's cameo appearance has not disappointed the audience in general. If she can make one or two more films, perhaps her acting skills will be further developed.

### Arriving Home

— Yang Shugang

Ten miles from home, the mountains and rivers are getting closer, the journey is still in the box, the clothes suddenly feel new. The original scenery has not changed, the gentleman has fallen mostly because of Chen. Welcoming and asking the elders, the eyes of the young people are confused. Shouts of joy move across the wall, and meetings show sincerity. The neighbor spreads the news, and the four neighbors stop my wheels. The sister-in-law says to prepare food, and the mother releases me from the middle. The crowd gathers from all sides, and the courtyard is in chaos for a while. I am ashamed of my depression on this trip. I have not yet comforted my relatives. But I said that I am well, and the wanderer has many hardships.

### Chicken

— Shen Shen

The three of them stared at each other for a long while. Finally, Village Chief Li spoke first, saying:

"Then how exactly should we resolve this? To be honest with you! He—" pointing at A-Kun in the corner of the room, "is an extremely poor person. You've taken it out on the wrong person. We spent the whole evening running around for him, and we had to mortgage his only small plot of land to get some money. The amount is of course not much, but in our opinion, it was already very difficult. Just now, listening to the Commander's tone, it seems he wants to give him a heavy beating, which is absolutely impossible. Even if you beat him to death, you can only say it was his destiny." Village Chief Li finished speaking in one breath, staring intently at Staff Officer Zhang with fiery eyes.

"This whole thing was stirred up by that little cook. Because the Commander wanted to eat something special, but the kitchen didn't have it ready, he sent this kid to the countryside to figure something out. Who knew that the fool went for half a day, then ran back crying, saying that there were chickens, but the people wouldn't let go, and he was even scolded and slapped twice. He exaggerated it a lot. Then the cook ran to the Commander and also exaggerated the story. This enraged the Commander, who immediately sent some brothers to bring this person back with the little cook. Although I clearly knew they were making trouble, what could I do to stop them? Now that things have turned from false to true, we have no choice but to play along. Village Chief Li! Don't get angry. How much money did you actually manage to get? I think it's best to settle this." Staff Officer Zhang seemed impatient and also quite indignant, finally getting to the main point.

"How much money? Only six hundred yuan. It took both of us persuading Old Man Huang on the east side of the river." Village Chief Li was already experienced in worldly affairs and knew that the more people on the team, the the better, so he understated the amount by two hundred yuan, leaving room for further demands. Staff Officer Zhang listened, revealing a bitter smile, and said:

"That's awkward! This amount has never happened before. The Commander will definitely not be satisfied. Even if I go to plead, I'm afraid I'll get scolded too. What should we do!" After speaking, he lowered his head, glancing sideways at A-Kun tied up in the corner of the room.

At this time, although A-Kun couldn't hear clearly what the three people were talking about, he vaguely understood something, likely about what would happen to him. He was also very tired and didn't bother to raise his head and worry. Although he was just a villager and had never experienced complicated worldly affairs, in his mind, he was thinking, just because I couldn't get a chicken for free, does that mean you can eat me? However, the fact was that he was already tied up, like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered, unable to move. (7)

### Contribution to the Cleanliness Campaign

— Hongxiang

Mosquitoes are vectors for transmitting malaria. Anyone with a little bit of hygiene knowledge knows that they must do everything in their power to eliminate them. In Chinese society, people who have mosquitoes are looked down upon. However, the main camp of mosquitoes—beggars—not only do not fulfill their obligation to exterminate them, but also throw them around everywhere on the streets, in the alleys, and under the sun, doing their best to spread them. Passersby who are not careful are harmed. Those who are harmed not only suffer damage to their health, but also lose face, especially children, because they don't know how to avoid them. As this cleanliness campaign is being expanded, I hope that the authorities will take measures to thoroughly eliminate this matter, which not only damages the health of citizens but also affects the appearance of the city, so as to enhance the true meaning of the cleanliness campaign and protect the welfare of citizens.

The privately-run Securities Industry Elementary School has recently established a scholarship program for poor students with free and half-price options: (1) The quota is ten male and female students per grade, from the first to sixth autumn semester. (2) Free: Tuition is completely waived for students from poor families who achieve a score of 85 or higher on the school's entrance exam. (3) Half-Price: Half of the tuition fee is waived for students from poor families who pass the school's entrance exam. (4) School address: 16 East Wangjia Sha Garden, Carter Road, Avenue Road. Telephone number: 31420.

The Wulun Middle School at 597 Chengdu Road has received a donation from the Xiong Chongshan Hall for five full-tuition scholarships for junior high school. The exam will be held at 9:00 AM on July 19th. Register as soon as possible.

Mr. Ma Shoubai established the Pei Cai Scholarship to specifically support poor middle school students. Now that the autumn semester is approaching, Mr. Ma will continue to provide assistance to existing middle school students, except for temporarily suspending assistance to new students. Correspondence address: Tongchang Jewelry Store, 465 Foch Road.

The Jingcheng Elementary School in Sicang Li, Zhaojiabang Road, Sicang Road, Nanshi, will offer one hundred free and half-price spots in the next semester. Children of excellent character and scholarship from poor families are welcome to apply for admission (except for first grade). Regulations are available upon request.

### The Old People's Association Seeks Comrades

— Zhu Juefo

Why is it that ancient cypress and pine trees that have stood for thousands of years, enduring snow and storms, superior to beams and pillars, are not as good as peach and plum trees that have grown into forests in only three to five years? I know the reason, it's not that they are not as good, it's that they don't do anything. Otherwise, how could Jiang Taigong enter the service of King Wen of Zhou at the age of seventy, establish a world-renowned accomplishment, and create an immortal career? Isn't he an old man? If they do something, then today's elders, aren't they the Jiang Taigong of the past? Alas, old but vigorous, my comrades, there are still those who are heroes. Even without a King Wen, reading these few words, you can still be inspired. (Association address: temporarily located within the Confucius Society on Avenue Edward.) (Note: Mr. Zhu Juefo is skilled in painting plum blossoms and orchids, as well as calligraphy. Anyone who wishes to obtain Mr. Zhu's calligraphy, regardless of the piece, please make a donation as you wish. All proceeds will be donated to this newspaper to help the poor and elderly in need.)
