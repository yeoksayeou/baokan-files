### The Third Year of the Eastern Front and the "Western Front" Problem

The unprecedented large-scale Eastern Front war—the German-Soviet War—has entered its third year. As the Japanese Asahi Shimbun pointed out in its editorial on June 24th, the biggest lesson from the German-Soviet War is that it refuted the fallacy of the so-called "short-term war" between Germany and the Soviet Union, advocated by some strategists at the beginning of the war, and fully exposed the character of a long-term war. Therefore, to judge the situation and prospects of the German-Soviet War, we must stand on this serious fact to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions.

The Eastern Front entering its third year of operations, precisely after more than three months of unexpected silence, what does this signify? Generally speaking, in the past two years, the timing of the seasons has had a significant impact on the Eastern Front. After each spring, the German army would begin large-scale offensive warfare, and when the severe cold season began, it would give the Soviet Union an opportunity to counterattack. However, today, when spring has passed and summer has begun—the very time when the German army should be launching a major offensive—why is the war on the Eastern Front still only manifested in localized battles in the Kuban region and Kursk, Orel, and other places, and the active air force offensive and defensive battles, without seeing the German army launch a major offensive? Does this mean that the German army is not preparing or unable to launch such a major offensive this summer? We want to point out that these issues must be observed from a comprehensive perspective by the most serious and accurate observers. First of all, can we ask such a question: When the German army has not launched a major offensive, why doesn't the Soviet Union seize the initiative and take further counteroffensives against the German army? We must first answer this question before we can proceed to estimate the trend of Germany's offensive and the development of the entire war situation.

The Soviet Union's inability to seize the initiative and develop a counteroffensive in the summer is not a question of whether they want to, but whether they can. First of all, in the past two years, the Soviet army's losses have been alarmingly heavy. According to German reports, the Soviet side's manpower losses (including seriously wounded prisoners) are no less than 20 million. And according to the Soviet side's own admission, "deaths and disappearances" also amounted to 4.2 million, and they also lost 35,000 artillery pieces of various calibers, 30,000 tanks, and 22,000 aircraft. These figures have certainly been greatly discounted in reality, but they can also be said to be "heavy losses." Therefore, the Soviet Union has encountered major difficulties in terms of human resources, economic productivity, and general economic productivity. Therefore, launching a major counteroffensive following the winter is absolutely not an easy task, except in idle talk on paper. The result may completely shake its national foundation. Can the Soviet Union do this? Ultimately, no matter how beautiful the speeches and telegrams of Roosevelt and Churchill are, no matter how the expectations and subjective demands of Britain and the United States are, the "Second Front," that is, the "Western Front," has not been realized. Here, the main reason is not so much the seriousness of the political contradictions between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, but rather the difficulties of Britain and the United States themselves. Within Britain and the United States, there is a domestic front. In Britain, there are contradictions between the Conservative Party and the various left-wing parties, as well as the Labour Party and the Communist Party. In the United States, the American Federation of Labor is no different from an enemy country within the United States. The recent waves of coal mine strikes have directly hindered and damaged American military industrial production, and even constrained the anti-Axis powers' strategic actions to open a Western Front. In addition, the black issue and the issues of various countries in Central and South America are becoming as active as the Indian revolutionary movement in the East at this critical moment, when Britain and the United States are attempting to attack Europe, and they are settling accounts with the United States and Britain. Therefore, the so-called Second Front is still just a slogan. However, this fact is the heaviest blow to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Information Bureau itself stated on the second anniversary of the war: "Letting go of the favorable opportunity to open a Second Front in Europe in 1943 and delaying this action will seriously damage our common cause. Delaying the opening of a Second Front in Europe will prolong the war, which will greatly increase the sacrifice." The above two points can fully explain why the Soviet Union cannot launch a counteroffensive.

The Soviet Union cannot counterattack, and at the same time, the "Western Front" will not appear all of a sudden. Does this mean that Germany can develop an offensive? As long as it is not just a superficial observation, there will never be this conclusion. Because, first, as the Japanese Asahi Shimbun pointed out on June 24th, although the Soviet Union has encountered difficulties in terms of human resources, military industrial production, and general economic strength, it has been working hard to reorganize its production capacity due to the advantage of its vast territory. It can be seen that the Soviet Union's combat effectiveness and its strong political power are still not to be underestimated. Second, although the "Western Front" may not be opened or developed for a while, the main reason is the obstruction of domestic problems in Britain and the United States. Recently, the appointment of Wavell as the Governor-General of India by Britain, as well as the publicity of cabinet reshuffles, the continued active movement of the merger of the Communist Party and the Labour Party, and the work on the labor front in the United States, although they will not have any important gains, it can also be seen that Britain and the United States are preparing for the domestic front. Therefore, the possibility of Britain and the United States taking risks still exists. If Germany acts rashly at this time, it is difficult to say what its future position will be in the long-term war. Therefore, Germany's cautious attitude towards the summer offensive is more like the silence of a lion. Mr. Moriyama, the Berlin correspondent of Asahi Shimbun, issued a dispatch on June 10th, specifically reporting the change in Germany's strategy for the war against the Soviet Union: "Seeking new solutions to the war against the Soviet Union from the two aspects of political power and military power." Mr. Moriyama especially pointed out that the German side is very concerned about and studying the countermeasures taken by Japan in the occupied territories in the South, and deeply admires Prime Minister Tojo's declaration of independence for the Philippines. He explained the evolution of Germany's strategic policy toward the Soviet Union: "In the first year, the main force of the Red Army's field army was annihilated; in the second year, the land resources of the Soviet Union were occupied; in the second year, its characteristic was the mobilization of political power." (Translation can be found on page 3 of the June 24th issue of this newspaper) This can be regarded as an important new policy adopted by Germany in response to the above facts.

The new strategy for the war against the Soviet Union, which combines political power and military power, does not naturally mean that Germany will not launch a major offensive on the Eastern Front, but only that it will launch a more powerful offensive based on a more cautious and foolproof plan, while also including strikes against the possible adventurous strategies of Britain and the United States. We firmly believe that Germany's current caution is precisely a factor in future victory. And the guarantee of this victory is the maintenance of Germany's rear productivity and general economic strength, and the advancement of military industrial production (see the June 23rd and 24th issues of this newspaper, "The Attitude of German Wartime Enterprises"). We can clearly say that the silence on the Eastern Front will not last too long, and the clamor on the Western Front will still be a futile clamor.

During the banquet, there was much toasting and the atmosphere was very harmonious. The guests and hosts parted happily at about 2 o'clock.

Minister Zhou Issues a Statement

Hankou, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) Minister of Finance of the National Government and President of the Central Reserve Bank Zhou Fohai, arrived in Hankou by plane from Nanjing at 12:20 noon on the 28th. After a brief rest, he visited the Japanese military and political authorities stationed in Hankou. In the afternoon, at 5 o'clock, he held a reception at the Wuhua Hotel for Wuhan Chinese and Japanese newspaper reporters and issued a statement. At 7 o'clock, he attended a banquet hosted by Governor Yang of the provincial government, with the directors of various departments and bureaus of the provincial government accompanying him. During the banquet, there was much toasting and the atmosphere was very harmonious. The guests and hosts parted happily at about 9 o'clock. The original text of the statement is recorded below: I came to Wuhan once in the 29th year of the Republic of China after the National Government returned to the capital. It has been three years since then. During these three years, I often wanted to come to Wuhan to inspect, but I was unable to spare the time due to busy matters. This time, I am very pleased to see the leaping progress in Wuhan's public security, politics, economy, and youth training. The assistance of the allied country, the efforts of the provincial and municipal government colleagues, and the support of the people are all achievements that cannot be ignored. It is a pleasure for me to have this opportunity to represent the Central Government to express my deep gratitude to the allied country and our country's officials and people. In particular, I cannot but express my gratitude for the great cooperation given by the allied country and the provincial and municipal authorities in the implementation of the Central Government's financial policy and monetary policy. Since China declared war on Britain and the United States, it has developed a relationship of sharing weal and woe with the allied country Japan, and has advanced to sharing life and death. Therefore, how our country should cooperate with the allied country, with the determination to die for a sure survival, is something that our country's officials and people should painstakingly ponder day and night to seek improvement. There are countless ways to cooperate, and we should make efforts in all aspects, but the most important thing is to strengthen the strength of finance and banking.

For three years, the National Government has been adhering to a sound financial policy, and the financial foundation has been established. At present, the government's expenditure has increased more than seven times compared to when it returned to the capital, but so far, it has not issued a single public bond, nor has it overdrawn a single penny from the Central Reserve Bank. The soundness of the finances can be seen from this. However, after China's participation in the war, there are many undertakings that must be carried out due to the war, such as expanding armaments, establishing public security, and developing industry. These undertakings all require funds. Therefore, the central task in the future is how to increase tax revenue to meet the needs of wartime finance and strengthen combat effectiveness. Regarding this point, the central government has studied a thorough plan to gradually implement it. The reorganization of Wuhan's national tax is also within this plan. After the National Government returned to the capital, I came to Wuhan once to organize the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Provisional Financial Reorganization Committee to meet the needs of the time. Thanks to the efforts of the committee and the assistance of the allied country, Wuhan's finances have been put on the right track. The mission that the Reorganization Committee should bear has been completed. Now, at the beginning of a new era, there must be a new institution to adapt to it. Therefore, the temporary organization of the Reorganization Committee will be terminated and changed to a normal Financial Special Envoy Office. In the future, how to increase tax revenue, how to equalize the burden on the people, and how to take both central and local finances into consideration, all depend on the planning and implementation of this office. I hope that the provincial and municipal officials and the authorities of the allied country will continue to cooperate with it so as to complete its mission and further strengthen the National Government's wartime financial policy.

The Central Reserve Bank has now become a national bank worthy of the name, and the Reserve Certificates it issues have also become the only currency in Central and Southern China. In the past, the promotion of Reserve Certificates has been deeply supported by the provincial and municipal officials and the authorities of the allied country. I hereby reiterate my gratitude. The task in the future is how to stabilize finance and achieve its sound development. The wartime financial policy has been detailed by the National Economic Commission and is being gradually implemented by us. The most important thing is to put finance on the right track, so that funds are invested in productive undertakings and not abused for speculation. For this purpose, the government has specially established a Financial Inspection Office to guide and supervise it. A branch office was established in Wuhan on the 20th. It is hoped that the establishment of this branch office will further promote the sound development of Wuhan's finance and the revitalization of Wuhan's industry.

### Vice President Zhou Advises the People of China and Japan to Briefly Express Their Views on the New Development of Sino-Japanese Relations

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of the National Government of China, recently briefly expressed his views on the new development of Sino-Japanese relations under the title of "Miscellaneous Observations on the Current Situation." The main points are recorded as follows: Since China declared war on Britain and the United States, the relationship between China and Japan has become closer, especially after Chairman Wang Jingwei expressed his determination to share life and death with Japan. Japan also responded by issuing a statement, actively preparing to abolish extraterritorial rights, return concessions, transfer economic control affairs to the Chinese side, and transfer some American and British enemy properties to our country for management. This time, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo also declared in parliament that he was preparing to revise the original treaties between China and Japan. Therefore, Japan's respect for China's independence and autonomy, and enabling China to obtain an equal and free position in the international arena, has been declared in reality. In the past, there were many Chinese people who doubted Japan's sincerity, but judging from the current state of affairs, they should absolutely trust the sincerity of the Japanese government. I have infinite respect for Prime Minister Tojo's great vision, thinking about the long-term plan for East Asia, and establishing a solid foundation. At this important time, the people of China and Japan must have an accurate understanding and give it support and trust. If they lack understanding, it will lead to unfortunate consequences. China must recognize that Japan's implementation of the new policy this time is completely out of spontaneous sincerity, and should not mistakenly believe that Japan has to implement the new policy because its overall war power is gradually weakening. As a result of Japan's acquisition of abundant resources in the South Seas, its combat power has been significantly enhanced compared to before. This time, with the progress of the development of the South Seas, Japan's combat power will become more and more substantial. The United States and Britain are trying to force Japan with a war of attrition, but the result is that they themselves are in a difficult situation. In the military aspect, relying solely on air guerrilla warfare will not be able to determine victory or defeat. It is difficult for the United States and Britain to provoke a decisive battle with Japan with ground troops. Not only can the American and British ground troops not invade the Japanese mainland, but it is also difficult to make a comeback in the Japanese-occupied territories. The gains and losses of only one or two small islands will not affect the victory or defeat. Japan has this kind of sure-win and undefeated attitude and determination, and is implementing a new policy toward China, which is full of sincerity in respecting China. If the Chinese people cannot recognize this fact and act arrogantly, it will inevitably arouse the resentment of the Japanese people. As a result, it will make it difficult for the Japanese government to implement the new policy, or even cause a reversal of the situation, and there is a risk of deterioration of the friendly relations between the two countries. Therefore, the Chinese people must be especially careful about this point. The Japanese people must also recognize that the implementation of the new policy this time aims to establish a permanent peace in East Asia, and is by no means trying to induce the Chongqing government to participate in the peace movement. The Japanese government's measures this time are completely out of sincerity and do not contain any strategic nature. I hope that the Japanese people can fully understand this fact. If the Japanese people believe that after the Japanese government implements the new policy, the Chongqing government will waver and return to the National Government, it can be said to be too ideal. If there are Japanese people who have this kind of hope, they will naturally first doubt the government's new policy, then feel disappointed, and even oppose the new policy. The Japanese people should follow the government's sincerity and determination, regardless of whether the Chongqing government participates in the peace movement or not, and thoroughly cooperate with the new policy. It would be great if the Chongqing government could realize this and participate in the peace movement, but if it cannot be realized, the new policy must continue to be promoted. We firmly believe that after Japan thoroughly implements the new policy toward China, the title and reason for the Chongqing government's resistance will completely disappear. Therefore, the Chongqing government's blind actions cannot last. Therefore, Japan's implementation of the new policy toward China will promote the Chongqing government to stop resisting. But it must be known that this is only one of the conditions included in several conditions, and it is by no means the only condition. To achieve comprehensive peace between China and Japan, several conditions must be overcome, such as the changes in the international situation. Japan's new policy toward China is the most important and fundamental of several conditions, but it cannot be regarded as the only condition. In other words, even if Japan implements the new policy toward China, it cannot be expected that the Chongqing government will immediately show wavering collapse and voluntarily request peace. However, it would be wrong to oppose the new policy and advocate its reversal because this kind of expectation cannot be realized. As the name suggests, the new policy is a policy rather than a strategy. Now is the time of historical transformation. If there is a mistake in understanding, it will lead to unfortunate consequences. Therefore, I would like to offer my loyal advice to the people of China and Japan.

### Nanjing Launches Short Hair Movement, Minister Lin Takes the Lead in Demonstrating, All Trainees in the Summer Training Camp Must Cut Their Hair Short

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) Summer has arrived, and hygiene is very important. The short hair movement under wartime conditions is gradually being launched by leaders at all levels. Lin Baisheng, Secretary-General of the New Citizens' Movement Association and Secretary-General of the China Youth Model Scope, took the lead in cutting his hair short. As a result, most of the staff of the various agencies affiliated to the New Citizens' Movement Association followed suit and automatically cut off their long hair. Those who still have it have no more than three centimeters. All the specialist members of the First Brigade of the Model Scope and many people from the press in this city have also appeared with bald heads. It seems that the atmosphere is developing and the short hair movement is becoming more and more popular.

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) The civil servants and the youth corps of the two camps of trainees in the summer training camp entered the camp on the 28th. The two camps had considerable planning in advance for the camp entry procedures and the reception staff, so the order was very good. The youth corps camp also produced a student handbook, which contains discussions on the New Movement, the government's published outline, and various New Movement training camp regulations and rules. The planned events for the 29th are: (1) individual talks, (2) physical examinations, (3) self-descriptions, and (4) movies.

(Also reported) The weekend training camp adopts strict principles for the management of trainees. In view of the necessity of summer hygiene and short hair movement during the wartime non-summer training, all staff, from the battalion commander downwards, took the lead in cutting their hair short, practicing the New Movement. The trainees are also limited to no more than three centimeters, and female trainees are cut to the ears. Once training begins, there will be no long hair, and the team can be seen to be energetic.

### New Citizens' Movement Association Glider Performs in Nanjing Yesterday

All the trainees and the people watching outside the airport applauded and praised the magical driving of Zhizuru, and were amazed. According to reports, Mr. Zhizuru is a first-class expert in Japanese gliding. It is expected that there will be a special and amazing performance at the presentation ceremony on the 29th. The performance time is 11 am, and the public in this city is welcome to visit.

### Ministry of Construction Plans to Undertake Two Major Water Conservancy Projects

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) In order to adapt to the wartime economic plan and actively promote urgent construction projects, the Ministry of Construction has prepared a three-year construction plan and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is reported that the plan focuses on the development of agricultural production and water conservancy, so as to achieve the goal of increasing production to enrich people's livelihood. Therefore, the two major water conservancy projects of opening up the Subei New Canal and dredging the East Taihu Lake in Jiangnan are listed first, and the relevant parties are planning to carry them out. The general outline of the project is as follows: (1) Opening the Subei New Canal: It is planned to open a new canal running from north to south in the area, supplemented by branch canals and dams, so as to form a perfect drainage and irrigation system, so that there is no worry about flooding and drought, and all of it can be reclaimed for cotton planting. In the three-year plan, it is planned to first open a section from Jiaoxie Town to Xinyang Port, which is 130 kilometers long and is called the first phase of the project. The estimated cost is 30 million yuan. After completion, the area benefited will reach 5 million mu. It has been decided to start from near Doulonggang in the first year, and partial benefits can be achieved in one and a half years. (2) The plan to dredge the East Taihu Lake in Jiangnan is mainly to open up the edges and dredge the downstream rivers, so as to permanently maintain the discharge capacity, and still leave a part as a prepared flood storage reservoir to increase the effective storage capacity. The reservoir is usually emptied for rice planting, and in flood years, it is opened for water storage. Because it was originally a beach, the storage capacity increases when it is opened. As for borrowing the lake for farming in peacetime to increase agricultural production, and returning the fields to the lake in flood years to accommodate flash floods, this is a way to take both into account. Because the above two items are profitable undertakings, although the funds required are huge, it is not difficult to hope that all parties will invest in them. The financial plan is being organized. As for the materials, in addition to the large number of water pumps required for dredging the East Taihu Lake, the remaining raw materials will not be a problem because the quantity required is not large. Also, the project is very large, but it has been decided to adopt the system of work according to labor. The price of labor will be paid on time. The promotion of these two major water conservancy projects will greatly increase agricultural production.

### Japan Divides Into Nine Regions to Strengthen Internal Political Power

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government, in order to cope with the new situation under the decisive battle, passed emergency decisive battle measures in the 82nd extraordinary session of the Diet. The purpose was to prepare enterprises to increase food production, and to prepare a winning posture within the country. This time, in order to smoothly implement these measures and further improve the domestic situation, it was decided to drastically reform the operation of internal affairs based on new concepts. Therefore, a special temporary cabinet meeting was convened at 2:00 p.m. on the 28th to formally approve its outline. After amending the county system and personnel matters, the Information Bureau announced the main points of the internal affairs reform passed this time, dividing Japan into nine regions: "Hokkaido," "Tohoku," "Kanto," "Hokuriku," "Tokai," "Kinki," "Chugoku," "Shikoku," and "Kyushu." The central officials of each region are authorized to direct the governors under their jurisdiction to be responsible for the comprehensive operation of the region's overall administration. Therefore, local administrative councils are added to the nine regions to quickly and fully implement the government's highest policy to the local areas, in order to smoothly promote production, distribution, transportation, port administration, and other matters related to enhancing combat effectiveness. At the same time, in order to use various complex local administrations, it is believed that close measures such as enterprise preparation and ensuring and increasing food production will be actively promoted and become more effective. So far, Japan has determined its solid foundation to adapt to the domestic decisive battle trend of the Greater East Asia Construction, and the internal and external decisive battle measures can be rapidly strengthened.

### Anti-Axis Convoy Near the Strait of Sicily Attacked, Twelve Giant Transport Ships Sunk or Destroyed, 30 Enemy Aircraft Attacking Sardinia Shot Down

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to the German military, the German Air Force attacked a large anti-Axis convoy in the sea off Bizerte and the Strait of Sicily on the 26th, sinking or destroying twelve merchant ships weighing 74,000 tons. In addition, two landing craft and one warship were destroyed. According to Major Frei Dack, a military reporter for the German News Agency, the details of the battle were: On the morning of the 26th, German Air Force reconnaissance aircraft discovered a large anti-Axis transport convoy off the north coast of Tunisia, escorted by many destroyers, coastal defense ships, and other warships. The German Air Force then sent several large formations of fighter-bombers to pursue the enemy in the waters north of Bizerte at noon and immediately began to attack. The enemy immediately retaliated with fierce anti-aircraft fire, but the German Air Force still bravely carried out low-altitude bombing, first destroying a 15,000-ton transport ship full of soldiers, rendering it unable to move. It then severely damaged a 10,000-ton cargo ship carrying aircraft, and hit two 5,000-ton merchant ships, and set fire to an 8,000-ton oil tanker. After nightfall, the German army repeatedly attacked the convoy with heavy bomber formations, dropping large bombs and hitting three cargo ships. One of them was witnessed exploding, and the other two were engulfed in flames. Another ship was tilted and about to sink. It is speculated that all three ships have sunk. In addition, the German Air Force concentrated on bombing another four enemy cargo ships, ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 tons. Each ship was hit by one bomb, and it is predicted that the repair period will take several months. Only two German aircraft participating in the battle did not return.

Rome, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a German news agency today, the German and Italian air forces jointly bombed the enemy's sailing team last week without interruption. Italian torpedo planes sank a total of eight enemy ships, of which seven totaled 74,000 tons. In addition, eight ships and one oil tanker were also destroyed. Three enemy warships and seven cargo ships were hit and damaged by German and Italian aircraft during the bombing of Bizerte and Pantelleria. The Italian heavy bomber formation air-attacked the west coast of Egypt, and the traffic lines near Fuka were interrupted. Important military targets in Syria and Palestine were also bombed. The transportation center of El Agheila and the airfield of Latakia were also attacked. On the other hand, fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns were very effective in resisting enemy air raids. Within seven days, the British and Americans lost 111 aircraft, 70 of which were shot down in air combat. When enemy aircraft recently bombed Naples, the damage rate reached 20%. Moreover, no less than 33 enemy aircraft were lost over Sardinia in one day.

Report that German troops are entering Italy to increase defenses

### Local Fierce Battles Occurred on the Eastern Front, Soviet Troops in Leningrad Attacked Without Success, Astrakhan Heavily Bombed by German Aircraft

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - Colonel Hamma, a military reporter for the German News Agency, said: On Saturday, battles of local importance occurred in several areas on the Eastern Front. In the Kupyansk bridgehead area, German mountain troops attacked the forward positions of the Soviet army and captured many Soviet soldiers. All the fortifications there were destroyed. On the northern flank of the central war machine, German grenadiers fought hard to repel the attacking Soviet troops several times and captured many Soviet soldiers. North of Leningrad, the Soviet army attacked the German positions with two regiments, but failed. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses.

Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency) - Although the land battle on the Eastern Front is still calm, the activity of the air force has become increasingly fierce. The two sides have repeatedly launched air battles in recent days. According to a German news agency, the German Air Force attacked Astrakhan, a Soviet heavy industrial city at the mouth of the Volga River, on the night of the 26th, dropping many bombs, all of which hit their targets, causing large oil depots and other places to catch fire. As for the German aircraft bombing the Soviet supply lines, it is still being carried out as planned. It is reported that on Saturday, German aircraft formations continued to bomb the Soviet supply lines and troop concentration points in the central and southern parts of the front line. Twenty Soviet aircraft were shot down by German aircraft in air combat, and three German aircraft did not return to their bases. In addition, German aircraft assisted the ground forces in attacking the Soviet army in the Kupyansk swamp area with great success. Eleven Soviet landing ships were sunk and another six were injured.

The German leader has ordered a party funeral to be held for him.

### Japanese Marshals

Marshal is the highest honor for a military man, and it is a title granted to a naval admiral listed in the Marshal's Mansion, and is the highest advisor on military affairs. Article 3 of the Marshal's Mansion Ordinance:

"To inspect the military on behalf of the Emperor."

Their status is like that of a veteran statesman, with no legal duties or regular meetings. They are purely veterans of the Japanese military.

The title of Marshal in the early Meiji period was a functional title, a first-class official above the rank of General. Saigo Takamori was appointed Marshal in July of the 5th year of Meiji. It became today's title bestowed upon Generals of outstanding achievement in the 19th of January of the 31st year of Meiji with the revision of the Marshal's Mansion Ordinance. In the 8th month of the 7th year of Taisho, a Marshal's sword and Marshal's ... ordinance were further added.

The Marshal's sword is made of gold, surrounded by purple leather cords with gold and silver threads, the hilt being five and a half inches long. The blade is two feet six inches long, in the "arrow sword style" granted to the Generalissimo of old, with a sharpened tip. To date, there are fourteen army officers and eleven navy officers listed in the Marshal's Mansion, including three members of the Imperial family. Admiral Yamamoto was granted the title of Marshal upon his death, which is the most recent instance. Kato Tomosaburo and Shimamura Hayao were also listed in the Marshal's Mansion while critically ill. The longest-serving Marshal was Saigo, serving for 22 years.

Today, there are only three Princes of the Imperial family with the rank of Marshal. That three Generals are listed in the Marshal's Mansion during wartime has deep significance.

Marshals before Yamamoto were Uehara and Takeshi Nishi-Yoshi. General Muto was granted the title of Marshal before his retirement to recognize his heavy responsibility as commander of the Kwantung Army. Marshal Muto passed away two months later.

Those granted the title of Marshal include:

Prince Komatsu-no-miya Akihito (Army General), Yamagata Aritomo (Army), Oyama Iwao (Army), Saigo Yorimichi (Navy General), Nozu Michitsura (Army), Ito Sukeyuki (Navy), Prince Arisugawa Takehito (Navy), Prince Kan'in (Army), Inoue Yoshika (Navy), Togo Heihachiro (Navy), Hasegawa Yoshimichi (Army), Prince Fushimi Sadanaru (Army), Kawamura Kageaki (Army), Prince Kan'in Kotohito (Army), Terauchi Masatake (Army), Ijuin Goro (Navy), Uehara Yusaku (Army), Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito (Navy), Kato Tomosaburo (Navy), Shimamura Hayao (Navy), Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi (Army), Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu (Navy), Prince Nashimoto Morimasa (Army), Muto Nobuyoshi (Army), Yamamoto Isoroku (Navy).

### Air Force Adopts New Tactics, Northern German Air Defense Consolidated, Heavy Losses in U.S. Attack on Germany

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - The recent large-scale air raids by the U.S. Air Force on northwestern Germany were centered on Bremerhaven. However, during the air raids, the completeness of the German defense was displayed. It is noteworthy that the enemy lost 25 aircraft, while the German side suffered no damage. According to German News Agency military reporter Schleiber, the complete success of the German defense battle this time was due to the new German air combat tactics and the brave fighting of the German Air Force soldiers. Military insiders in Berlin were also deeply surprised that the German side did not lose a single aircraft in the fierce air battle between the German and American air forces this time, while the enemy lost 25 heavy bombers. This shows that it is indeed impossible for enemy aircraft to break through the German defense wall. If the enemy attacks from the ditch, it must cross the coastal area, but before the enemy reaches the coastal area, the German fighter squadrons will quickly rise to meet and repel them, preventing them from completing their mission.

### Chilean Left-Wing Parties Organize United Front

Buenos Aires, 28th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports that Buenos Aires Radio announced that representatives of the Chilean Republican Party and the Labor Party have agreed to organize a united front. The number of trade union members participating will exceed 300,000, which may become a decisive factor in the Congress.

### Grew Re-Issues Warning That Japanese Potential Cannot Be Ignored, Davis Calls For British, American, and Soviet Cooperation

Buenos Aires, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from New York: Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew gave a speech in Buffalo on the 25th, pointing out the consolidation of Japan's decisive battle system, saying in essence that it would be most dangerous for us to feel at ease because the Japanese army has recently remained calm. Under this superficial state of calm, the interior is working hard to cope with the new stage of the war. In order to surprise and win, the Japanese army will use all unexpected operations, that is, the Japanese army is better than the anti-Axis countries in combat.

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Davis gave a speech at a public assembly in New York yesterday, again calling for close cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. He said that without the Soviet Union, victory could not be guaranteed, and without the Soviet Union, there would be no post-war adjustment and peace. Therefore, understanding between major powers is necessary. The achievements of the Soviet government, army, and people are worthy of the freedom, trust, and respect of the free countries. Judging from the agreement established by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's goals and political measures are coordinated with other anti-Axis countries.

### A Review of the Two Years of the German-Soviet War

The German-Soviet war entered its third year on July 22nd. On a 2,500-kilometer front, an unprecedentedly fierce battle was launched in history. The changes in the war situation were turbulent, and so far, no victory or defeat has been determined. Summer has already descended on the battlefield, and the increasingly fierce air battles are secretly brewing the start of the third fierce battle, and its trends are worthy of attention. The German-Soviet war remains the main stage of the European war situation, without any change. However, when looking at the actual situation, we cannot hastily make optimistic predictions. Now we review the past two years to help predict the future development of the war situation.

Since the start of the war to date, the German-Soviet war can be roughly divided into the following five phases:

(1) The German offensive phase; (2) The first Soviet winter counter-offensive era; (3) The so-called "summer array" era; (4) The second Soviet winter counter-offensive era; (5) The era of confrontation between the two armies.

On June 22nd of the year before last, as soon as President Hitler's offensive order was issued, the German army waiting on the border line began the offensive against the Soviet Union. The Northern Army aimed at Leningrad, the Central Army aimed at Moscow, and the Southern Army aimed at Ukraine, advancing towards each respective direction. By September, the German offensive had achieved significant success. In the north, it took the form of encircling the city of Leningrad, the center rushed to the western suburbs of Moscow, and the south seized the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, approaching the Donbas industrial area. However, after this cold punch, the Soviet army gradually reorganized its formation and stubbornly resisted with the tenacity unique to the Russians. In addition, since mid-October, an unprecedentedly severe cold in 140 years descended on the Eastern Front, severely limiting military operations. The Leningrad encirclement battle and the western Moscow battle fell into a stalemate. Even in the south, although the German vanguard troops broke into the key point of Rostov, they eventually retreated due to the Soviet counterattack. On December 7, the German army finally had to stop the offensive. This is the first phase.

Following last March, the Soviet army took advantage of the winter's favorable weather in the Zivun area, western Moscow, the Donbas area, and the Crimean Peninsula, and launched a counteroffensive, recovering several places. In the third phase, the German army began attacking Kerch on May 8 last year. Starting on June 28, it began a concentrated offensive in the south. Unlike the year before, the German army only concentrated its main force on the southern front from west of Kursk to Kharkov and Taganrog to carry out breakthrough operations. The central and northern parts took a defensive stance. The German army, which approached Voronezh and Rostov, was divided into two routes, with one part heading to central Caucasus and the other to Stalingrad on the Volga River. Although the Soviet army knew that mobile warfare was not the enemy of the German army, it stubbornly resisted in the positions, especially the intense battle for Stalingrad, which was unprecedented.

However, nature mercilessly descended again. In early November, the Morstov and Narichi regions in the central Caucasus, where the German army was active, were all white with snow, and the Stalingrad area was also in severe cold. On November 19, the Soviet army, preparing for the second winter counteroffensive, began operations simultaneously from Stalingrad, the middle reaches of the Don River, and the Voronezh area. Furthermore, since the end of December, they launched a counteroffensive in the Morstok and Narichi areas. Therefore, by February of this year, the German army eventually withdrew from Stalingrad, Rostov, Voronezh, Kursk, and the North Caucasus. However, in early March, the German army retook Kharkov, creating a major obstacle to the Soviet army's Ukrainian penetration operation. In the remaining northern and central front lines, the Soviet army also engaged in counterattacks, and the German army in Velikiye Luki and Vyazma was forced to retreat. In this way, the second Soviet counteroffensive of considerable scale ended in March. After that, the formations of the German and Soviet armies were intertwined and extremely complex, showing a stalemate to this day.

During this period, the local battles in the Kupyansk area and the increasingly fierce retaliatory bombings by the German and Soviet air forces became more and more intense. The German Air Force's long-range bombing of Gorky, Yaroslavl, and Saratov aimed to destroy the source of the Soviet Union's ability to cultivate war power, while ensuring the Kupyansk area, which still put great pressure on the Caucasus. In any case, in the past two years, the German and Soviet armies have learned each other's strengths and weaknesses. Locally, each battle was a blitzkrieg, but globally, it was divided into four phases. However, the strategic initiative that the German army gained at the beginning of the war remains unchanged to this day, constantly putting pressure on the Soviet Union.

Founding Declaration

Cultural undertakings are vital to the nation. The rise and fall of a nation's or an era's culture are often causally linked to the prosperity and decline of national fortunes. The publishing industry is an important link in the cultural enterprise. The quantity of publications is often taken as a measure of cultural prosperity. The quantity and quality of our country's publications, compared with those of the world's powers, are already dwarfed in comparison. Since the Incident, with the outbreak of war, it has suffered a further setback. The existing periodicals, with varying lengths of publication history, have persevered in a difficult environment, holding fast to the cultural bastion, and striving to do their part in this great era. The goals of their efforts are the same. Since the cooperation between China and Japan in the war, the national policy has been set, and the wartime cultural policy has been followed accordingly. The Shanghai magazine community, aware of the great responsibility of Shanghai as the center of the national cultural enterprise in revitalizing culture, and the difficulties of wartime material supply to be overcome, believes that only with concerted efforts and methodical steps can the best and greatest efforts be made. Thus, the organization of the Shanghai Magazine Federation is formally established today, vowing to uphold national policy, develop publishing culture, promote the national spirit, cultivate culture, instill academic thought, and overcome the material difficulties encountered at present under the leadership of the authorities, hoping to contribute to the country and the nation. This is hereby declared.

### Grandson Strangles Grandmother - Heinous Crime of Inhumanity - Zheng Yongkang, Addicted to Gambling, Commits Evil Act After Failing to Extort Money

Zheng Wu, an 81-year-old Ningbo woman, lived in a street-level building at 137 Rue Poncet in the French Concession. Her son had died, and she had two grandsons, the elder named Yongkang, 23 years old, and the younger named Chenggen, 13 years old. The three of them lived together in extreme poverty. Yongkang did not engage in honest labor and was addicted to gambling all day long. His younger brother, Chenggen, although young, knew to love himself and worked as a vendor at the Taiping Bridge vegetable market every day to earn a small profit to support his grandmother's expenses. On the morning of the [26th], around 11 AM, Yongkang again tried to extort money from his grandmother but failed. He noticed that she was wearing two gold rings on her finger, and an evil thought arose in him. After an argument, Yongkang took a mourning cloth and strangled her, taking the two gold rings. He placed the deceased on the bed, covered her with a quilt, closed the door, and fled without a trace. Not long after, Chenggen returned home and found the door locked. After knocking for a long time without a response, he managed to open the door and break in, finding his grandmother lying motionless on the bed, already dead. He saw a mourning cloth wrapped around her neck. He reported it to the police station with the neighbors. They are now searching for the rebellious grandson Yongkang to bring him to justice.

Brief Commentary

### Establishment of the Shanghai Magazine Federation

The "Shanghai Magazine Federation" was formally established yesterday. This is another sign that the country's culture will have new developments.

In the past, Shanghai's various magazine publishers had little mutual contact and even less unified organization, which inevitably led to many difficulties. The most obvious examples are:

(1) Various magazines have their own unique characteristics, but it is often found that some magazines publish texts with similar content or translations from the same original text. This duplication is a waste of both mental and material resources.

(2) Because the individual strength of each magazine publisher is weak, it is difficult to purchase sufficient reference materials. Also, because each magazine has few connected writers, it is often difficult to find suitable selectors for ideal topics. This is one of the reasons why the content of each magazine fails to meet the pre-planned goals and reach the ideal state.

(3) Recently, changes in the material environment have brought new challenges to magazines. For example, the repeated rise in paper prices has caused some magazines to reduce their size. There are also those who find it difficult to continue. Furthermore, the increase in advertising costs makes it impossible for magazines with economic difficulties to publish advertisements after publication, making them widely known in society. This is a crisis for the future of the cultural world, not just a misfortune for the magazines themselves.

Now that the "Magazine Federation" has been established, the above three points should be able to find reasonable solutions.

(1) After the establishment of the association, the various magazine publishers can have regular contact and consult on the content of the material at any time to avoid similarities or duplication, and make each strive to develop its unique personality. Supply readers with all aspects of spiritual food.

(2) The exchange of reference materials and the contact with authors will help each other, so that the content of each magazine will be more enriched and perfect.

(3) In the name of the federation, it will be more effective to request fair and equal allocation of paper at fair prices and preferential treatment for cultural advertising from the relevant authorities, thereby reducing the material burden on each magazine publisher and allowing it to continue to develop.

Finally, the poverty of cultural people is still , which is also a major reason why the cultural enterprise is declining. Therefore, how to seek the livelihood and welfare of the heads of various magazine publishers (especially editors, etc.) and various authors is also an urgent problem to be solved.

What is even more appropriate is that the organization of the "Magazine Federation" is mainly to "study the development of periodical publishing and give full play to the cultural mission and sexual power of the periodical enterprise"; however, the revitalization of a country's culture, in addition to the publication of magazines, obviously depends more on the joint efforts of the national cultural community. Therefore, we very much hope that general cultural organizations like "Cultural Associations" can be established in the shortest possible time. Jointly plan the national cultural enterprise, adjust cultural activities, and develop the cultural future.

The rise and fall of culture is a major force that determines the national spirit and knowledge. Therefore, we not only hope that the "Magazine Federation" and the future organizations such as the "Association of Cultural People" (assuming each title) will stand on their positions and engage in practical work that is conducive to cultural development. We also hope that the relevant authorities and the entire group of compatriots will urge, guide, and support them!

### North China Emergency Relief Charity Football Match - Donghua and Lianyi Meet Today - 5:30 PM at Yiyuan

The Charity Football Match for the North China Emergency Relief, co-sponsored by the Municipal Sports Association and co-organized by Donghua and Lianyi, will be held today at 5:30 PM at Yiyuan Stadium. Tickets are priced at 20 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. Mayor Chen will be invited to host the opening ceremony. During the match, charity footballs will be auctioned, and all proceeds will be used for relief purposes (expenses will be borne by the Donghua and Lianyi sports associations). The referee will be Deng Xiaoliang. The Cha Football Team is the best in China and both teams are like two Zhuge Liang's of their time. In the first round of the Western League, the two teams drew 0-0, and in the Zhou Renfu Yuan Cup charity match, Donghua won the first match, and Lianyi bravely won the second match. Each team has won one game and the results are balanced. This time, they are fighting for the top spot of the China's Crown. Chen, an official from the North China Emergency Relief Association, will attend to deliver a thank-you speech. The team lists are recorded.

### Searching for Huang Jiaqi

Huang Jiaqi, 23 years old, is from Rufu, Jiangsu. He is a student at the Police Training Institute of the Xuzhou Suhuai Special Zone Public Security Office. He graduated last month. The institute organized a police inspection team of more than forty people to observe in the Central China area. When they arrived in Shanghai, the students asked him to go to the city to exchange reserve certificates, but he did not return. This happened on June 1st. At that time, letters and telegrams were sent to relatives and friends in various places, but he was not found. His father, who works as a county magistrate in Beijing, is worried. Please inform the family of his whereabouts by sending it to President Ling of the Xin Beijing News in Beijing.

### Director-General Tang of the Business Consolidation Council Warns Colleagues to Practice Self-Discipline

(Business Consolidation Council News) Director-General Tang of the Business Consolidation Council, in response to an article published in the Shen Bao Economic World titled "Eliminating the Tendency to Seek Private Gain," which was critical of the council, personally issued a warning to lower-level agencies and all staff to practice self-discipline. The original text, "Eliminating the Tendency to Seek Private Gain," published in the Shen Bao Economic World on June 23rd, is quoted below. As the council is a commercial collective, it values the spirit of self-governance, and the duties of the office are heavy. Any behavior that seeks private gain not only abandons oneself to society but also goes against national policy and should be severely punished. Newspaper criticisms should not be taken as absolute truth, and criticisms should be taken as warnings. In addition to announcing to the public and merchants to report at any time, the previous intention should be reiterated and notified to the various professional committees, joint associations, and all colleagues of the council. "Please take note and cherish yourselves, do not ruin the reputation of the council, do not violate the law, and be cautious."

Economic Commentary

### "Implementing Material Control and Strengthening Transportation"

In order to establish a wartime economic system, the government strengthened the National Economic Council, placing it under the jurisdiction of the National Government, making it the highest planning agency for wartime economics after the war. It has held two meetings. In addition to increasing industrial and agricultural production, the second meeting paid special attention to "implementing material control and strengthening transportation." This is one of the wartime economic policies and should be given special attention. Since the establishment of the Commercial Consolidation Council, three months have passed, and the time and economic costs cannot be said to be small. However, in terms of work, it has only been busy with the organization of institutions and the payment of personnel. The material control itself has not been carried out in the entire work. Agricultural products in the interior are not easily transported to industrial areas, and manufactured products in industrial areas are difficult to transport to various places, forming a situation of obstruction. There are many reasons for the difficulty, and the imperfect coordination of various agencies and the improper handling of personnel are the main reasons. The impact on the entire economic infrastructure is huge. Government authorities have received reports from various parties and cannot but feel regret. Therefore, the second National Economic Council included the proposal to "implement material control and strengthen transportation." The intention is far-reaching and profound. It is hoped that the colleagues of the Commercial Consolidation Council and various trade associations will uphold this intention, take immediate action, and strive to complete the work within the entire wartime system. At the same time, all transportation agencies and governments at all levels must understand the difficulty of economic construction plans, cooperate to the best of their ability, and work together to promote transportation and implement material control.

### Conclusion of the Shenbao Cup Basketball Tournament: Chinese Youth Wins the Shenbao Cup; Western Youth Defeats Chinese Youth 31-21 Yesterday; Cambridge Elder Spends $40,000 to Purchase Charity Ball at High Price

The "Shenbao Cup North China Disaster Relief Basketball Tournament," jointly organized by the Chinese YMCA and this newspaper, successfully concluded last night amidst enthusiastic atmosphere and smooth progress. The achievements of this charity match are highly commendable. The charity ball auction alone has generated a total of $94,000. Adding donations and ticket sales, the total should be around $150,000. However, detailed figures still need to be carefully calculated and will be announced soon. Last night was the final game of the tournament, and it was already sold out before 7 o'clock. The audience was as large as the previous two nights. After two defeats, Western Youth fought hard yesterday like cornered beasts, ultimately winning with the saying "an army driven by grief is sure to win". They repeatedly took the lead during the process. As the championship was already secured, Chinese Youth did not push too hard and, prioritizing courtesy, allowed Western Youth to win the final victory with a score of 31-21. However, the first half ended in a 17-17 tie, demonstrating the intensity of the battle. In the overall score of two wins to one, Chinese Youth won the Shenbao Cup silver cup, while Western Youth received a commemorative cup. After the match, Mr. Lin Kanghou presented the awards, and Mr. Chen Bin delivered a thank-you speech, bringing the grand event to a successful conclusion. The charity ball auction last night was even more exciting and enthusiastic, with the bidding reaching a fever pitch. In the end, after fundraising by Lin Kanghou, the ball was purchased by a Cambridge elder for the huge sum of $40,000. The charity basketball fees over the past few days have repeatedly reached new heights, especially the $40,000 last night, which was unprecedented and broke all charity ball (including football) records in the city. Benefiting the disaster victims, doing good is the greatest joy, and their kindness is truly admirable. When time was up, after referees Liu Hesheng and Yu Julu blew their whistles, the two teams began to engage. Chinese Youth's fierce attack was unsuccessful, and Lin Weicong and Zhuo Guorong subsequently committed fouls. Tao Bolinji scored two free throws, taking an early lead of two points. Soon after, Lin Weicong made a shot from the side, tying the score at two each. However, due to a slight lapse in defense, Tao Bolinji scored three more consecutive points. Xiao Lin dribbled under the basket, and Yu Xunzi made a successful free throw, finally closing the gap to 5-8. However, Kaiqi made a brilliant long shot, making it 10-5. Chinese Youth fought hard, and Ma and Yu each made a shot, with Cheng making one free throw, eventually tying the score at 10 each. Then, Tao Bolinji made a long shot, once again taking the lead. Ma, Yu, and Wu each made three shots, suddenly taking a 16-12 lead, coming from behind. After 17-14, Tao Bolinji and Fonik's one free throw and one shot tied the score at 17 each, ending the first half.

Western Youth Succeeds in Physical Play in the Second Half

As the second half began, the four youths fought desperately. Fonik, Yelong B. Saszkin, and others made consecutive shots, adding seven points. Chinese Youth struggled to support, with only Ma Canxi and Tang Xuesheng each making one free throw at 21-17 and 25-18. Afterwards, Fonik probed the basket and made two more free throws, and Monroe Tuo made one shot, suddenly increasing the score to 31. Chinese Youth adjusted their lineup but still showed no improvement. Their luck was also poor, and they repeatedly missed shots. Ma Canxi made a long shot successfully. Then, the gong sounded, ending the game with a final score of 31-21. Western Youth reported their victory.

The scores of the two teams yesterday are as follows:

### List of Donors to the Shenbao Cup Disaster Relief

The following is the list of donors to the Shenbao Cup North China Disaster Relief received by this newspaper yesterday:

Mr. Ding Huikang, $23,000.

The following seven entities, each $1,000: Shaye Bank, Dazhong Insurance Company, Guangzhiliang, Chuan Xiangcheng, Wu Yunfu, Shanghai District Dim Sum Restaurant Association, Shao Shuhua of Central Reserve Bank, and Wu Kunsheng of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, Jiang Zhaozu of Chengfeng Enterprise Company. Wu Shaoting of Fuhua Bank, $600. Yang Fuchen, Jin Hongxiang, Zhu Qinpei of Zhengming Bank, He Shen, Chongqing Bank, Zhang Weiru, anonymous donor, Yang Yinsun, Wu Ruiyuan, Shi Xiaoshan, Timber Industry Association, Xu Baohua, Central Asia Bank, China Tobacco Bank, Xu Yongxiang, Jiangsu Local Banking Industry First, Wu Limen, Zhou Xingchu, Yida Motor Company, (fundraising by Zhou) Ge Yongqi, each $400. Zhang Yuqing, Cai Songfu, Wei Tuanxiang (fundraising by Zhou), each $200. Total received: $38,200 in reserve coupons. Remaining balance: $106,300.

Lower-level organizations have long encouraged each other with the words "fairness, integrity, and impartiality." Because this association is a commercial collective, it still emphasizes the spirit of self-governance. However, the matter concerns the overall duties and responsibilities. If there is any act of personal gain or profiteering, it is not only a self-abandonment to society but also a far cry from national policy and should be subject to strict sanctions. Although newspaper criticisms are not to be blindly believed, and public opinion deserves attention, it is important to be vigilant. In addition to publicly encouraging social merchants to report cases at any time based on evidence, we should reiterate the previous intentions and notify all types of specialized committees, joint committees, and all colleagues of this association to "exercise self-respect, avoid tarnishing the association's reputation, violating laws and regulations, and to act cautiously."

### Measures for Rice Transportation in the Shanghai Area

(Business Control Committee News) For the transportation of rice outside the controlled area in the Shanghai region, transportation is based on permits issued by the Ministry of Food. If the rice is transported into the Shanghai controlled area from foreign countries, it must be based on the "Provisional Regulations on the Prohibition of Movement of Wartime Materials." Except for glutinous rice, it must obtain the permission of the Business Control Committee and issue a transportation permit before it can be transported in. At the same time, all applications for the issuance of rice transportation permits must be based on the permits issued by the Ministry of Food.

### Application Procedures for the Transportation of Flour, Wheat, etc.

(Business Control Committee News) For applications for the transportation of wheat flour and bran by both Chinese and Japanese merchants, the Business Control Committee requires that they first be certified and stamped by the Joint Association of Chinese and Japanese Flour Industries and Miscellaneous Grain Industries. It should be noted that, for the sake of contacting and registering the flour and wheat professional committee, the application must be submitted to the committee for stamping and certification in order to conduct joint review. It is now known that, for the convenience of the procedures, it has been stipulated that all applications for the transportation of the above three items, in addition to following the original procedures, must also hold the application and other documents and first register with the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, which will stamp and certify it. Then, the Permit Affairs Group will accept it and, according to the procedure, review and approve the issuance of the transportation permit (or the transfer approval letter). However, if it is not approved, the Permit Affairs Group will notify the committee at any time for contact.

### Overview of the Internal Organization of the Rice and Grain Joint Cooperative

The Shanghai District Rice and Grain Joint Cooperative has been established and has begun operations. Starting next month, the purchase of rice and grain for the city's five million residents will be the responsibility of the cooperative, following the instructions of the Shanghai Food Adjustment Committee to handle procurement and allocation matters. As for the organization of the cooperative, it has been decided to divide it into one office and five groups, including the Secretariat Office, the Sales Group, the Allocation Group, the Manufacturing Group, the Finance Group, and the General Affairs Group. Subdivisions will be established within each group as needed. Regarding personnel, in addition to the position of Secretary, which has been assigned to Zhai Yi, the heads of the various groups are still under review by the Board of Directors.

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market experienced a resurgence of bullish sentiment. Despite it being before the mid-year closing of banks and money exchanges, credit remained loose, and both new and old investors became very active. The department store sector, including Wing On, Sincere, and China Emporium, saw the strongest gains. The domestic industry also rose, with Jingfu and Jinglun's shirts and socks also rising accordingly. In the textile sector, Leci's Yongzi Textiles saw large-scale purchases, breaking through the key level. Dasheng Mills No. 1 and No. 3 both saw significant gains, Rong's Textiles rebounded, and Dachungwa Knitting Co. saw active trading of smaller denominations. Guoxin, Tongji, Daguangming, Xinxin, Xinfu, and Guoguang all remained firm. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company suddenly surged at noon, and Great China Match advanced to new highs. Public utilities did not rise significantly, but they were all up. The pharmaceutical sector saw the smallest changes, with Sino-French and New Asia rising, and China Union falling, while Five Continents and Star Perfumery remained flat. In the cultural sector, China once again approached a key level, World rose, and Commercial Press remained flat. Tongyixin remained at its original price.

### Brief News

Procedures for Transporting Old Cotton, etc.

Regarding the procedures for transporting old cotton and old rubber hemp, etc., there is a lack of clarity in the outside world. The Business Control Committee has provided the following clarification: Cotton, regardless of whether it is new or old, must be transported to the Shanghai area (i.e., within the controlled area surrounding Shanghai), regardless of whether it is from nearby villages or from the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line or from Tongning and Shaoxing. The carrier must apply for permission from the Materials Movement Permit Office of the Business Control Committee before it can be transported in. As for movement within the city, currently, only yarn mills are allowed to apply for permits for self-use. Regarding the transportation of old rubber glands and other similar goods to the domestic area, it is not necessary to obtain permission from the committee.

### Assorted Rights and Wrongs

— Qingzhao

If history does not give people lessons but is merely a record of the surface of facts, then it has no value.

Exposing the true face of things is the primary task of historians. Historians only call things by their true names and do not worship the status quo. Therefore, the personal fate of true historians is often tragic, such as the Grand Historian Sima Qian in ancient China.

"The art of exposure is the art of recognition."

God grants people truth in their dreams. Hegel refuted this by saying that whatever is obtained in dreams is mostly nonsense.

Intelligent people are not incarnations of "infallibility." The characteristic of intelligent people can be said to be the ability to thoroughly correct their mistakes and the courage and determination to accept the lessons of facts.

The incarnation of "infallibility" is not a human being but God (?)

However, people still want to seek the incarnation of "infallibility," and this incarnation is best belonging to himself. Balzac then said:

When you are worshiped like a god, you cannot see your own good or bad.

### Teachers During the Summer Vacation

— Lu Shenting

Summer vacation has arrived, and it is time for teachers who have worked hard for a year to rest. People outside the education field seem to envy the good fortune of being a teacher. Being able to have two months of long summer vacation, but they don't know that teachers are getting panicked. Some are so anxious when grading papers that sweat beads even drip from their noses. They are worrying about the "renewal of their contracts" for the next semester and the "summer salary" during the vacation!

In China, where the situation of teachers is not guaranteed, the private school principals who have become bosses are thinking, "Where did these come from...? Might as well take this opportunity to clean and refresh the teachers. It's better to save a sum of money for the summer salary paid to the teachers."

There are also teachers who are so good that the students don't want them to leave, and the principal has no choice but to reluctantly maintain their positions. Teachers who can get half of their salary are considered very lucky. Clever principals simply open summer tutoring schools and have the teachers stand in the steamy classrooms to strain their voices. As a result, not only can this summer salary be squeezed from the teachers, but they can also profit from it themselves.

The devil is always one foot higher than the saint, and the amount of summer salary that teachers get can't keep up with the ever-increasing cost of living. They can't even "eat" properly, and they can't even think about "dressing" nicely. "Family and children" are even further out of reach. This ironclad fact doesn't need a single word to prove. In short, under these circumstances, it is difficult to prevent teachers from thinking about "jumping out of the education field to make a living," which leads to an education crisis!

This is a basic argument: The purpose of education is to turn students into good citizens in the future. Therefore, students must first receive a good education. To enable students to receive a good education, teachers must first be able to teach with peace of mind. Therefore, teachers must first have a stable life. To enable teachers to have a stable life, of course, is to "raise their salaries"!

But now, teachers not only dare not dream of "raising their salaries" but are also afraid of the "threat of summer vacation"! This is really unfair.

The relationship between education and society is extremely close, and we should not stand idly by and watch primary school teachers worry. I feel that there is an opportunity right in front of us that can make them feel a little more at ease, and that is to ask the principals to give the right to run summer schools to the teachers, so that the teachers can directly collect tuition fees. If this is done, not only will it consolidate the possibility of teachers continuing in the next semester, but it will also enable them to earn some extra profits. Naturally, the threat of the two-month summer vacation will no longer be long. (Move to North China disaster relief)

### Whetstone

— Yu Wenzhong

If we use the environment as a metaphor for a whetstone, then everyone is a knife.

We all believe that it is very difficult to sharpen a knife on a smooth marble stone, but it is not absolutely impossible. As long as you abandon the prejudice that "marble is smooth" and spend time and energy to grind it patiently, excellent conditions often make people lack the ambition to move upward, but I believe that if you are not satisfied with the perfection of the situation and still strive to improve, you will not be difficult to become a useful person in the future. Otherwise, you will be mistaken by the comfortable environment and bury your precious future!

A "relatively rough" whetstone is best for sharpening knives. Indeed, a "relatively bad" environment easily tempers people to be determined and capable. Friend—if you are in distress and lonely suffering; subjected to all kinds of hardships and setbacks; then I congratulate you, please don't think of "misfortune as disaster", and use a sincere heart to celebrate your acquisition of a whetstone. That blunt knife? It is yourself, there is a great possibility of being sharpened! I will not list the great people from ancient times to the present, both in China and abroad, who have struggled out of hardship, so as not to waste words.

As for wanting to sharpen a knife quickly on a stone with an uneven surface, the possibility is very small, and even a useful knife will be damaged or chipped. We believe that there are talented people in science, literature...etc., among the poor children, who can be made to achieve great things in the future, but unfortunately they die prematurely or remain unknown throughout their lives. This is not only a grievance for them personally, but also a loss for the country and society. In order to preserve this batch of useful knives, we must find ways to flatten those stones!

### Talking About "Laughter"

— Hai Lin

The progress of the world is based on "laughter." If a "person" is dissatisfied with the reality of society and recognizes the flaws in society, a foolish person may "grieve" and issue a cry of despair, or be "angry" and "look askance" at society, which is in an extremely bad state. But these are all expressions of not seeking improvement. Therefore, only those who "laugh" are intelligent reformers. Only "laughter" can most powerfully and peacefully recognize the deepest parts of real society. The highest art of "laughter" is to deal with facts that should be "grieved" and "angered," not by "laughing it off" but by being able to "deal with it while laughing." On the one hand, "laughing" elegantly, and on the other hand, being able to rigorously, correctly, and deeply correct the simplicity, humor, contradiction, evil, disunity, shortcomings, unreasonableness...of reality until it is "no longer laughable."

But unfortunately, because the "laughter" of many people is only a full "haha" and nothing more. Once the haha is over, it's over. Big dissatisfaction is haha, and small dissatisfaction is also haha. The power of laughter is completely relaxed. What benefit is this to real society? Therefore, a person who truly has the art of laughter does not easily "haha." If he laughs, it also indicates that he has truly seen the flaws.

So we need people who can truly "laugh"!

### Friendship

— Keshi

Nietzsche said, "Are you a slave? Then you cannot be a friend to others. Are you a tyrant? Then you cannot have friends." Then what kind of people cannot have friends or be friends to others? According to the above, we can say that slaves and tyrants cannot be friends to others. In other words, friendship is built on a completely equal class, not on the foundation of begging or military oppression. Trying wholeheartedly to use flattery to seek the other's pleasure, or using money to bribe, benefits to lure, or even using military force to threaten, in order to obtain the other's friendship is not true friendship.

"The friendship between gentlemen is as light as water, the friendship between villains is as sweet as honey." This is the most accurate description of friendship. The former is true friendship, eternal friendship, while the latter is momentary and hypocritical. In the initial acquaintance, they often express a situation of regretting meeting so late, as if only the two of them in the world are worthy of having friendship. If a third party intervenes, jealousy or rivalry will occur. But once a conflict arises over certain interests, the past friendship between the two will immediately vanish like a bubble, becoming like strangers on the road.

Friendship - the only thornless rose in the world, we should always preserve, cherish and protect it, just like the Malagasy proverb, "May your friendship be like the mouth and the hand, when the hand hurts, use the mouth to blow it, when the mouth hurts, use the hand to soothe it."

### Good and Evil

— Fang Hao

In this diverse real world, I believe that evil has already blinded the people. Although from the outside, this society is still singing and dancing, prosperous and very; but, if we can carefully observe the inside story; then, we must believe that even the world's greatest literary talents, with all their students' energy, would not be able to reveal all the base and filthy situations without any disguise to the world.

Mencius said: "Human nature is inherently good." However, Xunzi said: "Human nature is evil, and goodness is artificial." Regardless of whether Mencius said that human nature is inherently good or Xunzi said that goodness is artificial; they both advised people to do good. Since everyone knows that doing good is right and doing evil is bad behavior, why are so many people afraid of not doing evil quickly enough? Is it "people's hearts are not as they used to be"? Is it "the world is going downhill"? Neither. I say this is entirely due to the environment.

When young people enter the world deeply and their ambitions are not yet determined, they are very easily seduced by the outside world and lose their nature, blindly following the crowd towards the abyss of (happiness?). In the end, they are unable to extricate themselves from the depths of water and fire. By the time they discover that destruction is imminent, it is too late to "regret" it. Like us, young people with strong blood, how can we not walk cautiously?

Dr. Bauke said: "Kindness is the most beautiful virtue of mankind, and it is the foundation for obtaining happiness." This sentence is accurate. Don't we also have two proverbs? That is, "Harmony brings wealth" and "A harmonious family prospers in everything." It can be seen that goodness is the foundation of being a person. If you abandon the foundation and pursue the superficial, spending all day doing evil, the result is truly unimaginable!

Madame Flora Tristan said, "What is called goodness is not simply avoiding the penalty of doing evil. Goodness is not passive and passive. Goodness is active and automatic."

This is the division between good and evil.

### Collection of White Grass

— Ouyang Menglei

People who have tomorrow do not fear sorrow, even if they endure pain and torture today. Those who truly have "love" for humanity and are willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of others must eventually walk on the path to truth, regardless of where they start.

"Love" can forgive, while "selfishness" cannot.

Words that have not been thought about, chewed on, and digested often cause all kinds of misfortunes and regrets after being spoken.

### Abbot of Sanmei Temple Donates to Charity

Kuan Dao, the abbot of Sanmei Temple in the South City, wrote yesterday stating: "Kuan Dao has been a monk for twenty years and has never solicited alms. However, considering the hunger and suffering of monks and nuns in famous mountains and forests after the Incident, as fellow disciples, I could not bear to sit idly by. Therefore, I made a vow to lecture on scriptures and raise donations for three years, to do my best. This year is the last year to complete the anticipated total of 300,000 yuan. In addition to the donations for food relief in various places, and Buddhist porridge distribution and medical care in North China, which have already been sent separately, there is still 500 yuan for the Catholic Xin Pu Yu Tang, 500 yuan for the Orphanage. 300 yuan for a certain Christian Refugee Orphanage, and 100 yuan each for the Nursery, Fu You Academy, and the Mountain Bay Orphanage. 1,000 yuan for the Shen Bao scholarship, please transfer it on behalf of your newspaper." Note: The funds have been received. It is particularly commendable for a monk to donate to charity. It is hoped that all sectors will rise up and support it.
