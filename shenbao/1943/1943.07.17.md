### The Practice of Decisive Battle Living

A few days ago, Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech at the Central Cooperation Decisive Battle Council in Japan, calling on the one hundred million Japanese people to practice decisive battle living, thereby uniting the ten hundred million people of East Asia and earnestly cooperating to strive for the final victory of the war. Reading this speech has triggered endless reflections in us.

Frankly speaking, since the war, the Japanese people have already entered the right track of wartime living under the leadership of the government. The government has various regulations and leading organizations to encourage wartime living, advancing strict restrictions and political guidance simultaneously. Moreover, there are various folk organizations that conduct self-policing and self-discipline, so that the national living can fully comply with the government's intentions and requirements for combat. Whether in spirit or in material, they do not want to live outside the law, seek freedom, or avoid restraint. This spirit of sacrifice of one hundred million people with one heart is entirely to be loyal to the government and the state, and it fully expresses the people's confidence in the nation and the war. However, they are not satisfied with this. Today, as this world war is approaching the decisive battle stage, they are redoubling their efforts to suppress the daily living of the people under the central goal of "practicing decisive battle living", and advancing toward the path of "purity, freshness, simplicity, and frugality." Whether in food, clothing, housing, transportation, or spiritual life, they further demand that everyone exercise self-restraint and endure suffering in order to concentrate the heart, strength, ability, and material resources of one hundred million people, accumulate combat power, and lay a solid foundation for victory in the future decisive battle. In order to defend East Asia and ensure the liberation and freedom of the ten hundred million people of East Asia, the Japanese people are enduring all kinds of suffering and shouldering the most arduous responsibilities. Every Chinese person will inevitably feel ashamed because of this!

In the stage of the great decisive battle, the importance of China's position is beyond doubt. Whether the Chinese people can shoulder their due responsibilities without disappointing the Allied countries and other East Asian nations depends on how we live our daily lives. In reality, apart from the majority of our people who have been passively plunged into extremely difficult circumstances due to the impact of the war in recent years, it can be said that there are not many who have actively and autonomously rectified their lives in view of their own responsibilities. Generally speaking, whether rich, poor, or middle class, we have rarely seen anyone who can automatically change their state of living in view of the difficulties of the times and the honor and disgrace of the nation, and dedicate all their heart, strength, and material resources to the country. We have repeatedly advocated the implementation of wartime living, but so far only a few social leaders and some well-known figures in the business community have begun to practice it. The extravagance and waste in Shanghai remains the same. Looking at the "purity, freshness, simplicity, and frugality" of the lives of people in other countries, and then looking at our current situation, how can we not feel ashamed?

We believe that the movement to practice decisive battle living must be promoted quickly and effectively in China, especially in Shanghai. First of all, the operation of improper entertainment venues, as well as tea houses and restaurants, should be restricted, and the supply of water and electricity and their business hours should be limited. At the same time, in addition to restaurants that are necessary for the people and legitimate entertainment venues that meet the needs of wartime, heavy taxes must be levied. However, this income must be used to relieve refugees who have no clothing or food, and to run public welfare and social education undertakings.

In terms of clothing and food, on the one hand, the guidance of the authorities is certainly needed to clearly define wartime living standards, but on the other hand, the enlightenment of the general public is especially important. Based on historically passed-down habits, people have various misconceptions and prejudices. For example, when it comes to food, they all believe in rice and do not believe in the nutritional value of miscellaneous grains. We hope that scientists and experts will work hard to study and publicize the nutritional value of various foods, and promote the consumption of miscellaneous grains and potatoes, etc., in order to reduce the shortage of rice. For example, the general public in Shanghai has always loved pork as the best dish. Middle-class families consider it a loss of face not to eat pork. In fact, the nutritional value of pork is not very high, and the general public can do without it. On the contrary, pork can also transmit diseases. From an economic point of view, countless poor people's food is taken away to feed pigs, and raising pigs should also be restricted for the sake of material conservation.

As for clothing, due to habit, everyone knows that "one would rather suffer hardship than lose face," and has no choice but to wear high-quality Chinese and Western suits and high-end shoes and hats, etc. Whether in terms of personal economy, health, convenience of work, or social material resources, this is an extremely unreasonable phenomenon. We hope that leading figures in various industries and sectors will take the lead in advocating that Western suits should not be worn with jackets or ties in summer, and that "Hong Kong shirts," etc., should be regarded as ideal and appropriate summer clothing. For Chinese clothing, we should promote cloth short jackets. As long as patched clothing and shoes are neat and clean, it is not a loss of face, and should be respected. Women's fancy clothing, especially luxurious accessories, should be regarded as a special mark of women in improper occupations. By promoting simple and plain clothing, the social atmosphere can be improved, the national economy can be improved, and the country can benefit from the conservation of materials.

What we must specifically point out here is that, on the one hand, we must immediately promote the movement to practice decisive battle national living, and on the other hand, the authorities must strive to ensure the minimum living standards of the people, such as the low-priced rationing system for food and daily necessities, which must be implemented thoroughly. Then, the success of the decisive battle living movement can be guaranteed, and the social contradictions and crises of extreme wealth and extreme poverty can be eliminated, which will have great benefits for future revival and construction.

### Japan Central Cooperation Council Concludes Successfully Yesterday Evening, Unanimously Passes "Oath of Certain Victory"

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - The 16th was the last day of the Japanese Central Cooperation Council.

Thus, the Sino-British Cooperation Council, which had profound significance under the decisive battle, successfully concluded on the evening of the 16th.

### Director Tanihagi Detailed War Situation in Various Aspects, Raising the Determination of 100 Million Japanese People

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Major General Tanihagi, Chief of the Army Press Section of the Japanese General Headquarters, explained in detail the U.S. counter-offensive intentions and the war situation in various parts of the South Pacific at the plenary session of the Central Cooperation Council on the 16th, and raised the determination of the 100 million Japanese people. The original text is as follows: The United States regards "material," "production," and "time" as the three elements of war victory. However, the necessary types and quantities of material are not satisfactory. Due to various factors, production will reach its saturation point this autumn, and it will be difficult to rapidly increase production thereafter. However, if Japan is given a considerable amount of time, it will inevitably strengthen its political and strategic posture. Therefore, it is only natural that the United States intends to give Japan a major blow during its most advantageous period of this year and next year. Roosevelt also said in his message to Congress that 1943 was the year of the decisive battle. However, it would take considerable time and enormous sacrifices to carry out a counter-offensive against Japan on some Pacific islands. This would be a poor strategy. If Midway Island and the Aleutian Islands were used as bases to launch air raids on the Japanese mainland, the range of the aircraft would be insufficient, which would be useless. If aircraft carriers were used to attack the Japanese mainland, it would be extremely dangerous. As a result, the United States sought a base on the continent close to Japan to launch an aerial decisive battle against Japan. Therefore, it must first strengthen the Air Force stationed in Chongqing, but the supply of these can only rely on the air transport route from India. It is estimated that its monthly transport volume is only about a thousand tons, which is not sufficient. Therefore, the enemy has no choice but to attempt to seize Burma. This operation to seize Burma is not only to increase the assistance to Chongqing in the war of resistance against Japan and strengthen the strength of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, but also to defend the security of India. At a time when the independence movement in India is in full swing, this is an inevitable trend.

The United States Encounters its Greatest Crisis

The British and Indian troops began the operation to seize Burma at the end of last year, but after repeated failures, their attempts have completely failed. In this view, it is becoming increasingly difficult to approach the Japanese mainland. However, the enemy will never stop at this difficulty, and will try to increase its combat power to the maximum extent within the next two years, making a desperate struggle. However, if there are no great victories in the meantime, it will inevitably arouse questions from the general public. For example, Croc, the Washington bureau chief of the New York Times, once said that the U.S. domestic war line has encountered its greatest crisis since the start of the war. This is also the case. In addition, the failure of anti-inflation measures, the high cost of living, frequent labor disputes, difficulties in food supply, the struggle between bureaucrats for power, and the political struggle before the election of the president, the domestic situation is extremely uneasy. Moreover, the flaws in the anti-Axis camp have not yet been repaired. Therefore, it can only seek the support of public opinion with the results of the war and maintain its credibility with the anti-Axis countries. In November of last year, the British and American troops landed in North Africa, and their war was fortunately successful, and they won great praise for a time. After that, the leaders of the two countries further discussed the war policy in Washington. As a result, the principle of Europe first was generally adopted. At the same time, they tried to take the opportunity to launch an active offensive against Japan in the Pacific.

Surface Aid to the Soviet Union is Actually Self-Serving

The United States never had the true intention of actively rescuing the Soviet Union, but only to make Germany and the Soviet Union both lose, so as to benefit itself. It did not achieve ideal results in North Africa or Western Europe, and even the sacrifices in the future may not be rewarded. Therefore, it believes that the move to attack Europe is not appropriate. Looking back at East Asia, Chongqing is becoming increasingly declining. If it is not actively assisted, the result may be that it will break away from Britain and the United States. At the same time, Australia is also afraid of the Japanese army's attack and hopes to increase its assistance. Therefore, the United States can take the opportunity to intervene in Australia and India to fulfill its long-standing wish to defeat Japan. Therefore, the United States advocates the Pacific First Doctrine. Therefore, even if it accepts Britain's Europe First Doctrine, the momentum of its implementation will inevitably be unusually cold. Based on this, the United States launched a counter-offensive operation in the South Pacific. It can be seen that the U.S. counter-offensive in the South Pacific this time is not temporary or local in nature. It can be regarded as a large-scale counter-offensive operation with a concrete plan. The U.S. military is still greedy for endlessness, vainly believes in material victory, and still underestimates the Japanese air force's combat power and its productivity. The U.S. military on the battlefield initially had a considerable strong fighting spirit due to its adventurous spirit, curiosity, heroism, and banditry spirit. However, this is ultimately a kind of childishness, and was completely defeated at the beginning of the war.

The U.S. Propaganda Conceals Traces of Defeat

The U.S. counter-offensive this time is a great opportunity for us to annihilate the enemy, destroy its human and material resources, and destroy its tactics of relying on mechanical power and material power. Therefore, this counter-offensive operation of the anti-Axis forces is generally said by insightful people to be not a "gamble for victory" but a "crazy adventure." The general situation of the U.S. counter-offensive this time is briefly described as follows: Since June 30, the U.S. powerful army and navy have landed on Rendova Island and New Georgia Island in the Solomon Islands, aiming at Munda and continuing to advance forward. The Japanese army and navy stationed there are fighting bravely. In New Guinea Island, a part of the U.S. army landed in Nassau Bay on June 30, and another part went north from SARS and invaded. In addition, a part of the Australian army echoed this and attacked near Salamaua. Our army also intercepted it near Salamaua, and on the 5th of this month, it unexpectedly attacked the enemy's rear in the Papabun region, and all of them fled in panic. In addition, the two islands of Moa and Creina in eastern New Guinea Island, which have not been occupied by our army, seem to have been occupied by a part of the U.S. army around the 1st of this month. Initially, the United States publicized that this operation would first occupy Rabaul, take this as a base, and then advance to cut off the connection between the Japanese army and Mango Island, or use it as a smokescreen for new operations in other areas. However, the progress of its operations was not only not as it intended, but also suffered great losses. Therefore, it falsely claimed that this was to defend Australia, or to capture Rabaul, only to occupy the bases near the area. It further stated to its people that this great sacrifice was expected in order to cover up the traces of defeat.

### Mussolini Praises Great East Asia Policy, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Replies with a Thank You Message

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo previously issued the Great East Asia Declaration at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet. This has aroused great goodwill internationally, especially in the Axis countries, which have unanimously expressed their welcome. Now, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, on the 8th, entrusted the Italian Ambassador to Japan with a statement to be handed over to Prime Minister Tojo. The content of the statement was roughly as follows: I am one of the people who praised General Tojo's policy. I believe that this kind of policy is the most appropriate way to solve various problems in East Asia. I will convey this meaning to General Tojo. Also, Interlabos is an old friend of mine. I firmly believe that the cause he is undertaking will be completed. Therefore, it is urgent to assist Bose, and please also convey this to Your Excellency. After receiving the letter, Prime Minister Tojo immediately instructed Japanese Ambassador to Italy Hidaka to reply to Prime Minister Mussolini on the 16th, saying in the main: Your Excellency's praise for the policy adopted by our country to solve various problems in East Asia, wrongly, has increased our belief that the Axis will win (omitted in the middle), and I express my deep gratitude to the Italian Prime Minister.

War Situation Outside the South Pacific

Major General Tanihagi briefly described the war situation in various aspects other than the South Pacific as follows: In Burma, although it is now the rainy season, the British and Indian troops on the border still attack from time to time with small-scale troops, or use aircraft to disturb the rear, trying to recapture the area. However, they were repelled by our army at any time and place, so they have not succeeded at all. Britain appointed Wavell as the Governor-General of India, and established a new East Asia Operations Command in an attempt to exaggerate the situation. It also said that after the capture of Tunisia, it would transfer the ships in the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, preparing to carry out new operations after the rainy season. This is also what we are looking forward to, so that it can repeat the ugly drama on the Mayu Riverbank of the Arakan Mountains this spring. In addition, the aid of aircraft from India to Chongqing has continued unabated. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing began to move again after the weather turned better in early May. Recently, it has been constantly blindly bombing Hankou, Guangzhou, Vietnam, Haiphong, and other places. The enemy forces in the Aleutians seem to be deeply shaken by the spirit of Japanese soldiers after the Battle of Attu Island, but their ambition to seize Kiska Island has not diminished. They carry out air raids or bombard from the coast from time to time, but our garrison ensures the island and destroys the enemy's morale, which is extremely strong.

### The Situation of Fierce Battles in New Georgia and Other Places, Concrete Explanation by Lieutenant Commander Tashiro

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant Commander Tashiro of the Press Section of the Japanese General Headquarters gave a concrete explanation of the battle situation on New Georgia Island and Rendova Island at the plenary session of the Japanese Central Cooperation Council today, citing facts in order to promote the greatest determination of the Japanese people. He said: When the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet was convened in mid-June, the Minister of the Navy had already made a statement on the naval war situation. Therefore, what I am talking about today is the battle situation centered on New Georgia Island. The Japanese bases in that area are Rabaul Island and Buka Island between Rabaul and Guadalcanal Island. Guadalcanal and Rabaul are 600 kilometers apart, Rabaul and Buka are 300 kilometers apart, and New Georgia Island is in the center between Buka and Guadalcanal Islands. The island is 120 kilometers away from Guadalcanal, and its shape is like a cucumber. In the northwest is Kolombangara Island, which is shaped like a lotus leaf. The distance between the two islands is 15 kilometers at its widest point and 7 kilometers at its narrowest point. On the southern coast of the island of New Georgia is Munda Port. Five kilometers south of Munda Port is Rendova Island, which is shaped like a pipe. The area of fierce fighting now is centered on New Georgia, Kolombangara, and Rendova. Now I will briefly explain the situation before the enemy troops landed on Rendova Island on June 30. Therefore, since the beginning of the month, it has gradually increased its air force strength. At the same time, the strength of the Japanese air force has also gradually increased. The two sides are confronting each other, or bombing each other's air bases, or destroying each other's reinforcement routes, or engaging in aerial combat, almost every day. As the air force strength of both sides increased, the fighting became more and more intense. After entering June, the Japanese air force repeatedly bombed the enemy bases on Guadalcanal and the enemy air bases on the remote New Hebrides and Little Islands. In addition, it has repeatedly attacked the enemy's large transport convoys on Pinesel Island and Longa Bay, and has also engaged in fierce air battles with the enemy in the skies over St. Trand. On the other hand, the enemy has also repeatedly launched attacks on our positions, air bases, and ground troops. The days with the most enemy planes coming to attack after June reached 70 or more than 100. The Japanese army and naval ground troops on New Georgia Island and Kolombangara Island in that area used machine guns to shoot down the enemy planes that came to attack under the enemy's attack. This is what I personally witnessed and heard in that area. This is no different from crashing enemy aircraft carriers with planes. On the morning of June 30, enemy cruisers, destroyers, transport convoys, etc. appeared west of Rendova Island. Since the First Battle of the Solomon Sea, every time the enemy carried out a large-scale landing operation, it was followed by a large fleet, and at the same time, a large-scale naval battle was often launched. However, this time it was different. Landing craft and dozens of naval vessels, a total of 200, were full of troops, weapons, ammunition, and headed towards Rendova. At the same time, destroyers and cruisers were used as the main body for protection. After our army discovered the enemy ships, it immediately engaged in battle. The damage inflicted on the enemy has been announced by the General Headquarters. I will not repeat the numbers here. However, if we consider that 31 of our planes have not returned, we can know how fierce this battle was and how loyal and brave our army was. The failure of these 31 planes to return is actually only determined by the great sacrifice of 40 planes not returning in the South Pacific naval battle last year. After the enemy troops landed on Rendova Island, they advanced from the north of Rendova Island to a small island between Munda and Rendova to the south of New Georgia the next day. This is Rubiana Island. Enemy traces have also been found in that area on July 1. On July 2 and 3, the enemy used part of its forces to land in the southern area of Munda. On the other hand, enemy troops also landed on the mid-southern coast of New Georgia. The fierce battle between the two armies with Rendova and Rubiana Island as the center, its color is the one announced by the General Headquarters. The air force of our army on the front line is now in close contact with naval vessels or ground troops, and is fighting the enemy with a spirit of brave attack, and is fiercely counterattacking the enemy advancing from the south of Rendova Island. In addition, the enemy also attempted to launch an attack in the northwest of New Georgia Island, because from the evening of the 4th to the 5th of this month, it suddenly invaded Kula Bay between New Georgia Island and Kolombangara Island in the northwest, and a part of it attempted to land on the northwest coast of New Georgia Island, Rise, and Bairoko West within it. As a result, the part of it that wanted to land in the Bairoko area has been repelled. That night, due to the cooperation of the artillery of our army and naval ground troops and the water and need teams, three enemy ships were sunk first. A few of our destroyers, which were engaged in combat that evening, encountered a powerful enemy fleet consisting of more than ten cruisers and destroyers to the north of Kolombangara Island. Our destroyers immediately attacked the enemy cruisers, and sank one of them, and another one was also hit and caught fire. This is just like the battle when our destroyer defeated the enemy cruiser in the Battle of Bali Island in the past. The water mine team was unparalleled in bravery, so the enemy was greatly defeated and retreated in the night battle of Kula Bay. After that, the enemy actively gathered its forces on the northwest coast of Kula Bay, and our army and naval ground troops fiercely attacked them. This has been announced by the General Headquarters on the 12th. At this point, the enemy began to think about shifting the focus of attack to Munda Bay. On the 12th, the enemy troops in the Kula Bay area attempted to land again. That night, an enemy force of more than four cruisers encountered our water mine team on the sea off Kolombangara Island, and a fierce battle broke out again. As a result, several enemy cruisers were sunk or destroyed. After that, the battle in the Munda area was appropriately announced yesterday. The enemy landed from Rubiana Island to the east of Munda, and another part also approached Munda to attack. Our army saw this and attacked them fiercely. The enemy released smoke, but our army and naval ground troops fiercely counterattacked and repelled the enemy. The enemy lost more than 20 boats and fled in a panic. At this time, a part of the enemy troops that had already landed also attacked again. As a result, they were also repelled. What has been described above is the tragic and fierce battle situation centered on New Georgia Island, the enemy and our air battle, sea battle, and ground troop battle.

### Advisor Teraoka Talks About the Spirit of the Japanese Navy at the Training Camp

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The New Movement Association's civil servants and youth corps training camp specially invited Major General Teraoka, advisor to the Military Commission, to give a lecture at the camp at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (the 15th), entitled "The Spirit of the Japanese Navy." He explained the spirit of the Japanese navy's brave fighting in detail, and it lasted for one and a half hours before it was dismissed.

### Recent Developments in the South Pacific: Japanese Air Force's Successes Over the Past Ten Days – Large Formation of Japanese Planes Again Bombard Torokina Island – Japanese Fishing Boat Downs Enemy Plane Over Koale Bay

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – New army and navy air units in the South Pacific, in cooperation with ground battles in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, have been continuously bombing enemy bases day and night, and actively escorting convoys, inflicting great damage on the enemy. Based on the combined results achieved in early July (1st to 10th): twenty-two enemy aircraft shot down, five 5,000-ton class enemy transport ships sunk, one 5,000-ton class ship destroyed, numerous small boats sunk, and enemy ground facilities and landing points destroyed at more than five locations, all set ablaze. The Japanese side lost ten aircraft.

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) – According to a Melbourne broadcast by American wireless, a large formation of Japanese aircraft again attacked Torokina Island in the Solomon Islands today. It is reported that Japanese aircraft also flew to Torokina Island on the 13th, bombing the anti-Axis forces' positions and equipment there.

Rangoon, 16th (Central News Agency) – On June 29th, at 7:30 PM, a Japanese fishing boat sailing from here to Winkaung (150 kilometers south of Japanese-held Kyaukse) was attacked by a medium-sized enemy aircraft near Koale Bay. The fishing boat's crew immediately fired back with light machine guns and rifles, ultimately shooting down the enemy aircraft over Koale Bay. It is noted that it is rare for a fishing boat to shoot down an aircraft, and it has been widely praised.

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports from New York: Former US Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, warned in a speech on Wednesday night against underestimating Japan's strength. He said that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association is encouraging the people to prepare for greater sacrifices. Based on his years of experience in Tokyo, he knows that the Japanese people are willing to support the Association. America is far from the real battlefield, and the Japanese believe that Americans are too complacent about this.

### Japanese Expeditionary Force in China Announces Weekly Battle Situation

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced the battle situation for the week on July 16th: Recently, the Japanese Expeditionary Force has repeatedly launched vigorous mopping-up operations. The Chongqing army has completely gone into hiding. No active resistance has been seen on any front, and they seem focused on recuperating and replenishing their strength. The Chongqing side's dream of continuing resistance now only depends on the United Kingdom and the United States. To launch a counter-offensive against Burma after the rainy season, the Chongqing side has sent a considerable number of troops to that area, willingly obeying the commands of the United Kingdom and the United States and sacrificing the happiness of East Asia. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is strengthening its control over the Chongqing Air Force and is expanding its troop presence on the India Road under the pretext of assisting Chongqing, revealing their ambition more and more openly. They are also taking coercive measures against the Chongqing side, planning to place it under their control. It is said that fierce arguments broke out between the Chongqing and American sides during the round table conference held in Chongqing on the 25th and 26th of last month, which proves this point in general. At the same time, the internal conflicts inherent in US-Chongqing cooperation have become apparent. As the world is approaching the decisive battle stage, the exposure of such discords between the US and Chongqing is noteworthy. The Japanese Expeditionary Force is currently continuing to carry out mopping-up operations in various places in order to consolidate the security of the rear.

### No Major Changes in the Sicilian Battle Situation

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) – The German High Command's daily war bulletin stated today: German-Italian Allied forces yesterday repelled countless enemy offensives on the island of Sicily. These offensives were launched in the areas of Agrigento and Catania. The enemy lost many tanks. At the same time, the German-Italian air force fiercely attacked enemy ships off the coast of the island. Several enemy transport ships were either sunk or severely damaged. From the 10th to the 14th of this month, at least fifty-two transport ships used by the enemy for landing, totaling 300,000 tons, were sunk, and countless others were rendered unusable due to bombing.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) – Reuter's military correspondent, Captain Sertorius, declared: In the twenty-four hours from Wednesday to noon on Thursday, there were no major changes in the situation in Sicily. British and American forces continue to attempt to penetrate the interior, but have been resisted by Axis forces and repeatedly repelled with the help of tanks. The territory partially occupied by British and American forces in certain areas has no major significance from a military point of view. The fighting spirit and morale of the German and Italian defenders of the island are completely unshaken. The Axis command now possesses a large number of fresh troops that have not yet participated in the fighting. On the other hand, the anti-Axis forces have also transferred reinforcements from overseas and have landed and reinforced in the coastal occupied areas. On Wednesday, British and American forces made no further attempts to land at other locations on the coast of Sicily. There is also no sign that other units of the British and American troops that have already landed are joining the fighting. The current battle situation in Sicily can be described as follows: On the right wing of General Montgomery's forces, the pressure on Catania continues, but so far, they have not been able to cross the plain south of the city. On Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, British tanks and British paratroopers who landed in Catania failed to link up. The swift and complete elimination of these paratroopers has greatly affected the British High Command's strategic plans. At the same time, new German reserves south of Catania have launched counter-offensives in several locations and pushed the British forces back several kilometers. The central forces of the British Eighth Army are still suffering heavy losses in the mountains west of Syracuse and Avola, with no progress. On the left wing of General Montgomery's forces, when passing through Modica towards Ragusa, they encountered strong resistance from the Italian army north of that area. In the more western region, American forces are currently engaged in extremely fierce battles. The Canadian troops operating on the left wing of General Patton's American forces are advancing northwest towards Naro. Although the American forces seem to have made some gains, they are of no major significance.

### Turin Air Raid

Rome, 16th (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports: It has been learned here that Turin was recently subjected to an air raid, resulting in 400 deaths and 601 injuries.

### German Army Repels Soviet Offensive on Eastern Front

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) – The German High Command's daily war bulletin stated today: Although the weather was bad yesterday, the great battle continued in the central sector of the Eastern Front. Our forces advanced further north of Belgorod and encircled a powerful enemy force. The enemy's offensive momentum in this theater has greatly diminished yesterday due to heavy losses in recent days. The enemy launched offensives using infantry and tanks from the Kursk to Sukhinichi line, but were all repelled. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. In one German sector alone, the enemy lost 250 tanks. Despite the treacherous weather, German aircraft worked hard to support the German army and shot down 49 enemy aircraft.

Moscow, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Soviet Information Bureau announced last night: "After several counter-attacks, our forces have launched offensives against the German army to the east and north of Orel."

### Wang Kemin Discusses the Recent Situation in North China in Nanjing – Flew from Nanjing to Shanghai Yesterday

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Council, met with domestic and foreign journalists at the International Club at 11:30 AM on the 16th and gave a speech. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Shao Donghu, a counselor of the North China Political Council, served as the translator. The main points of Mr. Wang's speech are recorded below: There are two most important issues in North China now: (1) food, and (2) security. These two issues are interrelated. North China has never been a rice-producing region. Before the incident, the supply of food relied on imports from other ports. After the incident, food became even scarcer. Therefore, recently, those in North China with some assets mostly eat wheat flour, while the lower classes eat miscellaneous grains. Therefore, I pay close attention to issues such as food regulation and increased production. This matter is being actively worked on by Wang Yintai, the Superintendent of Industry, to formulate reasonable and satisfactory concrete measures to solve the current food panic in North China. As for the security issue, after years of efforts by responsible officials, the security of North China has achieved remarkable results. Recently, the North China Political Affairs Commission established a Communist Suppression Committee, and each province, city, and county has also established separate Communist Prevention Associations to carry out comprehensive Communist prevention work, with the aim of ensuring the security of North China. Later, reporters raised the following questions: (1) What is the relationship between North China affairs and the Central Government? (2) What new plans are there for North China's future administrative measures? (3) What are the plans for improving the exchange of goods between the North and the South? (4) What are your thoughts on the East Asia War and Prime Minister Tojo's new policy towards China? (5) The unification of the Central Government and North China is not without the influence of currency. Does the North China Political Affairs Commission have any concrete measures in this regard? (6) The disaster situation in North China this year is very serious. Are there any concrete relief measures? According to Mr. Wang's reply: North China belongs to the Central Government. The North China Political Affairs Commission is an organization under the control of the National Government. All future administrative measures will be handled in accordance with the intentions of the central government. As for the issue of promoting future administrative affairs, since I have just taken office, I have no concrete plans in this regard. However, Chairman Zhu has already made very good plans, and I will naturally follow the established plans, referring to the actual situation and needs, to gradually promote and improve them. Regarding the issue of the exchange of goods between the North and the South in the future, this point is extremely important. I will instruct the competent authorities to formulate concrete and appropriate measures to ensure the smooth exchange of goods between the North and the South. The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War is a powerful manifestation of our friendly nation Japan's pursuit of the independence and liberation of East Asian nations. The National Government's participation in the war not only expresses the spirit of sharing weal and woe with our friendly nation, but also embodies the solidarity and cooperation of our East Asian nations. I express my deep gratitude and excitement for Prime Minister Tojo's policy speech. Under the leadership of the Central Government, North China will work together with our friendly nation to advance towards the completion of the war. Regarding the currency issue in North China, I am planning to consider it, but there are currently no concrete measures. As for the disaster situation in North China, the harvest in various parts of North China this year is still good, averaging about 50-60%, and there is no actual disaster situation. The main reason is the lack of materials. Therefore, I will advocate for smoother exchange of goods between the North and the South, so that North China will not have a panic due to a lack of materials, and the people's livelihood can be stabilized.

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, came to Nanjing this time to report his inauguration to the Chairman and request instructions. He has been busy visiting various related agencies and attending social gatherings in recent days. Mr. Wang's mission to Nanjing has been completed. He took off from Nanjing for Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 16th, accompanied by Counselor Shao Donghu. He plans to handle private matters in Shanghai and will stay for two or three days before returning to Beiping.

According to staff from a neighborhood office in the Hongkou district's naval security association, the district is scheduled to implement its second widespread epidemic prevention vaccination on August 1st. Currently, staff from each neighborhood are actively preparing to assist doctors in maintaining order while vaccinating residents in sequence. It is reported that the Hongkou district's sanitation results this year have improved significantly compared to the past. The mortality rate has gradually decreased, and various epidemic diseases are also rarely found. The neighborhood's youth department is currently training cadre members, with training sessions held every Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning, it is said.

### Investigation Begins to Prevent Smuggling and Hoarding of Materials – Material Control Review Organizations Widely Established in Various Locations

The various trade associations in this city, to prevent the smuggling of materials out of the country and to reduce reserves, have issued separate notices stating: "It has been found that although the city's material reserves are still quite sufficient, it has recently been reported that some colleagues are selling entire batches of materials to small vendors at inflated prices. This behavior not only violates the association's regulations and the authorities' purpose of suppressing prices and cracking down on hoarding, but also has a great impact on the future supply of materials. It should be known that in this extraordinary period, citizens should be frugal and save, in order to prevent future problems. Merchants should abide by regulations to maintain the virtue of merchants. Moreover, the authorities are now making painstaking efforts to stabilize prices in various places, revive local industry and commerce, and vigorously prevent hoarding and strictly control, so that the exchange of goods tends to be smooth. All of my colleagues must abide by the regulations and only sell any kind of goods to legitimate users, and there should be appropriate restrictions to prevent hoarding. If there is any buying and selling that does not comply with the regulations, the association will not provide protection once it is discovered by the authorities."

Strict Investigation

Recently, police detectives belonging to various authorities have been particularly strict in their investigation work. According to reporter inquiries yesterday, there are a large number of police detectives near the various land and water terminals and traffic arteries. If anyone is carrying a larger package or seems suspicious, they will be ordered to stop and be strictly searched. If a large number of materials are found that are attempting to be smuggled out of the country, they will be detained and sent to the bureau for verification. It has been found that recently, due to the chaos of prices in Shanghai and the urgent need for goods in various places, the evil trend of trafficking has become increasingly rampant, which has a considerable impact on the city's commerce.

Material Control

Review Organization. The Material Control Review Committee is the highest national authority for reviewing material control countermeasures. In addition to recommending candidates and preparing to establish the "Wuhan Branch of the Material Control Review Committee," it is also establishing an office in Shanghai. The work of this office will especially focus on the connection with the Business Coordination Committee, so that the review and implementation of material policies can reach a state of integration. At the same time, according to inquiries from the Shanghai News Agency, the Business Coordination Committee, in view of the increasing expansion of its affairs, is preparing to establish the "Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Three-Province Branch" in the Wuhan area and is scheduled to establish an office in Nanjing this month.

### Income Tax Bureau Plans to Levy Foreign Residents' Income Tax and Conduct On-site Inspection of Account Books of Various Industries

The Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Collection Bureau have been actively promoting various types of taxes. Companies and firms that have complied with regulations to declare their income have been enthusiastic, and tax revenue is thriving. From January to mid-July of this year, more than 20 million yuan has been collected, which is several times more than the previous tax revenue. The bureau, in view of the fact that a portion of business establishments in the first category of profit-making income tax have been late in filing, has selected cadres to implement account audits and collections house-by-house, street-by-street, and industry-by-industry. If various businesses delay in filing, make false or concealed reports, refuse to audit accounts, or use the excuse of not having account books, the bureau will directly determine their tax liability in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and report to the judicial authorities to enforce the collection and execution of punishment in accordance with the Income Tax Punishment and Collection Execution Rules. Also, once the tax amount is determined, it should be paid within the time limit. If payment is delayed, a fine of up to one time the amount of tax owed will be imposed. It is heard that the bureau has now agreed with the city's courts on the implementation of punishment and collection methods. Also, the bureau believes that the period for the recovery of the two concessions is approaching, and is now planning to levy income tax on various foreign-owned businesses. It is estimated that this tax revenue will definitely be considerable in the future, benefiting the national treasury in no small way.

### Reorganization of the Taxpayer Association – Chen Jicheng Proposes a Plan

Chen Jicheng, chairman of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai Municipal Council, believes that the Taxpayers' Association has gloriously resisted the oppressive forces of Britain and the United States in the past few years. Now that the concessions have been recovered, there is actually nothing to do. If the association is to be dissolved, it would be a great pity. It is heard that Mr. Chen is drafting a plan to change the name of the association and reorganize it, which can both preserve its glorious history and create new business. Once the plan is drafted, it will be submitted to the government for approval.

### Japanese Economic Mission Hosts Various Sectors Yesterday – Tea Party at the Astor House Hotel

### Commemorating the Recovery of the Concessions – Performing the Play "Family"

Since the National Government announced the recovery of the concessions on August 1st, various agencies and organizations have been working together to prepare. It is heard that the theatrical circles in this city, on the occasion of this epoch-making event, will hold a joint grand performance. The play has been determined to be "Family" written by Wu Tian, and the original writer will make appropriate changes to the content to suit the significance of this celebration. Liang Xiuyu, director of the Municipal Propaganda Office, believes that theatrical performances are most effective in promoting propaganda, so he attaches great importance to them. He hosted a banquet for the heads of various theater troupes at the Jinmen Hotel last night. The heads of various theater troupes organized a joint performance preparation committee and assigned roles in the play. All are core members of various theater troupes. The strength of the lineup is unprecedented in recent years. Hong Mo will serve as the director, and the performance date is scheduled for early August.

### Amidst the Unified Promotion of Charitable Undertakings: A Visit to the Poor and Sick Relief Association (Part 3) - The Organizational Structure of the Religious Relief Association

So, how does the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association go about promoting and guiding the work of various charitable organizations? The person in charge of the association specifically introduced its organizational characteristics. The association is purely a non-governmental organization. All initiators are members. Any organization or individual that supports the association can become a member with the recommendation of three executive committee members. A general membership meeting is held every six months. Executive committee members are elected by the members (21 to 25 members). The executive committee elects seven standing committee members (Chairman: Wen Lanting; Vice Chairmen: Lin Kanghou and Yuan Ludeng; Committee Members: Wu Yunzhai, Xiang Kangyuan, and Guan Qun). A supervisory committee of seven to eleven members is also formed (Committee Members: Ding Houqing and Guo Shun). Under this upper-level organization, there is a secretary-general (Xiang Kuyuanshi), as well as secretaries and treasurers, to handle daily affairs. To promote various practical tasks, in addition to the executive and supervisory committee members, specialized committees such as advisory, fundraising, design, review, and fund management are established by the executive and supervisory committee members based on the importance of the tasks, to collaborate and develop the association's undertakings.

The first step, naturally, is fundraising, which is managed by the fundraising committee (Chairman: Zhao Jinqing; Vice Chairmen: Wu Yunzhai and Wang Boyuan). Fundraising is carried out in groups, with each group having a leader (selected from the committee members). Fundraising certificates are issued for all donations, with each booklet containing fifty sequentially numbered certificates. Each group leader reports on the fundraising results every half month. In addition, there are publicity and public relations groups to enhance the effectiveness of fundraising. Several banks, including Jincheng, Dalu, Shanghai, Xiye, Runqin, and Great Wall, as well as Fuyuan and Tongyuan pawnshops, are also engaged to collect donations. In addition to the fundraising committee, there is a fund management committee (Chairman: Ye Fuxiao; Vice Chairmen: Pei Yunqing and Zhu Boquan) specifically responsible for managing the funds. Except for payments submitted by the review committee and approved by the standing committee, no other expenses can be made. The use of donations must be approved by one of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the association's standing committee, one of the standing committee members, one of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the management committee, and the treasurer, who must jointly stamp the documents. To ensure prudence, the association has also established strict "accounting regulations." The purpose is to ensure that not a single cent of the money donated by the public is wasted, and that every cent is used effectively. At the same time, this can serve as a model for all charitable organizations, as a pioneer in improving future charitable undertakings, and to encourage people to donate generously.

18,000 Shi of Rice from Suzhou, Yangzhou, and Huzhou Arrive in Shanghai; All 200,000 Shi Will Arrive Soon; 19th Phase of Rice Distribution in the City at One Sheng Per Capita

The Shanghai citizen's food problem, which is the focus of attention of the city's five million residents, has seen rumors quelled and the black market for rice suppressed, with public sentiment trending towards stability, due to the steady flow of rice from Suzhou, Yangzhou, and Huzhou. According to reporter investigations, the amount of rice that has already arrived in Shanghai has reached approximately 18,000 shi as of yesterday. The rice from the three areas is currently being transported by both land and water routes under a sound organizational structure. Within a day or two, all 200,000 shi of rice should arrive in Shanghai. The 19th phase of per capita rice distribution in the city will be carried out as scheduled.

Lieutenant Saltian Elaborates on the Historical Significance of "Sea Day": A Deep Understanding of the Sea is Necessary for Any Nation Wishing to Become a World Power

The regular meeting hosted by the three Japanese authorities in Shanghai (Army, Navy, and Overseas Affairs) to entertain the Chinese press corps of this city was held yesterday (16th) at 3:00 PM at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, as usual. First, Lieutenant Saltian of the Combined Fleet Press Department gave a detailed explanation of the history and meaning of "Sea Day." Mr. Saltian began by saying, "The 20th of this month is Japan's Sea Day. We who live on land should have a deep understanding of land, sea, and air. Any nation wishing to become a world power must control the air and sea in addition to the land. Today, in the midst of the Great East Asia War, control of the sea is even more important. Therefore, we should have a deep understanding of the sea. Currently, the Japanese military has control over the vast Pacific and Indian Oceans, which fully demonstrates Japan's extraordinary naval power. We are pleased to celebrate the third Sea Day this year, and its significance is even greater. This year, in Japan, in order to further promote knowledge of the sea, the entire nation will celebrate as usual. In Shanghai, preparations are also underway for commemorative ceremonies, organized by the Shanghai branch of the Naval Association, the Shanghai Japanese Residents' Association, and the Naval懇話會 (Naval Round-Table Conference)." Then, Mr. Saltian expressed his hope that the Chinese people would also have a deep understanding of the sea and make contributions in this regard. Finally, he described the history of Sea Day, saying that in the Meiji 9th year, the Japanese Emperor toured northeastern Japan to gain a better understanding of the sea. After completing the tour on the 明治丸 (Meiji Maru), the ship returned safely to Yokohama. In recent years, the Japanese authorities' Maritime Affairs Bureau, recognizing the importance of 梅, has taken charge of the development of the sea and sought to make people deeply aware of it. Therefore, it was decided that the day of the Meiji Emperor's tour should be designated as a commemorative date to promote the spirit and ideas, and to deeply understand and respect the hard work and achievements of sailors. Therefore, it was specifically designated as a national commemorative ceremony, which has now been celebrated for many years.

### Citywide Sugar Sales to Begin on the 21st

The fifth phase of per capita sugar distribution in this city has been approved by the sugar merchant cooperative business office to continue processing by the military allocation authorities. It has been determined that the allocation is ready, and it is scheduled to be sold simultaneously in all districts of the city from the 21st to the 31st of this month. The quantity will remain at half a jin per person, and the selling price will be 2.35 yuan. All other procedures will be exactly the same as in previous phases.

### Regulations for Admitting Patients to Epidemic Hospitals

In view of the fact that summer has arrived and public and private epidemic hospitals have been established in this city, the Bureau of Health has specifically stipulated the following provisional supplementary measures for admitting epidemic patients to facilitate strict management: (1) After admitting an epidemic patient, a form should be filled out and reported to the Bureau immediately, or directly reported to the affiliated agencies of the Bureau nearby (such as health offices, health affairs offices, municipal hospital clinics, etc.) so that personnel can be dispatched quickly to carry out disinfection procedures. (2) After the patient is admitted to the hospital, a stool test should be performed promptly, and the test results should be reported to the Bureau in detail. When the patient recovers and is discharged from the hospital, the stool must be tested more than twice before discharge is allowed. After a patient dies, it is best to cremate the body immediately. If burial is desired, the burial site designated by the Bureau must be approved. It must be far away from residences and water sources, the pit must be seven feet deep, lime must be sprinkled inside and outside the coffin and in the burial pit, the coffin seams should be sealed, the coffin lid should be five feet below the ground, and the soil should be restored. At that time, the Bureau of Health will also send personnel to supervise the household to carry out the above-mentioned necessary procedures.

Sports

### Huatong Cup Charitable Football Tournament: Lianyi to Face Sao Paolo in Opening Match Today at 6:00 PM at Xuhui Stadium

Mr. Jiang Yixin, president of the Huatong Sports Association, promoted summer football and donated the ticket revenue to the Tongtong Orphanage. He initiated the Huatong Cup Chinese-Western Charitable Football Tournament, inviting the two giants of the football world, Lianyi and the Sao Paolo Alliance, to compete in a three-game, two-win series. The first match is scheduled for 6:00 PM today at the Xuhui Middle School Stadium. The second match will be held at the same venue next Wednesday (21st). To make the event more grand, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Deputy Kui of the Public Works Department, will perform the opening kick-off ceremony today. Tickets are 20 yuan. During the intermission, the match ball will be auctioned. Mr. Jiang will also donate a trophy to the winning team. This battle is not only based on charitable motives but is also a battle for the leadership of football in this city. Currently, among Western football teams, Sao Paolo and Sao Francisco are considered to be the best. The essence of the first-class foreign generals has been gathered here. This time, they have joined forces to fight side by side, and their strength should not be underestimated. Today's battle is naturally a big enemy for Lianyi. However, Lianyi will fight with the most standard lineup today. In addition, Song Lingsheng's leg injury has recovered, and he can play today. The best central defender in the Far East is finally complete and flawless. At the same time, Zhang Lingen's big-foot style, matched with Li Tiansheng, has its own merits in terms of speed. They are not worried about the Sao Paolo's fierce offensive. In addition, Gao Baozheng and Fei Chunhua are both in their best state. Wu Qixiang has been transferred to the left wing, and he can cooperate tacitly with the two veterans, A Li and Lao Sun, and exert their magical martial arts. It can be expected that they will defeat the enemy and overcome the results, washing away the old shame of Donglian, and the excitement of the process is self-evident. In this post-season scenery, such a grand event is rare, and it is expected that the grand occasion on Xuhui Road today will be unprecedented. This charity match has been greatly supported by celebrities Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and Jian Jiaqi, and their kindness and righteousness are admirable. If it rains today, you can call Xuhui Middle School at 74929 at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The audience can take public bus route 22 in the French Concession or tram route 2 of the French Concession to reach the school directly. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

### Mr. Yamada and Mr. Ueno Met with Magazine Industry Representatives Yesterday, Hoping to Promote Cultural Exchanges between China and Japan

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Mr. Yamada Kenkichi, managing director of the Japan Greater East Asia Publishing Company, and Mr. Ueno Iwao, director of the Greater East Asia Publishing Culture Research Institute, have been quite busy with social engagements since arriving in Shanghai a few days ago. The newspaper held a tea party to entertain the two gentlemen, introducing them to people from the Shanghai press circles for a cordial exchange of ideas. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Since the publishing and cultural industry is inseparable from the magazine industry, and it has significant implications for cultural exchanges between China and Japan, this newspaper once again held a tea party at the Asia Building at 5:00 PM yesterday, introducing the two gentlemen to colleagues from the magazine industry in this city. Those who attended included Mr. Yamada and Mr. Ueno, as well as magazine industry representatives Zhou Shoujuan, Liu Yusheng, Tao Kangde, Yang Guangzheng, Ye Deming, and Ren Yunpeng, representative of the Magazine Federation, and others, more than ten people in total. During the event, Mr. Chen, president of this newspaper, introduced the magazine industry representatives one by one.

Ueno's Speech

Then, Mr. Ueno gave a speech, saying: "We are grateful to Mr. Chen, president of Shen Bao, for introducing us to people from the press yesterday, and we are very honored to be able to meet with representatives from the Shanghai magazine publishing house today. We have long known that Shanghai is the cultural center of China, and the magazine representatives are the best in the magazine industry. Therefore, we hope to hear the insights of authoritative figures in the magazine industry, so that we can learn from them. In today's wartime, the gentlemen of the magazine industry have worked hard in their positions and fulfilled their missions, which is truly admirable. We hope that you will give us your valuable experience and superior achievements as a guide for our publishing industry and the magazine industry. This time, we came to China to investigate the cultural publishing industry in your country. After completing our task in Shanghai, we will go to Nanjing, Beijing, and other places to inspect. Although we will be separated from you, there will still be opportunities to meet in the future. However, today's opportunity is rare. We hope that all of you will express your opinions and expectations for the Japanese magazine industry. We will convey them one by one to the people and cultural circles in our country." Finally, he mentioned that he regretted not being able to meet with the Chinese representative, Mr. Liu Yusheng, at the opening of the Tokyo Writers' Conference last year due to his duties.

Liu Yusheng's Speech

Then, Mr. Liu Yusheng said: "It is a great pleasure to meet Mr. Ueno and Mr. Yamada this time. Although the Greater East Asia Publishing Company and the Cultural Publishing Research Institute have not been established for long, they are progressing very smoothly. I believe that they will make a significant contribution to the cultural relationship between China and Japan. First of all, we should thank the two of you. I think the two gentlemen know very well the general situation of the magazine industry in Shanghai before meeting with us. There are dozens of magazines published in Shanghai, among which, in addition to one or two magazines with a long history, most of them were founded after the Sino-Japanese Incident. There were even more publications after the Great East Asia War and the participation of the national government in the war. Therefore, whether specialized or general, they are directly or indirectly suitable for the wartime system and exert their functions and strength. Therefore, we believe that all cultural magazines must be more profound in their thinking in addition to their practical performance, in order to gain universal understanding and sympathy. This is what we actively hope to achieve. From the surface, Sino-Japanese cooperation in politics is one thing, and the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese cultural circles is another, but in fact, they are equally important. Therefore, we hope that the magazine industry will work harder. We can trace back to the remarks of the Chinese cultural circles on Sino-Japanese relations after September 18, 1931, which have lost their understanding. Only Xu Zunlin's "Enemy or Friend?" and Chen Binsu's "On Chiang Kai-shek" can best understand the Sino-Japanese relationship. We hope that cultural colleagues will conduct in-depth research on Sino-Japanese relations and move towards this path."

Ye Deming's Speech

Then, Mr. Ye Deming expressed his opinion, saying that one of the four major綱領 (guiding principles) of the East Asia League is cultural communication, but the general Japanese habit is to think that cultural thought and politics cannot be linked together, while the Chinese think that cultural thought cannot be separated from politics. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, ideological movements have never left politics. If it leaves politics for a day, it will inevitably lose touch with reality and end in failure. For example, in the eyes of the Chinese, the Greater East Asia Publishing Company and the Cultural Publishing Research Institute must be linked to politics. In the future, after the two of you inspect Nanjing and Beijing, you will definitely discover this phenomenon. Secondly, the East Asia League movement is still in the initial stage of development in China. From its history and development process, it has eliminated the divisions of parties. Chairman Wang of the National Government has announced that this movement is China's national policy and a concrete development of the Three People's Principles. However, articles by the Japanese cultural and publishing circles on this movement, whether supporting or opposing it, rarely mention it. I hope that in the future, we can understand each other and work together based on the point of cultural communication. Finally, I hope that the Japanese cultural circles can introduce not only the old culture of thousands of years ago, but also the new culture of reality in their introduction to Chinese culture.

Yang Guangzheng's Speech

Then, Yang Guangzheng expressed his opinion on the issue of cultural thought, saying that China and Japan have the conditions for cooperation in terms of geography, culture, and bloodline. However, the transition of thought is even more important. Therefore, if the thought of the Sino-Japanese relationship is transformed, in-depth cooperation can of course be carried out, and we can help each other. However, the realization of this thought must be mutual understanding and mutual equality. There can be great achievements. Many people think that cultural communication between China and Japan must first start with language. However, it is not difficult for us to recall that famous Chinese writers who studied in Japan, such as Guo Moruo, Yu Dafu, and Tian Han, were very fluent in Japanese. However, due to ideological issues, they could not join our camp. Therefore, communication in language alone is not enough. The most important thing is the communication of thought and spirit. In short, the Sino-Japanese relationship cannot simply express friendship on the surface. It must be observed from the people's spirit and heart. Everyone should be honest with each other, frankly point out shortcomings, and have sincere understanding. Furthermore, a thorough communication in culture, thought, and spirit will enable the people of the two countries to accept the highest reality of the Greater East Asia, which is not glorious.

Zhou Shoujuan's Speech

Finally, Zhou Shoujuan, the former leader of the Chinese magazine industry, expressed his aspirations, saying that in addition to his love for literature and art, he also loves gardening, and he admires Japanese bonsai and flower arrangement. In the past, he founded the "Bonsai Magazine" to introduce Chinese and Japanese bonsai. To this day, there are still many precious photos of this kind. Recalling twenty years ago, a certain magazine published in Shanghai translated a book written by a 人 (person), "The Weakness of the Motherland," which is a patriotic novel. The translator was Mr. Taogawa. This is what I am proud of. I hope that we can thoroughly cooperate in culture in the future. Finally, he also talked about the situation of the Japanese publishing industry and the life of cultural people. According to him, Japanese newspapers only sell for five or six yuan, which is very different from the situation in China, where paper is as expensive as洛阳纸贵 (Luoyang paper is expensive). Therefore, there are many publications, and all printing houses are overwhelmed with work, and all are by reservation. The income of cultural people is higher than that of Chinese writers. Each page of about 400 words averages about 10 yuan in Japanese currency. The price of rice is extremely low, with each dou (equivalent to two dou in China) selling for only 5 yuan in Japanese currency, which makes people's lives stable and the cultural undertaking extremely prosperous. After a pleasant conversation, everyone dispersed at seven o'clock.

Economic Review

### The Shanghai Market Today

Not many days ago, we said that the recent surge in prices in Shanghai has exceeded the scope of economic issues and become politically charged because "speculative hoarders are deliberately spreading planned rumors about the recent political situation." As a result, the underground market prices of important commodities are becoming increasingly rampant behind the scenes, which the authorities do not allow to be published, to the point of being uncontrollable, and the people's lives are falling into deep water and fire. As a result, the boiling of prices has led to the boiling of popular resentment. And the elements behind the rumors are exactly as they wished!

To encourage a comprehensive rise in prices, the spreading of rumors is used as an invisible tool, the meaning of which is to depreciate the value of the national currency and increase the threat to people's lives. As for the tangible tools, the most important one is to take advantage of the foolish idea that the people hold about money not being able to be separated from gold, and the bad phenomenon that various markets in Shanghai still follow the gold market. The price of gold is secretly raised, making it rise again and again without end, setting off a fierce surge in the entire Shanghai market, causing the people to sigh that they cannot guarantee their lives in their daily lives, and making themselves reap the profits of the fisherman, while others suffer from rumors. This situation is the Shanghai market today! This situation is the phenomenon that continues to exist in the声中 (midst) of the recovery of the concession!

The Shanghai market today is like a fire about to burn out the prairie. It must be extinguished quickly, otherwise, the economic future of Shanghai is unimaginable.

### Stagnation in the Money Exchange Business; Numerous Reorganizations into Banks, Trading Firms, and Tobacco Shops

The Shanghai Money Exchange Association's member money shops are still in a stagnant state of business. Many are reorganizing into banks, remittance money shops, or tobacco shops. The Qianlian Bank, jointly established by the industry, has shareholders mostly from the money exchange business, and its transactions are also primarily with money exchange firms. The business situation is generally good. Details are as follows:

Depressed Business

Before the incident (likely referring to a war or major event), there was a small amount of foreign currency trading, but business was mediocre. In the two years after the war, because the various markets had not returned to normal, trading in government bonds, stocks, gold, cotton yarn, and foreign currencies became popular. The industry saw many people making large profits, and new businesses sprang up like mushrooms after rain, increasing from over a hundred to more than two hundred. This was the golden age of the money exchange business. However, after the authorities cracked down on speculation, banned black market trading, and the Greater East Asia War broke out, with the subsequent cessation of circulation and trading of British and American currencies, the industry suffered a sharp decline. The business of each shop almost completely stopped. To date, sixty or seventy shops have stopped operating, reorganized into banks, remittance money shops, or tobacco shops. Only about one hundred and fifty shops remain.

Reorganization into Banks

After the money exchange businesses withdrew from the money market and formed their own association, their structures became similar to those of banks and money shops. In addition to running schools, libraries, and barbershops, they first organized a Money Exchange Clearing House and then a Joint Reserve of Money Exchange Businesses, to manage inter-firm check clearing, collection, and transfer. Not long after, the Clearing House was shut down, leaving only the Reserve. In the spring of this year, the businesses agreed to reorganize the Reserve into Qianlian Bank. The bank's capital is two million yuan, jointly invested by the businesses. When the Ministry of Finance ordered both the banking and money industries to increase their total capital, the industry, for the convenience of inter-firm transactions, the board of directors has resolved to increase capital, and a special shareholders' meeting will be convened on the 24th of this month to discuss the amount of the increase. After a decision is made, the procedures will be followed to apply for approval from the Ministry of Finance.

### Strict Enforcement of Price Controls on Cotton Yarn and Cloth

According to inquiries made by a Shanghai News Agency reporter from cotton cloth industry sources, the current inventory of cotton yarn and cloth in this city is still relatively abundant, sufficient for several years of need in Central China. The industry association has decided to strictly prohibit its member businesses from selling above the price limits. All businesses must mark the price limits when selling at retail. If any violations occur, all parties can report and inform on them for investigation. At the same time, those shipping to other areas must first apply to the association for a certificate according to regulations. This certificate must specify: (1) the name of the business; (2) the address; (3) the name of the manager; (4) the destination; (5) the name of the receiving business; (6) the type of cotton yarn and cloth; (7) the total quantity; (8) the manufacturer; (9) the trademark; and (10) the origin and destination. After the certificate is stamped by the association, a transportation permit can be obtained from the Materials Permit Office of the Commercial Control General Association. For non-association members, and if the cotton yarn and cloth have not been registered with the relevant parties, permits will be refused. It is understood that most of the current shipments of cotton cloth are for winter use, and the destinations include Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, and Songjiang. Yesterday, someone familiar with the cloth industry also said that in the last two or three months, the establishment of small cotton cloth shops has been like bamboo shoots after the rain, many using "three-plus discount" as a slogan. Therefore, their daily business is no less than that of large cotton cloth shops. However, these businesses have relatively small capital and limited stock. The Cotton Industry Association previously announced that all businesses should use the city ruler as the standard for measurement to ensure uniformity and compliance with industry regulations.

### Extension of Deadline for Registration of Flour and Wheat Merchants

The control of flour and wheat under the Commercial Control Association system has made significant progress in practice since the Executive Yuan approved the wheat unified purchasing plan and new wheat from various production areas has been introduced. After the members of the Chinese Grain Industry Association, flour and wheat merchants, and Japanese flour milling associations have registered their qualifications and trading, the unified control process will be easier to implement. However, since the start of this registration, some flour and wheat merchants have not been able to complete their qualification registration for understandable reasons. To fully protect the rights and interests of all merchants, the registration deadline is extended to the 20th of this month.

### Flour Mills to Start Production After Wheat Purchase is Completed

After the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Commercial Control General Association decided on the wheat purchase plan, it negotiated a wheat loan of 100 million yuan with Chinese and Japanese banking circles and decided to establish branch offices in major production areas to supervise the wheat purchase. It is now understood that the first step of the branch offices, the qualification registration procedures for wheat shops, vendors, commissioned merchants, and flour milling manufacturers in various places, has been completed. Various merchants have begun purchasing wheat in various production areas at the established prices. It is expected that the purchase work will be completed by the end of this month. It is said that the Fufeng Flour Mill in this city and various Chinese and Japanese flour milling plants in the interior are repairing their machinery and will start producing flour separately in mid-August.

### Estimated Purchases of Corn and Sorghum in Central China

The Oil and Grain Committee has estimated the possible purchase amount of corn and sorghum in various regions of Central China this year: corn is estimated at 50,000 to 100,000 dan in Chongming District, 150,000 dan in Qingpu District, 10,000 dan in the Nantong-Zhenjiang area, 150,000 dan in the Wuhu area, 100,000 dan in the Anqing area, and 30,000 dan in the Tonghai area. Sorghum is estimated at 50,000 dan in the northern Anhui area and 50,000 dan in the Yangzhou-Taidong area, totaling 490,000 to 450,000 dan of corn and 100,000 dan of sorghum.

### Overview of the Work of the Chinese Economic Research Society

The Chinese Economic Research Society is an economic research organization initiated and organized by Zhou Zuomin, Wu Zhen, Tang Shoumin, Li Shengbo, and other people from the economic circles of this city. It is located in the Bank of China on Chengdu Road and Yanan Road. Although it has been established for only a few months, its work has been quite active. The society has a research department responsible for collecting actual materials, conducting surveys and statistics, and editing. In addition, three specialized committees on finance, industry, and trade are set up, with experts from various fields in this city jointly responsible for the implementation of the work. The inaugural issue of the society's "Chinese Economic Bi-monthly," has now been published. Important papers include "On Double Personality and the Financial Market," "Trade and Exchange in North and Central China," "Exchange Under Controlled Economy," and "Economic History of the Qing Dynasty," all of which are novel and informative.

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, after a sharp rise, the Chinese stock market suddenly saw a sharp fall. The sentiment turned from firm to weak. The price of gold plummeted, and stock prices were too high, weakening buying power. Sellers automatically lowered prices, and around noon, supply exceeded demand, and a downtrend began. Although still higher than the previous day, the future is not optimistic, and the market remains chaotic. Yong'an, Xinxin, Guohuo (domestic goods) three department stores, and Da Lai Yi, all fell after reaching new highs. Jinglun and Jingfu shirt and socks stocks were also rising. Yong'an Textiles fluctuated within a narrow range. Rongfeng Textiles showed a slight upward trend. The small-face-value Da Zhonghua Weaving rose to the hurdle. Guoxin, Guoguang, and Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing continued to rise. Nanyang Tobacco Company stood firm outside the hurdle. Da Zhonghua Matches suddenly rose. Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric rose. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Sino-French Pharmacy saw another sharp increase. New Asia Pharmaceutical once broke through a hurdle. Xinyi, Wuzhou, and Four Star perfumes all saw transactions, and prices jumped sharply. The buying and selling prices of the cultural industry companies Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, and World Book Company differed greatly. Various other small-face-value stocks were suddenly favored by investors, such as Jiu'an Industrial, Da Zhonghua Industrial, Xinyi Real Estate, Tongyi Trust, Zhongxing Wood Industry, China Clock Factory, Defeng Knitting, Xin'ya Construction, and Bao'an Glass, all of which rose. China Brick and Tile, and Kangyuan Canning also saw strong increases.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Gold and Silver: The market price and handling fees for gold in silver shops remain the same, but no goods are available for exchange. Outside the industry, the price is chaotic, once exceeding the hurdle before falling back and entering the hurdle again. The price of silver has risen significantly and is about to hit the hurdle.

Daily Necessities: The rise in the price of matches has reached a fever pitch, leading to repeated new highs. Soap and candles struggled at high levels but ultimately also rose. Cigarettes have also risen in price due to market dryness, with Great Britain leading the way. Other brands also saw sharp increases.

### Brief News

The Shanghai Lacquer Industry Association held its inaugural meeting at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. More than one hundred representatives from the Economic Bureau, the City Chamber of Commerce, and member representatives attended. The articles of association were approved, and elections were held. Ye Rixuan and nine others were elected as directors, and Zhang Nanyuan and five others were elected as supervisors, all of whom were sworn into office on the same day.

### Those Who "Know the Times"

— Zhi Wu

Stubborn, old-fashioned people who are stuck in their ways, ignorant of reason, and headstrong are not only making a mistake in terms of the times, but will eventually be abandoned by the torrent of the times.

The Book of Changes says: "How divine is it to know the opportune moment!" A great opportunity is rare and fleeting. Therefore, "those who know the times are outstanding." In life, being able to recognize and grasp the times is the secret to success in a great career.

Therefore, historically, ambitious people have always acted when the opportunity arises and moved when the time is right, never acting rashly. Confucius was a sage of the times who acted when he could and stopped when he could. He appeared when the state was well-governed and disappeared when it was not. He only knew how to protect himself wisely and never went with the flow. As for wise people like Zhang Liang, he was an example of someone who "knew the times." He knew that Liu Bang could share hardship but not prosperity. Therefore, after he had exhausted his loyalty and helped Liu Bang establish the Han Dynasty, he retired to avoid future trouble. Fan Zeng, on the other hand, was unenlightened. He did not leave Chu when Xiang Yu killed Qingzi Champion, but wanted to rely on Xiang Yu to seek fame and fortune. When he finally left, it was too late. This was the result of his "not knowing the times."

Time, time, does not come again! Therefore, those who "know the times" will always steer with the wind, make decisive decisions, and take advantage of the momentum, never going against the tide of the times.

### Returning from Japan (II)

— Sheng Yudu

Men and Women Fulfill Their Duties

The government and people of that country are indeed in a state of war, and what touched me most deeply was the people's obedience and spirit of cooperation. The people of that country absolutely obey the government's orders and do not evade the law to seek advantage. Everyone is self-reliant and sacrifices enjoyment. Men are naturally like this, and women also have this spirit. Those who serve society work outside, while those who manage the family toil inside. They are by no means comparable to those who only apply makeup and consume without producing anything. In short, under wartime conditions, the government's thorough control, the frugality of resources, and the people's fulfillment of their duties, love of country, loyalty to the emperor, and spirit of cooperation with the government are truly a wake-up call to our people. Shanghai has undergone several changes, and dangers have arisen, but it has safely passed through to this day, which is extremely fortunate. However, the future is long, and such fortune is unsustainable. It can happen once, but not again; it can be temporary, but not permanent. If everyone harbors a mentality of luck and rushes to the field of speculation, those who are fortunate enough to succeed will squander their wealth extravagantly, while those who are unlucky will take risks to gamble everything, ultimately losing their families and lives, leading to an irreversible situation. The impact on the country's future and the harm to social security are unimaginable.

The People Should Wake Up

I believe that the nation's struggle for survival and fight for freedom cannot be accomplished by the power of those in government alone. The key lies in the progress of each individual citizen. Gather the strength of each unit to become the strength of the government, and maintain the order of each individual to become the order of society. I hope that the citizens of Shanghai will wake up as soon as possible, abandon their mentality of luck and complacency, and think for the country and for society. The most tempting thing is today's speculative business, hoarding and speculation, which not only harms the country and society, but also has a cyclical harm to themselves. Because the financial resources of a few people are limited, the types of goods they hoard must be very few, and they cannot hoard all the necessities of life at once.

Therefore, I say eliminate luck, reject complacency, and start from the individual, from small things, and build and operate through legitimate means. More production means cultivating more vitality for the country, and saving more resources means storing more strength for the country. Today's sacrifice is tomorrow's enjoyment, today's pain is tomorrow's happiness. Conversely, today's complacency is tomorrow's pain, and today's enjoyment is tomorrow's sacrifice. Although this trip was short, I have many feelings, and I use this to describe the outline, hoping that people will learn from each other's strengths to make up for their own weaknesses. People must help themselves before others help them, and then heaven will help them. I am willing to encourage the citizens of Shanghai together! (The End)

### Chicken

— Shen Shen

She got up, put on her clothes, and ran outside. She glanced at her father sitting on a stool, lost in thought. She couldn't remember much of the chaotic scene she had seen last night after falling asleep.

"Dad! You're up so early! I have three eggs. Dad can take them to town to exchange for some cooking oil." Xiu Bao said, making a "cluck, cluck, cluck" sound, preparing to open the chicken coop and let the chickens out. A hen rushed out, some spreading their wings, some stretching their legs, some relieving themselves, each doing their morning chores. Xiu Bao grabbed a handful of wheat and scattered it on the ground. The hens scrambled to eat it. A Kun silently watched the chickens, more deeply recalling the scene from last night, which deepened the wounds in his heart.

"Oh no! Dad! This isn't good! The guy in the gray cloth clothes from yesterday is back! Look!" Xiu Bao suddenly exclaimed, pointing to two people in gray cloth clothes walking towards their house from the south. The one in front recognized the little fellow who had come yesterday for the chickens. Behind him was a tall man. A Kun raised his head, trying to identify them. In a moment, they had already reached the courtyard. A Kun's heart beat wildly. He expected misfortune to come again! Although he felt hatred, he didn't have the courage to express it!

Several hens were still vying for the scattered wheat, clucking, clucking. They didn't know that misfortune would soon befall them. The little fellow in gray cloth had already spotted the plump hen he had seen yesterday and turned to the tall man, smacking his lips without saying a word.

"Good! A good plump chicken, grab it back and we can have a feast!" the tall man shouted, and started to grab it. The little fellow helped to block the chickens. In a flurry of steps, the hens clucked wildly. Finally, they caught two of them. The poor hens struggled and cried desperately in their hands, but this time there was no way to save them.

"No! No! I won't! My hens are laying eggs! We need them to get oil and salt! No! I won't!" Xiu Bao continued to cry and shout. She stepped forward to snatch them back, but the tall man handed one of the chickens in his right hand to the little fellow, and slapped Xiu Bao, leaving a red mark on her face. Xiu Bao fell to the ground, rolling and crying madly!

"Damn it! I want to eat chicken, I don't care if you want to! If you were a few years older, I'd take you away too, ha! ha! ha! Let's go!" The tall man hummed, a triumphant smile on his face, and walked back the way he came, holding the hen. Xiu Bao was still lying on the ground, crying and shouting loudly.

A Kun sat on a stool nearby, a mix of anger and sorrow, numbing his heart. He vividly remembered the story from last night, how could he dare to say anything? He watched helplessly as they swaggered away, and as Xiu Bao cried and shouted, thinking about the hens! ... the eggs! ... the silver thread! ... the Field Army! ... aiding bandits! ... hiding guns! ... He was even more stupid than a wooden chicken! (The End)

### Recording the North China Emergency Relief Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition

— Dong Gangxiong

On the 15th, I took a car to the fourth floor of No. 12, The Bund to visit the North China Emergency Relief Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition, which I had admired for days. Upon entering, I signed my name and received a catalog and a compilation of Shen Bao editorials and relief news, calling on the entire country to help the disaster victims in North China. I truly admire the thoughtfulness of the organizers.

Passing through a corridor is the charity exhibition hall. Upon entering, I saw many people coming and going, vying to purchase the works. Suddenly, I saw Mr. Lin Kang was also there. His energetic demeanor was truly admirable. In this hot summer, it is truly rare for Mr. to participate in bidding.

Today, I feel very honored to have received Mr. Kang's own "Doing Good is the Greatest Joy," as well as Mr. Qian Hailong's, the child prodigy, "Righteousness and Brilliance," and Mr. Huang Jingwan's autographed work. I am extremely honored. Here, I earnestly urge all sectors of society to participate enthusiastically and contribute to this good cause, so that our suffering compatriots in North China can leave the sea of suffering as soon as possible.

### Dr. Shen Donates Medicine

Dr. Shen Zhongru donated 1,000 packets and 100 bottles of "Sha" medicine to this newspaper yesterday, instructing us to forward them to the poor and sick. We will do so immediately. Dr. Shen's clinic also has medicine to donate. If there are any extremely poor people, they can be introduced by this newspaper, and consultation fees will be waived. The clinic is located at No. 163 Laodagu Road (west end of Marius Vegetable Market).

### Charity School and Scholarship Assistance

Starting from the next semester, Qipu Road, Xintangjia Lane Private Qicheng Primary School, in addition to the original free and reduced fees, has received a donation from school director Mr. Wu Jinling to fund 20 free students. This newspaper can recommend all of them.

Yingshe, at No. 87A Xujiahui Road, Xuhong Road, has admitted many students through its scholarship committee to study at Jiangdong Middle School (No. 232 Fuxu Road). There are still three openings for junior high school students.
