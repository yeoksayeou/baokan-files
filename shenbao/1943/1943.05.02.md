### Weather, Terrain, and Popular Support

"Timely opportunity is not as important as advantageous terrain, and advantageous terrain is not as important as popular support." This is what Mencius considered to be the key to military victory, focusing on "popular support." At the same time, it is also an important factor in strengthening one's position politically. Having a favorable time, having superior terrain, but lacking "popular support" to grasp and utilize them, the result will still be missing the opportunity in the blink of an eye.

In his address to the nation on the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital, the Chairman also specifically pointed out the importance of "popular support." He further pointed out that the collapse of the British Empire was due to the loss of "popular support." Knowing only to promote colonial policies, valuing material things, and treating "people" as "things," tending towards the extreme of utilitarianism, the result was like a river breaking its banks, with a great flood inundating everything, collapsing beyond repair.

What is popular support? In the Chairman's explanation: "Besides the body, people also have spirit; besides labor, they also have personality and consciousness. Respecting their personality and consciousness, so that my spirit unites with the spirit of the people, this is called popular support." This "popular support" of everyone's spirit united as one can be said to be active. Another interpretation: "Popular support is the harmony and happiness of winning the hearts of the people," which can be said to be passive. In today's era and environment, we need to first have active "popular support," and then we can obtain passive "popular support."

Based on the above explanation, our only hope is that the government can gain the support of the people nationwide, at least first gain the support of the people within the peace zones. Although, since the Chairman initiated the peace movement, some leading figures in the government have been diligent and hardworking, assisting and supporting it. After several years of struggle, most of the people's attitude towards the peace movement has progressed from suspicion and apprehension to understanding and acceptance. Especially after the National Government's entry into the war and the subsequent change in Japan's policy towards China, greater importance has been attached to the spiritual unity of the people. However, we must recognize that these are only the beginning stages of "popular support," with only partial small achievements. We must obtain the entire "popular support," with the spirit of every single person wholly united as one, and this can only be achieved by actively improving politics. Secondly, since the beginning of the unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident, the people have suffered from the calamities of war and displacement. When the peace movement began, the people within the peace zones could have hoped to have some respite from this, but initially, because the personnel participating in the peace movement were of mixed quality, and the leading figures could not reach everywhere, the situation was inevitably chaotic, and the people suffered from the tug-of-war. Later, as the government's position gradually stabilized, eliminating violence and pacifying the good people, the people's terrified souls were initially calmed, but what followed was the soaring of commodity prices, and they suffered again from the oppression of life. Therefore, the people have not yet achieved harmony and happiness. During wartime, the hardships of the people's lives in a nation are, of course, a matter of duty; however, it must be "suffering without complaint" only if the suffering is equal and average, allowing everyone's spirit to be united as one, enduring today's hardships and striving for tomorrow's "harmony and happiness," which can only be achieved by actively improving politics.

Then, since we already understand that "popular support" is the most important factor in strengthening political status; at the same time, we also understand that taking "popular support" and actively improving politics is a necessary path. Then, how exactly should we improve politics? Of course, there are many ways, and we have repeatedly raised questions from many aspects. Moreover, we believe that the highest authorities are working hard day and night, faithfully serving the country. As the saying goes: "No matter how beautiful the peony is, it all depends on the support of the green leaves." A single pillar supporting a tall building is, after all, an effort that is not rewarding.

Therefore, today we propose the principle of increasing administrative efficiency, "simplifying office procedures," to thoroughly eliminate the bad habit of circuitous, slow, and bureaucratic airs, as a starting point in the process of improving politics. If this point is not achieved, then all meticulous and detailed political plans will only become empty words on paper, and there will be no talk of efficiency. Those in charge of political institutions at all levels must strictly adhere to office hours, carefully handle official duties, and complete today's work today. Urge subordinates and staff to develop the habit of being quick in handling affairs. Reduce the procedures for the transmission of official documents, allowing for an emphasis on the conciseness and clarity of the language used in official documents, being straightforward and eliminating unnecessary clichés such as "accordingly, we hereby," in order to save time for drafting, writing, proofreading, and even for the reader on the other end. When several agencies jointly handle a matter, they should quickly discuss and decide with each other, each taking responsibility for their current duties, and not shirking responsibility to each other. For related matters within the same agency, reduce the back-and-forth of official documents and use telephone or oral contact as much as possible. In short, handling official matters during extraordinary times is like being on a battlefield, quickly rushing to accomplish tasks and seizing opportunities. The old-fashioned, sluggish style of government offices has long been out of step with modern times.

We can cite a recent example: The Shanghai publishing industry recently submitted a request to the concurrent President of the Executive Yuan, requesting a review of a relatively important event for the preservation of culture; at the same time, they sent a letter to the Chairman for assistance. Based on the letter, the Chairman immediately met with representatives to inquire, and quickly handled the matter before it was formally submitted to the Executive Yuan for a meeting, resulting in a very satisfactory outcome. The publishing representatives were deeply moved by the Chairman's sincere attitude, thoughtful consideration, and swift handling. At the same time, they also thought of the fact that if government officials at all levels could adhere to the principle of simplifying office procedures, then matters that benefit the people's livelihood would certainly not be impossible to promote, and it would also be the easiest way to obtain "popular support."

Speaking of matters that benefit the people's livelihood, of course, there are many aspects. We especially hope that the government will thoroughly implement the orders that have already been issued. Such as "thoroughly investigating hoarding," "government officials not being allowed to engage in commerce," and "strictly prohibiting gambling," etc., from all directions, to obtain "popular support," to strengthen political status, and to revitalize the nation.

The peace zones have a climate with normal temperature, and regulated rainfall, possessing suitable weather conditions; they have fertile land, and abundant products, possessing superior terrain conditions. We are only waiting for "popular support" to grasp and utilize these good conditions of weather and terrain that are already in place. We also hope that those in charge of governments at all levels will take the Chairman's spirit of handling affairs as their guiding principle, leading their subordinates, starting with "simplifying office procedures," providing convenience to the people, and starting with the beginning stages of "popular support." This is a responsibility, not an obligation, and it is hoped that it will be clearly recognized and implemented immediately.

### Japanese Army Air Force Heavily Bombs Yunnan Airfields; 46 Enemy Aircraft Destroyed; Military Facilities Hit in Two Places, Fires Started

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) — At 11 o'clock, the Japanese General Headquarters announced that the Japanese Army Air Force had, on April 26th and 28th, launched surprise attacks on American airfields concentrated in Yunnan, with the following results: (1) 5 shot down, (2) 41 destroyed on the ground and set ablaze, (3) military facilities destroyed and set ablaze in 2 places. During the operation, one Japanese aircraft was self-detonated and one did not return.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) — In order to reverse the losing trend, the American army actively strengthened the American air force stationed in Chongqing, attempting to launch air raids on Japan. In order to preemptively crush this attempt, the Japanese Army Air Force, on the 26th and 28th of last month, launched surprise attacks on the Yunnan-yi southwest airfields with a large combined formation of fighters and bombers. A total of 46 enemy aircraft were shot down and destroyed, inflicting a major blow on the American air force stationed in Chongqing. On the 26th of last month, when the combined formation of fighters and bombers launched a surprise attack on the south airfield of Yunnan-yi, almost all of the enemy aircraft there were wiped out. At that time, only a few enemy aircraft took off to intercept, and the anti-aircraft fire on the ground was also extremely quiet. In this operation, the Japanese aircraft not only suffered no losses, but also shot down two enemy aircraft, setting ablaze one large four-engine aircraft, eight HAU4 types, destroying one large aircraft, twelve HAU4 types, and setting ablaze one ammunition depot, one oil depot, and several vehicles. These vehicles were parked next to the large aircraft that were set ablaze, and were destroyed by Japanese aircraft with machine gun fire. On the 28th, Japanese aircraft again used a large combined formation of fighters and bombers to attack the airfield, and most of the enemy aircraft were destroyed: one large four-engine aircraft, eight North American types, and ten small types were destroyed, and three HAU40 types were shot down. These seven aircraft that were shot down were shot down during an air battle with ten small HAU40 fighters when the Japanese aircraft arrived over the airfield. In this operation, one Japanese aircraft was self-detonated and one did not return. As with previous announcements, the results announced by the Japanese General Headquarters this time were judged based on photographs taken after the bombing, so they are extremely accurate.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) — The American air force stationed in Chongqing has placed its main force in the Yunnan-Guangxi area, attempting to spy and air raid Japan. It is reported that there are 70-80 American aircraft in the Kunming area, and 20 in Guilin. After the attacks by Japanese aircraft, these air forces have lost 45 aircraft, and their strength has been greatly reduced. At the same time, the plan to air raid the Japanese mainland has also become a pipe dream. According to discussions among recruiters here, the significance of this Japanese aircraft attack is that it has inflicted a heavy blow on the American air force in Chongqing. At a time when the American air force commander in Chongqing, General Chennault, and the American military commander in Chongqing, General Stilwell, jointly went to Washington to request strengthening the strength of the American air force stationed in Chongqing, their subordinates were greatly shocked. Even if the American government can send more aircraft to Chongqing, it will only be a good target for Japanese aircraft.

Guangdong's light industry is now actively increasing its production. Judging from the geographical relationship, the material trade with Hainan Island will definitely be frequent in the future. The Japanese military occupied areas are now gradually progressing due to the efforts of the local Japanese military in various constructions. The local people are also quite cooperative.

### Valley Hagi Press Department Head's Speech: Reviewing the Global War Situation; Japan Achieving Significant Gains in Various Regions; German-Italian Relations Increasingly Solid and Steadfast

Tokyo, 1st Central News Agency Dispatch: According to a Nagoya telephone report, Major General Valley Hagi, head of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, delivered a speech at the Nagoya New Public Hall at 6:30 p.m. on the 30th, titled "The Current Situation in Greater East Asia." A summary is as follows:

"First, the Current Situation of the Greater East Asia War": Our country has established a winning position in both political and military aspects in Greater East Asia. Our army is crushing enemy counterattacks at any time and place and is preparing to launch large-scale new operations. Today, the defense area of our army is centered on our mainland. It includes the mainland and islands of the ocean within a full circumference with a radius of 5,000 kilometers. Based on the situation, we will launch a major offensive operation from the strategic strongholds established there. Therefore, the responsibility of our army is deeply felt to be significant. (A) Aleutian Islands Area: The enemy has recently strengthened its war preparations in this area, advancing its airfield to Amutka Island, east of Oshima Island. Recently, large squadrons of aircraft have attacked our occupied islands on a daily basis. Our army's morale is extremely high. Our aircraft have resolutely taken to the air to intercept them, achieving great results. (B) Burma Area: In an attempt to recapture Burma, the British-Indian army has, since the last month of last year, ordered its elite troops to cross the border and advance towards Nikkei. However, our troops took the offensive in early March, engaging them in fierce battles on the banks of the Ma Yu River, inflicting heavy damage. Our army is currently continuing to mop up and pursue the remaining enemies in various places. After this fierce battle, our army annihilated the British-Indian 6th (White Unit), 47th, 54th, 71st, and 123rd Brigades, and the Garawa Detachment (a mixed regiment), and dispersed the 4th, 5th, and 88th Brigades. (C) Southwest Pacific Area: Our army has established strategic bases on key points and lines, such as the Xinwen Islands and Banda Islands, establishing the foundation for completing new operations. We are continuing to carry out air force annihilation operations, destroying enemy bases, shooting down and destroying numerous enemy aircraft, and sinking many enemy ships, especially transport ships, to cut off enemy supply routes, achieving great results. (D) China Area: In the Chinese area, our army confronts the Chongqing army on an extremely long front. We will take the opportunity to carry out offensive operations, destroy the Chongqing army's combat power, and ensure security. On February 21, with the understanding of the French government, our army and navy troops were stationed in the French concession of Guangzhou Bay. In accordance with the spirit of the Japan-France joint defense agreement in Vietnam, we are preventing the Chongqing army's movements before they happen. We have also started operations north of Dongting Lake in Hubei Province and in the Suhuai area of Jiangsu Province, which ended in mid-March. Since then, the work of mopping up the remaining Chongqing army has also been completed. (E) Manchuria-Soviet Border Area: In the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, consolidating the northern defense is our unshakeable national policy. The Soviet-Manchurian border has been peaceful as always, and illegal border crossings by Soviet troops have also decreased. However, in order to prepare for any changes in the situation, we have made full preparations.

"Second, the World Situation": (A) European War Situation—The German-Soviet battlefield has now reached the thawing season. The roads are muddy and impassable, so the fighting has temporarily stopped, except in the Leningrad area. Generally, the two armies are still facing each other on the battle line where the German army launched its summer offensive last year. As for North Africa, the German-Italian army has retreated from the Sera do Mountain promontory on the north coast of Tunisia to the new 150-kilometer front in front of Enfidaville on the east coast of Tonder, stepping up preparations. This line is a hilly area with a height of seven or eight hundred meters, and its location is quite important. The Allied forces have also arrived. The maritime supply to Italy during the Tunisian period is also well protected, so it can provide a strong defense. (B) The Situation in Germany and Italy: Germany's manpower is still extremely sufficient, and Germany's food can also supply its power. The domestic arms industry capacity is even more sufficient. The German people fully trust Führer Hitler, and their fighting spirit is extremely strong. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Anelli in Italy, political power is becoming increasingly strong, so its combat power's strategy and propaganda have not been shaken in the slightest, and on the contrary, they are becoming more and more consolidated and as stable as a cornerstone. (C) The Situation in Britain, the United States, and Chongqing: Although the productivity of the United States cannot be taken lightly, it has reached its limit. It is a fact that its arms production is far below the planned target. "Conclusion": This war is just like what the declaration of war showed. Our country rose up courageously for self-defense in order to eliminate all obstacles. The rise and fall of our country and the fate of East Asia are all in this battle. Serving the country is to die for this cause. We deeply believe that under the Emperor's plan of unifying the world, our 100 million people will work hard to advance, and we will surely be able to subdue Britain and the United States and achieve final victory. , And win the final victory.

### Battles at Mejez El Bab: German Army Gains the Initiative; British Forces at Pont du Fahs Retreat After Fierce Attacks

Berlin, 1st Central News Agency Dispatch: According to a military correspondent for the Hai Tung News Agency, there have been no major changes in the situation in Tunisia from noon on Thursday to noon on Friday. General fighting has been limited to the usual conflicts of sentinel and raiding parties, with more intense fighting occurring in only a few locations, but not exceeding a local nature. On the west coast, the French advance has been blocked by German artillery fire. The US Second Corps is still being blocked in front of the Jefna Pass and Sidi Cel, and these units have made very little progress recently. The same is true for the British forces operating in the Djebel Ang area. The local battles east of Mejez El Bab are now being initiated by the German army. The Anglo-American tank corps suffered a major defeat in their attack on Debauerba on Wednesday, and they are apparently still affected. On Thursday, the anti-Axis forces in the east of Mejez El Bab were completely on the defensive, while the German army cleared out the remaining enemies in the reoccupied areas and advanced slightly to the south. General Anderson has concentrated a large force near Lake Kurzia, but has not yet started operations. The French attack on Pont du Fahs was also crushed by the Axis's intensive fire. The left wing of the British Eighth Army also attacked the German positions at Pont du Fahs from Djebibina, but was repelled by a fierce German counterattack and abandoned its temporarily occupied territory. General Montgomery's right wing has also failed to achieve any new achievements. It remains to be seen whether the anti-Axis forces will continue to engage in the current attack war at a great cost, or whether they will engage in a siege war at a lower cost.

Turin, 1st Central News Agency Dispatch: The Stanba newspaper reported that the Axis's shortcomings in Tunisia are due to the lack of coastal areas under the jurisdiction of the German-Italian army and the extremely incomplete landing equipment. As a result, when a large number of munitions and other supplies arrive, they feel unable to cope. Moreover, the Strait of Sicily is vulnerable to attacks by the anti-Axis naval and air forces. In addition, the lack of airfields and the fact that many of them need to be technically improved are also disadvantages for the Axis forces.

### Three-Nation Conference Held at the German President's Headquarters; Concrete Exchange of Views on the International Situation

Berlin, 1st Central News Agency Dispatch: According to an official announcement from the President's Headquarters on the 30th, President Hitler met with French Chief Laval and Italian representatives on the 29th to hold a three-nation conference. Prior to this conference, French Chief Laval had held several rounds of consultations with Marshal Pétain and French government leaders in Paris and Vichy. When French representative to Paris Brinon arrived at the German President's Headquarters, Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Paschani, Director of the European Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Vitiqi, and Chief of Protocol Li Qi had already arrived at the German President's Headquarters one after another. When French Chief Laval arrived in Berlin, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop went to the station to greet him and then began the three-nation conference with the Italian representatives. It is said that during this preparatory conference, President Hitler had a three-hour meeting with Laval, Ribbentrop, and Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Paschani. As for the content of the conference, the authorities only issued a simple communiqué, but although no detailed information was released, authoritative sources believe that when the anti-Axis forces illegally invaded French territory in North Africa, Chief Laval met with President Hitler twice in November and December 1942. Although the French government did not officially join the Axis camp, in fact, the national policies of Germany and France are based on full cooperation between the two countries as a major premise. Therefore, the three-nation representatives seem to have exchanged concrete views on the mission of the French government and the French people when the Axis forces recently launched their summer offensive. After the conference, Ribbentrop hosted a banquet to entertain the representatives of various countries. According to a telegram from Paris, Chief Laval returned to Paris by train at 4:40 p.m. on the 30th.

Paris, 1st Central News Agency Dispatch: After French government chief Laval visited the German Führer's headquarters, he returned to the East Station here by special train at 4 p.m. yesterday. Many important figures from Germany and France greeted him at the station, including French government officials currently stationed in Paris and representatives of the German embassy, ​​as well as the commander of the German forces stationed in France. After exchanging greetings with the crowd, Laval took a car to the Matignon Hotel with his entourage and hosted the press at the hotel last night.

The local teachers are also cooperating with each other, so that the children and young people of the new East Asia can already sing Japanese songs, which is even more memorable.

### A Review of the Internal Situation in the Soviet Union (1): The Soviet Union's View of Britain and the United States

(Special Correspondent Taguchi from Zurich, 27th) When this World War began, the mistake made by Britain and the United States was that they underestimated the combat power of the Axis powers. Britain and the United States also made the same mistake in their assessment of the combat power of the Soviet Union. The reason why Britain and the United States underestimated the combat power of the Axis powers and the Soviet Union was that Britain and the United States hoped to permanently maintain their own world domination system and their own position, and did not want to be left behind by the rise of these many emerging countries. They naturally produced the above-mentioned mistakes based on this hoped-for observation. The unexpected resistance shown by the Soviet Union and the strong fighting power of the German army were both regarded as terrifying new discoveries by Britain and the United States. How did the Soviet Union fight? What is the state of the Soviet people's lives? What thoughts do the Soviet people have about Britain and the United States? This kind of internal situation in the Soviet Union can hardly be窥测 from the outside. Recently, special envoy Chang Philip Jordan, who was stationed in the Soviet Union by the British newspaper News Chronicle from the beginning of the war until the beginning of last year, described in detail in his recent book the internal situation in the Soviet Union, the reality of British and American aid to the Soviet Union, and the inside story of Soviet diplomacy. Although the data is not necessarily the latest, it paints a vivid outline of the current situation in the Soviet Union. The Soviet government's distrust and fear of Britain and the United States will also be explained, involving the truth about British and American relations with the Soviet Union, which is worthy of appreciation. The outline is introduced below:

The author first starts with the industrial strength of the Soviet Union and describes the general situation in the Soviet Union as follows:

The most noteworthy aspect of the industrial development of the Soviet Union is that the Soviet Union has built its own machine tool industry. The reporter would visit the military factories in the Moscow area and between Kuibyshev and the Urals. Most of the machine tools were self-made, and very few were made in the United States. When the German-Soviet war broke out, there were only four factories in the Soviet Union that manufactured fighter planes. Now there are six to eight. Since the outbreak of the war, military factories in Moscow, Kiev, Kharkov and other places have begun to move to the new industrial center in the Urals. The trains transporting factory equipment to the Ural Mountains stretched for dozens of miles, which was extremely grand.

Although the Ural region has become an industrial area, its full picture is still unclear. However, in the reporter's opinion, the weapons and materials used in the Moscow defense battle in the autumn of 1941 were completely made in the Soviet Union. In the early stages of the war, British-made tanks were used, but soon their firepower was exposed to be extremely weak. From October 1941, the British and American bombers that should have been supplied to the Soviet Union every month were not available until February of the following year. Only a few were seen at the airfield in Iraq four months later.

Wheat is one of the most important materials for aid to the Soviet Union. Since the loss of Ukraine, food was in short supply in 1942. We believe that the Soviet Union's military production capacity cannot be underestimated, so what the Soviet Union urgently needs today is not military supplies but food. Since the Soviet Union concluded an agreement with Britain and the United States on material assistance, the second front has not been successfully opened up, and British politicians are still trying to maintain Britain's leading position. Therefore, the Soviet Union cannot but doubt the ultimate intentions of Britain and the United States.

Among the officers of the British Army, many believe that Britain must restrain the Soviet Union in the future, just as it is now restraining Germany. The Soviet Union believes that this is an implication of the British authorities' views. In view of the anti-Soviet sentiment among the British military department, the current combat plan is to seek as much aid from Britain as possible on the one hand, and to try to ensure that the country is not limited to the complete exhaustion of national power at the end of the war on the other hand. Therefore, the Soviet Union harbors mistrust of British Conservative politicians and American financial groups.

As for the people's livelihood, although coal is in short supply, so that the people have no heating equipment in winter, the Soviet people are happy to endure this lack of materials and have no complaints.

### Two Insurance Companies Falsely Report Capital; Authorities Order Dissolution; Fearing That Other Companies Have the Same Situation; Supervision Bureau is Sending Personnel to Secretly Investigate and Rectify

The Overseas Chinese Fire and Water Insurance Company and the Overseas Chinese Life Insurance Company were initiated by Lin Mao from Fujian. His wives, concubines, and children served as directors, managers, and the like. There were also one or two other directors and supervisors who were Lin's relatives and friends. The Overseas Chinese Fire and Water Insurance Company claimed to have a capital of 2 million yuan, and the Overseas Chinese Life Insurance Company claimed to have a capital of 1 million yuan, but in fact, no payment had been made.

Obtaining a License by Deception and Diverting Funds for Inspection

In September of last year, they deceptively obtained registration licenses No. 50 and No. 47 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. In October, the Insurance Supervision Bureau was established and repeatedly sent Chang to inspect the property. Lin Mao and others cleverly concealed this by temporarily borrowing funds from the Overseas Chinese Industrial and Commercial Bank, which he was in charge of, depositing them in various banks, and presenting bank remittance receipts and checkbooks for inspection. After the inspection, Lin Mao privately spent the deposits for his own use. Recently, the Supervision Bureau went to the group for detailed investigation. The employees of the two companies were scattered, and no one was in charge. All the books and records were also incomplete. The Supervision Bureau authorities secretly investigated various related banks and learned that the two insurance companies had no capital at all. The previous reports to the Ministry claiming that the capital was not fully collected and the reports to the Bureau on the use of funds were all false.

Sending Personnel to Liquidate and Hand Over to the Court for Punishment

The responsibilities of the Supervision Bureau are crucial. The authorities reported the results of the investigation to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval and instructions. Subsequently, they received a reply telegram ordering the dissolution of the companies, sending personnel to liquidate them, and requesting the Ministry of Justice to order the competent court to severely punish them for criminal violations. It is reported that after receiving the order, the Bureau has published an announcement announcing the dissolution of the Overseas Chinese Fire and Water Insurance Company and the Overseas Chinese Life Insurance Company, and has selected a liquidator to begin liquidation. It is also heard that in view of this, the Supervision Bureau is afraid that other companies may have the same situation, and is separately sending personnel to secretly investigate in order to rectify them.

### 34th Phase of Household Flour: Rice Shops Collect Purchase Orders; Total Number is Less Than Last Time

Yesterday, rice shops in the two concessions collected flour warehouse receipts for the 34th phase from the Rice and Flour Distribution Office of the Public Works Department, and then指定 warehouses to ship the goods. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the total number of whole rice and broken rice distributed to each rice shop in the 34th phase is about 43,000 bags, while there are only more than 20,000 bags of flour. This is because the number of household flour in this phase has decreased, and each rice shop has some surplus from previous distributions. It is also learned that there are currently six designated rice shipping warehouses and three flour shipping warehouses.

Gunny Sacks Should Still Be Returned According to Regulations

The Rice and Flour Distribution Office of the Public Works Department has catered to the rice shops' needs for the movement of empty gunny sacks without the need for transportation permits. However, each rice shop must still return the gunny sacks to the Rice and Flour Distribution Office of the Public Works Department in accordance with the previous regulations. Rice shops in the two concessions should comply with this and must not hide the gunny sacks.

Citizens in Shanghai West Hope for Flour Distribution

The 11th phase of grain distribution by population at the Public Grain Sale Office in the West Shanghai District began at the end of last month, and citizens in the district were very enthusiastic about collecting grain. The amount of coarse rice distributed in this phase was 1.9 liters, and the price was 5.7 yuan in national currency. It will expire three days later, and the授 will be stopped after the deadline. As this 11th phase of grain distribution is still the second grain distribution in West Shanghai District in April, the third grain distribution in that month is also expected to be allocated in the near future, but the date has not yet been determined. As for the end of February, the 6th计口 flour and the flour collection certificates for March and April, citizens in the West Shanghai District hope that the Public Grain Sale Office will allocate them as soon as possible to benefit the people's livelihood.

### Small Wheel Capsizes on the Qingning Temple River

The Jiangsu, a municipal ferry operating between Beijing Road and Gaoqiao in this city, was fully loaded with passengers at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday. It was heading from Shanghai to Gaoqiao. When it passed the Qingning Temple pier in Pudong, half of the passengers disembarked, and more than 400 of the remaining passengers boarded the Shandong Changwan small wheel to be transported to Gaoqiao.

### Military Police Corps Cracks Down on Undesirables Impersonating Secret Agents and Extorting Money, Hoping for Cooperation from Chinese and Japanese Citizens to Assist Authorities in Combating This

Central News Agency, Shanghai dispatch: Recently in Shanghai, there have frequently been unscrupulous individuals falsely claiming to be secret agents of the military or military police, unjustly coercing innocent Chinese citizens or extorting money, which is utterly illegal. The Japanese Shanghai Military Police Corps, in light of this situation, has launched a severe crackdown and is thoroughly arresting these undesirables to eliminate such illegal behavior. Considering the gravity of these incidents, the Military Police Corps headquarters has issued the following statement, hoping for the united cooperation of the citizens:

Statement from the Japanese Military Police Corps Authorities

The Shanghai Military Police Corps has already issued a warning to both Chinese and Japanese residents, as well as people of third countries, to severely crack down on those unscrupulous individuals who falsely claim to be from the military or military police and extort money from law-abiding citizens. Recently, due to economic problems, there seems to be a sense of unease among some citizens, and these bad elements are exploiting this opportunity, leading to a regrettable increase in criminal cases. These illegal individuals falsely claim to be secret agents of the military or military police, or exploit the military police, to extort money from those who hoard or conceal goods, as well as illegal merchants, and even innocent Chinese citizens.

Numerous Cases in Four Months

From the beginning of this year to the end of April, a total of twenty-seven criminal cases of this nature have been cracked, involving thirty-six criminals, of whom twenty-three were Chinese, and thirteen were Japanese and other nationals. Twelve cases have resulted in prison sentences, five cases were dealt with on the spot, three cases resulted in deportation, and the others are still under serious investigation. Some victims were defrauded of as much as 9,000 US dollars, 35,000 old legal tender, or 11,000 reserve certificates. The Military Police Corps views these unscrupulous individuals as profaning the prestige of the Japanese military and will impose severe punishments without leniency. It hopes that Chinese and Japanese citizens will warn each other and cooperate with the authorities in cracking down on these activities, in order to achieve the goal of building a bright and prosperous Greater Shanghai.

Fabricating Titles and Endangering the People

Furthermore, military personnel and military police, when performing their duties, always carry identification cards or service record books. Not only do they not demand money or goods, but they also absolutely avoid coercive words or actions. Therefore, if anyone discovers someone fabricating the title of military police or secret agent of the military police and engaging in illegal activities, they should immediately report it to the nearest military police station for arrest.

Common Types of Crimes

According to the investigation, the more serious cases include: (1) A Dutch woman residing in the French Concession hid over 500,000 yuan worth of undeclared precious metals. These individuals learned of this and, falsely claiming to be members of the military police, coerced her and forcibly seized twenty-five kinds of precious metals. The criminals have been arrested and sentenced to one year in prison. (2) Chen Afang was suspected of stealing cotton and was also defrauded of 1,000 yuan using the name of the military police. In addition, an old lumber merchant was also coerced into giving up 80 yuan. (3) An unscrupulous individual, claiming to be a secret agent of the military police in a tea house, said that if he was given 5,000 yuan for "expenses," he could have those who had been arrested released. (4) Falsely claiming that someone was secretly colluding with guerrillas, they extorted 9,000 US dollars and 35,700 old legal tender on the condition that the person would not be arrested. In summary, it can be seen that these individuals often take advantage of the weaknesses of those involved, seizing the opportunity to coerce and extort money. Such incidents are endless. It is hoped that citizens will understand the authorities' intentions and cooperate to quickly eradicate such evil practices.

Planning to Shelter All Street Beggars

The English-language Times reported that since the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, the authorities of the three municipal districts of this port have repeatedly planned to clear all beggars from the roads. After several months, beggar shelters have been set up in the suburbs, and a large number of charitable organizations related to social welfare have been established. It is now known that the authorities are paying great attention to the beggar problem, as the maintenance of public health and the tidiness of the city depend on the solution to the problem of street beggars. According to estimates from relevant parties, there are more than 50,000 beggars in Shanghai, who often make the roads unclean and spread germs. The authorities are now planning to shelter all of them, teach them work skills and knowledge, and make them respect themselves. It is expected that this plan will be realized soon.

### Economic Circles, Commentary: The Financial World and Industrial Loans

The normal business of the financial world in the future will be to support productive organizations, in other words, to be the backbone of factories, using most of its strength to help factories strive for production.

The financial world's loans to factories should not be for official purposes, nor should they be based on sentiment. They must be based on actual achievements and only provide loan convenience where it is deemed worthy.

Therefore, thorough investigation, detailed research, and scientific analysis must be conducted beforehand. It must be felt that the factory is worthy of loans in terms of its overall prospects, its structure, and its assets, and then loans should be made. One should never act on temporary emotions, nor should one engage in superficial work to perfunctorily fulfill responsibilities.

In particular, it is important to provide continuous technical guidance after the loan is made. The past practice of not paying attention after the loan has become a thing of the past. In the future, experts must assist factories in research, analysis, examination, and auditing, which is essential. It is best to recruit many engineers to conduct design and research; every factory and every part must rely on the full spirit and strength of engineers to improve. If there is something wrong with every factory and every part, one must study the methods of reform as soon as possible and never be polite or perfunctory. I remember that a manager of a brick and tile factory in Hong Kong asked an electrical engineer to inspect the factory one day and learned that the old belt of the motor was broken, and every action was delayed by several seconds, resulting in a waste of a lot of electricity every month. Later, after the factory replaced the old belt with a new belt through an electrical engineer, it saved more than two thousand seven hundred yuan in electricity costs every month. It can be seen that the importance of the relationship between technology and production is beyond doubt. It is hoped that after the financial world is strict and disciplined, it must pay attention to this kind of scientific production loan.

### Pearl and Jade Industry: Reorganization of the Revitalization Group Ordered

Before the Incident, the pearl and jade industry in this city had three trade groups in the Houjiabang area of the South City, namely Revitalization (i.e., Yunhui), Yunhuai, and Yangzhi. After the war, the affairs of the three groups were at a standstill. The Revitalization Group, having the largest number of members among the trades, took the lead in reorganizing its business last year, and handled trade regulations. After submitting separate applications to the authorities of both the Liang He Jie (Two Rivers Boundary) and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for approval, the group has now been ordered to reorganize as the "Shanghai Special City Pearl and Jade Industry Trade Association" in accordance with Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations of the Industry and Commerce Trade Association, and has submitted an application to the Bureau of Social Economy for approval and registration.

All commercial firms in this city engaged in the industrial raw materials of animal and vegetable oils, oil bone industry, asphalt industry, tung oil industry, and ramie industry must join the association, with a deadline of the 8th of this month. Those who fail to do so will be deemed unofficial member stores and will be required to cease operations in accordance with the regulations.

### Strengthening the National Government and the Problem of Hoarding (Part Two)

Reality and Principles: There should be a strict distinction and a clear comparison between the ideals and reality of China's participation in the war. If a gap is found between them, every effort must be made to bridge it in order to make reality conform to the ideals. What is most undesirable is to make compromises with reality. The three principles of Konoe are still regarded by the Japanese people as the basis for their political, economic, and cultural attitude towards China. At the same time, the National Government and its people should, in accordance with the various principles of peaceful nation-building and various ideals of participating in the war, launch a faithful and courageous wartime campaign to conduct a thorough self-criticism. What, then, are the basic principles of China's participation in the war? This is to participate in the Greater East Asia War and make it a national war in the true sense of the word.

What the Japanese people expect of the National Government, national capital, and the Chinese people is to promote the national war, that is, to establish a wartime system as soon as possible. The seriousness of the obstruction of the national war by the Chinese political, economic, and ideological reality revealed by hoarding behavior does not need to be explained in detail. In short, anyone who obstructs the promotion of the national war should be held accountable, and even further, such elements should be accused of aiding the enemy and thoroughly eliminated. In the future, the National Government must obtain the strong support and trust of the people in order to promote the national war, but the problem of hoarding is hindering this national war, so it must be thoroughly resolved.

Under China's participation in the war, everything in politics, economy, and ideology has been distorted by the hoarding incident, thus distorting the morality of participating in the war. Therefore, hoarding is hated by the Chinese people and also hated by the Japanese people. The Japanese national war and the Chinese national war are national wars that stand in a relationship of life and death and seek victory in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we strongly advocate that the problem of hoarding, which undermines the livelihood of the Chinese people and makes other conditions for participating in the war unstable, must be eradicated.

New Economic Policy and the Problem of Hoarding: At any time and in any country, the problem of hoarding has a serious impact on the people of the country. After China's participation in the war, and at the beginning of its departure towards a new economic policy, the facts of this problem must be taken seriously. Only by thoroughly eliminating hoarding can the first step of faithfully implementing the new economic policy be taken. This is by no means an exaggerated statement.

In order to strengthen the political and economic power of the National Government under participation in the war, it is necessary to mobilize Chinese national capital in the material and economic policies of Central China to give play to its autonomy and creativity, so as to make Central China a logistics base for completing the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, with the entire national capital and the entire Chinese people as the targets, the aim is to promote the establishment of a wartime national economy in China.

The National Government and the Chinese people also cooperated with the Japanese side in the conversion of economic policies, and first established the National Commercial Control Association. More than twenty days later, the problem of hoarding turned into a political problem. Not only the Chinese people attach importance to it, but also the Japanese people attach great importance to this point. In order to implement the new policy and strengthen the efforts of the National Government, three necessary conditions must be paid attention to when promoting the new economic policy:

First: The new economic policy of the entire National Government and the entire national capital must cooperate strongly.

Second: The cooperation of the National Government internally with the new economic policy must be strong.

Third: The mutual support of national capital for the new economic policy must be strong.

If the above three conditions cannot be achieved, then the new economic policy will become empty talk. At the same time, the problem of hoarding must be solved in order to achieve the above objectives. Therefore, we hope with all our hearts that it can be thoroughly solved.
