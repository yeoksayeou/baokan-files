### The Realistic Problem of Commodity Prices

Recently, the fuel issue in this city has caused severe panic. The difference between the controlled price and the black market price of coal briquettes is several times over. Secondly, firewood, charcoal, and coal chunks are all soaring. The more prices rise three times a day, the more people try their best to find ways to cope, and everyone they encounter is anxious and complaining about it. Some even blame heaven and curse people.

Besides fuel price increases, the black market price of white rice is also rising steadily. Consequently, the prices at restaurants are being revised daily, and all commodity prices are moving forward in step. Therefore, since the beginning of this month, especially in the past week, anyone bearing the burden of daily life must feel increasing pressure and a greater threat.

People need food to survive. "Even the cleverest housewife can't cook without rice," and "raw rice cannot be cooked into a meal." Therefore, rice and firewood are absolutely essential for people's survival. If rice and firewood become a problem, it means people's basic survival needs have become a problem. In this situation, is it appropriate to discuss other issues?

We have always advocated that people's lives must first be stabilized. Even during wartime, only the general standard of living should be lowered so that everyone suffers equally. However, in Shanghai today, essential commodities such as rice, coal, and oil are nominally rationed, but the actual amount is insufficient, leading to the emergence of black markets. And since black markets have no set prices, prices rise abnormally. Thus, those with money can still obtain supplies from the black market without panic, but those without money are deterred by the black market, suffering hunger and hardship. The poor account for the majority of Shanghai's five million population, and they are directly oppressed by these uncontrolled black market prices. We would like to loudly and urgently appeal to the relevant authorities to pay attention to the most realistic problem of people's livelihood, commodity prices, and to implement emergency countermeasures quickly. Our suggestions are as follows:

Fuel is one of the most essential commodities for people's livelihood, and its black market prices should absolutely not be allowed to rise wildly. In the past, when various prices soared, coal briquettes were the slowest to rise, which was due to a sufficient supply. The recent sudden panic requires the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation of the main reasons. If the source of supply is blocked, efforts must be made to clear the way. At the same time, limit the amount of coal consumed by entertainment places, such as hotels, apartments, etc., for heating, and divert it to meet the needs of ordinary people's lives. The allocation of coal to cooked water shops and restaurants should be prioritized over that to bars and eateries. Furthermore, the household rationing method should be earnestly implemented. It is preferable to increase the official allocation price according to actual needs, and the allocation amount must be suitable for the most urgent needs. Now that the municipal government has been unified, the responsible departments should make overall arrangements.

The continuous rise of rice prices in the black market can only be attributed to the reduction and delay of rice rations, and the responsible authorities cannot shirk responsibility for the reduction and delay. The Rice Control Committee has been established for several months. Without analyzing its work, merely comparing the implementation of rice rations in recent months, its merits and demerits will be self-evident. Someone enriched the country by tens of thousands of yuan in three months, while the rice allocation was neglected. I believe that although every citizen wants to remain silent, how can they endure their urgent situation? We can no longer sit idly by and make mistakes. All empty talk is unnecessary. We should quickly plan for the "punctual" and "sufficient" allocation of rations to satisfy the public.

The relevant economic and other authorities should pay close attention to the rise in all commodity prices, regarding it as their own responsibility and not remaining helpless. Various organizations related to price control must establish close ties with each other, jointly research the causes, discuss countermeasures, and faithfully implement them.

In short, the problem of commodity prices cannot be solved casually. It requires a spirit of determination and perseverance to serve the people. At the same time, we hope that the Allied authorities will do their best to assist in achieving a reasonable adjustment as soon as possible. The well-being of the Chinese people is the good fortune of the future of Sino-Japanese cooperation.

### Elite Japanese Naval Air Unit in White Book Bombs Calcutta, Giving the Anti-Axis Powers a Great Shock

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese air unit recently conducted a large-scale bombing of Calcutta in a white book fashion, which seems to have given the anti-Axis camp a great shock. According to a telegram from Calcutta, the commander of the US 14th Air Force, Doolittle, stated that the Japanese army had never openly bombed Calcutta before. This bombing shows that the Japanese army has the ability to attack Calcutta. The Japanese army seemed to have used elite units, or naval air units taking off from land bases, to participate in this bombing, and said that they used even more excellent fighters and bombers.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain base on the Burma front, on the afternoon of the 13th, the Japanese army air unit, with a combination of various bombers, launched a large-scale attack on the Tinsukia enemy airfield, strafing the enemy planes stationed there with machine guns, completely destroying them. It also engaged in fierce aerial combat with about 30 enemy (P-61) and (P-40) aircraft that intercepted them, resulting in the Japanese aircraft shooting down five (P-40) aircraft (two unconfirmed), ten (P-61) aircraft (four unconfirmed), and one Spitfire fighter. It burned four large enemy aircraft, destroyed five large aircraft, and six small aircraft, totaling thirty-one aircraft.

### The Chongqing Army on the Indo-Burmese Border Shows Signs of Wavering; Japanese Aircraft Assist in Combat with Great Results

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - A telegram from the northernmost front of the Burma-India border on the 15th stated that the Japanese army in the Hugong Valley area of northern Burma, after realizing that the war situation was ripe, suddenly launched an attack on the Chongqing (Yu) army on the front line on the morning of November 30th. The Chongqing army relied on air transport for supplies and resisted stubbornly. In this area, the rainy season has ended, and the newly formed 38th Division of the Chongqing army, under the command of American officers, moved southeastward in early October, constantly maneuvering on the Burma-India border. On October 31st, it began a counterattack, using a certain place as a base. At the same time, it dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle. It is learned that since Japan implemented its new policy toward China, although the Chongqing side's resistance was weakening, it still had not given up completely. Seduced by the sweet words of the British and American forces to open the Yunnan-Burma Road, it continuously sent troops to India, serving as sacrifices for the British and Americans. The following is the battle situation in this area since the end of October this year: First, in a certain area, the Chongqing army, under the command of American officers, was attacked by the Japanese army from October to November. However, the newly formed troops reached a point two to three hundred meters away from the Japanese army's base on November 6th. On the night of the 20th, the Japanese army attacked a certain location by surprise, attacking one side while forcing the rear, and on the night of the 22nd, it attacked the Chongqing army's headquarters, defeating them. In this night attack, it captured an American supervising officer with the rank of lieutenant colonel and several Chongqing soldiers. Also, in a certain area, the Japanese army gradually pressured the Chongqing army, waiting for an opportunity to annihilate it. Furthermore, in a certain area, since the beginning of November, the Chongqing army has been engaging in reconnaissance on one hand and repeatedly attacking the Japanese army's positions on the other. However, a certain unit of the Japanese army suddenly launched an attack on the evening of the 11th, and south of a certain river, it repelled the Chongqing army and occupied a Cham village. Moreover, the Chongqing army had built a defensive position near the Kachin village. However, a certain unit of the Japanese army crossed a certain river on the night of the 21st, flanking the Chongqing army and launching an attack. The Chongqing army, in addition to bombarding the first line of the Japanese army with artillery fire, also used aircraft to provide cover and resisted stubbornly. On the afternoon of the 22nd, it launched another attack under the cover of mortar fire, but was repelled by the Japanese army. On the 25th, a Japanese army unit launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing army on the front line, seizing its position, and the Chongqing army retreated. However, it continued to maneuver, and the Japanese army, in order to completely annihilate it, launched an attack at dawn on the 27th. On the 29th, a Chongqing army lieutenant and others surrendered to the Japanese army. The enemy army is currently in a state of wavering.

### Indian National Army Moves to Burma, Reaching a Landmark Stage; Approaching the Date of Advancing to the Border

Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Indian National Army has begun to advance towards the India-Burma border. In order to understand the Indian National Army's belief in the independence movement and the situation of the Burmese and Indian people's support, the reporter specifically interviewed Lieutenant Colonel Alagappan, the acting Indian Independence President and senior officer of the Indian National Army. The question and answer session is as follows: (Question) What is the situation of the Indian National Army's advance? (Answer) The independence movement engaged in by the National Army, due to the decision of the Indian Provisional Government, has reached a landmark stage in its transfer to Burma. Comrades in a certain place are waiting for an opportunity to move out. When the Burmese and Indian people heard that the National Army's advance was imminent, they were also excited, donating tens of thousands of rupees as a real fund for the independence movement, and providing various materials necessary for other combat operations. Indians in Malaya are also vigorously supporting the National Army. Our National Army adopts a policy of elite troops, and its morale is high. They are all eager to go to the front line as soon as possible and quickly break through the border. (Question) When the Indian border is broken through, to what extent will the Indian soldiers and the general public respond, you are sure? (Answer) Our army is fundamentally different from the troops recruited in India by the British. We are confident that one division of our army can easily defeat ten or even fifteen divisions of British and American Indian troops. All Indians know that Mr. Bose has now risen. As the commander of the independent National Army, it is clear that as soon as our independent tricolor flag is waved, the Indian soldiers will unconditionally stop resisting and surrender, and the public will rise up to cooperate. (Question) What is your view of the current situation in India? (Answer) India's current political situation is in imminent danger, and it is about to collapse. The lives of the general public are also extremely precarious. The Indian army has heard of Burma's independence and the National Army's imminent advance, and it has become increasingly unstable. Tens of thousands of soldiers are deserting, and many are defecting to Mr. Bose. Indian spies repeatedly sent by the British have also turned to our side. These Indians shed their previous Indian environment and will restore their original appearance. (Question) What are your expectations of the Japanese people? (Answer) India's pursuit of independence is the pursuit of independence for all of Asia. Japan and India continue to maintain friendly relations, and under the ideal of completing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, they provide assistance to India. In order to repay this, we also vow to contribute to the permanent co-prosperity of East Asia.

### The Ministry of Industry Establishes Restrictive Measures for Company Capital Increases and Appreciation; Vice Minister Jiang Issues a Statement Clarifying the Meaning

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - In order to maintain the foundation of companies and to allow companies to increase capital and appreciate within appropriate limits, and to prevent abuse, the Ministry of Industry has drafted temporary measures to restrict company capital increase registration. It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgated for implementation. The statement of Vice Minister Jiang of the Ministry and the temporary measures to restrict company capital increase registration are recorded below: Jiang's Statement Recently, many companies and factories in Shanghai and other places have applied to the Ministry to increase capital and change registration. The methods of increasing capital are generally as follows: One is cash. In addition, there is also the method of raising one share into several shares, the so-called stock raising method. From the surface, the first method is a good phenomenon for supporting industry and commerce, increasing production, and prospering society. However, the use of investment must be coordinated with the progress of various enterprises to achieve proper results. Otherwise, unnecessary capital increases may lead to abnormal operations. Secondly, the value of the assets of companies and factories that have been established for a long time, such as houses, real estate, machinery, and other assets, is no longer what it used to be, and it is reasonable to increase prices and increase shares. However, the reason why the value of its stock is so high today is due to the solidity of its original assets. If the appreciation ratio of its assets is not properly restricted, and the amount of high valuation is allowed to be raised into shares, it will not only risk stimulating other price increases, but also once prices become balanced, the company's assets will have a huge number on the surface, but the actual foundation will be empty. Not only will the value of its stock depreciate, but also the foundation of the company will be shaken. In addition, the method of stock raising is also legally unfounded. The Ministry has the responsibility to supervise the company and will not sit idly by. In order to protect the foundation of the company and maintain social economy, after careful visits and weighing the pros and cons, we drafted the temporary measures to restrict company capital increase registration and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The main purpose of this law is to make capital increases and appreciation within appropriate limits, to prevent abuse and utilization, not to completely prohibit them. We hope that the industrial circles will understand the government's intention and fully cooperate to use funds in the normal way to increase production, so as to stabilize people's livelihood and consolidate their foundation.

Temporary Measures to Restrict Company Capital Increase Registration All companies, whether limited, unlimited, or partnerships, whose capital increase registration, in addition to complying with the company registration rules, company law, company law implementation law, and special regulations for financial institutions, shall be handled in accordance with these measures. All companies that increase capital shall state the reasons for the capital increase and the share subscription methods, and submit them to the local competent authorities for transfer to the Ministry of Industry for approval. Those who have not been approved shall not increase capital. However, those who have been ordered to increase capital by the competent authorities due to factual needs are not subject to this restriction. All companies that increase capital shall be subject to the following restrictions: 1. Companies that have not applied for registration and obtained a license shall not increase capital. 2. Companies shall not increase capital twice within a year. 3. Companies shall not use materials, raw materials, etc. as shares based on their value to increase capital. 4. Companies that increase capital and have been established for more than two years may use houses, real estate, machinery, and other assets used in business to increase capital, but the appreciated value shall not exceed one time the original price, and the original price certification documents, accountant's audit certification documents, asset liability tables of previous years, and business reports shall be submitted for verification. When necessary, the ministry shall send personnel or order the local competent authorities to verify them, but the capital increase of financial institutions, unless specially permitted by the Ministry of Finance, shall not be made by appreciating property other than money. 5. Companies shall not use donations, rewards, or other similar methods to increase capital. 6. Companies shall not use other stock raising methods to increase capital, except for the appreciation and stock raising under Item 4 of this article. All companies that increased capital before the implementation of these measures and applied to the local competent authorities or the Ministry of Industry to change registration are not subject to these measures. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Germany Vigorously Attacks Hull's Speech; European Small Nations Should Be Wary

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a Reuters dispatch, a German Foreign Ministry spokesperson declared that U.S. Secretary of State Hull's speech to Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania has exceeded the scope of his authority, with the sole purpose of luring small and weak nations into the arms of the Soviet Union. Since the Moscow and Tehran conferences, Southeast European countries that the anti-Axis powers wish to place within their sphere of influence are now increasingly clearly within the Soviet sphere of influence. The spokesperson continued, saying that the Soviet-Czech pact can also be seen as a concession by Britain and America to Soviet demands, as the Soviet Union's political assistance to others will inevitably be the same as what Finland previously encountered. The Soviet Union's dispatch of a military delegation to the newly established Yugoslav partisan government also demonstrates the Soviet Union's policy that it intends to implement in Europe, and this action is supported by Britain and America.

Since September 9th, our army's positions have been strengthened daily, and the enemy's chances of success have diminished daily. The panic caused by Badoglio's armistice was only a fleeting moment. Today, the German fortress line from the Atlantic to the French Mediterranean coast has extended to the Italian coast. Our army, based on the experience and lessons learned from past enemy landing operations, is engaged in defensive training. Therefore, both the coastal defense forces and the fresh troops on standby in the rear are first-class elite soldiers. In addition, the importance of concentrated firepower has also been noted. The heavy artillery of the coastal defense force can now concentrate firepower to defend against the enemy's attack.

### The Collapse of the Enemy's General Counteroffensive - Dialogue Between Navy Press Section Chief Colonel Kurihara and Army Press Section Chief Colonel Matsumura of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters

### (Continued from the Second Edition of December 9th) - Desperate on the Front Lines, Production in the Rear

Colonel Matsumura:

In this fierce war, Japan must intercept the three major counteroffensives from the south, especially the counteroffensive where the situation is currently tight, and must stop it. Therefore, the previously mentioned large increase in aircraft production and strengthening of military production capacity is more important than anything else. Furthermore, the morale of the people is also very important. In addition, with the war situation already so tense, we must unite as a country domestically, and unite the nations of Greater East Asia in Greater East Asia. I think these are very important matters.

The phrase "unity of the nation" is often mentioned when the country is in times of trouble, but I think there has never been a time as important as today. To achieve "unity of the nation," the most important thing is for the army and navy to work together as one. Domestically, everyone should join hands and exert their total strength to the highest degree. In Greater East Asia, all nations should support each other and strive to defeat Britain and America. In short, it is the unity of 100 million and the gathering of one billion.

Colonel Kurihara:

This is just my personal opinion, but I have studied total war before. I feel that this war is gradually developing and has become a true total war. From an economic point of view, this war is a war of attrition. When implementing this large-scale war of attrition, it is very important to maintain the combat power of the front lines. For the sake of supplies, the country must devote itself to production. Thinking about this, it can be known that the soldiers on the front lines and those who have not yet

The supply to maintain combat power and replenish the war of attrition on the front lines, and the production for the implementation of supply. It is difficult to continue the war without any of the three.

I often compare this relationship to the relationship between the gunner firing the cannon, the ammunition bearer transporting the shells, and the ammunition depot worker handing the shells to the ammunition bearer. These three are recognized as combat by the navy. War is just like this. The soldiers on the front lines are the gunners; the sailors transporting various military supplies, fuel, and weapons are the ammunition bearers; the entire nation producing weapons is the ammunition depot worker. Thinking this way, the soldiers on the front lines, the sailors, and the entire nation engaged in production are all combatants. I think, doesn't this align with Prime Minister Tojo's "100 million combat deployment"?

In other words, in this war, not only the entire nation and the soldiers on the front lines, but also everyone else can be said to be engaged in the war with the same qualifications. Therefore, what we people in the rear have to deeply reflect on is, when the soldiers on the front lines—such as the soldiers defending Attu Island—are working so hard, why are we, the same Yamato race in the rear, not more serious? In the past, when Japanese people talked about the nation, everyone dedicated their lives to the country. This is the proper attitude of the Japanese people. If we properly discuss the essence of this war, the entire nation should seriously carry out this war with the true attitude of the Japanese people. If everyone can forget themselves and devote themselves to the country's crisis, then it can be said that we have established the so-called invincible system in terms of content.

We often talk about the war of righteousness, and we say that we win because it is a war of righteousness. I think that is indeed the case. Originally, because it is a war of righteousness, the entire nation engaged in this war is also fulfilling righteousness. When practicing righteousness, there is no friction, no jealousy, no sinister darkness, and everyone is friendly and harmonious. The army and navy are of course harmonious, and the entire nation is also harmonious. This harmonious effort ultimately leads to the war being won.

This war of righteousness, in other words, is the so-called "holy war." It is a holy war, so we win. This is what the Japanese people can say. When thinking of the holy war, there is really no need to consider sacrificing one's life. Forget everything and sacrifice oneself for the country; that way, the war will be won. If we forget this premise, forget this stage, and only verbally shout "It is a war of righteousness, so we win," but in reality, there is no righteous conduct, then that's terrible!

The country has recently been strengthened. The people are practicing righteousness. The people have responded to Prime Minister Tojo's call on September 14th and have risen up. This is because the people clearly know this premise. I hope that under this premise, we can forget ourselves even more, and the entire nation can become one, and move forward. That is what I am thinking.

Colonel Matsumura:

Recently, students have also enthusiastically joined the army. I think this fact is also an expression of the people's thorough understanding of the entity of the war.

Colonel Kurihara:

The students' enthusiastic uprising, I think, is precisely because they have clearly distinguished the essence of the war. The students have become one with the war! Now, those who are one with the war, first and foremost, are of course the soldiers on the front lines, and second, I think it is these students.

However, these students did not specifically obtain detailed war reports from the Imperial Headquarters, and the Asahi Shimbun's dispatches and features were not exclusively for the students. On the contrary, the students, because they are busy with their studies, do not observe the war situation in detail. But they know, "Today is the time for us to rise up." This is the expression of the true posture of the Japanese people who must all rise up. (Translation from Asahi Shimbun, December 5th)

### Advance Accounting and Payment for Purchased Gauze; Uninspected Gauze to be Kept by Original Applicant

Central News Agency report: The Business Coordination Council was ordered to handle the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in this city. The special fixed deposit slips to be paid have been approved by the Executive Yuan to start on October 1st. However, upon investigation, the types and names of the yarn and cloth applied for funding are numerous, and the quantities are also quite large, resulting in extremely complex and time-consuming procedures for sorting, investigating, and inspecting. In order to take care of business difficulties and enable them to receive the first installment of the fixed deposit slip payments on schedule and avoid long waits, special changes have been made. For the sold yarn and cloth that has not yet been inspected, the original applicant will first be responsible for safekeeping. The calculated price may be written by the applicant at the Cotton Industry Management Office, based on the standards set in the price appraisal table reported by the Business Coordination Council to the Executive Yuan for approval, after deducting the reserved quantity and exempt quantity, in order to verify the payment and notify collection. However, the applicant must guarantee the accuracy of the quantity, type, quality, and price of the goods sold, and must find two stores to guarantee them. If there are any shortages in the goods, if the varieties are substandard, or if the packaging is damaged in the future, it should be deducted from the price. That is, when the first special fixed deposit slip payment is received, the applicant must pay the difference to the Business Coordination Council in cash to complete the procedures and meet the actual situation. If the applicant conceals anything during the application, the guarantor shall bear joint and several legal liability. It is understood that the Council has specially stipulated the application filing date. It is hoped that all applicants for sale will verify the official receipt number and, in accordance with the regulations, take it to the Cotton Industry Management Office to obtain a price appraisal table and keep it in accordance with the regulations.

Regarding the outline for the purchase of wheat using exchanged materials and the implementation guidelines for exchanged materials needed for the procurement of rice and grain this year, it was resolved that the Business Coordination Council would be invited to convene representatives from the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee and the Rice and Grain Control Committee to discuss and decide on the 17th.

### Chinese and Japanese Press Circles Held a Joint Celebration Yesterday; The Situation Was Enthusiastic and Extremely Grand

Central News Agency report: In order to promote cultural communication between the two countries and unite members of the press circles, the Shanghai Press Association and the Japanese Press Club have held joint banquets twice. Yesterday, the Press Association held a Sino-Japanese Journalist Exchange Conference on the fourth floor of the Xingya Building. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. The details are as follows:

Gathering Together

The Sino-Japanese Journalist Exchange Conference was held at 6:00 PM. Allied officials and guests included Information Minister Hirota of the Japanese Embassy, Secretary Iwai, Director Izubuchi of the Army Press Department, Lieutenant Commander Nakagawa, Captain Tanda of the Fleet Press Department, and Tosuke Yoshida. Chinese officials and guests included Director Liang Xiuyu of the Propaganda Office, Zhang Yipeng, and Liu Haisu. Chinese and Japanese journalists included Shota Taro Miyake of the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun, Toshihiko Miyano of the Tokyo Shimbun, Keisuke Fujii of the Manchuria Daily News, Director Iwamoto of Domei News Agency, Masao Kawasaki and Sun Ming of the Chinese Department of the agency, Yang Huilang, Yu Naliang, and Hu Si'an of the Central Telegraph Agency's Shanghai branch, and members of the association: Yuichi Osaka, Naomasa Akamatsu, Hiroshi Kojima of the Mainland New Daily, Secretary Hu, Zhenyuan Dian, and Yunzhang Jiang, representing President Xu of the Jiuhua Daily, Chen Binhe, Xuncheng Niu, Hanru Liu, Huan Wan of Shen Bao, Guangjie Lu, Ke Chen, and Liudai Pan of Ping Bao, Rongze Zong, Yongkang Zhu, and Fu Wang of National News, Feng Lu, Yongqing Weng, Liugong Wu, Weiping Guo, Chi Xu, and Zhengguang Peng, Musong Zhu of New China News, Xiaoxue Xue of New Shen Bao, Yan Zheng, Zhongquan Cheng, Leshan Pan, and Youzhi Cao of Xinwen Bao, and General Secretary Yun of the association, and Secretary Zemin Di, etc., with no less than two hundred people. Chinese and Japanese journalists gathered together, and the atmosphere became even more enthusiastic.

Harmony and Joy

The Press Association believes that Sino-Japanese friendship values cultural exchange, and that the press circles are the vanguard of the cultural world. Therefore, at yesterday's grand meeting, in order to seek practical exchanges, the guests at the meeting were all arranged to sit in a lottery manner, entering the seats in order, which was of great significance. After everyone was seated, Chen Binhe, president of Shen Bao, the monthly executive director of the association, delivered a speech, saying that today is the second time that the association has hosted a banquet for allied colleagues. We are honored by the presence of everyone and the special presence of officials from both China and Japan, which shows the extraordinary friendship and cultural exchange between China and Japan. Therefore, no ceremony will be held at today's celebration, and we pray that it will be practical. I had the opportunity to visit your country to attend the Greater East Asia Press Conference held in Tokyo, and I witnessed the efforts of your country's press circles and the struggles of the soldiers on the front lines, which complement each other. I express my great respect for this point. At the same time, I visited the elder Mr. Chofu So, a pioneer in your country's press circles, in a personal capacity, and had a long talk, which was even more gratifying. Therefore, after returning to China from Tokyo, I felt that colleagues from both China and Japan should cooperate more closely. Not only in public affairs, but also in private contact, should be close. Last week, your country's famous economists held a reception, and I also expressed my opinion on this, hoping to strengthen contact even more in the future and strive to increase emotions. We should start with our colleagues, and I hope to strengthen contact in both public and private aspects, and I hope that in the future, the Sino-Japanese joint celebration will be jointly hosted by both parties, so that the meaning of the celebration will be more genuine. Then, Mr. Chen introduced the Chinese guests, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, and the famous artist Liu Haisu, and Mr. Zhang chanted an ancient poem, and then asked Lieutenant Commander Nakagawa to chant a famous Japanese poem. Finally, Miss Pan Liudai of Ping Bao sang "China's Clothing," and there were impromptu performances to add to the fun. The atmosphere was harmonious and joyful, with mutual congratulations and toasting, until the meeting ended happily at 10:00 PM.

At the meeting, representatives from each province and city reported on the handling of existing simple donation taxes in each province and city, and the amount of tax revenue, and discussed various issues after the implementation of the new tax in the future, in order to be thorough. As a result, it was decided that the above taxes will be uniformly handled by the central government and will be implemented starting on January 1, 1944.

### Tram Entering Depot Time Remains the Same; Rumors of Change are Untrue

Central News Agency report: According to today's Shanghai Evening News, the person in charge of the Shanghai Tram Company told the newspaper's reporter that the city's trams are still running as usual until 9:30 PM before entering the depot. Several newspapers in this area recently reported that the time would be changed to 8:00 PM starting today, which is not in line with the facts. If there are any changes in the future, another notice will be announced.

### Hua Tai Ferry Incident: Li Kaichen's Remarks; Overloading is the Main Cause

Central News Agency report: At about 7:00 PM on the 9th of this month, the Hua Tai ferry of the China Shipping Company sank in Xingang, drowning more than a thousand passengers. Li Kaichen, Director of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, made the following remarks: (1) Regarding the Hua Tai ferry incident, I deeply regret it after reading the newspaper reports. After inspecting and registering the ship, the total tonnage was 639.43 tons, the net tonnage was 359.07 tons, and the passenger capacity was limited to 538 people. However, the ship carried more than a thousand passengers this time, exceeding the capacity by more than double. Overloading is the main cause. (2) The Bureau has long ordered the handling of crew certification through the Ministry of Transportation. The crew hired by the company has mostly not been certified by the Bureau. The Bureau has repeatedly ordered them to come to the Bureau to handle the assessment, but the company has not complied, so the driving management may have gone awry. (3) After this case occurred, in addition to reporting to the Ministry of Construction, the Bureau has also sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to verify the handling. I hope that the families of the victims will come to the Bureau to clarify the details.

### Brief News

Personal parcels and personal small parcels sent to the Jinhua Bureau in the Zhejiang District can now be resumed. However, if they contain cigarettes, they must be accompanied by a permit before they can be accepted. As for other items, they can be handled according to the methods opened in Bureau Circular No. 5637. Bulk parcels and bulk small parcels sent to the Fanchuan Bureau in the Jiangsu District can be resumed.

### First District Office Prints Enemy Aircraft Diagrams and Builds Model Air-raid Shelters

Central News Agency report: According to today's Thames News, the First District Office told the newspaper's reporter that, in order to enable its subordinate civil servants to obtain practical air-raid knowledge, it will soon publish diagrams of enemy aircraft. The diagrams will show the front, rear, and side views of the American aircraft that may attack in the future, so that all staff members can memorize them and be able to identify them at a glance. It is also said that the Public Works Department of the office will build model air-raid shelters in various public places before the end of this year. The shelters will be square or circular in shape and can accommodate one to six people. As for the enemy aircraft printed in the diagrams, the four-engine aircraft will be a hybrid B24 and Boeing B17, the medium bomber will be a North American B26 or Martin B26, and the fighter will be a Curtis P40. In short, all aircraft are American Air Force aircraft, and are now uniformly used by the Chongqing side. The diagrams will also explain the new markings used by the U.S. Air Force. The form and color are a blue circle with a white star in the middle, with red-edged squares on both sides. Regarding air-raid shelters, various styles and sizes have been planned, and it is sought to be easy to build. The details are not yet known, but model shelters may be built in open spaces such as Zhaoyan Garden. The Public Works Department of the office will also urge the various Baojia districts to build shelters in appropriate places, so that even if houses collapse, they will not be affected. This method will make shelters spread throughout the city in a short period of time. The style of the air-raid shelters will be to build a staircase to reach the trench. The mud dug out of the trench will be piled around the trench for cover, in order to avoid enemy machine gun bullets and bomb fragments.

Economic Circles Commentary

### Implementing Thrift and Economy

Proactive wartime economic policies aim to increase production, while passive wartime economic policies aim to reduce consumption. The two must be implemented in succession to achieve the intended results of wartime economic policies. In recent days, the Central and North China regions have been actively implementing campaigns to reduce consumption. Notable examples include the implementation of restrictions on electricity consumption in Shanghai, the regulations on banquet restrictions in Beijing, and the reduction of newspaper businesses in Tianjin, leaving only five major and minor newspapers, all of which are restrictions adapted to the situation to save material resources.

According to the "Outline of Wartime Economic Policy," regarding reducing consumption, civilian materials related to military needs should encourage the manufacture of substitutes or the acquisition of substitute raw materials. The production of various expensive and luxury goods should be restricted or prohibited. All unnecessary consumption should be suppressed. A quota rationing system should be gradually and separately implemented. May we ask whether the above points have been earnestly promoted? The manufacture of substitutes is rarely heard of, the production of luxury goods remains the same, unnecessary consumption is countless, and the quota rationing system is not yet thorough. If we want to achieve the desired effect of reducing consumption, then in terms of implementation, we must fully promote, and even forcibly implement, the "Outline of Wartime Economic Policy." It seems insufficient to implement thrift and economy merely by using a "treating the head when it hurts, treating the foot when it hurts" approach.

### Trade Associations Order Members to Report Stored Goods and Submit Reports on Schedule for Filing

The various trade associations in this city, in order to prevent members from concealing goods or privately engaging in black market trading, are closely monitoring the shops and firms of their members. They send personnel to inspect their retail business operations at any time and inspect their purchase and sales ledgers. Recently, in order to understand the quantity of goods stored by each member at any time, the various trade associations have issued a type of goods storage report, ordering members to truthfully submit it to the association at the end of each month or every ten days for investigation. The report lists the name of the member's store, the address, the name of the warehouse where the goods are stored, the date and quantity of goods received, and the date and quantity of goods shipped. The report must also be stamped with the store's official seal. If the association finds that the information filled in on the report does not match the actual situation, it may be punished for the crime of hoarding.

### Chinese Stocks Fall Sharply and Rebound Slightly, Lunhua and Dingxin Alone See Price Increase

After a sharp drop in Chinese stocks yesterday, there was a sudden slight rebound. People's hearts have changed from tired to stable. The morning trend was soft, and buyers were reluctant to sell, resulting in a huge plunge. In the afternoon, many buyers appeared, and the rebound was also strong. However, due to the previous sharp drop, the closing price was still significantly lower than the previous day's. There were also outstanding performers, such as Lunhua and Dingxin in the "textile industry," and silk prices rose. Yong'an and Meiya were the most tired. Zhongfang, Xinhe, Hongxing, and other weaving companies all saw declines. In the "department store industry," Yong'an Company had low supply and high demand. At noon closing, it broke through 200 yuan. Xinxin fluctuated around the 140 yuan mark, both seeing small increases of four or five yuan. Guanghua Company's department store also saw a return to lower prices. In the "pharmaceutical industry," Xinya, Zhongfa, and others all saw small price increases. In the "financial industry," demand for withdrawals was high, and Shanghai and Zhejiang Xing both increased by 5,000 yuan. The salt industry was uniquely tired.

### Impoverished Compatriots Need Winter Clothing

At present, prices are soaring, and the lives of ordinary people are increasingly oppressed by life. At this time when the north wind is strong and the weather is getting colder every day, many impoverished compatriots are struggling to maintain their livelihoods, let alone making winter clothes. Some have even pawned all of their winter clothes. How will they survive the winter!

This time, the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao newspapers are raising funds for winter clothing to help impoverished compatriots. This action is very commendable. It is believed that society is not lacking in public-spirited people, and there are many wealthy people. It is hoped that they will understand the meaning of mutual assistance and sympathy and embrace the idea of helping others as if they were helping themselves. If they donate generously, the impoverished compatriots will greatly benefit!

The municipal authorities have always aimed to promote the welfare of the people and should also find ways to increase revenue to help them. It is my opinion that the ticket prices for entertainment venues in Shanghai have risen to over 100 yuan, and each venue is packed. If a certain amount is added to each ticket price, and small amounts are accumulated, this money can be used to make winter clothes. The impoverished compatriots will benefit greatly. With a simple wave of the hand, why wouldn't the authorities be happy to do so! (Zheng Yunying)

### Winter Clothing Donation Report

Huazhong Tobacco donated 500 yuan to the labor union, the fifth-grade class committee of the newspaper workers' elementary school donated 400 yuan, the sixth-grade class committee of the newspaper workers' elementary school donated 300 yuan, Suzhu Shuren Elementary School donated 224 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen, anonymous donor from the business department of Wuzhou Pharmacy donated 200 yuan, Mrs. Yin donated 50 yuan, totaling 1,674 yuan, 8 jiao, and 5 fen. Together with the previous balance, the total is 129,411 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

Eight

The main pillar has collapsed. For the Gu family, this is a serious problem, and the whole family now feels it deeply. The deceased Zhenji, in fact, single-handedly supported the family and everything inside and outside the shop. However, the emptiness felt by the bereaved family is not just the loss of a person responsible for buying and selling rice and groceries—it is not of that nature.

(Daddy is gone)

The emptiness felt by Sueo, who is only five years old this year, is also the state of mind of everyone in the family.

In particular, the impact on Wakako is even greater. In any occasion, she is not a woman who oversteps in front of her husband. Although her hands are already like worn-out baseball gloves, she still works tirelessly, ultimately being a good helper to her husband. She silently and attentively understood her husband's feelings, raised her children, and worked hard in the store. Therefore, is this woman like a boat that has lost its rudder?

What will happen to the store? What will happen to Chunko, who is 26 years old, and Mitsuko, who is 23 years old? How will Jindo and Sueo grow up?

(No matter what, we have to find a way?)

Whether she can do it or not, the woman can only shoulder all the realities of the burden.

If she were the wife of a samurai family, then in the Satsuma region, Wakako would have to gather her children in front of her father's ancestral tablet and resolutely order something. But she did not do that. On the day after the funeral, she tied up the thick apron left by her husband and silently began to work several times harder than before. When Zennichiro, who was teaching as a substitute, said he wanted to stay in the store to help, Wakako shook her head.

Due to her mother's instinct, she knows the paths of her sons. They are not suited to work in the store. They should go their own paths. For the same reason, she accepted Shirokichi's request. Shirokichi, the most gentle of the brothers, dropped out of Kojima Commercial School after two years and took care of the shop. Just like Jindo, he did not complain at all. He took off his uniform and stood beside the rice milling machine.

The women are even more responsible, from the eldest daughter Chunko, who has missed her marriage, to Hokko, who is 16 years old, each has her own duties. In this way, the new system of the Gu family has begun.

Soon, the children forgot the emptiness of not having a father. Because the Gu family did not know when they had erected a new main pillar. Wakako is that pillar. Although she is not a heroine or an efficient mother, the children's instinctual trust is firmly tied to her.
