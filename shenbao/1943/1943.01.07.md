### On Discussing and Clarifying Politics

Speaking of discussing and clarifying politics, it can be divided into two aspects: addressing the root cause and addressing the symptoms. To seek the way to clarification from politics itself is to seek the way to clarification from the aspects of personnel selection, legislation, and execution, which is addressing the root cause. The fundamental principles of Chinese political science for addressing the root cause are only eight characters:

"Appoint the virtuous and employ the capable, reward merit and punish wrongdoing."

Mr. Lu Xiangshan once said, "Without rules, there can be no circles or squares." The importance of legislation is by no means accidental. However, after reading Chinese political history, one may ask, what is the reason for the darkness and corruption of Chinese politics for thousands of years? Although this is a big question that cannot be fully discussed in a few words, the basic direction is very clear, which lies not in the lack of good legislation, but in the fact that all good legislation is not effectively and appropriately implemented. To quote an ancient saying, it is "having laws but lacking those who can govern." In Chinese history, there were countless good laws and political programs, but they were all ruined by "the lack of those skilled in execution." Wang Mang's reform knew how to implement new laws but did not know how to use new people, resulting in his disgrace and becoming a sinner for thousands of years. Wang Anshi's reform followed the old path of Wang Mang's failure and was ruined by "appointing treacherous people." Unfortunately, later scholar-officials did not understand this key point and focused their attacks on the new laws of the two Wangs, while foreign historians only studied how the new laws of the two Wangs were, but neglected whether the new laws of the two Wangs were truly implemented, how they were implemented, and by whom they were implemented. In other countries, the problem lies mostly in legislation, and what the people strive for is good legislation. But what about China? It is not only necessary to strive for good legislation, but more importantly, to strive for people who can implement good legislation. If one believes that having good legislation is evidence of a bright future for Chinese politics, that is a huge mistake.

From this, it can be seen that in addition to legislation, the way to clarify Chinese politics mainly relies on "personnel selection" and "administration." Personnel selection requires "appointing the virtuous and employing the capable," and administration is "executing legislation," which requires "rewarding merit and punishing wrongdoing." First, let's talk about "appointing the virtuous and employing the capable." Here, we must pay attention to the distinction between virtue and ability. A capable person is not necessarily virtuous, and a virtuous person must also be capable. Non-virtuous capable people should be focused on the word "employ," while virtuous and capable people must be "appointed." From this, it can be seen that the main thing is to value and appoint the virtuous. In modern terms, it means to appoint those who have political knowledge and skills and have the spirit of sacrificing everything for the country and the people. Such people's involvement in politics is not for personal gain or loss, not for personal likes and dislikes, but for saving the country and the nation, for saving the people, and for realizing their political ideals. As for the "capable" people, in modern terms, they are people with specialized knowledge and skills. It is not necessarily expected that all of these people have a revolutionary spirit and qualities, or have the morality of engaging in politics to save the country and love the people. Although they must also be absorbed, they must be placed under the "virtuous" and be skillfully used by the "virtuous." Only when virtuous and capable individuals are absorbed into the periphery of government policies, only when all opportunists who are neither virtuous nor capable are expelled from the government, and only when they are deprived of any opportunities for reliance and association can merit be rewarded and wrongdoing be punished, and only then can good legislation - political programs and policies - be fully implemented.

Next, let's talk about "administration." The main thing is to reward merit and punish wrongdoing. First, it is necessary to "appoint the virtuous and employ the capable," and second, it is necessary to implement the spirit of "impartiality and selflessness." That is, to regard politics itself as a common goal, and not to regard "administration" as a means to achieve any personal goals. This point is even more important in China, because China has been under autocratic feudalism for almost a thousand years, and everyone is shrouded in the concept of family private property. The imperial court has the saying of "governing the world with filial piety," openly encouraging the pursuit of family interests. For example, Confucian scholars have the proposition of "respecting their position and valuing their emolument to encourage affection for relatives." Aren't these political poisons that reward selfishness and harm the public being tasted by many politicians today? In this kind of traditional thinking, everyone only knows how to pursue personal gain and only knows how to employ people based on personal relationships, so administrative rewards and punishments also become private. Rewards and promotions are disorderly, and punishments and prohibitions are not implemented. All laws and systems become mere formalities. Everyone only knows that engaging in politics is a means to achieve personal goals or satisfy desires. Therefore, those who are close and affectionate occupy important positions in the government. As a result, they do nothing all day long, their words are not righteous, and they sit idle and harm the country. In addition, acts of relying on power to bully the good and oppress the people emerge endlessly.

Using impartial and selfless spirit in personnel selection and administration, and implementing "appointing the virtuous and employing the capable, rewarding merit and punishing wrongdoing," is the fundamental solution to clarifying politics. However, at the same time, we must also consider the actual environment of the political society and pay attention to symptomatic solutions. It is undeniable that, in the Chinese government, in addition to a very small number of outstanding and extraordinary senior talents, there are three types of people: the first and highest level are the "masters," the second level are the "clerks," and the third level are the "runners." There are significant gaps in economic status, social status, and spirit among these three levels. The first type is the "haves," who are very wealthy in terms of material enjoyment, social status, and personal dignity. Apart from lecturing to the clerks and runners every day, telling them about principles and doctrines, and asking them to be loyal and make sacrifices, they themselves go to enjoy life. The second and third types are the "have-nots," who are the actual political workers and implementers. However, they have no status in terms of economy or society. After working hard and being trained every day, they return home and are at a loss when facing their wives, children, parents, and elders who are not well-fed or warmly clothed. Therefore, the good people "perfunctorily perform their duties" and "only seek to avoid mistakes" in their political work; while the cunning ones only rely on the government's reputation to engage in corruption and bribery, and the darkness and corruption of politics are unbearable to hear. Therefore, if we want to discuss clarifying politics today, we must also thoroughly remove the barriers between government staff members, equalize the living standards of political workers at all levels, make upper-level personnel have real work besides giving speeches, writing articles, and socializing, and greatly improve the living standards of middle and lower-level personnel, so that they can obtain due stability in terms of economic status, social status, and spirit. Finally, what is even more important is that, whether addressing the root cause or the symptoms, we require the people to have the opportunity to speak out and participate in politics, and we require public opinion to have the opportunity to rise up. Only in this way can the clarification of politics be guaranteed, and only when politics is clarified can cooperation between China and Japan and victory in war be guaranteed.

### Fierce Battles Continue Between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Velikiye Luki Area; Soviet Offensives on the Don River and Lake Ilmen Are Repelled by German Forces with Heavy Losses

Berlin, 6th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Fierce fighting continues on the Eastern Front, with particularly intense fighting on the Don River front. Soviet forces launched an offensive in the central part of the Eastern Front, but were met with fierce resistance from German forces. The Soviet forces suffered heavy losses in both manpower and materials. Soviet forces launched six offensives southeast of Lake Ilmen, suffering particularly heavy losses.

Bern, Switzerland, 6th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to German sources, fierce fighting continued yesterday in the Velikiye Luki area on the Eastern Front. German forces destroyed 14 Red Army tanks and destroyed a Red Army base in the Caucasus. German aircraft also bombed the Kirieshi area and attacked enemy transport units. In the Terek area, repeated Soviet offensives were repelled. Fighting continues in the Don River area. According to Soviet sources, the situation in the Velikiye Luki area is chaotic, and there is fierce fighting in the Mozdok area and southwest of Stalingrad. Encirclements are taking place between Kotelnikovo and Elista.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German military authorities issued a statement at noon on the 5th regarding the situation on the Eastern Front, stating that although Soviet forces have recently launched constant counter-offensives in various places, the overall situation of the war has hardly changed. The Soviet Union's claim that it has recovered Velikiye Luki is merely an exaggerated and false propaganda. The German positions in the area remain as solid as ever. The Soviet counter-offensive launched in the Terek area was defeated after losing a large number of tanks. The enemy has also been repelled in the Don River area after fierce fighting. The German military authorities are still keeping silent about the detailed situation in various places. Based on past experience, it can be seen that this treasure has a profound meaning. Although the Soviet Union has repeatedly published special war results, it is difficult to determine the true situation in the vast combat area and severe winter climate. The Soviet Union has repeatedly attempted to stimulate the German side by publishing information, so the German side has had to issue explanations in order to clarify the current state of the war.

### Axis Submarines Go to the Atlantic to Prepare to Attack British Convoys

Bern, Switzerland, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to sources in Berlin, the Axis countries have dispatched several submarines to the Atlantic in order to attack convoys transporting troops and military aircraft to the British military headquarters in North Africa. The Allies are attempting to use the protection of the African coast and shorten the sea route from Brazil to near Cape Verde in Africa, so most of the Axis submarines are long-range submarines and are fully equipped to cope with this difficult task. Some of them even have special equipment to carry out repairs on the high seas.

### Japanese Aircraft Soar Over Tokyo to Celebrate Unprecedented Victory

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A large formation of approximately 500 Japanese army air force aircraft, consisting of heavy and light bombers and various types of fighter and reconnaissance aircraft, visited Nanjing at 11:00 a.m. on the 6th. The roaring of engines and the glittering of silver wings filled the air as they unfolded a grand aerial review to celebrate the Japanese army's unprecedented victory. Seven million citizens of Tokyo looked up at the majestic appearance of the aircraft and were all extremely excited.

### German Forces on the Tunisian Front Break Through British and American Positions in Two Places

Rome, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Italian military headquarters announced the battle situation on the 5th as follows: 1. On the Sirte front, the land battle has been difficult since the 4th due to adverse weather conditions. In the southern desert area of ​​Libya, the anti-Axis forces are strengthening their pressure on the Axis forward outposts. 2. On the Tunisian front, the Axis forces repelled the counter-attacking enemy forces, capturing six enemy generals and 300 soldiers. In addition, a German assault team broke through two anti-Axis positions, capturing 28 British soldiers and two generals. 3. The Axis air force bombed the port of Algiers on the night of the 4th, heavily damaging the port facilities and military areas. 4. The anti-Axis air force attacked the island of Lampedusa, causing minor damage.

Vichy, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Military observers here said that the bridgeheads held by the Axis forces near Bizerte and Tunis are the most important and solid positions in the North African war. The Axis forces' occupation of Bizerte and Tunis is sufficient to completely control the "waist of the Mediterranean" and render the Anglo-American attempt to maintain east-west traffic in the Mediterranean hopeless. The British have repeatedly attempted to send merchant ship convoys from the port of Gibraltar to the eastern Mediterranean, but the voyage along the African sea route to Egypt and Malta requires at least 14,000 miles. On the Axis side, the distance from Cape Bon near Tunis to Marsala in Sicily is only a narrow strip of water, and there is also the island of Pantelleria in the middle, which, although lacking natural ports, is a very important base that can serve as a base for submarines and air forces. It has been fortified in recent years and several airfields have been built. The waters between Tunisia and Sicily are controlled by more distant submarine and naval air bases. Sicily, Trapani, Palermo, Catania, and Augusta are all strong air bases. Cagliari at the southern tip of Sardinia is also an important military point. It can be seen from this that the positions held by the Axis forces are extremely dangerous and solid.

### Japanese Air Force Captain Talks About His Impressions of Combat

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army front-line base, after the Japanese air force repeatedly bombed Chittagong, Tinsukia, Yunnan-Yi, Calcutta, and other places, the enemy aircraft have been on the verge of annihilation. The commander of a certain unit of the Japanese air force, who has participated in numerous battles since attacking the Tinsukia airport on December 25 last year, recently expressed his impressions, saying that the training and education of the enemy air force stationed in India have not yet been fully developed, especially the fighter aircraft. They have actually only received two-fifths or one-third of the Japanese education and have not received local training before participating in combat. Their technology is far inferior to ours. Moreover, in aerial combat, the machines and technology must be completely consistent in order to achieve results. The enemy lacks this integration, relying only on superior machines and neglecting fighting spirit. This is their biggest defect. We shoot accurately, but enemy aircraft pursue from a distance of 100 meters, so the low hit rate can be imagined. Until recently, enemy aircraft would flee as soon as they saw our fighters. Furthermore, the enemy has been making great efforts to replenish aircraft and personnel, seeming to be making a desperate defense. As for our side, we are constantly training in combat tactics, hoping to give the enemy a painful blow.

### Thailand Announces This Year's Budget

Bangkok, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Thailand's budget for this year, which was passed by parliament in November of last year, was officially announced in a special government gazette on the 5th. The total revenue is 148,697,769 baht, with capital expenditures of 1,297,593 baht. Both revenue and expenditure are lower than last year's 165,596,883 baht. The main items include national defense expenditures of 40,377,125 baht and internal affairs expenditures of 27,195,918 baht. All expenditures are reduced compared to last year. In addition, the various capitals of the newly established Thailand Rubber Company, state-owned companies, and the Central Bank are all drawn from the country's public bonds, the Ministry of Finance's reserves, and other revenues.

Brief News from Kangding

### Transferred from Macau in November of the 31st Year

The work of purchasing food grains in Western Sichuan, Kang District, began on October 1st. The Ningya districts began on November 1st. Currently, the Provincial Government, together with the Field Management Office, has issued an order to start the requisition, with a uniform limit of two months to complete the purchase. It is said that the staff handling the requisition work in Western Sichuan have changed the scales to the new city scale. With one entry and one exit, the nouveaux riches have increased again.

Now is the time when the weather is clear and crisp outside the pass in autumn, the so-called "July, August, September is the best time to travel." In general, Kang Tibetan lama temples and merchants from the caravan continue to arrive in Ya, exchanging cloth for tea, so the business of the various "guo chun" (tea shops) has suddenly become active.

The Dengke ferry crossing on the Jinsha River, which must be passed when traveling from northern Kang to Tibet, originally had two leather boats for ferrying. Recently, due to the frequent visits of Han and Tibetan officials and merchants, the original leather boats are not sufficient for use. The Provincial Government has ordered the Transportation Bureau to improve wooden boats and to repair the old roads of Yajiang, Tianquan, Baoxing, and Maoxian counties to facilitate transportation.

According to a telegram from Team Leader Du of the surveying team from Dege to Yushu: The team's work is progressing smoothly, and it can be completed by the end of this year.

Due to poor food, the health of teachers and students at the Western Sichuan Normal School has been greatly affected. The faculty and staff of the school have jointly telegraphed the "Ministry of Education" to negotiate.

### Small Businessmen's Complaints

The Troublesome Story of the Nanxiong Direct Tax Bureau

I am a small businessman dealing in Nanxiong tobacco leaves. Each day I go to Nanxiong, carrying the residential and commercial sales permit I obtained from the Direct Tax Bureau, intending to use it for the purchase of tobacco. Before the establishment of the Nanxiong Direct Tax Bureau, I would take the purchase and sales permit to the Qujiang Direct Tax Bureau after the goods arrived in Qujiang to complete the shipping手续, which had been smooth for months. However, since the Nanxiong Direct Tax Bureau opened on September 1st, it has deliberately created difficulties for outside tobacco merchants who hold complete purchase and sales permits. For example, if one could pay tens of dollars in "activity fees," even if the regulations were slightly non-compliant, they would be allowed to pass. This is not a fabrication. Relevant authorities may wish to send personnel to investigate. It is estimated that because of the Nanxiong Direct Tax Bureau's obstruction, as many as four to five thousand pieces of Nanxiong tobacco leaves have been held up. It is known that these tobacco leaves are used as raw materials for local handmade paper cigarettes. Recently, many cigarette factories in Guilin and Liuzhou have suspended operations because they lack tobacco leaves, which directly hinders the development of commercial businesses. Even if that is not important, how can we not be concerned about the indirect impact on the livelihoods of workers in various cigarette factories? To care for merchants and facilitate business, the establishment of a direct tax agency in Nanxiong has only increased the suffering of countless merchants. What to do? What to do?

Sudden Increase in Wine Tax in Dabu Township, Liucheng

I am a wine merchant who has been engaged in winemaking for several years. In the past, wine tax was an obligation that merchants should fulfill. Now, there are many problems with the wine tax in Muxiang Township, and the tax authorities have failed to provide a satisfactory answer, which is regrettable.

The total amount of wine tax in Muxiang Township used to be more than 1,500 yuan in national currency. Starting in September, it suddenly increased to 8,500 yuan, an increase of five or six times. According to past tax increases, there has never been a sudden increase of more than five times. Later, it was investigated that although the wine tax in neighboring townships had increased, the amount of the increase was small. For example, in nearby Shapu Township, the tax amount used to be more than one hundred yuan, and now it has increased to 2,000 yuan, and the total increase is less than five times. However, according to a comparison of the tax amounts in the two townships, the wine tax in this township is four, two, and one times that of Shapu Township. In addition, according to a comparison of the wine production in the two townships, it is only two, five, and one times. The county is the same district, but the tax bureaus are different, and the intentions of the tax authorities regarding the increase are not known. Due to the increase in wine tax, the tax authorities have instead reduced the tax payment procedures. In the past, every time taxes were paid, the tax authorities would issue receipts. Now, the tax authorities have tacitly canceled the purchase procedure. The reason for the cancellation, according to the tax bureau, is that receipts are unnecessary and wasteful. This is the only reason the tax bureau has given for abolishing receipts. However, according to the past procedures for paying taxes, the tax bureau needed to issue receipts, which indicated that the tax was statutory and that the tax bureau was responsible for the funds. Now the tax bureau has canceled the receipt procedure. Perhaps the tax bureau was ordered to increase wine tax and also to reduce the number of staff filling out receipts! The reason for this must have something that is difficult to understand.

In the past, the wine tax in this township was apportioned according to the amount of wine produced by each household. Now it is different. The tax bureau evenly distributes the total amount of wine tax to each household. Because of this, problems have arisen. Because during the tax increase, some winemakers with larger capital gathered together into one household and secretly engaged in winemaking, paying the wine tax for only one household. Because their production volume is high, and the tax amount is the same as winemakers with small production volumes, their costs are low and their selling prices are cheap. Therefore, small winemakers are being defeated by them invisibly.

### On the Eve of the Opening of the U.S. Congress, Both Parties Prepare Strategies, Next Year's Budget Reaches Tens of Millions of Yuan, Optimism Difficult for the President's Control of Congress

Lisbon, 6th (Haitong News Agency) A Washington dispatch states that the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States are making final efforts to prepare for the opening of Congress. The Democratic Party still nominates Rayburn as Speaker of the House of Representatives, while the Republican Party focuses on Marley. In the meeting to decide its policy, the Republican Party decided on all government proposals. At the same time, the Democratic Party also disagrees with the "American Piverlayqi Plan." Political observers in the U.S. capital believe, based on the current situation, that it is difficult for President Roosevelt to control the current Congress. When drafting the message to Congress, President Roosevelt invited Hopkins, Rosenman, and the famous writer Sherwood as his advisors.

Lisbon, 6th (Haitong News Agency) According to White House Secretary O'Leary yesterday, the U.S. next year's budget, which was originally scheduled to be submitted to Congress this Friday, will be submitted to Congress for approval next Monday. It was previously known that the U.S. war expenditure budget for one year from July 1st is 10 million yuan.

Lisbon, 6th (Haitong News Agency) According to Washington news, President Roosevelt has issued an order stipulating that the wartime transportation bureau controls the country's buses, streetcars, and ferries. At the same time, it was announced that the Ministry of Justice has stopped investigating railroad companies and automobile companies that were accused of violating antitrust laws, but the reasons were not disclosed.

### United Nations Issues Joint Statement

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) Although there have been frequent reports of the anti-Axis countries launching a counterattack in 1943, in reality, the situation of the war is already irreversible. Moreover, because the war has become protracted, disagreements have been exposed at any time. According to a Washington dispatch, the so-called seventeen United Nations and the French National Committee issued a statement on the 5th stating that all property in occupied countries will be returned to its rightful owners after the Axis powers are driven out of those countries. Merchants in neutral countries believe that the purpose of this statement is to prevent divisions and disputes caused by disagreements among the anti-Axis countries.

### Girod Arrives in Dakar Suddenly

Tangier, 6th (Haitong News Agency) Girod arrived in Dakar today to inspect various parts of French West Africa. His plane was escorted by twenty-five planes. After Girod arrived in Dakar, he immediately held talks with the Governor-General of French West Africa, Boyason. London expressed considerable surprise at Girod's sudden arrival in Dakar.

Lisbon, 6th (Haitong News Agency) According to Algiers Radio, the new British Resident Minister in North Africa, Malcolm MacDonald, visited Girod, Chairman of the North African French political power, on the 5th to hold talks. In addition, Girod is also scheduled to go to Dakar to meet with U.S. military representatives within a few days.

Lisbon, 6th (Haitong News Agency) The headquarters of the anti-Axis forces in French North Africa previously arrested twelve senior French officials who were planning to assassinate Girod, Chairman of the North African French political power. According to a telegram from Algiers, the U.S. authorities are still continuing to conduct fierce investigations throughout Algiers and have arrested many people. It is reported that among these arrested persons, there are also people close to Girod. Their names have not yet been determined. It is learned that a senior French general is also among those arrested. Girod is also quite dissatisfied with the U.S.'s suspicious actions and is reported to have raised objections to Murphy, the U.S. Chief Administrator of North Africa.

In addition, the British Ambassador to Spain, Hall, also participated in the talks. After the meeting ended, Gort left for London to report on the political situation to his country. At the same time, Eisenhower also returned to Algiers.

### British Newspapers Advocate Opening a Second Battlefield

Stockholm, 6th (Haitong News Agency) According to a report from the Stockholm newspaper's correspondent in London, British newspapers are now issuing urgent calls, demanding the speedy establishment of a second battlefield. According to the News Chronicle, a newspaper belonging to the British Labour Party, whether viewed politically or militarily, the establishment of a second battlefield is an urgent task. Before the Soviet Union launches an offensive, we must obtain a base on the European continent. If we look at Germany in 1918 and today, we know that today's German army has obtained greater resources. Therefore, we must quickly build a second front to disperse Germany's fifty divisions in the Soviet territory, lest Germany launch a spring offensive again this year.

### Authorities Plan to Consult and Purchase Rice from Various Regions, Rationing of Food Products Will Gradually Increase, A Large Amount of Sugar Has Arrived in Shanghai and Entered Warehouses

The rise in rice prices not only affects public security and the people's livelihood, but also stimulates the prices of all goods, which is not a small matter. The authorities are continuing to take necessary measures to ensure that the amount of supply is sufficient for the residents of all circles to cook with the household rice flour purchased on schedule. Currently, the rice prices in the nearby areas and Shanghai are vastly different. We are studying with relevant parties to find ways to transport it to Shanghai for the market. In the near future, we may jointly purchase a large amount of rice from rice-producing areas in cooperation with the Japanese side.

Household Rice Price

The contracting rice shops handling the sale of household rice have received the twenty-third batch of purchase orders and started paying the money to pick up the goods from the designated warehouses yesterday. The upper [illegible] reporter learned from the rice industry that the next batch of household grain will be given half a liter of white rice, one liter of brown rice, and half of magazine rice, which is half a liter more than the previous batch. Flour will be one and a half catties, which is four taels less than the previous batch. The price of rice for each rice shop is 304 yuan and 4 jiao, and the price of each bag of flour is 92 yuan. As for the quantity and price sold by each rice shop, it must wait for the official announcement by the authorities.

Control Office Plan

Since the Public Works Bureau's Material Control Office separated from the General Office this year and became an independent agency, it is now expanding its scope of work and cooperating with relevant authorities to implement new price management countermeasures. The most important step at present is to adjust the supply and demand of materials within the concession. It is said that the decision has been made to increase the items of material rationing in the shortest possible time. The principle is that the rationing items are not limited to the existing white rice, flour, and bread, and will be extended to all food products. Once all food products are rationed, they will be extended to the clothing department. Consumer associations and purchasing associations will be used as rationing agencies. The organization of these agencies will make full use of the Baojia system.

Oil on Sale Starting Today

After the retail oil shops in the two concessions and the urban area were divided into two groups, A and B, to sell edible oil, Group A had already sold out on January 3. From the 4th, both groups A and B did not sell. Starting today (the 7th), Group B oil shops will continue to sell for four days. The total amount of more than 4,000 dan that had been paid for on the 5th and received on the 6th has been completely picked up last night and can be sold in full starting at 9:00 AM today. The oil will still be purchased by each person by queuing up according to the number, and each person can buy one catty of oil for 7 yuan and 1 jiao in storage notes, including donation. The sales period is scheduled for four days, until the 10th when it will be sold out. Whether it will be distributed by head or by household after the 10th is still being planned in detail.

This Month's Sugar

The Sugar Cooperative Business Office has been approved by the authorities, and the total monthly ration will increase to 40,000 bags starting in January. According to a Great Eastern News Agency reporter, December's sugar is still being retailed, and the rationing [illegible] for January has been issued, with a deadline for receiving the certificate before the 8th.

The actual amount of sugar stored in this city is gradually decreasing. It is learned that a large amount of sugar has been shipped by friendly countries and is being stored in warehouses. Therefore, the sugar supply in this city will not be interrupted and will continue.

### The Burmese Consulate General in Shanghai Was Officially Established Yesterday, Ren Hetake as Consul General

### Record of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference (7), Translated from the "Domei Xunbao" in Late November 1942

Second Section: Finance

In the morning, the second section elected Mr. Masaji Arakawa, Director of the "Bank of Japan," as chairman. The discussions were centered on financial countermeasures that are more ideal for the economic construction of Greater East Asia. On the Japanese side was Shojiro Kudo; in addition, there were many representatives from Manchuria, Mongolia, and various regions of China. Regarding the establishment of a financial cooperation system within the circle, and the cargo transportation countermeasures in various regions, sincere and brilliant opinions were successively expressed. The main points of everyone's speeches are as follows:

Shojiro Kudo—Japan

Based on the financial countermeasures that are ideal for the economic construction of Greater East Asia, I hope everyone will pay attention to the following four points:

(1) The currency and financial policies of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must not resort to verbal or active means and must be implemented in a planned manner under the command of Japan.

(2) A single currency within the circle is not suitable for the actual conditions of each region.

(3) The exchange rate between the currency of each region and the yen must fully reference the pre-war ratio. The subsequent changes, the common main materials and price levels of each region, as well as the economic strength of each region, should be fully considered when determining the rates.

(4) Once the exchange rate is decided, it is best to keep it as fixed as possible and not change it again.

(5) The funds for expanding production in various regions must not rely solely on Japan's supply, but should be coordinated locally as much as possible.

Tsuneo Uchida—Manchuria

Regarding the price issue in Manchuria, the resolution of the following three items is very important:

(1) The implementation of the Five-Year Industrial Plan and prices;

(2) Countermeasures to deal with the impact of special price phenomena in adjacent regions;

(3) Maintaining low prices for important exports to Japan.

The emphasis must be placed on these three points before the integrated economy of Japan and Manchuria can be achieved.

Ouyang Zaixiang—North China

(1) The reason why prices in North China are more expensive compared to Japan and Manchuria is due to the sharp drop in prices in legal tender, the low level of productivity, the undetermined economic circle in North China, and inflation.

(2) However, in the financial aspect, the financial institution management rules have already been implemented. Therefore, the prices of commodities other than the main food products have been suppressed.

(3) The current problem is the rising price of food, daily necessities, etc. This is because the above-mentioned items must rely on foreign countries. Therefore, we are now urgently seeking to establish a self-sufficient circle in North China. If this can be successful, all problems will be solved.

Shen Wenbing—Mengjiang

(1) The reasons for the high prices in Mengjiang are due to the impact of legal tender prices outside the region, the expansion of Meng currency, and the sluggishness of exports.

(2) As a countermeasure to the above-mentioned phenomena, price and purchase controls are being strictly implemented. In the financial aspect, emphasis is being placed on financing, absorbing purchasing power, unifying financial institutions, and controlling remittances.

(3) Because of imports, prices in Mengjiang are higher than in other regions. Therefore, it has been decided to control the import and export of materials, adjust their prices, and strive to be a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Pan Tingwu—Guangdong

Lin Jichuan—Xiamen

(1) For the sake of the stability of the lives of the people in Central and Southern China, we hope to revive remittances from overseas Chinese.

(2) The current situation of unsmooth material exchanges, we hope to dredge them within the possible range, and hope to give a comprehensive characteristic to the extremely isolated economies of the current regions.

### The French Concession Will Levy a Baojia Surtax Starting This Year, the Tax Rate is 10% of the House Tax, the Baojia Voluntary Donation Will Be Discontinued From Today

French Authorities Bulletin No. 1 states that the Baojia voluntary donation will no longer be collected from today. For this reason, all Lianbao, Bao, and Jia personnel are not allowed to collect Baojia donations in any way in the future. However, starting from January 1, 1943, a Baojia surtax will be established separately and paid at the same time as the house tax. The tax rate for taxpayers to pay the surtax is, in principle, 10% of the house tax, which will be collected by the French Municipal Council's Donation Office. Those who violate this will please report to the nearest police station immediately. This bulletin.

### The Public Concession Economic Police Department Is Assigned to Mr. Gotō Concurrently as Director

According to well-informed sources, after the two concession police forces strengthened their police force last year and achieved remarkable results in dealing with crimes related to financial and other issues, the French Concession will also add a similar organization. The relevant authorities will make further efforts starting this spring to make the security in the concession more solid. The details are as follows:

Planned to Establish in the Near Future

According to already confirmed news, the Public Concession Upper Bureau Police Department plans to establish an Economic Police Department in the near future. The director will be concurrently held by the Deputy Police Chief Gotō. Once established, crimes related to economic and financial issues will be handled by the department. For example, the speculators who were arrested in the gold market in the second half of last year will be directly handled by the department in the future. As for the shops that exceed the price limit, the illegal merchants who hoard goods, and others who knowingly disrupt the people's livelihood and still seek their own profiteering, it is heard that the newly established Economic Police Department will investigate, arrest, and punish them in the future.

Staff Recruited from Japan

Because the establishment of the Economic Police Department is sufficient to suppress prices and maintain the normal life of the general public, the residents of this port hope that such a plan can be realized as soon as possible. It is also heard that the Public Concession Police Department will recruit some of the staff of the Economic Police Department from Japan, and the other part will be trained in this port. As for the French Concession, it is heard that it will follow in the footsteps of the Public Concession. After the Public Concession establishes the Economic Police Department, the French Police Department will also add a similar organization.

### Talk by the Japanese Ambassador at a Reception

Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: The Japanese Embassy in this city, as per usual practice, held a reception for the Chinese press corps of this city at the Cathay Hotel yesterday (the 6th) at 3:00 PM. More than ten reporters from various newspapers in this city attended. From the embassy side, Information Minister Hirota, accompanied by Vice-Consul Fuku, attended on time. During the reception, they exchanged views on the recent world situation over the past week and held cordial discussions for a long time. Regarding the recent frequent rumors of Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the United States, Information Minister Hirota also provided a detailed critique. He said that although there had been rumors about Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the United States, its possibility would await factual proof. If Chiang Kai-shek were indeed to make this trip to the United States, he would offer the following points: Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the United States would inevitably be to request the United States to step up its aid with a large amount of military supplies and to open up transportation routes. Chiang Kai-shek's blind resistance war is self-aware of being stuck in a quagmire from which he cannot extricate himself, and deeply feels that his days are numbered. The United States' aid to Chiang Kai-shek is merely Roosevelt's perfunctory trick. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek is making this trip to lobby American political circles, hoping to obtain a dream of massive aid. At the same time, due to the blockade of the Burma Road, transportation has been greatly hampered, and this is to open up a new path. Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States have suffered major blows. For example, the United States has suffered heavy losses in naval battles on islands such as the Solomon Islands and Hawaii, to the point where they cannot be recovered. At the same time, the Allied forces of Britain and the United States have repeatedly suffered defeats in North Africa and are unable to take care of themselves. How can they plan to aid Chiang Kai-shek? Therefore, this visit by Chiang Kai-shek will certainly be difficult to fulfill. As the Axis forces win victory after victory, they will inflict major blows on the United Nations. Therefore, Britain and the United States also know that they cannot extricate themselves and have no hope of victory. They are putting on a show to ease public sentiment regarding Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the United States. The Allied front has already revealed its predicament, and its collapse is not far off, and so on. The reception ended with refreshments at 5:00 PM.

Japanese residents must apply to the Japanese consulate.

### Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Postpones Its Annual Meeting

### Recent Situation of the Zhendong Agricultural Village Run by Overseas Chinese from Canada in Kunshan

The Zhendong Agricultural Village is located in Xianglu Township, Third District, Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province. In 1926, overseas Chinese from the United States and Canada raised more than 600,000 yuan to purchase more than 3,000 mu of land there and build more than 61 Western-style houses and more than 20 fish ponds. The current market value of the farmland is estimated at about 7 to 8 million yuan. After the August 13th Incident, the villagers took refuge elsewhere, and the fields were devastated. Later, representatives of the village, Huang Chouli and Huang Baiman, and others appealed to the committee to find a way to recover the village so that they could move back to live there. Subsequently, Committee Member Chen Jicheng sent Committee Member Hui Ling to Kunshan County Government and negotiated with the local garrison to assist in the matter. As a result, the property was returned to its original owners. Thereupon, the overseas Chinese villagers moved back to live there one after another. Later, He Zhuoyan and others raised funds to establish a planting company to cultivate the wasteland in the village, and the harvest was very abundant. Recently, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's office in Shanghai specially sent Commissioner Zhang Yuan and others to inspect the village and conduct overseas Chinese registration there. More than 200 people registered. Commissioner Zhang and others returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to reports, the order in the village has been restored. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, foreign exchange has been suspended, and the village's economic sources have been greatly affected. Now the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's office in Shanghai will lease 20 wastelands in the village to the overseas Chinese merchants Guangzhong Company to engage in fish farming to increase production.

### On the Timeliness of Winter Relief

— Tang Xiongfeng

The vagrant group who are unable to solve their own food, clothing, and shelter, every winter, public and private charitable organizations and benevolent people hold winter relief for them, to help them through the "hunger and cold" crisis. This was the case last year, and this is the case this year. Even since the incident, it has never been interrupted. Especially in years of social upheaval and turmoil, it is even more worthy of praise and congratulations for the wandering refugees. However, this year's winter relief work seems to be not only deserted but also somewhat slow, and even has the regret of "digging a well when thirsty!" For example, the Shanghai Municipal 31st Year Winter Relief Fundraising Committee is undoubtedly a main force for this winter's "winter relief," but at present, the candidates for the committee members have just been determined and are yet to be established. Also, the temporary cold shelters established by the Shanghai Westside Poor Relief Association have only just been completed, and the other two or three shelters that are planned are still in the process of searching for open space. But in terms of seasons, it is only one month away from "Beginning of Spring," and the current temperature records have dropped below 50 degrees Fahrenheit several times. The roads have been iced over, and it should be entering the "severe winter" stage. But the crowds of people who are starving and unable to cover their bodies and who are homeless were already beginning to experience "hunger and cold" under the first wave of cold air when people were taking off their "autumn coats," and they were beginning to collapse from the cold and hunger!

This fact can be seen in the collection reports of the Pushan Villa; in the first "cold spell" of every winter, the number of corpses on the road suddenly increases! Therefore, the fact tells us that the feeling of cold for the average person, especially for benevolent people, has a "temporal" difference from the perception of the suffering vagrant group. In the different environmental encounters with each other, the "winter relief" of previous years has often created a record of "arriving late and leaving early!"

Now that the 31st year winter relief work is just beginning, we hope that it will be carried out quickly so that it will not be delayed too much, considering the "temporal" nature of "winter." At the same time, we hope that it can be advanced in the 32nd year to achieve the perfect effect of being "timely" and "effective." We hope that benevolent people from all walks of life can show compassion for the suffering group at the turn of autumn and winter "when the atmosphere has cooled but is not yet cold," and generously donate to relieve their suffering.

### Public Basketball Yesterday: Three Games, Red Team Strives to Defeat Hua Lian, Xing Ren Defeats Tong Ren, Lian Xing Loses to Ice Team

The Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament, three games in Group A last night, fought at the China Youth Gymnasium. In the first game, Xing Ren played against Tong Ren. The former's strength was exceptionally strong, and the team's cooperation was particularly tacit. Therefore, they led the way throughout the game. As a result, they defeated Tong Ren with a score of 37 to 27. Next, Lian Xing and the Ice Team took the stage. Lian Xing originally had the ambition to win the championship. Unfortunately, they had already lost to Xing Ren last week. The absence of Nei Xi's players Tao Bolin, Ji Qiang, and Du Lai was again poisoned by Monocle, and their morale was suddenly挫折. Therefore, in yesterday's battle with the Ice Team, they were at a disadvantage with a score of 21 to 22 in the first half. After switching sides, relying on the efforts of Chen Xuechong, Kong Guangyi, and others, they finally reversed the defeat with a score of 38 to 31. In the last game, the Red Team played against Hua Lian. It was originally thought that the former would win steadily.

### Chinese Stocks Still Enveloped by Selling Pressure, Slightly Stabilized at Noon

Yesterday's Chinese stock market saw a sharp drop first, then suddenly stabilized at noon. It was still enveloped by sellers seeking cash. Although there were new and old investors active seeing the low prices, they had no competitive spirit and all had the thought of absorbing at low prices. The textile industry saw the most significant first drop and then rise, probably because there was a rumor of rising yarn prices that led to the increase. Wing On Textile Factory retreated to 345 yuan, then rebounded to 365 yuan, breaking even. Dasheng No. 1 Factory reached around 390 yuan, and No. 2 Factory reached 375 yuan. Small-denomination stocks also turned stable from being flat and weak. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water and Electricity was as low as 59 yuan, then 60 yuan, a small 5 jiao. China Merchants Electric retreated from 42 yuan to 39.5 yuan, and then rebounded to 40 yuan, a small 1 yuan. The cultural industry also saw weakness. China Merchants was as low as 440 yuan, a small 5 yuan. China retreated to 160 yuan and then rebounded, a small 7.5 yuan. The World was 105 yuan, down 1 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Sinya fell another small half yuan to 25.5 yuan. Minyi fell to 62 or 63 yuan, even lower than the premium price. Sino-French New Shares fell from 27 yuan to 25.75 yuan, then rose by 1 yuan at noon, still a small 7 jiao higher. Wuzhou traded at 695 yuan, Zhongxi at 440 yuan, and Xinyi around 260 yuan. Sinya Enzyme traded at 22.5 yuan and 2 yuan. In the department store industry, the China Products Company fell to 75 or 76 yuan, New World fell to 135 yuan, and Wing On to 126 or 127 yuan, all in a slump. Great China Matches traded at 355 yuan, a small 12.5 yuan higher. Nanyang Tobacco fell from 125 yuan to 22 yuan, a small 3.5 yuan lower. Most other stocks saw declines, and transactions were scarce. The list is as follows:

### Government Bonds Increasingly Unsustainable, Market Prices Have No Standard

Government bond market prices became increasingly unsustainable yesterday. Although it is the beginning of the year, the money market is still very tight due to the proximity of the Lunar New Year. Those holding goods need cash and have to sell their goods for money, so market prices are getting lower and lower. In themselves, they have nothing to do with income and expenditure, but are forced by the environment and the times. Yesterday, Type A traded around 1 yuan, Type B for 0.8 to 1 yuan, Type C had a high price of 2.6 yuan and a low price of 1.8 yuan, eventually settling at 2 yuan, Type D was about 0.2 or 0.3 yuan, and Type E was only 0.5 yuan. Although the prices were uniform, there were very few transactions, and most people were unwilling to do this business, so the market became narrower and narrower.

### Gold Ornaments Rise Slowly in the Domestic Market

Yesterday, the gold jewelry market price in the city's silver and jewelry stores remained unchanged at 3,050 yuan per tael (the purchase price was reduced by 200 yuan). The inter-dealer price fluctuated and then slowly rose. In the morning, it was 2,900 yuan, up 30 yuan. It once fell back to 2,875 yuan, but soon buying interest rose again, and at noon it had risen to 2,955 yuan, an increase of 85 yuan compared to the previous day. There was usually a difference of 80 yuan, and transactions were scarce. The price was still rising later in the day, and there were few sellers. The price of silver for jewelry remained at 16 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price had risen to around 17 yuan.

The interest rate for interbank lending at the Money Dealers' Association remained unchanged at 1 jiao 7 fen.

### Military Tickets Still Flat, Allied Currency Lower

Yesterday, the military ticket was flat. The inter-dealer exchange rate was between 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen and 5 fen 2 li. The buying and selling price at small money shops and silver houses was 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen half and 4 fen half. The buying and selling price of the Allied currency was 3 yuan 8 jiao and 7 jiao half, slightly lower by 5 fen, it is said.

### Last Year's Total Number of Foreign Bank Checks Exchanged

The total amount of checks exchanged by 15 foreign banks in this city in 1942 is as follows:

(1) Military Tickets (Unit: Thousands of Yuan)

January: 185,684, February: 180,615, March: 323,671, April: 241,521, May: 248,377, June: 238,636, July: 266,982, August: 240,209, September: 255,159, October: 314,722, November: 322,256, December: 252,741 (from the 1st to the 29th).

### Cotton Cloth Transactions Remain Scarce

This morning, there were continued transactions in cotton cloth factory orders, but transactions remained scarce, and the market situation remained firm. The transaction prices for both coarse and fine cloths in department stores have risen by nearly 10 yuan each. The red order for Sijunzi cloth rose from 8 yuan 4 jiao 6 fen to 8 yuan 6 jiao 6 fen, an increase of 3 jiao 3 fen. Colored goods showed a state of having a price but no market. Taohua Nushilin was quoted at 342 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Rosin Slightly Falls

About 300 pieces of miscellaneous rosin have arrived this time. Because the outflow has been relatively stagnant recently, the supply seems to be greater than the demand. Therefore, the market price is difficult to rise. Yesterday, several dozen boxes were opened in the North and South Market. The goods were average, which caused the quoted price to fall by another 20 to 30 yuan. Calculated according to the production price, it is still losing money.

### Ji Kuizi is Scarce and Prices are High

Although there are few Ji Kuizi goods arriving, the sales have been very weak recently, so it is extremely difficult to increase the quoted price. Yesterday, there were dozens of packages of goods, the particles were still large, but the meat content was relatively poor. The counteroffer was still close to the spectrum, with a difference of 20 codes, and it was about to be成交, it is said.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Market Trend Turns Sluggish

Yesterday's miscellaneous grain transactions started lively but then turned stagnant. The market price started high and then became mediocre. It is estimated that 30 packages of Chongming beach yellow were opened, priced at 334 yuan. Another 10 packages of beach red were priced at 340 yuan. 500 Zhang Ji bean cakes were priced at 92 yuan half. Two cars of Yuanlong bean cakes were priced at 93 yuan to 93 yuan half. Three cars of Fei Zi bean cakes were priced at 94 yuan to 93 yuan half.

### Foreign Coins and Flat Iron

Sales are Scattered

New foreign coins and flat iron have already been in short supply, but due to the price limit, they are difficult to be too high. However, those holding the goods are unwilling to sell. Yesterday, first-class goods were sold at 11,000 yuan per ton, and new foreign coins and flat iron were sold at 13,000 yuan per ton, and there are worries about not being able to buy goods. New angle iron was quoted at 16,000 yuan, and first-class angle iron was priced at 11,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan per ton (the colors are added appropriately).

### Soap and Candles Are Scarce and Prices Rise Frequently

Daily necessities such as soap and candles have been rising in price continuously. Because the stock is becoming more and more depleted, there are very few sellers, and the market trend is becoming more prosperous. Matches are still relatively stable. It is estimated that the Phoenix brand is still quoted at 3,000 yuan, the Beautiful brand at 3,150 yuan, the Golden Ding brand at 2,800 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2,100 yuan. The cost of fixed soap is 5,45 yuan, Baixiangmao is 500 yuan, scissor soap is 525 yuan, and Huangxiangmao soap is 435 yuan, which is one to two yuan more expensive than last year. The price of Burberry's candles is 510 yuan, monk hat brand is 450 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 340 yuan.

### The "Death" Heavier Than Mount Tai

— Peng Liu

The Creator seems to arrange the life process of all living things with a playful attitude: birth, aging, illness, and death. All living things cannot escape this process. Even mankind, the spirit of all things, cannot avoid death. Therefore, "death" has become the only final destination for all mankind and even the entire biological world. Because of this, "death" is the most ordinary yet most mysterious event in life.

We all know that most deaths are due to illness. Besides, we sometimes hear people say that a certain old man passed away without any illness. So generally speaking, there are only two reasons for death: death due to illness is illness-related death, and death without illness in old age can be called death from old age.

Speaking of the changes in the physiological mechanisms of these two types of death, we must first explore some physiological conditions. The death of the body is first caused by the individual death of a certain important organ in the body. There are many organs in the body, among which the most important and dominant are the heart and nerves. All organs in the body rely on the heart to transport nutrients and remove waste, and are also managed by the nerves to produce various physiological functions. When the heart dies and stops working, the body's blood circulation also stops. As a result, the cells in all parts of the body gradually die due to lack of nutrients, and the organs also die as a result. When the nerves die, the heart and other organs lose their control and die one by one. Speaking of the death of the heart and nerves themselves: when the heart is dying, its lower part slows down first, while the upper part remains normal. Then the lower part becomes completely static, while the movement of the upper part gradually decreases. Then the left half of the upper part gradually stops, while the right half can still beat. Finally, the right half also becomes static, and the entire heart becomes still. Before the death of a nerve, its function must be higher than usual (the so-called 'glow of vitality' before death is also the case), but after a moment, it quickly decreases until it completely disappears. Among all the nervous systems, the brain dies first and fastest, and its function disappears in an instant, followed by the spinal cord, and finally the peripheral nerves, and the further away from the brain, the slower its function disappears.

Returning to the above two causes of death, death from illness is mostly due to the death of the heart first, which then causes the death of other organs, while death from old age is mostly due to the death of the brain first. The death of the heart in death from illness is either due to external damage (such as bacterial toxins in infectious diseases) or due to toxins produced in the body due to pathological changes, which cause the heart to be poisoned and die. As for death from old age, it is because the brain is the most easily aging tissue, and it eventually dies after a lifetime of hard work.

In summary, it can be seen that everyone can die from illness. If one can always stay healthy and not get sick, one will eventually die from old age. Sooner or later, death is inevitable. Furthermore, for our own sake, we should maintain health and not get sick. We would rather let the body die naturally from old age than be invaded by "toxins" into the heart and "die from the heart." Furthermore, life and death are a universal principle throughout the ages. If we want to live, we must prepare for death, and we must not die lighter than a feather, but die heavier than Mount Tai. This is the "death" that makes mankind superior to other creatures, and this is the death that is extraordinary and not mysterious.

### Huxley on the Question of Human Immortality — One of the Letters of World-Renowned Scientists

— Translated by Lincoln Schuster, written by Gu Xin

Life will not exist without some conformity of the individual to the surrounding universe—that conformity involving a certain quantity of happiness over pain. Simply said, we live, we get the price of living.

When we fail to see the obvious discrepancy between human activities and their rewards, we must remember that nature is fairer than we are. She records what a person brings to the world, which human fairness cannot do. If I am born a brutal thug, inheriting all kinds of evil traits from others, and kill you, my fellow human being, of course my fellow human beings will fairly hang me, but I will be spared that terrible regret. If my nature is higher, and I do the same thing, regret will certainly be my true punishment.

The absolute fairness of the system of things seems to me as clear as any scientific fact. The attraction of sin to sorrow is as certain as the attraction of the earth to the sun, and even more certain, because the factual proof is accessible to all of us—no, as long as we have eyes to see, it is clearly placed before our eyes.

Therefore, I not only believe in rewarding behavior, but I also believe that seeking rewards and punishments after death will cause people to completely ignore the fact that their inevitable rewards and punishments are in this world.

If anticipating hell in the afterlife would make me do bad things, then, of course, the certainty of hell in this world would even more make me not do bad things. If a person can certainly have an impression, believing that being a thief will harm himself, just like swallowing arsenic (which is indeed the case), then isn't the power of this belief to dissuade wrongdoing greater than the power based on rewards in the afterlife?

I am not an optimist for the first teaching, but I have the most solid belief that the divine government (assuming we use such a name to represent the totality of 'physical habits') is perfectly fair. The more I know about other people's lives (not to mention my own), the more I understand that the wicked will not prosper and the good will not be punished. However, for the sake of clarity, we must remember in our hearts those things that have been almost completely forgotten, that is, the rewards of life, as long as they comply with all the laws—physical and moral—will be obtained from time to time, but moral compliance cannot redeem physical sins, and vice versa.

The Supreme God's general ledger is strictly recorded, and everything that everyone does is settled clearly at the end of every minute of his existence.

This reminds me of another point.

That day, I stood behind my young son's coffin, and there was no anxiety in my heart. The pastor, according to his duties, read these words: 'If the dead do not rise, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.' I cannot tell you how indescribably these words shocked me. Paul had neither a wife nor children, otherwise he would have known that his words simply desecrated everything that is best and noblest in human nature. I could laugh scornfully. What! Because I personally encountered irreparable losses, because I have returned the cause of great happiness to the source from which it came, and still maintain in my life the various blessings that sprang or will spring from that cause, should I look down on my humanity, roar, and degenerate to beastliness? Ah, even apes know much more. If you shoot their young, they will also wail and cry, and will not immediately hide in the canyon.

### Teacher of All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin

(1)

A great joke, a joke that has been told for a long time—but also a somewhat sad joke. Chips sat by the fireplace, the autumn storm shaking the windows. Waves of laughter and sorrow swept over him from time to time, until his tears fell. Therefore, when Mrs. Wickett brought in the tea, she simply did not know whether he had been laughing or crying there. I am afraid Chips himself could not understand it either.

(2)

Brookfield was across the road, behind a row of old elm trees, covered with vines and the like, turning reddish in the autumn light. A group of nineteenth-century houses, concentrated around a square courtyard, in addition to many acres of sports fields; further on was the small village established on this basis, and the open swampy countryside. As Wetherby said, Brookfield was an old foundation, a small school established in the Elizabethan era. If it had been luckier, it might have been as famous as Harrow. However, it was not so lucky. It went through twists and turns, at one time almost disappeared, and at another time almost shone brightly and could compete with other schools. It was in these later, constantly fluctuating periods that the main building was renovated and a large number of additions were made, during the reign of the first King George. Later, after the Napoleonic Wars, until the mid-Victorian era, it declined again in terms of numbers and reputation. Wetherby came in 1840, and he finally restored some of its fortunes; however, it has never been raised to the first rank since then. But it is still a good school of the second rank. Several prominent families supported it; it produced the great figures who made history in the contemporary era—judges, parliamentarians, colonial administrators, and a few nobles and bishops. However, it produced the most merchants, manufacturers, and professional talents, and not a few squires and parish priests. Some schools, when people mention their names, general exaggerators will say that they seem to have heard of this school, to show their broad knowledge. Brookfield is somewhat like such a school.

But if it were not such a school, it might not have hired Chips. Because Chips, in any social or academic sense, was just like Brookfield, slightly famous but not very reputable. (Four)
