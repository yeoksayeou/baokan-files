### Why We Insist on Requesting the Government to Thoroughly Implement its Policies

Why do we insist on requesting the government to thoroughly investigate speculation and hoarding? Here are a few simple reasons: (1) At the risk of repetition, it is worth reiterating the National Government's order of April 7th: "It has been found that large-scale speculation and hoarding of important materials have recently occurred in Shanghai, which is detrimental to society and disrupts the market, which is extremely hateful. ... Investigate impartially and thoroughly. If any senior officials of financial institutions are engaged in speculative trading, if they are government-run, suspend their operations and reorganize them immediately. If they are privately run, they shall be closed down. Anyone engaged in speculative trading, manipulating market prices, and disrupting the market shall be reported to the National Defense Conference for special punishment after verification, regardless of who they are, and the seized materials shall be confiscated to deter the wicked." Also, the National Government's order of April 13th: "... It has been verified that Han Gongbei, through the unregistered Zhenhua Company, has purchased a large amount of important materials, disrupting the market. He is to be immediately detained and sent to the court for severe punishment. Futong Bank is suspected of serious involvement and is to be ordered to suspend operations by the Ministry of Finance and send personnel to investigate thoroughly... Other matters that have not yet been thoroughly investigated are to be continued by the responsible departments..." These two National Government orders were issued within six days of each other. First, we must ask: Is it possible that within this short period of six days, "all financial institutions" (including government-run and privately-run) have been thoroughly investigated, as stipulated in the National Government's order? Secondly, we must ask: Are the only two business firms that have been found to have violated the order the two mentioned in the National Government's order, and are there no government-run financial institutions engaged in hoarding?

We are not quoting out of context or misinterpreting the orders; nor are we quibbling with the government over the wording. We sincerely love the government and, even more so, the government's wise measures to stabilize people's livelihoods. Unless the government adopts a laissez-faire attitude, if the government has already decided to ban hoarding and issued an order, then it must absolutely implement the order's provisions and maintain the dignity of the order. Otherwise, speculators will despise the law even more and spread their poisonous flames further. The majority of the people will suffer more and more, and their faith in the government will decrease. The key to this cannot but be closely watched by the government authorities.

(2) Shanghai's large-scale speculators should bear most of the blame for the current severity of the price problem. It is rumored that the funds and profits used by the banks found to have violated the order this time actually exceed the original capital by dozens of times. How can this be achieved? It can be said that "Sima Zhao's heart is known to all." This kind of artificial high price oppression, which enriches a few and impoverishes the majority, makes people dare to be angry but not to speak out, and they have no power to punish these so-called upper-class elements. Now that the government has resolutely ordered a thorough investigation, the people are overjoyed, like sweet rain in a severe drought. How can they not be moved and insist that the government thoroughly investigate to relieve the people's suffering? Therefore, for the sake of the people's livelihood, we must ask the government authorities to pay close attention.

(3) The new transformation of Japan's policy towards China is, needless to say, to assist the National Government in strengthening its political position in order to fulfill its role in the Greater East Asia War. The Continental Daily News, which represents Japanese public opinion in China, has repeatedly offered sincere advice since the National Government issued the order to investigate the hoarding case. In its editorial on April 15, titled "Expectations for the Courage of the National Government," it stated: "Japan's transformation of its policy towards China seeks to create a central government of the National Government that has a real substance and can independently maintain domestic security. The economic chaos caused by speculation today is a heinous crime, no less than the disturbance of local areas by bandits. If the National Government has started a thorough investigation but abandons it halfway, this will not only greatly disappoint the people but also greatly disappoint Japan, which has spared no effort to assist the National Government in strengthening itself. In this sense, the task of thoroughly investigating speculation is not only a domestic problem in China but also a moral responsibility that the National Government should bear to Japan." Therefore, if the National Government's investigation is not thorough and it talks loudly about cooperating with Japan in the war, it seems that it will not be trusted by Japan. For the sake of genuine cooperation between China and Japan in the war, to show a revitalized spirit, we must ask the government authorities to pay close attention.

Our journalistic circles are purely standing on the people's side in this investigation and are speaking out the bones stuck in our throats. At the same time, we have received a stream of letters from readers, some with激昂 words and scathing attacks, and some who are deeply versed in the world and are more certain that there will be no results, but still hold a glimmer of hope. We believe that although the views of the protectors differ, they all express sympathy. We accept the鞭策 and should fulfill our journalistic responsibility. Therefore, we do not mind seeking details and repeatedly explain our views. Our ultimate goal is to support the government's policies, alleviate the people's suffering, increase the people's faith in the government, strengthen the government's position, and work together to win victory and complete the task of national construction. With this goal in mind, we expect it of ourselves and of others, and we do not care whether we are guilty or at fault.

### The Current State of Rebirth in South China: Guangzhou Transforms from a Commercial City to a Production City

South China, heavily reliant on external sources due to its limited resources, inevitably faced challenges in its industries. With the progression of the Greater East Asia War, a rapid transformation in its character became necessary. Especially with China's entry into the war, this need intensified. Changing South China's economy and establishing a self-sufficient system was not only requested, but fervently demanded. Furthermore, contributing to Japan, establishing a cooperative system, and realizing thorough Sino-Japanese cooperation, to make South China a part of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and fulfill a significant mission was intensely desired. The so-called South China peace area refers to Guangzhou and its surrounding areas, Xiamen, Shantou, the Leizhou Peninsula, Hainan Island, and other scattered regions. Apart from Hainan Island, all other areas are small regions without hinterlands, reflecting the current situation where significant economic activity cannot be expected.

Guangzhou Region

Guangzhou was originally the oldest trading port in all of China, with a history spanning hundreds of years, even disregarding its interactions with the Roman Empire. After the Opium War, especially after Britain seized Hong Kong, Guangzhou lost its significance as the only foreign trade port in South China. It transformed into a mere distribution center for goods in the Pearl River basin, existing as a so-called comprador commercial city or consumer city, essentially becoming a political or military stronghold.

Since the Japanese army entered the city, four and a half years ago, the exchange of goods between urban and agricultural areas has been revived, restoring its original appearance as a commercial city and its former prosperity. The liveliness of Xiguan Hua Street, the bustling Changdi Wharf, and the swarms of sampans gathered on the Pearl River accurately demonstrate the restoration of Guangzhou's old appearance.

However, now, the phrase "transforming from a commercial city to a production city" has become Guangzhou's wartime slogan. Therefore, securing food and reviving factories have become urgent priorities, and countermeasures are gradually progressing. The provincial government has established an economic revival plan. The first step is to increase arable land, making full use of vacant land, reclaiming wasteland, and constructing dikes for paddy fields, all with utmost effort. At the same time, it is incorporating Japanese agricultural technology to accelerate rice production. Planting has already begun in recent days, with considerable increase in the first phase expected.

In terms of industry, it is currently somewhat sluggish. Before the Incident, the provincial government had established the Guangdong Province Construction Three-Year Plan and the Guangdong Province Industry Five-Year Plan, etc. Some of which had been realized, including several provincial-run factories, which were later suspended due to the Incident or became sacrifices of the scorched-earth policy. After the Japanese army entered the city, these factories became military-managed factories, reviving one after another. Furthermore, these military-managed factories had already been completely returned to the Chinese side in October of Showa 15 (Republic of China Year 29), and are now embarking on the first step towards an economic cooperation with Japan, which is particularly noteworthy.

Specifically, the provincial-run spinning factory in Henan has resumed operations on the first of this month after completing machinery adjustments. The sugar factory in Shunde County, managed by Yufeng Company, is also stepping up production. Other local products, such as paper, are also being continuously shipped to Hainan Island and Shantou.

Next, regarding the exchange of goods. Guangzhou is, of course, the center of material exchange along the South China coast. Now, it has become a base for the exchange of goods to distant southern regions, so its brilliant future can be foreseen. Currently, the transfer and entry of goods is generally carried out by the Guangdong Materials Transportation In-and-Out Distribution Association Federation, implementing unified control. The main exports are Chinese medicine, herbal products, and local paper. The main destinations are Shanghai (40%), Hong Kong (20%), various southern regions (20%), North China, Manchuria, and Japan (20%). In particular, the relationship with Hong Kong is the closest. At the fourth settlement and transaction meeting held in Guangzhou on the 22nd of last month, it was agreed that Guangdong would ship goods worth one million Japanese yen to Hong Kong each month, mainly agricultural products (vegetables, fresh fruits, firewood, charcoal, and fresh fish). In return, Hong Kong would ship surplus goods worth approximately 500,000 Japanese yen each month (textiles, industrial chemicals, machinery, etc.) as trade. Furthermore, material exchange agreements have also been concluded with Zhaonan Island and the Philippine Islands, showing considerable success in material exchange.

In the financial sector, the issuance of new military scrip has been abolished since the first of this month. Deposits, loans, and remittances at banks are all conducted using savings bonds, not to mention even the salaries of Japanese soldiers are now paid in reserve certificates. The exchange rate between military scrip and reserve certificates has been declared to remain absolutely unchanged in the future, and the reserve certificates have reached a stable position, with no fluctuations or changes whatsoever. Therefore, the financial sector has smoothly entered a state of complete reserve certificate dominance.

In terms of prices, due to the interdependent relationship with Shanghai, they are greatly affected by Shanghai's prices. The shipping capacity, which has a huge impact on material exports, also has a significant impact on prices. Recently, with the reduction in inventory, there is an inevitable upward trend. Japanese and Chinese authorities have established measures to stabilize prices from all sectors, striving for adjustments. A rationing system has been implemented for rice and other necessities.

Finally, it is important to pay attention to the character and thoughts of the Cantonese people. Cantonese people have always been strong in self-esteem, exclusive, and have rapidly absorbed European and American ideas, becoming pioneers of new thought movements. Especially making Guangdong the birthplace of revolution. On the other hand, they are also strong in gratitude, with a spirit of thoroughly executing what they believe in. Now, the five million people of South China, especially the youth, under the banner of national liberation, have deeply understood the true meaning of Sino-Japanese co-existence and co-prosperity, and are marching together towards the complete destruction of Britain and the United States. Their pure spirit and firm belief are powerful driving forces for the new China, with a significant impact on the future of the new China. At the same time, their thoughts and practices also pose a considerable threat to the Chongqing side, which is currently the enemy. The chairman's previous visit to Guangdong placed great expectations on the activism of the Guangdong youth, and placed particularly high hopes on the training of the youth cadre school that will soon be established.

Chaoshan Region

The population of this region is now estimated to be over 1.1 million. These residents are distributed in densely populated cities such as Shantou, Chaozhou, Chaoyang, Chenghai, and Anbu, as well as the fertile Chaoshan Plain. Shantou is the gateway to the Chaoshan Plain, possessing a rich hinterland. Its ability to transform from a poor village into an import port in just eighty years, developing from a sixth-class export port to an eighth-class port in the pre-war era, is due to its origin as the hometown of overseas Chinese in Nanyang, especially the 2.5 million overseas Chinese in Thailand, and the development of drawn-thread work, known as "Shantou Lace."

Before the Japanese army landed in Shantou in the 28th year of the Republic of China, it replaced Guangzhou as the throat of the aid-Chiang route, playing a significant role. After the Japanese army landed, it relied on trade, the export of drawn-thread products with an annual production value of 20 million yuan, and overseas Chinese remittances with an annual value of 50 to 60 million or even 100 million yuan, boasting itself as the most peaceful and prosperous place in South China.

However, with the start of the Greater East Asia War, the shortage of ships naturally became the reason for the decline in its trade. The drawn-thread embroidery, which had always boasted of its production value, also shrank due to the blockade of foreign trade. At the beginning of this year, with the National Government's participation in the war as an opportunity, it finally had to break away from its traditional dependent economic state and fundamentally shift towards establishing a self-sufficient system. The first step was to secure food, reorganize orchards, reclaim wasteland, and focus on the cultivation of rice and other agricultural products needed for military supplies. Furthermore, various considerations are being made for the Chaoyang salt area, one of the largest salt-producing areas in South China, including the formulation of production increase plans. However, given the current situation, new enterprises that require huge amounts of capital and materials are impossible. Therefore, the main focus is concentrated on specialized industries. However, those that can be carried out with local materials or with one-time investments are being actively developed. As for trade, on December 20th of last year, a joint Sino-Japanese Materials Transfer In-and-Out Distribution Association Federation was organized to transport local products such as hemp, oranges, and seafood (mainly fish) to Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Taiwan, and to import groceries, rice, sugar, etc., from these places. On the one hand, attention is also being paid to the use of sailing ships for transportation to compensate for the shortage of ships. Recently, there has been a proposal to organize a sailing ship association. On the day of its realization, coastal trade will undoubtedly be promoted, and the exchange of goods in the Han River basin will also be greatly promoted.

Furthermore, the issuance of new banknotes for military scrip in the area was stopped on April 1st. However, the circulation of military scrip in the region was originally very small, so there was almost no impact. Therefore, reserve certificates can achieve complete dominance in the short term. As for prices, because of the great dependence on Shanghai, they are naturally under its influence. Now, with the reduction in inventory, there is an inevitable upward trend.

There are approximately three thousand Japanese residents in the area, and their relationship with the Chinese is quite harmonious, with good cooperation in all aspects. In particular, the huge investment of 300,000 Japanese yen was successfully completed last summer. At the time of the establishment of the Shantou Shrine after holding a memorial service, Mayor Xu Shaorong took the lead in performing manual labor to demonstrate a model of Sino-Japanese cooperation, which greatly impressed all parties. Furthermore, the peace propaganda work in the enemy area has also had good results. At the Sino-Japanese middle school exchange meeting held in Shantou last time, several students from Jieyang in the enemy area risked danger to participate. This fact is proof that the area is a peaceful village and is admired by the residents of the enemy area. (Ding: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 11)

### Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Bombing Results at Milne Bay, Heavy Losses for Enemy Ships and Aircraft, Three U.S. Air Force Generals Recently Killed in Action

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency)

The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 16th that the Imperial Naval Air Force discovered an enemy transport convoy arriving at Milne Bay on New Guinea Island on April 14th. A large-scale attack was immediately launched. Another naval air force unit raided the Lae airfield, achieving the following results: Four enemy transport ships sunk, seven others bombed and set ablaze, sinking. Several enemy small warships destroyed. Forty-four enemy aircraft shot down, more than ten enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground, five military facilities destroyed. Five of our aircraft were self-exploded in the operation.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) The detailed circumstances of the battle in which the Japanese naval air force attacked Milne Bay this time are as follows, according to reports. The air battles between the Japanese and American air forces in the South Pacific region around New Guinea have already become increasingly fierce. The Japanese naval air force bombed Oro Bay on the 12th, and then launched another large-scale attack with a sky-covering fleet of aircraft on the 14th morning on Milne Bay, the enemy's supply base at the eastern end of New Guinea. The Japanese aircraft first discovered an enemy convoy full of soldiers, weapons, and materials, trying to enter Milne Bay. After receiving the report, the Japanese aircraft fleet launched a siege. As bombs fell everywhere, two enemy ships were hit and caught fire, and another was grounded on the coast by the blast. At that time, the Japanese aircraft continued to bomb heavily, braving the fierce defensive fire of the enemy convoy, and sank another four enemy ships, including one large transport ship and one medium-sized ship. Another seven enemy ships, including two large transport ships, four medium-sized ships, and one small ship, were also hit one after another and sank after catching fire. Several other small enemy warships in the bay were also sunk. At the same time, the Japanese aircraft attacked the enemy airfield at Lae. At that time, enemy fighters (P38 type), (P39 type), (P40 type), etc., also took off to fight back, and a duel was immediately launched. As a result, forty-four enemy aircraft were also hit and destroyed. Other military facilities, such as airfields and fuel depots, were also set on fire, with fierce flames soaring into the sky. Five Japanese aircraft also self-exploded in the operation, which was much lighter than the enemy's damage. From this, it is sufficient to show the difference in the excellent aviation technology of the Japanese army and the enemy army, and the spirit of bravery and fighting of the Japanese aircraft combatants.

Buenos Aires, 16th (Central News Agency) The U.S. Air Force in the Southwest Pacific has been fighting with the Japanese Air Force for days, in addition to losing a large number of aircraft, the loss of personnel is also very heavy, including three generals. According to the April 12th issue of the American magazine "America", Brigadier General George of the U.S. Army Air Force died in Darwin Harbor last year. He was followed by Brigadier General Walker, commander of the Fifth Air Force, who died in January of this year while bombing Rabaul. After Walker's death, General Kenney, commander of the anti-Axis air force, urgently summoned Brigadier General Ramey from Hawaii to succeed him, but he died in office only a few weeks later.

The posture of completing the Greater East Asia War is also unfolding steadily in a strong manner. Therefore, Minister Aoki's trip to various southern regions has great significance.

### Greater East Asia Medical Association Held in Tokyo

### Italian Premier Declares Sicily and Sardinia as War Zones, Local Battles in Tunisia

Rome, 16th (Central News Agency) Italian Premier and Supreme Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Mussolini announced that Sicily, Sardinia, and nearby small islands in the Mediterranean would be designated as war zones from April 15th.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) The German Supreme Headquarters announced today: (1) There were local battles in various parts of the Tunisian front. The anti-Axis forces launched an offensive in the eastern mountainous area, which was repelled by the Axis forces, and many were captured. (2) German bombers attacked the port of Bône on the night of the 15th, severely damaging one enemy warship and one enemy ship, and dropped many heavy bombs on the port's docks and warehouses.

Rome, 16th (Central News Agency) The Italian Military Headquarters announced today: The Axis forces on the Tunisian front have withdrawn from Sousa, 120 kilometers south of Tunis.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) According to the military correspondent of the Domei News Agency, although most of General Montgomery's infantry has arrived, the British Eighth Army has not yet launched a large-scale attack on the new German and Italian positions northeast of the hills on the Tunisian coast. Therefore, the British commander may have decided to postpone the final act of his offensive to wait for the completion of certain preparations, such as concentrating his artillery, setting up huge ammunition depots, and improving his rear transportation lines. However, there was some fighting in the area west of the Gulf of Hammamet on Wednesday. The British army made an armed reconnaissance attack, but was repelled in the southern border of the hilly area with many casualties. The British army repeatedly tried to occupy the town of Enfidaville in order to provide a favorable base for a large-scale offensive in the future, but has not yet succeeded. In the new Axis positions in the mountains southeast of Bou Arada, the French rebels of Giraud attacked, but were severely defeated and repelled to their original positions by a fierce German counterattack. The British localized attacks in the Méjez el-Bab region completely failed. The high ground overlooking the north and northwest of the town is in the hands of the German mountain combat troops. According to observations, General Anderson is rushing to reinforce a large number of artillery, and is being very careful about the use of tanks due to the difficulty of the terrain. There has been no major change in the situation in the coastal area south of Serrat Djanen. Although the anti-Axis forces have made slight progress in a certain river basin in the area, it is of no importance, because the surrounding mountains are still in the hands of the German army. Recently, the U.S. military has not appeared in large numbers on the front line. Whether the U.S. Fifth Army will continue to be a unit or whether special troops will be merged into the two British armies is still in doubt. This force includes at least four infantry divisions and one or two tank divisions, which is enough to show that the enemy, already superior in numbers, still has very large reserves to rely on.

### Cape Serrat Area: German Coastal Guards Repulse British Landing Forces

Lisbon, 16th - Central News Agency: The German official news agency claimed last night that the anti-Axis forces that broke into the northern region of Medjez el Bab on Tuesday had driven a wedge into the Axis line. However, German forces under Arnim launched a fierce counterattack on Wednesday, repelling and severely damaging these British and Free French forces, and have now restored the original main battle line. The Axis forces’ attempt to advance was only slightly challenged by the troops under General Montgomery, who used relatively small units. British militia landed in the Cape Serrat area, hoping to attack the German forces from behind, but were repulsed by vigilant German coastal guards. On Wednesday evening, the German guards discovered that the British landing forces were attempting to cross the sea to the rear of the Axis line in the Serrat area. They allowed them to land without interference. After the British forces had reached the unprotected part of the beach, fully equipped and landed, the Germans immediately opened fire with machine guns and mortars. The British forces were panicked and unable to resist, retreating in disarray to their ships. They suffered heavy casualties and left behind many dead and wounded. Although their ships were hit several times, they managed to escape in the darkness. On Wednesday, there were fierce localized clashes in all areas of the Tunisian front. The British no longer deny that they have not yet achieved their objectives. On the contrary, the meeting of Marshal Rommel's forces with those of Arnim is of extreme strategic importance. The cautious advance of British, American, and Free French forces has proven that General Montgomery, General Anderson, and General Patton, as well as their supreme commander General Eisenhower, are fully aware that they are currently only encountering the Axis rearguard. On the southern flank, the vanguard of General Montgomery's British Eighth Army, assisted by mine-clearing teams and reconnaissance units, is exploring and advancing towards the central plains of Tunisia. These reconnaissance units have been counterattacked and repulsed by Axis forces several times, suffering many prisoners and losing a great deal of military supplies. General Montgomery has reinforced his vanguard with tanks, but they are currently avoiding entering the hill areas. In the southwestern section of the thrust line across the Atlas Mountains, British and American forces are using heavy artillery cover in an attempt to attack more advantageous positions in front of the Axis forward line. British reporters reported from the front line yesterday that as pressure on the Axis bridgehead increases, German and Italian resistance is also becoming stronger. After concentrating their forces, the Axis forces have been able to greatly strengthen their resistance. According to the reporter, the progress made by the northern flank of the British First Army in Medjez el Bab yesterday was not significant. General Arnim is fighting bravely, and the anti-Axis forces have only advanced one kilometer towards Mateur. According to British newspapers, the Free French forces under Giraud are currently stationed about 75 kilometers south of Fondouk. The advance of this unit has been blocked by steep mountains 1,300 meters above sea level. Before this unit can continue its attack, the British Air Force must first destroy many well-defended strongholds. The Axis air force has also increased its offensive and defensive activities in the past 24 hours, with German fighter and bomber squadrons appearing in all operational areas of the Tunisian front. According to anti-Axis sources, General Montgomery is still concentrating his artillery in preparation for the next attack. Although his vanguard is constantly in contact with Marshal Rommel's forces, no major decisions can be expected at this time. General Montgomery has learned a lesson from the setbacks suffered by his predecessor in Libya, namely, "do not extend the vanguard too far." According to US Secretary of the Army Stimson at a press conference yesterday, Marshal Rommel's forces still have approximately 175,000 to 200,000 troops in Africa who have long been engaged in combat, and the Axis forces are currently not preparing to withdraw from Tunisia. Anti-Axis reporters say that the anti-Axis forces are only 30 to 40 miles away from Bizerte and Tunis in some locations, and it cannot be said that the war will end next week.

### Axis Air Raids on the American Mainland: Imminent in the Near Future; Japanese Military Affairs Bureau Chief Sato Explains: Difficulties of Distance Have Been Overcome

Tokyo, 16th - Central News Agency: Major General Sato, Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Army Ministry, stated forcefully in a speech on the 14th that the Axis powers would launch a large-scale bombing of the American mainland. He said: The difficulty of air raids on the American mainland is only the problem of the distance of the Pacific Ocean. However, this distance problem has now been completely overcome by Japan. Japan, Germany, and Italy are cooperating with each other, and the date of air raids on the American mainland is not far off. The new German advanced super-heavy bombers are now capable of flying 15,000 kilometers continuously, and this has been completed. Therefore, the United States on the east coast of the Pacific is currently uneasy about this. The American press has been loudly calling for German planes to attack, and even published "Diagrams of German Planes Bombing New York" to warn the public. Their panic and embarrassment have reached the extreme. The German Heinkel 177 new advanced super-heavy bomber can take off from a German base, cross the Atlantic Ocean, and directly attack the American mainland. This is very likely, and American air force experts are all shocked by its power. Japan, during this time of war, has an absolute advantage over the enemy in terms of spirit, technology, and strength in dealing with enemy planes attempting to attack the Japanese mainland. Furthermore, it is actively preparing for air raids on the American mainland, making the United States currently deeply feel the crisis of a pincer attack by the Axis forces from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The imaginary articles published in the American newspapers depict the tragic scene of the German Heinkel 177 new advanced super-heavy bomber attacking New York, turning skyscrapers into ashes. Because Roosevelt has repeatedly called for air raids on the Japanese mainland, the American public has focused their attention on the west coast of the Pacific. The invention of the Heinkel 177 and Junkers 264 long-range bombers is like a bolt from the blue for them. Regarding the performance of the Junkers 264, it was recently heard that it can fly 15,000 kilometers continuously. Other structural performances are still secret. As for the Heinkel 177, it has been showing its power on the European battlefield since October last year, and is a major threat felt by the anti-Axis camp. This aircraft is equipped with four engines, but each has its two engines connected into one group, arranged longitudinally inside the left and right wings. In appearance, it is no different from a twin-engine aircraft. This is a characteristic of this aircraft, and from this, one can also glimpse the path of the latest progress in the German aviation industry. It is heard that its range is the same as that of the Junkers aircraft, reaching 15,000 kilometers. If it takes off from the Brittany Peninsula on the west coast of France to New York, it is only 5,500 kilometers. It is more than enough to use this aircraft to attack New York. American air force experts have attached great importance to the excellent performance of this aircraft since October last year, and have issued opinions to call the public's attention, saying that the possibility of German planes bombing the American mainland is currently approaching realization. The United States fears the power of the Heinkel aircraft so much that it even published "Diagrams of the German Aircraft Bombing the American Imaginary" in the newspapers. Therefore, its terrifying and embarrassing situation is not difficult to imagine. It is said that the general structure of the Heinkel aircraft is very complete, with a width of 32.35 meters, a length of 20.5 meters, a height of 0.4 meters, a wing area of 154 square meters, a maximum load of 35,000 kilograms, a maximum speed of 500 kilometers, and a range of 11,200 kilometers (capable of carrying 500 meters of bombs). The engines are made by Daimler-Benz Company. There are two 610-type engines installed in each of the left and right wings, each with about 3,000 horsepower. Looking at the performance of this aircraft, one can know that the American mainland is bound to be attacked by air. Furthermore, the Japanese Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau Chief Sato's remarks about air raids on the American mainland are now believed to be in the near future.

### London Announces Reorganization of the Mediterranean Air Force Command

Stockholm, Sweden, 16th - Central News Agency: According to London reports, the British Air Ministry announced on the 15th that, in order to unify command of the air forces in the Mediterranean, Africa, the Middle East, and other regions, the anti-Axis forces have decided to establish a Mediterranean Air Force Command, appointing British Air Chief Marshal Tedder as commander.

Lisbon, 16th - Central News Agency: London officially announced last night that the reorganization of the anti-Axis air force in the Mediterranean region has been completed. All air forces in the region are commanded by Air Marshal Tedder, and have now been reorganized into three parts: one in the Middle East, one in northwestern Africa, and one in the Malta region. The commanders of these three parts are all directly responsible to Tedder. The Middle East portion is commanded by Marshal Douglas, including the area from India to Tunisia and Madagascar. In addition to launching attacks, it is also responsible for protecting the anti-Axis shipping in the eastern and central Mediterranean. The northwestern African portion is commanded by Major General Spaatz, including British, American, and Free French forces. The Malta portion is commanded by Vice Marshal Park, responsible for defending Malta and engaging in attacks.

### A Travelogue of the Ancient "Caravan Ships" Between China and Burma: Tracing the Footsteps of Marco Polo

The caravan route from Tengyue in Yunnan Province to Bhamo in Burma, winding along the valley of the Daying River, has been the only transportation route connecting Yunnan to Burma since the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. The Japanese army's 〇〇 unit recently used the area near this route as a base to appease the local chieftains and respond to the troops advancing eastward from northern Burma, in order to eliminate the remnants of the Chongqing army (organized from the remnants of troops defeated in Burma as the Yunnan Western Self-Defense Force) stirring up trouble near Zhanda, Daping Street, and Manyun. They launched an attack on Tengyue, attacking the Daying River Valley, preemptively destroying the enemy's attempt to establish ground contact between Yunnan and Burma, and successfully completed their mission. The reporter, taking the opportunity to accompany this unit, was able to traverse the Yunnan-Burma caravan route that Marco Polo had passed through, now overgrown with moss.

Cultural Cities on the Caravan Route

From Tengyue to Nandian, the width of the Daying River is only 30 meters. The surrounding area is hilly with very few trees, not even shrubs along the riverbank. Looking around, it feels like traveling through a beautiful highland area. However, this route, which has been a transportation route for hundreds of years, is very rough. The entire route goes up and down through the valleys, following the left bank of the Daying River. In the dry season, it meanders on the river sand, and in the rainy season, it winds along the cliffs of the rapids, leaving historical relics everywhere. Near Nandian, the width of the river becomes slightly wider, and in the valley along the river, terraced fields rise and fall continuously, stretching to the distant hills. Crude bamboo bridges are built over the small rivers, reminding one of the flooding during the rainy season. Nandian is a cultural city along this caravan route, located on the south bank of the Daying River, surrounded by bamboo forests, with thriving Han Chinese streets and markets. The Tusi's (chieftain’s) residence is an ancient building and very spectacular. On the opposite bank of Nandian, there is a new road that is said to have been built by the Chongqing government, which ordered the tribes along the route to rush to build it. The nearby farmers have suffered greatly because of this. It is also said that it is expected to be completed in two more years. There are many thatched huts near Nandian, and there are many Dai (Tai) villages on the mountaintops.

Bamboo-roofed markets are set up on both sides of the road. One village even erected a memorial archway decorated with fir leaves spelling out "Welcome Japanese Army". In comparison, the Dai (Tai) seem to be more willing to show goodwill towards the Japanese army than the Han Chinese. The agricultural products brought to the market here include sweet potatoes, ginger, taro, rice, and tropical fruits such as pumpkins and bananas.

Tusi's Residence Hangs Japanese Sword

"Pay attention, doesn't it have a bit of a Burmese flavor?" a soldier said to me. Indeed, once you get here, the Burmese-style scenery feels thicker. On the way to the Tusi's residence in Xincheng, tall pagodas stand tall. From a custom point of view, this area should be the border between Yunnan and Burma. The Tusi's residence in Ganya is very magnificent, with four side gates, and the walls are covered with historical traces. This residence is connected to the yamen (government office). Upon entering the door, one sees the sword, naginata, and spears arrayed, displaying the majesty of the hereditary Ganya Thousand Household Chief. Surprisingly, the storm of the Chinese Revolution has also slowly blown over here. The giant hand of the central government's propaganda has extended here. Pictures, slogans, and leaflets used to popularize national defense knowledge, such as group anti-poisoning and air force operations, are all vividly displayed.

The ancestors of the Ganya Tusi were named centurions in the early Ming Dynasty and, together with other Tusi, came down from Nanjing to take charge of border defense. Later, he was promoted to a thousand-household head, and even received a sword from the emperor, and was appointed as the hereditary Ganya Thousand-Household Chief, which has continued for twenty-eight generations to this day. The current Tusi is called Dao Zheng Yue, who is twenty-eight years old this year, a fair-skinned youth, assisted by Daolisan and other clan members. He just held his wedding about a week ago. It is said that Zheng Yue's grandfather, Dao Anren, went to Japan to study thirty-seven years ago in order to acquire new knowledge. He studied at Japan's Hosei University for two semesters. Therefore, there is still a Japanese sword hanging in the Tusi's residence.

An Old Woman Who Can Speak Japanese

The caravan traveling to and from Yunnan often braves heavy rain, treads on bad roads, leads horses, and travels over mountains and ridges every day. Sometimes there are 300 horses a day, and sometimes there are only two or three horses a day. On average, one person often leads about five horses. The horses from Bhamo to Tengyue carry metals, gold sand, groceries, and daily necessities from Western Europe and other Asian regions. The horses from Yunnan to Burma carry Sichuan silk, cowhide, beans, Tengyue hemp, paper, and other goods to be sold out. These caravans all carry camping equipment. In the dry season, they camp on the sandbars, and in the rainy season, they live under the eaves of people's homes. Also, in the rainy season, the caravans often ride rafts with their horses and float across the river. The caravans living in Hezunxiang and other merchant towns have branches in Shanghai, Hankou, Singapore, and other places. They entrust the goods to transportation merchants, who transport them to Bhamo via the Irrawaddy River, and then from Bhamo to Yunnan for trading. The remains of destroyed suspension bridges and the traces of Marco Polo's passage since the Yuan and Ming Dynasties remain in the mountains, reminding people of the historical events of trade at that time.

What is particularly surprising here is that when you come to this place in Yunnan to stay, you will hear an elegant old woman who can speak Japanese. When we went to visit the residence of Dao San, the Ganya Tusi, a kind old woman was sitting on the stone steps. When she saw us coming, she stood up and said, "Oh, how respectable Japanese gentlemen, I still remember Japanese." This is really a strange thing. It turns out that this old woman followed Tusi Dao Anren's wife to live in Tokyo, Japan, thirty-seven years ago with Tusi Dao Anren. At that time, she was still a young girl from Yunnan. She had a deep impression of Japan when she lived in Tokyo, so she still remembers it piece by piece. She spoke of the past word by word, happily entertaining us.

Pioneers of Japanese Technology

Another surprising thing is that several Japanese men and women came to this Ganya place. Among them were sericulture experts, weaving technicians, doctors, and private soldier instructors of the Tusi. In this remote area of Yunnan, they served as instructors, and their deeds still remain vividly.

They were hired by Dao Anren when he traveled to Japan to instill new civilization into Yunnan. According to the memory of Dao San's family, one of them named Iwamoto was the Tusi's political advisor, one named Oishi was the Tusi's private soldier instructor, and there were also a doctor named Ariyama, two weaving technicians named Fujinuki and Yokota, and a sericulture technician named Otsuki. In addition, there were two women named Suzuki and Hosoda. They all came here thirty years ago and served under the Han Chinese, leaving a deep and unforgettable impression on the people here. After a few years, most of them left. Among the private soldiers who had been trained, there is still a blind man named Mengmao who is still alive. According to him, there are also Japanese tombs here. (Ding: Abridged translation of Asahi Shimbun, April 3)

### Crackdown on Hoarding and Implementation of Price Controls: Authorities Strictly Enforce Measures and Thoroughly Investigate Warehouses and Storage Facilities, Encouraging Citizens to Report Accurately

In light of the soaring and seemingly endless rise in commodity prices in Shanghai, the authorities, in accordance with the law, have taken measures to crack down on such practices. They have also separately and thoroughly investigated goods stored in various firms, as well as private warehouses and storage facilities. At the same time, citizens are encouraged to report suspected cases. It is stipulated that if there is evidence of hoarding, citizens should report it truthfully. Once the facts are verified, in accordance with Article 9 of the "Provisional Regulations for Cracking Down on Commodity Prices," a fine will be imposed, and 20% of the total amount will be awarded as a bonus to the investigator or the person who reported the case. In addition, the following regulations have been stipulated: (1) The prices of goods sold by stores and businesses must be clearly marked and may not be encoded. (2) Stores and businesses must not arbitrarily raise prices or falsely claim that goods are out of stock with the intention of hoarding for profit, nor change the quality of goods or mix inferior goods with the intention of deceiving consumers for profit. (3) If stores and businesses need to change prices due to cost reasons, they may request a price adjustment from the competent authorities through their trade associations. Implementation is permitted only after approval. It is also heard that the relevant authorities have separately notified citizens to assist the local authorities in clearing out hoarders, stabilizing commodity prices, and benefiting the people's livelihood.

Reporting Inventory of Warehouses and Storage Facilities

The Shanghai Municipal Council announces: All public warehouses and storage companies in the International Settlement shall compile detailed lists of all items stored as of the close of business on the 20th of this month, regardless of their nature or type, stating the name, address, and quantity of the owner of each batch of stored goods, as well as the date of storage. At the same time, a separate list should be prepared, detailing all items that have been transported into or out of each warehouse between the 15th and 20th of this month, along with the dates of transfer. These lists should be submitted to the Council before the 30th of this month.

Restrictions on the Movement of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth

The Shanghai Municipal Council announces: From the 17th of this month, any person or group, regardless of nationality, who wishes to move cotton yarn or cotton cloth within the International Settlement must obtain a transportation permit from the Council's General Office if the quantity to be transported is 100 pounds or more of cotton yarn per bundle, or 10 or more pieces of cotton cloth. Goods moved without permission in violation of this announcement will be confiscated without compensation. If the total amount of cotton yarn transported exceeds 100 pounds, or the total amount of cotton cloth transported exceeds 10 pieces, a permit must be obtained regardless of the number of separate movements. The person in charge of any warehouse company or other location storing cotton yarn or cotton cloth who allows such goods to be moved without a transportation permit will be subject to punishment by the Council.

Dispatching Personnel to Conduct Spot Checks and Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cloth

For the purpose of thoroughly investigating speculative buying and selling of cotton yarn and cloth, the Ministry of Industry has ordered that the movement of all registered yarn and cloth be temporarily suspended. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, together with the relevant trade associations, will dispatch personnel to conduct spot checks. If unregistered yarn or cloth is found, the Economic Bureau or the Settlement authorities will be notified immediately to detain the goods pending further investigation.

Drafting a Plan for the Exchange of Goods

Since the implementation of the new system for the transport of goods, the transport of items other than controlled commodities is bound to become busy. The industrial products of this city and the agricultural products of the interior also urgently need to be exchanged. According to reports, the relevant authorities are currently drafting a detailed plan for the exchange of goods between various regions in order to adapt to this need. The plan will stipulate the rules for the transport of goods between various regions. Once the plan is completed and implemented, procedures for the transport of goods will be greatly facilitated.

After deducting various expenses from the collected fees, there was a surplus of 4,000 yuan.

### Cigarettes Begin Distribution: Strictly Prohibit Price Cutting, Hoarding, Resale, and Refusal to Sell or Tie-in Sales

After the Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association implemented the second phase of cigarette distribution, it has ordered all wholesale distributors and retail vendors to bring their distribution cards and seals to the designated distribution points and Datong Bank to pay for and pick up the goods. There are four grades: A, B, C, and D. The payment for the goods is slightly higher than the first phase. It is expected that the distribution will be completed before the 25th of this month. In order to effectively implement cigarette price controls, in addition to ordering distributors to hang their price signs and retail vendors to hang their price tags in conspicuous places to facilitate identification by purchasers, it has also issued 15 rules prohibiting price increases, hoarding, and reselling for profit. At the same time, purchasers are allowed to report violations at any time for investigation and punishment. The distribution of goods in other areas and the suburbs of Shanghai has been handled separately by the Association, and prices will be unified. Therefore, resale is bound to disappear.

The authorities are determined to strictly implement the retail of low-priced cigarettes. It has been learned that some tobacco and paper stores often refuse to sell them under various pretexts, or require customers to purchase a pack of non-price-controlled cigarettes when buying low-priced cigarettes, which is not appropriate. Therefore, personnel have been dispatched to investigate and ban such practices.

### Launch of Crackdown on Pickpocketing: Multiple Pickpockets Arrested, Mostly Repeat Offenders; Crackdown to Continue Until Satisfaction is Achieved

According to a revelation to reporters from the Police Department Director, since the police began the crackdown on pickpocketing on Sunday, nearly 150 pickpockets and suspected thieves have been arrested to date. It is said that most of the arrested pickpockets are "old hands," making it easier to catch them. It is also said that the crackdown on pickpocketing will not end until the authorities are completely satisfied; the end date may not be specified. After being arrested this time, the pickpockets will be severely punished. Pickpockets who have served their sentences and been released will be severely warned by the authorities. If they rejoin pickpocketing gangs, they will be subject to the most severe penalties.

### Investigation of Sublease Licenses Based on Household Registration Records

For those who have generally delayed obtaining licenses, the sublease housing management office will review whether there are attached households listed in the household registration records.

### Solving the Problem of Papermaking Raw Materials: Japanese Merchants Raise Funds to Establish a Pulp Company with a Monthly Output of 300 Tons of Pulp, Raw Materials Sourced from the Four Suburbs of This City

The raw materials required by the papermaking industry in this city are supplied by reclaimed waste paper in conjunction with imported pulp from Japan. However, the supply of such pulp is insufficient to meet the needs of the papermaking industry in this city. Furthermore, the price of waste paper in this city is also surprisingly expensive. Therefore, the raw material problem is an important issue for the papermaking industry in this city. According to reports, a certain Japanese industrial company in this city is currently raising funds to establish an industrial company with a monthly output of 300 tons of pulp in order to solve this problem. The raw materials needed will be sourced locally from the four suburbs of this city, and it will soon be established. It is expected that after the establishment of this pulp company, the raw material problem of the papermaking factories in this city will be solved, paper production will increase, and paper prices will inevitably fall.

### Although Air Defense Drills Have Passed, Citizens Must Continue to Take Precautions; Blackout and Firefighting Equipment Should Remain in Place; Self-Defense Corps Members Must Remain Vigilant at All Times

The neighborhood administrative offices in all districts of this city have been instructed to continue to pay attention to air defense equipment in their respective jurisdictions. Although the four-day air defense drills ended the day before yesterday, the air defense authorities believe that people's air defense measures are not limited by time or space. To prevent problems before they occur, blackout equipment and firefighting materials must be prepared in every household for a long time to guard against emergencies. Members of the self-defense corps in each district must remain vigilant at all times and are responsible for supervising air defense facilities in their respective jurisdictions. According to the Japanese Army Press Department, the Japanese air force in China has a large and expansive force. The area under its jurisdiction will not encounter any air raid threats. However, as a precautionary measure, it is hoped that residents will cooperate closely with the authorities to strengthen air defense.

### Cultural Circles in This City Welcome Japanese Literary Figures

### Epidemic Prevention Work

Recently, the weather has been getting warmer, and the season for epidemics is approaching soon. Therefore, all health authorities have launched comprehensive epidemic prevention work to ensure the health of citizens.

Nanshi

The Nanshi Health Office of the Municipal Health Bureau has designated four locations for free cholera vaccinations in order to effectively carry out epidemic prevention work in the entire Nanshi area and to prevent the outbreak of epidemic sources.

### Information Chief Hirota Delivers Speech

At a regular meeting with foreign journalists yesterday, Hirota, the spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy, ​​declared: "President Roosevelt of the United States made a broadcast on Lincoln's Memorial Day, stating that 'the United States and Britain will adopt the policy of "solving Europe first."'" However, after two months, a propagandist in the United States suddenly claimed that this policy only reflects the true attitude of the United States towards the Pacific War. This shows that the policies of the anti-Axis countries are contradictory and their steps are inconsistent." Hirota quoted three points from President Roosevelt's speech on February 12 to prove the accuracy of his judgment. The first point of Roosevelt's speech quoted by Hirota was: "Our opinions have become consistent, with the goal of achieving complete victory throughout the world. The British Prime Minister is very willing to sign an agreement statement with us, stating that if Germany surrenders before Japan, Britain will of course dedicate its national manpower and material resources to jointly attack Japan with China and our country. I told Mr. Churchill at the Sabranca Conference that this kind of formal agreement is not necessary, because Americans should accept the words of the great British, and our determination is completely consistent." Regarding this kind of statement, Hirota said that unless one is inherently forgetful, no one can believe that the current US propaganda is valuable.

The second point of Roosevelt's speech quoted by Hirota was: "The US military in the Southwest Pacific is receiving a lot of assistance from Australia, New Zealand, and the British side." Hirota said: "This kind of exaggeration is contrary to the recent statements by US propagandists and Sea Chief Knox regarding the supply of reinforcements. This shows that those who receive assistance are not Australia but the United States."

The third point quoted by Hirota was: "In the process of bringing Japan to its final failure, we do not want to slow down our progress in the Pacific and waste time. We will take strong and decisive actions to drive the invaders out of Chinese territory, and we will also take important actions in Chinese airspace." Hirota said that the US military in the Southwest Pacific has not made an inch of progress to date, and is retreating in sections. As for air strikes, what kind of aircraft can the United States use? In fact, the United States does not have any aircraft that can attack Japan.

### Judicial Officials of the District Court Exempted from Self-Defense Corps Service; Clerks and Below Still Required to Serve

The Shanghai District Court sent a letter to the Nanshi District Neighborhood Administrative Self-Defense Corps Headquarters, requesting exemption from the duty of serving in the corps for the court officials residing in Nanshi. After receiving the letter, the headquarters decided after discussion that judicial officials above the rank of clerk would be granted exemption, while other office staff would still be required to serve as required and could not refuse on pretexts.

### Land Tax for the Thirty-First Year to Be Collected Starting Today

Now that the time for the collection of land tax for the 31st year has arrived, it is hereby determined that collection will begin from today. The people in the district should pay the new and old land taxes directly to the collection office.

Yesterday, the newspaper announced the time was 8:30 p.m.

### Economy

After the authorities dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate the accounts of the banks, the money market suddenly tightened. Hoarders flocked to the market, and the prices of yarn, private service stocks, grain, and daily necessities fell for days.

### Commentary: The Banking Industry's "Self-Restraint System"

The banking industry in this city, in order to assist the authorities in eradicating hoarding and to strictly implement the "self-restraint system" in the banking industry, will hold an important meeting in the coming days to discuss countermeasures. The main issue to be discussed will be that in the future, speculative hoarding merchants will absolutely no longer be granted funds; if a certain bank continues to collude with speculative hoarding, or even directly engages in speculative hoarding in secret, once it is verified, all banks will take three countermeasures: (1) All banks will stop all business dealings with the bank; (2) All banks will uniformly refuse to accept the bank's checks; (3) The bank association will expel the bank's membership. This is of course a way to "draw firewood from under the pot" to eradicate hoarding.

This "self-restraint policy" can be interpreted as gentlemen valuing themselves, valuing their economic mission, their financial responsibilities, and their social righteousness. If a bank participates in speculative hoarding, it is tantamount to aiding and abetting the evildoer. Its crime against the country and society is greater than that of ordinary people engaged in speculative hoarding. This is undeniable.

More than a month ago (March 10 of this year), the Shanghai Banking Association had already resolved to pass new measures for silver and money loans. All restrictions are strict and reasonable; logically, no bank should participate in speculative hoarding after that. However, because restrictions have been stipulated, but punishment methods have not been considered, there is little fear. Therefore, we feel that the "self-restraint system" should be interpreted as "heavy law" rather than "self-respect," because all "self-restraint systems" still need to be constrained by laws and regulations, otherwise it is impossible.

### Relevant Authorities Reconsidering Merging Small Banks in This City to Thoroughly Eradicate Hoarding by Financial Institutions

Regarding the government authorities dispatching personnel to thoroughly investigate the speculative hoarding incidents of various financial institutions in this city, all sectors of society are paying close attention to this. It is generally believed that the ability to thoroughly resolve this investigation depends on the government authorities using political pressure. On the one hand, the current situation of Shanghai's financial sector, such as the simple organization and insufficient reserve funds of some small banks, and the fact that they use the name of banks to engage in hoarding, all need to be reconsidered. It is reported that in order to seek a thorough solution to the hoarding incident, the relevant authorities will implement strong countermeasures against Shanghai's financial sector, resolutely dispose of those who violate government laws and regulations and disrupt the social economy in their operations. At the same time, a decision has been made to merge a part of the small banks. Detailed methods are being considered.

### Municipal Economic Bureau Continues to Designate Promoters for Four Trade Associations, Limiting the Time to Convene the Organization to Complete the Reporting

In order to comply with the provisions of the wartime economic policy outline, the Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau will adjust and reorganize all old industrial and commercial trade associations in this city whose economic structure is not suitable for the wartime economic system. It has been decided to first adjust and organize the trade associations of the cotton industry, yarn industry, knitwear industry, cloth industry, coal industry, coal ball industry, new medicine industry, industrial industry, oil industry, cigarette match soap candle industry, and tobacco sales industry in this city. The promoters of the trade associations of the coal industry, coal ball industry, new medicine industry, industrial industry, oil industry, cigarette match soap candle industry, and tobacco sales industry were designated in accordance with Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations. Organize preparation and organization, and limit it to complete the organization and report for verification before April 25. It is learned that the bureau yesterday (16th) continued to publish the designation of promoters for the four trade associations such as cotton to convene and organize on schedule. The list of promoters for each industry is continued as follows:

Cotton Trade Association

Designated promoters: Wang Renqing, Chen Qingzheng, Zhang Qiliang, Feng Junsheng, Shen Boqin, Li Ruifu, He Changqi, and designated Wang Renqing as the convener.

Yarn Trade Association

Designated promoters: Tang Zhiliang, Shen Boqin, Zhou Jiasheng, Gu Xikun, Xi Shaosun, Zhang Yucang, Chen Junming, Zhou Desan, Gu Yousheng, and designated Tang Zhiliang as the convener.

Knitwear Trade Association

Designated promoters: Xu Wenzhao, Hu Yunfei, Yi Yande, Jiang Zhonghe, Fu Liangjun, Ye Fukang, Ba Lingyun, and designated Xu Wenzhao as the convener.

Cloth Trade Association

Designated promoters: Ding Fangyuan, Zhou Rongsun, Xia Xianting, Wu Zihua, Wu Junhao, Qiu Weicheng, Zheng Weizhang, Shi Jiumao, Gao Aizhou, and designated Ding Fangyuan as the convener.

### The Reorganization of Trade Associations Has Nothing to Do with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce; The Adjustment is Guided by the Municipal Economic Bureau

In order to adjust and strengthen the wartime economic institutions, the government has expressly abolished the old laws and regulations that are not in line with the current environment and promulgated new provisional regulations for industrial and commercial trade associations. The various trade associations in this city are currently being guided and adjusted by the Economic Bureau to reorganize as soon as possible to meet current needs. It is heard that this matter is exclusively managed by the Economic Bureau and has no direct relationship with the National General Association for Commercial Control.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Instructs Various Associations to Submit Membership Rosters

The Banking Association of this city, in order to comply with the wishes of the authorities, has decided that all banks will only extend loans with commodity guarantees to members of various industry associations, and has requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform the various industry associations to send a copy of the membership roster of each association to facilitate distribution to various banks for reference. It is learned that the Money Industry Association is also following in the footsteps of the Banking Association and has requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send the membership roster of various industry associations to the association. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has recently sent a letter to the various industry associations, requiring them to send two copies of the membership roster within seven days of receiving the letter in order to be sent to the Banking and Money Industries Associations for inspection.

### Preventing Illegal Profiteering: Joint Venture Cooperatives Organized by Various Industries

Considering that in the past, the operations of various industries in this city have often been disrupted by the involvement of individuals outside the industry and by those within seeking illegal profits, and now that the Commerce Control Committee has been established, the trading of various industries will soon be reopened. To eliminate past malpractices, various industries in this city plan to universally organize joint venture cooperatives. It is understood that the paper industry joint venture has already been established, while the rice and grain industry joint venture and the egg industry joint venture are actively being prepared. Industries also planning to start preparations include the aquatic products industry, tea industry, vegetable industry, fruit industry, and condiment industry.

### Arrow and Knife Soap Sold at a Fair Price

The China Chemical Industry Society on Henan Road in this city, in order to alleviate the soap shortage among residents, has specially requested and obtained approval from the authorities to offer 3,000 boxes of Arrow and Knife soap. Approximately 30 cigarette and exchange shops in various districts will simultaneously sell the soap at a fair price, starting from the 16th, at 13 yuan per bar, including donation. Each person is limited to two bars, while supplies last. The supply situation on the first day was very good, but the remaining stock is limited. Those wishing to purchase can go to the designated sales points nearby to buy.

The remuneration for manuscripts in this section for March has been settled. Contributors are requested to bring their payment slips to the Accounting Department of this newspaper from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 17th, 18th, and 19th to collect their payments. Furthermore, Mr. Yingying, Mr. Wang Duan, and Mr. Chen Xitai are requested to provide supplementary seals and contact addresses and come to the newspaper office at 9:00 PM nightly for a face-to-face discussion. - Editorial Department, Economic Section

### Perspectives of Those Involved in Planning the Commerce Control Committee

Textiles

To cultivate combat power and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Commerce Control Headquarters was established, and various control institutions were established under it as lower-level organizations. Among various materials, the most urgently needed measures are food, cotton textiles, soap, matches, flour milling, candles, livestock, tobacco, and the sugar industry. Therefore, it was decided to first establish control institutions, with personnel selected by both Chinese and Japanese authorities, and preparation directors and committee members selected from both Chinese and Japanese civilians to establish lower-level organizations to create this institution that adapts to the times. The committee's policies and operations will determine the success or failure of the new economic policy. The following describes the opinions of those involved in the groundwork of the Control Headquarters, namely the aspirations of the preparation directors and others.

First, let us ask Mr. Hishida Itsuji, the preparation director of the cotton textile department, for his opinion. Mr. Hishida is the president of Yu Textile Company and the Shanghai branch manager of the Textile Industry Association in China. He is skilled and experienced, making him the most suitable person to guide the textile industry during this transition period.

The following is a speech by Mr. Hishida: "Of course, I have aspirations and plans, but because my every word and deed can easily cause an oversensitive reaction from my peers, so..." Mr. Hishida initially wanted to avoid speaking, but he could not resist the reporter's urging and finally opened the floodgates, saying the following at length:

"The National Commerce Control Headquarters clearly states on its signboard that it is the control of commerce and the control of industry, doesn't it include it! This kind of opinion is rampant in the streets and alleys, but I think this view is wrong. In this case, although there is no 'industry' character, the 'commerce' character contains the meaning of industry.

The main purpose of the establishment of the Commerce Control Committee is to deal with the current chaotic prices. Just imagine, with such chaotic prices, how can we talk about enhancing national power, revitalizing the economy, and stabilizing people's livelihoods! Stabilizing prices and establishing a certain standard is the greatest mission of the Commerce Control Committee, and the adequate supply of goods is an urgent matter. Just like the cotton textiles that I manage, in order to revitalize cotton yarn and cotton cloth textiles, we have to increase cotton production. In this case, we also need to refer to other agricultural products and guide farmers to plant agricultural products like cultivating cotton. If we say that we can use political power to increase cotton production, I don't think it is so simple and successful. Even if we want to increase cotton production, but the prices of agricultural products or other goods are higher than cotton, then the increase in cotton production will still be difficult to achieve. Therefore, we must seek its balanced development in everything." (Continental News, April 14)

### Three Film Companies Merged to Form a Unified Organization

The Chinese film industry, having previously concentrated and unified the establishment of China Film Company to handle distribution, China United Film Company to handle production, and Shanghai Cinema Company to operate theaters, now finds that the separation of the three companies has not achieved simplification. To adapt to the wartime cultural propaganda system, the Propaganda Department has ordered the three companies to merge and reorganize into a unified organization to seek further concentration. After receiving the order, the authorities of the three companies immediately jointly consulted on everything, established a temporary preparation office, appointed Feng Jie as the director, and appointed Kawakita Nagamasa and Zhang Shankun as deputy directors to carefully study the reorganization matters. A formal preparatory meeting was held yesterday to discuss all the procedures.

### Reader Forum: Children's Welfare and Society

— Lin Chongzhi

Children's welfare refers to the general happiness that children should enjoy. In each era, the scope of this welfare depends on the attention and evaluation given to children by society. Currently, children are recognized as the most important social unit, and things like nutritious food, complete clothing, adequate entertainment, learning methods suitable for their nature, and attention to the full development of their talents are all conditions that contribute to the physical and mental health of children. However, such conditions, for fortunate children, can be enjoyed by relying on the power of their parents. As for unfortunate children, either due to irresponsible parents, or the death of parents, or the deprivation of legal guardians, they must rely on social organizations and child care institutions to provide care so that they can grow up.

This only discusses the general care aspect. The greater reason for social organizations to establish care institutions, the most obvious one, is to maintain the national spirit of human tradition; to prevent the growth of criminal psychology in children; to give sympathy to the poor and helpless; to stimulate the reaction of stubborn parents; and to develop the activities of political parties, religions, or organizations, etc. Not only can it remedy the inadequacy of family education, but it is also easier to establish a good social order. The American educator Dr. Dewey once said: "What is lacking in wise parents for their children is what is lacking in society for children." This can serve as a guiding principle for those engaged in children's welfare work.

Children's welfare activities can be carried out in many ways:

(1) Establish "Children's Foundations" to expand economic assistance so that their parents can continue to care for their children, with society in a monitoring position; or allocate funds to childcare institutions on a regular basis to supplement their lack of financial resources.

(2) Establish "Orphanages" to accommodate as many orphaned children as possible so that they have a place to rely on.

(3) Establish "Rehabilitation Centers for Disabled Children" to accommodate poor disabled children and teach them appropriate skills so that they do not use their disabilities as tools for begging.

(4) Establish "Infant Welfare Homes" to accommodate poor children and provide them with appropriate education or skills so that they do not wander the streets begging.

(5) Establish "Daycare Centers" to care for the young children of working women so that they are not burdened with childcare and can engage in occupations or other valuable labor.

(6) Establish "Children's Health Associations" to specialize in physical examinations and epidemic prevention, and to guide and supervise family children's health matters.

(7) Establish "Children's Hospitals" to specialize in admitting sick children and providing them with medical assistance.

(8) Establish "Children's Sports Associations" to promote public entertainment in order to promote physical development.

(9) Establish "Children's Nutrition Associations" to investigate the nutritional status of children's food and further study appropriate methods for reference by families and childcare institutions.

(10) Establish "Children's Welfare Associations" to protect the interests of child laborers and children before the law, and to adjust children's issues, etc.

(11) Central and local governments should establish children's welfare bureaus to manage various child care institutions, and to formulate laws related to children's welfare, and to effectively supervise and guide in order to seek children's welfare.

Children are the foundation of the nation and the masters of the next generation. If we want to improve the social structure, strengthen the race, promote work efficiency, and develop scientific knowledge, we must start with the issue of children's welfare in social problems. People often neglect children's welfare as a small part of social problems, which is a great mistake, because children's welfare is closely related to all major problems in society.

### Genius, Opportunity, Effort

— Jia Xue

Many people believe that genius is the ruler of life, and that learning, career, and various achievements all depend on the development of genius. The size of each person's achievement is determined by the level of genius, thus neglecting human effort.

Many people believe that opportunity is the master of life. No matter how strong your ability or how deep your knowledge, if opportunity does not come, it is useless. On the other hand, if opportunity comes at the right time, even if you are of low status and have shallow knowledge, you will have a day to stand out. Therefore, many people hand over their future to opportunity and give up real effort.

Many hard-working people, under the pressure of reality, only their own efforts are the best guarantee for the future. Therefore, in eternal work, they discover their own genius, encounter wonderful opportunities, and create extraordinary achievements from hardship. And these geniuses and opportunities were not considered by them at the beginning. They started with effort, seized the opportunity, honed their genius, and achieved more than the first two types of people.

Relying solely on genius and opportunity is empty, although we do not underestimate the role they play in human affairs. Only in the process of effort can they provide people with effective help.

### X-ray Examination Record

— Lu Shenting

"Hmph! Hmph! Especially us teachers who eat chalk dust, we are most likely to get lung disease; I don't have lung disease, do I?" Every time Mr. Chen coughs, he always thinks this way.

Some places have mandatory X-ray examinations for lung disease. He wanted to go and have a look, but his busy work didn't allow him any relaxation. Even on Sundays, he had to stay at school to mimeograph handouts and do miscellaneous tasks. Finally, he hardened his heart and asked Mr. Principal for leave to go for an examination.

At 9:00 AM, Mr. Chen had already stepped into the hospital, full of joy, and suddenly felt a lightness in his chest. When he went to the service window to inquire, he learned that free X-rays would start in the afternoon.

Mr. Chen had no choice but to blame himself for being rude, so he simply bought a newspaper to relieve his boredom. Near noon, he bought a small, pointed bread for lunch.

At 12:30, Mr. Chen had already stretched his neck and waited at the registration room. After a while, more and more people came, until the room was full of sallow-faced people. The nurses then put on sullen faces and pursed their lips, and started distributing forms in a harsh and strange voice.

Immediately, countless withered hands flew up, scrambling to grab them. At this critical moment, Mr. Chen was fortunate enough to get one. He carefully took out a pencil stub, filled it out one by one, and handed it in.

The nurses were afraid of being bothered, so they issued another order, instructing everyone to temporarily retreat outside. Examinations would not begin until 2:30 PM.

Around 4:00 PM, Mr. Chen's name was called.

The doctor, wearing dark glasses, glanced at Mr. Chen and, seeing his old gown and long hair, couldn't help but scold, "How many times have you come to take a picture?" Mr. Chen answered in a low voice, respectfully, "First time." The doctor immediately snorted and said, "I don't think you look like someone who's trying to get something for free for the first time!"

Mr. Chen shuddered.

"Chi chi... chi..." rang a few times. In less than half a minute, the doctor dragged Mr. Chen out of the darkroom and called out, "Deep bronchial shadow!" So the nurse outside stamped a "Deep bronchial shadow" stamp on the form he had filled out and handed it to him, saying, "Okay, you can go back!"

He felt very tired and wanted to take the tram back, but he thought that he had already spent a lot of money today. Taking a class off would deduct one yuan and two mao. Wouldn't all seven classes today deduct eight yuan and four mao? Plus one yuan and six jiao for the small bread, the tram fare this morning, and the newspaper money... Ah! I can't waste any more money, let's walk!

"What is a deep bronchial shadow? Do I have lung disease after all?" This question swirled in his stomach again. "Hmph! Hmph!" He still coughed inexplicably, thinking that he still had to grade seventy-four diaries tonight.

### "Idle Talk"

— Jiang Feng

Heartfelt "persuasion" is indeed "lubricating oil"; but "idle talk" from bystanders is not necessarily "rough sand." Some "idle talk" is indeed aimless and slanderous; but some "idle talk" can help us discover our own shortcomings, errors in our work, and other extremely valuable opinions.

Let us not engage in "idle talk" about others! But regarding others' "idle talk" about us, we must dispel prejudice and analyze and study it with a correct perspective.

The attitude of treating all "idle talk" like worn-out shoes is incorrect!

### Root

— Zu Bo

However, they separated from the others on White Tiger Back. White Tiger Back is the spine of a branch, those going west go west from here, those going south go down the spine from here, but they are going to Lingshan Bay, which is on its east side, so they all go down east from here.

They seemed to have walked a little further, going around in a big circle. But Dagen's home is close to this branch, closer than going back to the original road of Sanmao Temple, and going straight down from Tianqi Temple is only rubble and no road, so they had to come down from White Tiger Back. In addition, they originally planned to go around in a big circle, so they decided to go this way and did not regret it.

"Dagen brother," A Wu said, looking at the entire Lingshan Bay in the rain, "Your place is very good. If there is a war, the mountains on three sides are easy to defend, and the gap in front is also easy to defend. I think the people in the 'team' will one day pay attention to this place..."

"I don't understand these," Dagen also looked at his hometown, which was familiar to him with every tree, every stone, every piece of soil, and every brick, "I only know that it is warm in winter and cool in summer, and there are no floods or droughts, a good place. The mountains in the north block the cold wind, and the south can blow in the summer wind; the heavy rain will drain away, and if it doesn't rain, the water in the pond is enough, and there is also a mountain spring that will gradually drip down..."

"You say that well, I want to live here too!" A Wu said with a smile.

They reached the plain in laughter and reached Dagen's home. (End of Chapter Two, to be continued) (Thirty-three)

### Heredity and Environment

— Zhi Dao

"How do heredity and environment affect individual development?" is a topic that everyone is interested in. However, opinions on this question differ not only among ordinary people, but also among many experts due to different starting points.

Galton was a hereditarian. In his book "Hereditary Genius," he listed many facts to prove that genius is hereditary. Later, Thorndike and Hughes also conducted similar studies. Hughes said in his "Heredity of Intelligence and Morality in Royalty": "Regarding intellectual life, environment is a completely inappropriate explanation. On the contrary, heredity can not only explain all (at least 90%) of the facts of intelligence, but the less we talk about environment, the more complete the explanation. Therefore, we must conclude that the differences in intellectual activity that can be measured by ten levels are small differences in the original germ plasm and have long been predetermined." Therefore, their conclusion is very consistent with our old saying "Generals and ministers are born of a certain stock." But we have to ask: Is there no room for rebuttal in their views? Now let's look at the views of environmentalists.

In order to prove the influence of environment on individual development, Watson and Freeman both selected twins as subjects of study. Because the inheritance that twins receive from their parents is the same, the differences in their subsequent development are the influences produced by the environment. The results of their research all agreed that the younger the twins' age, the greater the similarity; the older the age, the more different they become. Freeman found in his research on three pairs of identical twins who were separated and raised from childhood that the IQs of two pairs were very similar, while the other pair was very different. From this, it can be seen that the power of the environment is also undeniable.

After reading the above-mentioned studies, we can draw a conclusion here: Heredity limits the energy we can develop, and environment provides us with the opportunity to develop. If heredity is a seed, then environment is the soil, sunlight, and fertilizer. Good seeds can never bear good fruit on barren land. Conversely, inferior seeds cannot bloom well on fertile land. Only good seeds on fertile land, under the irrigation of capable gardeners, can have a satisfactory harvest!

### Eighth Place in February Essay Contest: How to Read and What to Read?

— Lu Tingfang

I feel that the question of what to read is obviously more important than the question of how to read; and at the same time, the question of what to read can also be included within the question of how to read. Because when we say how to read, this refers to the method of reading; when we say what to read, this refers to the method of selecting books; including the method of selecting books within the method of reading is naturally very logical.

So, what kind of books should we read? This completely depends on our own needs. What we need, we read. Rich knowledge in all aspects is the foundation for studying all knowledge. If we ask ourselves, if our knowledge still has a certain defect that prevents us from specializing in a certain discipline, we must consider selecting books in a certain area to enrich our knowledge defects.

Regarding the text related to the selected knowledge, whether it is a separate book or an essay or note in a magazine or newspaper, even if it is a scrap of paper, we must browse it one by one to the best of our ability. But if we encounter the essence, which we have never heard before, we must carefully consider it, and use our own opinions and experience to verify the opinions and descriptions in the book, and transform the opinions in the book into our own opinions.

Sometimes, when we find two or more different opinions in two or more similar books, we may feel the pain of not knowing what to do. In fact, this is our supreme opportunity for progress. Because, at least for now, there is no science that is completely perfect; every science is full of different problems that need us to answer or correct its answers. If the books we see are all the same, without different opinions, then if we have one, we don't need others; therefore, if books of the same kind have the same content, the second one becomes worthless to us. It is precisely because they have different opinions that they can guide us to compare various opinions; and by continuing to research, when we have our own unique insights, we can join the ranks of scholars.

Many kinds of knowledge cannot be understood by reading alone, so we must pay attention to practice in addition to reading. Verifying what we get from practice with what we get from reading then constitutes our knowledge. This is especially true in all natural sciences and applied sciences. For example, mathematics must focus on calculation, chemistry, physics, animals, and plants must pay attention to observation and experimentation, medicine must pay attention to practice, and geography must carefully check maps and travel.

In addition, various reference books such as dictionaries and thesauruses are of great value in helping to answer various terms, and it is best to purchase them completely. Specializing in one or two foreign languages to expand the scope of one's reading is naturally a very good thing. As for books with obscure and incomprehensible translations, they only waste time, and it is better to give them up and not read them. All books and newspapers that promote character and cultivation must also be read frequently, because having a sound character and body is useful after acquiring knowledge!

### Death

— Xie Shan

"Death" is painful (generally speaking), so some people are very afraid of "death"; but "death" can end all the troubles of "life", even the most difficult things (?), so some people desperately want to "die."

In fact, both of these views are wrong. Is "death" painful? No one has tried it, and even if someone has "died," they can no longer tell it. Can "death" end all the troubles of "life?" This sentence is full of passive and evasive psychology, and is not thorough. Since his troubles have not been solved by himself, his troubles will forever exist in history - "This hatred lasts forever."

Since we understand very well that we cannot escape the arrival of "death," then when "death" has come to our side, why bother to look for "death" ourselves?

"Death" must be "died" worthwhile, so-called "'death' is heavier than Mount Tai"; "death" has "died" unworthwhile, so-called "'death' is lighter than a feather."

Living in the world, with a clear conscience above and no regrets below; seeking peace of mind, then what "fear" or what "joy" is there for us in the arrival of "death"?

### A Visit to the Labor Daycare Center Sponsored by the YWCA

— Gong Yunyan

The Labor Daycare Center at 66 Daxilu is a small three-story Western-style building. In front of it is a large garden planted with tall cypresses and hollies, surrounded by green fences, a quiet environment. The downstairs is divided into five small rooms. In addition to the kitchen and office, the rest are the living rooms for children in grades ABC. The second floor, in addition to the living room for children in grade D, has two bathrooms and three bedrooms. One is for children aged two to three, one is for children aged three to four, and the other is a special bedroom. The third floor is the bedroom for five-year-old children. According to people at the daycare center, the center has been established for two years. It was originally located in the buildings of the Tongren Hospital on Bailinan Road. Since the war the year before last, it has moved to its current location. Monthly expenses are 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Staff salaries are more than 100 yuan, all with meals and lodging. There are currently more than 90 children in the center. Their families are very poor, and some pay fees, but they are all within their ability. Because the children are young, the teachers only impart practical teaching. In terms of common sense, they teach them to recognize colors and distinguish between salty and light. In terms of Mandarin, the most important thing is speaking. At the same time, singing is also emphasized. Meals are divided into four times a day. The first time is at 7:00 in the morning, eating porridge or steamed buns. The second time is at 11:30, the older children eat rice, and the younger children drink porridge. Naps are at twelve o'clock, snacks are at three thirty, and dinner is at seven o'clock. There are both meat and vegetarian dishes, and they are changed at any time to provide the children with the necessary nutrients on average as a principle. Recently, the authorities of the center have felt great anxiety due to the forced sale of the building and the difficulty in funding, and hope that people from the Needlework Association will cooperate.
