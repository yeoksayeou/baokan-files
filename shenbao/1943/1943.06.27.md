### A New Review of This Year's Scholarship Fund

Zhang Yipeng

In recent years, the operation of scholarship funds has gradually become a trend, which is naturally a rare good phenomenon amidst all the chaos. However, the targets of scholarship funds, in terms of people, are needed tenfold or a hundredfold more than before. In terms of material resources, excluding food and lodging, the increase in expenses such as tuition, experimental fees, etc., is also astonishing. Using limited donations to meet endless supplies is truly a major event worthy of careful consideration and anxiety. Originally, the establishment of scholarship funds can be roughly divided into three categories: The first category is personal voluntary contributions, allocating private wealth as a permanent and regular undertaking, such as the Shu Ping Loan Scholarship and the Yu Zhai Scholarship. The second category is public organizations that agree to use public funds to help students from their group who have dropped out of school, such as hometown associations, trade associations, or the schools themselves. The third category is public opinion organizations that openly solicit donations. Regardless of the amount of funds, they accumulate them into a substantial sum and use procedures such as registration, examination, and investigation to distribute them fairly, such as the News Daily and the Shen Bao. Although their institutions and methods are different, the qualification of being poor and outstanding is a common principle. Now, to adapt to this current environment, the most desired thing is naturally the expansion of the scholarship fund amount. However, for the first category, due to the factual and definite control of the founders, it is certainly not likely to decrease, but it is also difficult to increase, or perhaps new institutions are constantly brewing there. The second category has great potential for expansion, especially the schools themselves. Setting up several full or half-tuition scholarships can prevent students with excellent academic performance from dropping out halfway. It doesn't cost the school much financial resources to enroll a few more students, so why not do it? As for the third category, the problem is much more complicated than the first two categories. This is the central focus of this article that needs to be re-examined.

The News Daily and the Shen Bao's scholarship funds are affiliated with the social service department. This department includes many types, but the scholarship matter is the most crucial. Because promoting students and cultivating talents is not only a matter of individual success or failure but also related to the rise and fall of the nation. Moreover, it has a special characteristic. In the position of managing scholarships, one naturally hopes that wealthy and benevolent people will make large donations, but even small and fragmented amounts can be accepted and assimilated, forming a grand spectacle. This is something that individuals or organizations cannot do. Therefore, even peddlers and laborers, with one or half a dollar, as long as they have enthusiasm, can have an effect. In Shanghai, there are many idle classes who use entertainment as a way to pass the time. It is not necessary for them to sacrifice everything, but if they can reduce one or two times a month, or save one or two dollars each time, they can help countless young people who have dropped out of school. Also, for gift-giving at weddings, funerals, and celebrations, such as flower baskets, scrolls, and paper ingots, if they are converted into cash and sent to the scholarship organization, and the receipt is used as a gift certificate to be sent to the host, it would truly be transforming useless things into useful ones. Furthermore, reciting scriptures in memory of ancestors and performing rituals to pray for birthdays are common customs among Chinese people. However, reducing the number of monks and priests from thirteen to four or six would not diminish the reverence and would allow the saved money to be used for scholarships, wouldn't that be more satisfying and valuable? Moreover, regardless of wealth, everyone has children and hopes that their children will succeed, so they must pay attention to their cultivation. Seeing others unable to afford education, who wouldn't feel compassion in their hearts? Although it is not necessary to talk about cause and effect, planting melons yields melons, and planting beans yields beans, there is a certain result. I advise the people of the world to pay attention to this.

In managing scholarship work, on the one hand, we advocate for raising donations, and on the other hand, the distribution of scholarship funds is also crucial. The so-called "those who have money contribute money, and those who have no money contribute effort" are originally complementary. First of all, we must adhere to the constitution of "poor and outstanding." How to ensure that the measurement is accurate without any errors, and how to ensure that the public's expectations are not disappointed. Not only is using public office for private gain considered a great sin, but also intercession and favoritism are absolutely not tolerated. This is a matter of righteousness, not a blessing. For example, the Shen Bao has held five sessions, but each session has its own difficulties, and each session also has its own improvements. Before the registration begins, we have already convened and mobilized, discussing separately and proceeding in an orderly manner, sparing no effort. The most difficult thing is the investigation. The four words "poor and outstanding" seem very simple at first glance, but in reality, they are complex. Being poor due to extravagance and waste cannot be considered "poor," and being outstanding without good character and physique cannot be considered "outstanding." Although it may seem overly harsh and nitpicking, every case of abuse means one less hope. It is not only unfair to the recipients but also unfair to the donors. This is a sincere statement from the conscience.

According to past statistics, the previous session had 2,632 applicants, and the number of recipients was 1,530. The total amount of scholarship funds was 217,883 yuan. Although we cannot predict the number of registrations and recipients this time, it is likely that it will increase several times under today's living conditions. With the soaring tuition and fees, a total scholarship fund of one or two hundred thousand yuan is necessary. The Shen Bao is working hard to make progress, and if we can achieve our goal, we cannot help but bow our heads and express our gratitude to the masses.

Finally, I have one more suggestion to offer. Recently, the number of scholarship organizations has been increasing day by day. It is appropriate for them to contact each other and study together consistently, without any ambiguity. This is also a form of mutual assistance.

### A New Facet of Sino-Japanese Cooperation

Prime Minister Tojo, in his policy speech to the 82nd Diet, stated that the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia currently trust Japan, sincerely and voluntarily cooperating to complete the Greater East Asia War, and that their strength is increasing daily, with the foundation of co-prosperity already fully established. At the same time, the Prime Minister also elaborated on the policy of constructing Greater East Asia. Among them, regarding the relationship with China, the Prime Minister solemnly declared that the Sino-Japanese Treaty will be fundamentally revised, further promoting the cooperative stance between the two countries, which is quite noteworthy. The content of the revision is certainly worth speculating on, but Japan, sparing no effort to support China's completion of independence and autonomy, expects China to realize harmonious cooperation with all the Chinese people as the target, so that the Chinese people thoroughly understand that without the victory of the Greater East Asia War, there is no liberation of Greater East Asia, and without the construction of Greater East Asia, there is no welfare of Greater East Asia. With this belief, they can cooperate with each other and move towards common goals.

The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can only be completed by the ten billion peoples within its borders uniting in the spirit of good neighborliness and cooperation. And the absolute condition for this is the complete understanding and cooperation between China and Japan, the axis of East Asia. Without the complete fusion of China and Japan, the satisfactory completion of the Greater East Asia War is impossible.

In January of this year, concurrently with China's participation in the war, Japan implemented a new policy towards China, and China was freed from the shackles of a hundred years, completing the goal of the Chinese national movement in one fell swoop: to abolish unequal treaties and strive for independence and autonomy. What Japan intended was not the destruction of China, but truly the completion of China's autonomous independence and prosperity, which can be proven by facts. Even the anti-Japanese regime in Chongqing today cannot but tacitly acknowledge this. Therefore, this new Japanese policy has had a great impact on Chongqing. In various ways, it has shown that there have already been shakes within its camp.

Needless to say, the new policy towards China has achieved great results in handling the incident, but the Chongqing anti-Japanese regime has not collapsed as a result. Moreover, from the perspective of truly handling the incident, if the anti-Japanese regime were to collapse at this time, and the entire Chinese people were not happy to participate in the cooperative stance of integrating with Japan, then the final goal could not be achieved.

The reason why the anti-Japanese regime has been able to linger is that they are still able to attract the hearts of the people. The National Government's ability to attract the hearts of the people is not sufficient, and the people's trust is still inevitably weak. This is because the National Government is seen as a puppet of Japan, and the deep-rooted anti-Japanese sentiment among the people makes the National Government unable to attract the people. In order to make the people thoroughly understand Japan's sincerity, break the迷妄 (misconceptions), and realize the integration of China and Japan, Japan still needs to further reflect and make efforts.

When the new policy towards China was previously implemented, the Minister of Greater East Asia requested that the individual interests of Japanese people and Japanese companies be secondary, and that genuine Sino-Japanese cooperation and the completion of the joint war for the sake of the sublime national goal be the primary consideration. In order to realize the Sino-Japanese integration that forms the backbone of the construction of Greater East Asia, the Japanese government and people must not fail to understand the great spirit of "rectifying righteousness without seeking profit, clarifying the Way without seeking merit." For the future revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, we earnestly hope that it can realize a new facet of harmonious cooperation between the two countries.

Selected Translations of Current Commentary: The Great Road of Construction in the New East Asia

"The current situation is extremely critical, and it is imperative that hundreds of millions of people unite and exert all their strength to crush the enemy's ambitions." This was the Imperial Rescript bestowed upon members of both houses of the Imperial Diet at the opening ceremony of the Extraordinary Session. We can only respectfully remember it, devote ourselves wholeheartedly, and strive to live up to it. The Prime Minister, Tojo's speech in the Diet, its inner meaning also lies in the speedy completion of the war objectives, hoping to implement the Emperor's will and to reassure people's hearts. It is the right time to boost morale and strengthen the spirit of public service.

Braving the cold and heat, enduring epidemics, and fighting against winds and waves, we express our infinite respect to the soldiers on the front lines who are skilled in planning and courageous in battle, and extend our arms of compassion to the wounded, disabled warriors and their bereaved families. We do not forget the sorrow of Admiral Yamamoto and Company Commander Yamazaki and others who sacrificed their lives for the country, and thus naturally express our earnest feelings, and shoulder the important task of assistance on our shoulders. This is the urgent task, and it is enough if everyone has this kind of feeling. We should cooperate sincerely and advance forward, strengthening our determination to respond to the Emperor's will.

The Prime Minister then spoke about the situations and countermeasures in East Asia. The close and seamless friendship with Manchukuo goes without saying. The Prime Minister also pointed out the path to China's prosperity and expressed a fundamental revision of the Sino-Japanese treaties. Taking the essence of the Greater East Asia strategy as the foundation, and advancing towards a gradual construction, can be expected.

The Prime Minister then stated that Thailand resolutely abandoned its complex and subtle relationship with Britain and the United States, and is cooperating with Japan. For the sake of the country's development, "new cooperation is needed." In Burma, the Independence Preparatory Committee has already been organized, "to quickly realize the glorious day of history," emphasizing Japan's deep expectations for this.

Of particular note is the Prime Minister's prediction that the Philippines "will be given the honor of independence within this year." For the residents of Malaya, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Celebes, he declared that in addition to gradually improving education and cultural facilities, the study of measures for "participation in politics" will be conducted this year. In particular, Java is expected to realize this as soon as possible within the realm of possibility.

Regarding Vietnam, from the perspective of the increasingly close relationship based on the spirit of the Franco-Japanese agreement on joint defense, it can be seen that this is where Japan's national policy lies, which is to allow all nations to have their place and all people to live in peace, as indicated by the founding spirit of the nation. At the same time, making it possible and concrete in terms of political strategy and tactics is the task of the authorities and can also be regarded as the only path for the nation to endorse.

Prime Minister Tojo then elaborated on how the enemy, Britain and the United States, disrupt peace, expand disasters everywhere, avoid their own tragedies, and directly cause other countries to bear the brunt. When it is disadvantageous to them, they discard them like worn-out shoes without regard, declaring that treaties are just a piece of waste paper, and fabricated independence is also a deceptive facade. Their ultimate goal is to maintain their own autocratic domination, using the sacrifices of others to provide for their own comfortable and luxurious lives. This is completely incomparable to Japan's policies towards various countries.

People of East Asia! Nations of East Asia! Remember this deeply in your hearts and do not forget it. Look back at history with reason and face reality. Use passion to crush sweet words and feel sincerity. If we cannot win, there will be no liberation of Greater East Asia. Without the new construction of Greater East Asia, there will be no welfare for the people of Greater East Asia.

Looking at the recent financial situation, this is the true meaning of national management, which ensures victory in war and success in construction. The achievements of the 82nd Diet session will surely follow this clear and great baseline, in order to reassure the Emperor and fulfill his desires. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun editorial on June 17)

The Significance of the Extraordinary Diet Session

The importance of the 82nd Extraordinary Diet Session, which bears a historical mission, goes without saying. Looking at the already decided budget案, the additional budget of 620 million yen for the general account and 1.43 billion yen for each special account, the actual national treasury burden commitment of 5.75 billion yen, can be broadly said to be a ballooning wartime finance, a huge sum that cannot be lightly let go.

Whether the implementation of this budget will create floating purchasing power must be carefully examined from all angles. Therefore, in this sense, the responsibilities of the Extraordinary Diet Session are already quite significant.

The mission of this Diet session is not only to solve these financial and monetary issues. Establishing measures to accelerate the increase of war power through enterprise preparation, and measures to ensure self-sufficiency in food for conserving ship space, concentrating the nation's economic power on the single point of prosecuting the war, is also one of its important missions.

However, the significance of the Extraordinary Diet Session is not limited to deliberating these important issues, and it cannot be expected to establish concrete countermeasures immediately. Regarding enterprise preparation and food countermeasures, the general outlines of the policies that the government intends to implement are already clear. It seems unnecessary for Diet members to add constructive opinions. The content of the policies will naturally be examined in depth, and various different opinions will arise, but this is impossible in today's great war. At the same time, it is also unnecessary, as can be seen from past examples. Therefore, the nation's expectations for the Diet, rather than detailed technical examinations, are that the government, Diet members, and the people will unite as one through sincere discussions in the Diet, and jointly enter the future decisive battle.

Under the extremely tight current situation in military, economic, and political affairs, it is naturally necessary to implement rear economic policies boldly and quickly. However, at present, any wartime economic measures cannot be further advanced without the nation making great sacrifices. Therefore, if the government's trust in the people is not sufficient, the government will not take decisive policies out of concern for the people's wavering. Conversely, if the people do not frankly express their thoughts to the government, hiding them in their hearts without speaking out, it is impossible for the government to trust the people. In this sense, the greatest mission of the government and Diet members is to sincerely face the crisis and abandon all schemes and unnecessary worries. In this atmosphere, various emergency measures can leave the realm of armchair theorizing and be implemented smoothly, forcefully, and quickly.

It must be noted here that merely using an excited attitude and impassioned abstract words to create a national unity façade does not contribute much to advancing the path of establishing a decisive battle system. Modern warfare, which uses airplanes and submarines, simultaneously demands a spirit as hot as burning fire and as calm as still water. The atmosphere of moving towards unity displayed by the Extraordinary Diet Session should also conceal the enemy-destroying spirit of burning fire in cold rationality. (Xiang translated from the Nishigun Asahi Shimbun on June 16)

Fourth Phase of Rationed Oil: Sales to Begin Separately in Each District
Sales to Begin Tomorrow in Huxi and Other Districts, Delay of Several Days for the Concession and Zhabei

The remaining concession and Zhabei districts will have to wait for the arrival of raw oil before sales can begin, which should be available for general sale in about three to five days. The sales method for this time is as follows: (1) The Public Concession and Hongkou will require the spring property tax receipt and the resident certificate for cohabiting family members. (2) The French Concession will require the March-April property tax receipt and the identity residence certificate for cohabiting family members. (3) Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, and Pudong will require the household registration certificate, house number certificate, and the residence certificate for cohabiting family members. (4) This phase limits each person to four taels, based on the number of people listed on the back of the property tax receipt or the number of people listed on the household registration certificate. Regardless of the number of people in each household, it should be purchased all at once and distributed equally, and there must be no withholding. Merchants buying oil should verify the weight in person. (5) Daily oil sales hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. This phase will sell two types of oil: soybean oil and raw oil. Prices remain the same. Soybean oil is 20.04 yuan per market catty, 5.1 yuan per four taels, and raw oil is 21.42 yuan per market catty, 5.355 yuan per four taels.

Strict Crackdown on Black Market Cooking Oil

The city's edible oil trade association has recently reported that black market cooking oil prices have soared. However, an investigation reveals that the Cooking Oil Trade Wholesale Association's supply has increased without decrease, and the retail price has not changed. The black market price has exceeded the ration price by more than double, which is clearly being manipulated by non-industry speculators. The association, in accordance with its responsibilities, strictly prohibits members from engaging in the black market and has issued a notice that all oil stocks must be registered in order to eradicate the black market.

Rationed Sugar Sales Begin at Four Locations Yesterday

Sales of the fourth phase of rationed sugar began yesterday (the 26th). Half a catty of white sugar can be purchased with a certificate for 2.35 yuan.

As for the fourth phase of sugar rations in the Huxi district, sales have been delayed until today due to the sugar certificate stamping procedures of the district rationing authorities being incomplete. At that time, citizens will be able to purchase sugar with the fourth-phase sugar purchase certificate, half a catty per person, priced at 2.35 yuan.

"Shen Bao" Cup Basketball Charity Tournament Opens Yesterday: China Youth Defeats West Youth, Score 21 to 18
Second Game Tonight at 8 PM
Mr. Ding Huikang Purchases Charity Ball for 2,000 Yuan

The "Shen Bao" Cup North China Disaster Relief Basketball Tournament, co-organized by the China Youth Association and this newspaper to provide urgent relief to disaster victims in North China, began yesterday (the 26th) at the China Youth Gymnasium in Eight Immortals Bridge. Three consecutive games will be held. Yesterday was the first game. The highlights are recorded below:

Unprecedented Grand Occasion for the Game

The game began at 8:00 PM last night amidst a heated atmosphere. The China Youth gymnasium was filled with people, and the audience was so large that there were no empty seats. Those who arrived later could not find a foothold. The grand opening of the battle was unveiled with a solemn opening ball ceremony by Mr. Lu Ganchen, Executive Secretary of the China Youth Association. After intense battles between the Chinese and Western Youth teams, a tense situation formed, culminating in a climax in the last five minutes, which was extremely stimulating. In the end, the Chinese Youth team, with tacit cooperation, turned the tide from an absolute disadvantage and achieved a final victory with a score of 21 to 18. In the first half, the Western Youth team took the lead with a score of 7 to 10.

Audiences Compete to Purchase Charity Balls

During the break, charity balls were auctioned off, personally presided over by Mr. Chen Binhe, President of "Shen Bao". Starting from 1,000 yuan, the price soared in an instant. Finally, Dr. Ding Huikang, in commemoration of his father, Mr. Ding Fubao's 70th birthday, purchased it for the highest price of 22,000 yuan to benefit the disaster victims. His benevolence is admirable. The second battle will be held at the same venue at 8:00 PM tonight. The Western Youth team will do their best to avenge their loss, while the Chinese Youth team will give them a head-on blow to maintain their victory honor. The excitement and tension will be even greater than last night. Yesterday, hundreds of people were unable to enter because the tickets were sold out early. If you want to feast your eyes tonight, you must get there early. In addition to the game tonight, charity balls will continue to be auctioned off. We hope people from all walks of life will actively participate!

Western Youth's Individual Advantages

With a whistle from referees Zhou Jiaqi and Liu Hezhu, the Chinese and Western teams began to make contact. The Chinese Youth's offensive was strong. Ma Shuoxi took the lead, and Yu Xunzi followed with a long shot, scoring four points in a row, and the momentum was overwhelming. After a hard fight, Foneik broke the deadlock for the Western Youth team, barely scoring two points. However, Yu Xunzi immediately made another free throw, still taking the lead with a score of 5 to 2. Unexpectedly, in no time, the Western Youth team saw a turning point. Foneik's side shot was successful, and Sarski added another free throw, immediately tying the score at 5 to 5. The Chinese Youth team repeatedly missed their shots, taking a very long time. Kezmirov broke through in the center, and Bort also took advantage of the opportunity when the Chinese Youth team changed players and the formation was loose, and succeeded with a side shot. When Sarski made a free throw, the Western Youth team took the lead with 10 to 5. When Zhang Jinxuan succeeded under the basket, the break time had arrived, and the Chinese Youth team trailed with a score of 7 to 10.

China Youth Finally Wins

As the enthusiastic charity ball auction tide fell, the exciting battle resumed. Zhang Jinxuan put the ball in under the basket, and Bort retaliated in the same way. Xunzi's shot brought the score to a close situation of 11 to 12. Unexpectedly, the Western Youth's offense suddenly became active again, and Taublinji and Sarski scored again in succession, adding four points. The Chinese Youth team urgently adjusted their strength and Wu Chengzhang entered the field, while Zhuo Guorong stepped down. As soon as the adjustment was made, the momentum really improved. However, after Tang Xuesheng's long shot was successful, the shot again repeatedly failed, and the front line was calm for no less than three or four minutes. However, after Sarski's free throw made the score 17 to 13, the battle situation changed again. The Western Youth's momentum slightly weakened, while the Chinese Youth took advantage of the wind and waves and swept down in one fell swoop. Zhang Jinxuan's wonderful shooting forced the Western Youth to call a timeout. Tang Xuesheng's basket side shot made the score a tie at 17 to 17. At this time, there were only five minutes left until the end of the game. The most intense climax erupted at this moment. Zhang and Wu of the Chinese Youth team successively scored baskets, taking the lead with 21 to 17. In order to save the situation, the Western Youth team launched a fierce counterattack. However, Foneik, Taublinji, and Kezmirov repeatedly missed their shots. Even if they once called a timeout in the last minute and a half, it did not help. Although Kezi made a free throw, the whistle also sounded, and the Chinese Youth team won with a score of 21 to 18.

Economic Commentary:
Two Organizations Urgently Needed by Trade Associations

Recently, various trade associations have been reorganized and established one after another. At the same time, the joint associations of various industries have been declared established under the guidance of the Commercial Integration Association, completing the organization of a unified economy. This is undoubtedly a major event for the industrial and commercial sectors. However, the main purpose of trade association organizations is to seek the development of the industry and promote technological improvements, not to operate for personal gain, seize power, or make private plans. Those who work in trade association positions have obligations but no rights, responsibilities but no private benefits. All the past bad habits of fighting for power and profit must never be tolerated today, so as not to tarnish the unified economy. For today's trade associations, there are many things that should be done, such as reorganizing the membership, rectifying industry regulations, carefully selecting office personnel, and researching association affairs programs, all of which are urgent tasks. What is especially important is to quickly establish two committees:

(1) Investigation and Design Committee
All the profits and losses, advances and retreats of the industry, as well as the internal and difficult situations, should be investigated in advance as a basis for designing improvements. As for design matters, there are thousands of ends and myriads of threads. The main goal is to seek the welfare of the industry and assist the government in promoting the unified economic program. It is also advisable to recruit specialized talents from within and outside the membership to preside over the investigation and design, or to be entrusted by industry members to wholeheartedly serve the industry at any time, excluding selfishness. This is the responsibility that each trade association should have today, especially the Federation of Trade Associations, which is larger in scale and has more talents. This organization should not be regarded as a slow plan.

(2) Technical Committee
Whether the business of each member's factory can progress or not largely depends on technology. Therefore, to guide the industry's manufacturing improvement, it is necessary to recruit specialized technicians from within or outside the industry to organize a technical committee to preside over the industry's technological advancement. All changes in styles, substitutes for raw materials, improvements in work efficiency, as well as the renewal of machinery, energy conservation, etc., should be earnestly guided and facilitated for members, so that the industry's manufacturing technology can be improved day by day. This is a work that the industry association cannot shirk and should be carried out as soon as possible, so as not to fail the main purpose of establishing the association.

Shanghai Special City Bank Association Held a General Meeting Yesterday
Wu Zhenxiu, Tang Shoumin, and others were elected as directors
Wu Weiru, Huang Yuzai, and others were elected as supervisors

In order to adapt to the wartime financial system, the Shanghai Banking Industry Trade Association held its 13th general meeting of members' representatives at its office at 519 Hong Kong Road at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 26th), in compliance with the provisions of the current Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations and the detailed rules for implementation. Qian Xianting, chief inspector of the Criminal Special High Section of the Central Police Department of the Public Concession, Zong Zhongpei, specialist of the Municipal Finance Bureau, and 401 representatives of 153 member companies attended the meeting. After Mr. Wu Yunzhai, the original executive committee member of the association, was publicly elected as the chairman to deliver the opening speech, Secretary-General Kang Hou reported on the association's affairs and read the proposed amendments to the articles of association. The application for membership by the four banks, including Jin Kangchangxing China Qi Gong Zhonghua Industrial, was approved. The election of directors and supervisors was held, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The newly elected directors and supervisors immediately convened the first joint meeting and took the oath of office. The details are recorded below:

Association Affairs Report

First, Chairman Wu delivered the opening speech, clarifying the significance of convening this general meeting of members and the preparation process of reorganization in accordance with the order. It was decided to follow the current industrial and commercial laws promulgated by the government authorities and to change the previous committee system to the election of directors and supervisors. He hoped that all members of the industry would cooperate and jointly maintain the association's affairs, seek welfare for the industry, and serve the society. Then, Secretary-General Lin Kanghou reported on the association's affairs, saying:

Since the 12th regular meeting of this association was held on June 29, 26th year of the Republic, six years have passed. Only one temporary general meeting of members was convened last year in February for the declaration of new members. In the past six years, the world situation has changed, and I am now feeling emotional. Speaking of financial affairs, the industry has repeatedly changed its course with the changes of the times, and what has been experienced is especially complicated. In this dangerous earthquake, this association has always aimed at seeking the welfare of the industry, supplemented the deficiencies, and made every effort to do so. Fortunately, since the incident, the association's affairs have never been interrupted for a single day, which can be told to all members. The progress of the association's affairs from the second half of the 26th year to the 30th year had its own importance at that time, but it will no longer be described in detail. After December 8 of that year, the world situation changed abruptly. The silver and money industry was aware of the current changes in the situation. It was not enough to overcome the difficulties by increasing the strength of the group. Therefore, the original organizations of the silver and money associations were linked together to form a temporary joint committee of the silver and money industry. At that time, warehouses were closed, finance was disordered, the market could not avoid chaos, and members of the industry had nowhere to turn. Therefore, the meeting negotiated and compromised, day and night. The matter was complicated and the responsibility was heavy, which was almost unparalleled. After several months, there was a clue, but soon the voice of currency reform was overwhelming. The scale of its involvement was far from comparable to the past abolition of taels and the implementation of the legal currency policy. Before the event, this association and various public relations still held the purpose of knowing everything and saying everything, and never failed to contribute to the authorities. Until the end of May, the currency reform was determined, and the market situation was slightly quiet. The internal procedures of the silver and money industry were changed, and everything was handled by the joint association. In order to have something to follow, the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions were promulgated, including the payment of reserve funds for fixed and current deposits, and the deadline for supplementary registration. They were all major events for the silver and money industry itself, and they were handled in order, and the tax was reported to a stage. During this period, prices soared, and the number of emerging banks and money shops increased day by day. Although the situation is different now and in the past, the review and adjustment of their own business by the silver and money industry is still urgent. Therefore, the "New Measures for Loans in the Silver and Money Industry" was formulated, and the industry was notified to strictly abide by the measures. Within the restrictions, the purpose of promoting the production industry was to bring the wandering to the right track, so as to meet the authorities' intention to stabilize people's livelihood and suppress prices. To sum up, only the most important things are mentioned. Other things, such as the upper part of the damaged banknotes in January of the 31st year, refused to accept them, resulting in many disputes. It was not possible to entrust the joint preparatory committee to collect and redeem them on behalf of them, so as to make a transitional wave. Once summarized, the matter was settled. By the end of May, the total number of redemptions by the association reached more than 40 million yuan. In April of the same year, the market one yuan was suddenly in short supply, and the scattered receipts and payments were very inconvenient, which indirectly promoted the increase in the cost of living of ordinary people. Therefore, the Central Reserve Bank was also asked to provide as much assistance as possible to gradually stabilize the situation. Recently, in order to meet the needs of commercial trends, a small group meeting was organized to discuss the promotion of commercial acceptance bills and other businesses, and there are quasi-plans and multiple lists. It is hoped that the industry will

### Ambassador Gu and Staff Discuss the Return of Shanghai Concessions; Concrete Consultations on Various Plans; Implementation Awaits Government Instructions

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese Ambassador to China Gu Zhengzhi recently returned to Japan to report on his duties and discussed important issues related to advancing policies towards China with government authorities. He returned to his post on the 22nd. On the 23rd, he respectfully paid his respects to Chairman Wang and reported on his discussions with government authorities during his return to Japan. He explained Prime Minister Tojo's declaration to fundamentally revise all Sino-Japanese treaties, and stated that the Japanese government, based on its policy towards China, decided to first begin the return of the Shanghai International Settlement to assist China in fulfilling its consistent commitment since joining the war. On the 24th and 25th, Ambassador Gu held concrete consultations with Ministers Horinouchi and Tajiri, as well as representatives of the Japanese Army and Navy, regarding the return of the Shanghai International Settlement and various plans. Implementation will commence as soon as instructions are received from the government. It is noted that the Shanghai International Settlement has long been a base for British and American aggression against China. Since the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing, China has suffered under the control of Britain and the United States for a century. After China joined the war, the Japanese government, in order to express its sincere goodwill towards China, decided to return this base of British and American aggression to China. This is truly an unprecedented event in Chinese history. Henceforth, the Shanghai International Settlement will be able to restore its original appearance, sweep away the past British and American influences, and advance on the path of new development in East Asia, which is truly cause for celebration.

Policy Priorities After the Return

Central News Agency, this city - The Shanghai International Settlement, a base for Britain and the United States to exploit and invade China for a century, will soon be taken over by the National Government, and the remaining forces of Britain and the United States can be completely eliminated. As for the new form of governance and administration of the Shanghai Special Municipality after the return of the International Settlement, it is reported that it can be divided into five points: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement will be abolished, and a district office will be established under the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to govern the Nanshi, Huxi, and central districts of Shanghai. (2) Except for institutions related to hygiene and education, which may still exist, the rest will be fundamentally reformed, and the police organization will also be reorganized. (3) All existing treaties of the Shanghai International Settlement will be completely abolished, but some laws concerning private property rights will remain temporarily in effect. (4) After the Shanghai International Settlement is recovered, it may also be under the jurisdiction of the central district office. (5) After the Shanghai concessions are recovered, the administrative functions of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government will naturally expand, so it is expected that the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government will be adjusted to include Chongming Island, with the central district as the central administrative area.

Ambassador Gu's Remarks to Reporters

Another report - Since returning to his post, Japanese Ambassador to China Gu Zhengzhi has been extremely busy negotiating with the National Government on the return of the Shanghai International Settlement and promoting the implementation of new policies towards China. On the morning of the 26th, he met with reporters again to explain his firm belief in handling Sino-Japanese relations, which lasted for an hour and a half. The gist of his remarks was that Sino-Japanese relations today are no longer empty talk, but about implementation. Japan's decision to return the Shanghai International Settlement this time is based on this belief. The issue of abolishing extraterritoriality, which is still under negotiation, is also expected to be realized soon. The issue of taxation, which is planned to be resolved first, can be completed within one or two months. In short, my intention is to eliminate all discussions, vigorously implement the new treaty, and study other issues, such as establishing a system for Chinese youth to study in Japan, which is one example. The current study abroad system is not suitable, so it cannot achieve any results. Therefore, a detailed plan should be established before sending students abroad, and the future destination of the students should be determined so that they can study in Japan with peace of mind. A cultural agreement can be concluded in the future, and I plan to discuss this issue with the National Government in the near future. Furthermore, Prime Minister Tojo stated in his speech in the Diet that the agreements between China and Japan should be fundamentally revised. I also believe that new agreements should be concluded with full sincerity within the possible scope. Regarding this point, I am willing to do my best to promote its early realization after obtaining the opinions of the Chinese and Japanese authorities.

### Revised Tax Laws in Mengjiang

Zhangjiakou, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Mengjiang authorities, in order to adapt to the current economic situation and the needs of the current situation, have decided to revise four types of tax laws: commodity tax, livestock tax, production tax, and unified tax. It is scheduled to be implemented from July 1st. It is reported that according to this revised tax law, tax revenue for this year can be increased by approximately six million yuan.

### Telephone Service Between Beijing and Baoding

Baoding, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The long-distance telephone line between Beijing and Baoding has been completed, and the first call was made at 4:00 PM on the 21st.

### Order

National Government Order (June 26, 32nd year of the Republic) - The Provisional Regulations for Punishing Acts Disrupting Economic Control in North China are hereby promulgated.

### Reorganization of the "Little Four Banks"; Ministry of Finance Promulgates Guidelines; First Directors and Supervisors Already Appointed

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Siming Commercial Savings Bank, the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, the China Industrial Bank, and the China National Products Bank, commonly known as the "Little Four Banks." Among them, the China General Chamber of Commerce and Siming Banks were established in the late Qing Dynasty, with a long history. The China Industrial Bank was established in the 7th year of the Republic and operates other banking businesses in addition to commercial banking. The above three banks were originally commercially operated. In the 25th and 26th years of the Republic, government shares were successively added, and they became banks jointly operated by government and commerce. The China National Products Bank was established in the 18th year of the Republic and has been jointly operated by government and commerce since its inception, as a bank to promote national products. Now that the situation has changed, all government shares of these four banks should be taken over by the National Government, and whether the old commercial shares have enemy relations should also be adjusted separately. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has decided to reorganize the four banks, formulated guidelines for handling them, appointed the first directors and supervisors, and ordered the four banks to comply. The above guidelines and the list of directors and supervisors are specially recorded below:

Guidelines for Handling the Siming, China General Chamber of Commerce, China Industrial, and China National Products Banks.

In order to strengthen financial institutions in Central China, the National Government, after reorganizing the Central and Communications Banks, will continue to reorganize the Siming, China General Chamber of Commerce, China Industrial, and China National Products Banks. The purpose is to completely eliminate the Chongqing faction influence from each bank and make them purely commercial banks. Therefore, the guidelines for handling them are as follows:

(1) The total capital of each of the four banks is set at four million national currency, fully paid up, which will be offset by the net assets of each bank in the peaceful area. (2) Old commercial shareholders of the four banks shall apply for registration of the number of shares they hold within six months. Only those who are identified as having no enemy relations or having severed enemy relations shall be given new shares of the same amount according to the number of old shares. The aforementioned identification shall be carried out by the National Government's Enemy Property Management Committee. Old commercial shareholders who do not apply for registration within six months shall be deemed to have waived their rights. (3) Enemy-related abandoned shares among the Chongqing faction's government and commercial shares shall be taken over by the National Government and transferred to the Central Reserve Bank free of charge. The Central Reserve Bank may sell them to merchants and people at the appropriate time, and the profits from the sale shall be paid to the National Government. (4) Assets and liabilities in the property of the four banks that are identified as having enemy relations shall be separately transferred to the Enemy Property Management Committee for management, and the rest shall be inherited by the board of directors of each bank at an appropriate price. The aforementioned identification shall still be carried out by the Enemy Property Management Committee. (5) The staff of the four banks after the reorganization shall be mainly those without the Chongqing faction influence, and the Ministry of Finance shall consider appropriate candidates to be responsible for the operation. The first directors and supervisors shall be appointed by the Ministry of Finance, and at least one of the supervisors of each bank shall be appointed by an employee of the Central Reserve Bank. (6) After the reorganization, the four banks shall abolish the privilege of issuing exchange coupons and operate purely commercial banking businesses under the control of the Central Reserve Bank. The four banks shall temporarily set up head offices, branches, or offices in Shanghai, and may gradually set up branches and offices in other places when necessary. (7) After the reorganization of the four banks, they may obtain low-interest funds from the Central Reserve Bank if necessary for business operations. (8) All businesses during the transition period before the reorganization shall still be handled as usual by the important staff of each bank.

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After intense battles for positions between German and Soviet forces west of Moscow, the fighting has spread to the Staraya Russa area south of Lake Ilmen on the 25th. Soviet forces launched a large-scale attack southwest of the area, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat with German forces. According to frontline German sources, the Soviet objective appears to be to recapture the strategically important railway line from Leningrad through Dno west of Staraya Russa to Vitebsk. After a long period of bloody fighting, Soviet forces once penetrated German positions, but German main forces, reinforced by dive bombers and tank units, ultimately repulsed the Soviet forces. On the southern front, fierce fighting continues around Lisichansk. According to a United Press report from Moscow, German forces appear to have broken through Soviet positions again, but their subsequent movements are unclear. According to a German news agency reporter, Soviet forces have repeatedly accumulated large armies west and southwest of Moscow, especially since the 24th. They appear to be awaiting final orders from the Moscow High Command before launching an attack, and the situation is extremely tense. German forces in the area have completed preparations to crush the Soviet forces.

It is learned that in order to thoroughly clarify the true meaning of building Greater East Asia in terms of economic relations with China, Greater East Asia Minister Aoki recently visited Osaka to hold discussions with the Kinki branch of the Sino-Japanese Economic Roundtable and related parties in the southern economy. Furthermore, it is learned that senior personnel within the Greater East Asia Ministry will be mobilized to explain the government's policies to various regions and invite cooperation from the private sector. After the Japanese government launched a new policy towards China, it convened a roundtable meeting on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation at the Prime Minister's official residence on March 29th to frankly exchange views, which had a great effect on promoting economic cooperation between China and Japan. Therefore, the decision that senior executives such as Greater East Asia Minister Aoki will go to various regions as necessary to establish close contact with private organizations is of great significance for popularizing the concept of building Greater East Asia and quickly implementing various measures. Therefore, the results are deeply worthy of anticipation.
