### Kursk, Sicily, and the South Pacific

The calm before the storm has finally ended, and the summer offensive of 1943 has already begun. As we predicted, the war in Europe has first erupted on the German-Soviet battlefield. On July 5th, a large-scale battle centered on the Kursk battlefield began. Although the German side claims that the war was initiated by the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union claims it was initiated by the German side, the initiator is irrelevant to the future of the war. Given the current international situation, Germany does have an initiative advantage and has already broken through enemy lines in several locations, seizing several key strongholds. This has been acknowledged by the Soviet side. The trend of the war is now in full swing, and we are unable to make accurate inferences based on scattered battles. Considering the nearly half-year preparation by both sides and their cautious attitude in combat operations and official war reports, it is conceivable that this year's war will be the most arduous and the most difficult to win in the short term for either side. They are bound to undergo the longest hard struggle. On the German side, based on the experience of the summer offensives in 1941 and 1942, they will certainly not regard territorial gains as victory but will focus their combat efforts on annihilating the Red Army's combat power, while also striving to use political warfare to assist military warfare to achieve decisive results. Of course, on the Soviet side, they are still attempting to delay the war until winter arrives. Therefore, they may still be trying to avoid large-scale battles. However, the Axis powers are certainly aware of this strategy. Judging from the German force in the Kursk front, which is as large as the force used to capture Stalingrad last year, the Red Army will be forced to concentrate their forces to be annihilated. Therefore, whether the Red Army's above-mentioned attempt can be realized is still a big question.

Not long after the arduous battle on the German-Soviet battlefield began, Soviet public opinion expressed its final and most blatant protest against the failure of Britain and the United States to open a second front in a timely manner. At the same time, the Soviet ambassador to Britain, Maisky, hurriedly returned home, and American public opinion rose up against Roosevelt and Churchill. Strike movements became serious again. Amidst this chorus of criticism, the anti-Axis military authorities hastily launched the landing operation on Sicily. Fierce fighting is taking place in the southeastern corner of Sicily. The Axis forces are taking advantage of their air superiority to strike at the support units and transport ships of the British, American, and Canadian landing forces. If the anti-Axis forces cannot maintain their supply lines, then the annihilation of the landing forces will naturally be only a matter of time. Now, the world's attention may, in addition to Sicily, also be focused on other parts of the northern Mediterranean coast. Alternatively, some people worry about whether any accidents will occur in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. However, if one considers the strength of the anti-Axis forces – especially their manpower and support capabilities – it can be said that this worry is unfounded. Moreover, on the other side of the issue, we must also see the defensive strength of the Axis powers. Are Britain and the United States so foolish as to risk their national fortunes on a single gamble and truly open a "second front" in Western Europe? This remains doubtful, because attacking fortified positions has been avoided as much as possible in the military histories of Britain and the United States.

The decisive force in the war mainly depends on the Axis powers' rear, the current state of total mobilization of manpower and materials, and whether its future development can meet the new needs of future war developments. The most fundamental element is whether the military industrial productivity can have the upper hand. In this regard, based on the current situation, the Axis powers occupy a great advantage. If the future war in Europe develops in the northwest, west, or southeast, from a geographical point of view, it can also be asserted that the future situation will favor the Axis powers. This is because, once the troops of Britain, the United States, and Canada land anywhere in Europe, their consumption of personnel and ammunition will be several times higher than the defense side, according to general war experience, and the urgency of their need for replenishment goes without saying. Assuming that Britain, the United States, Canada, and North Africa have considerable replenishment capabilities (it seems that Britain and the United States have been working hard on this in the past six months), the most serious problem still lies in ocean transportation. Not long ago, in June, Churchill admitted in his first report after returning to Britain from the United States that the main content of future operations is still anti-submarine warfare, which shows his anxiety about the supply problem once they land in Europe. On the Axis side, it is completely the opposite. They can boldly open the rat-catching bag without fearing it will not go deep! Because the war is being waged in Europe, why worry that European manpower and resources will not be used to defend Europe?

What cannot be ignored is the war in the Pacific. Around the German-Soviet front and the Sicily landing, the Australian and American forces in and around Australia launched a "counter-offensive" against New Guinea and the surrounding islands. This stirring can, to some extent, be exaggerated as the prelude to a major Pacific counter-offensive, or, in reality, it is only a disruptive guerrilla warfare, attempting to use an "offensive" to hinder Japan's possible new offensive, taking advantage of the tense situation in Europe. Considering that the "counter-offensive" targets of the anti-Axis forces are particularly focused on islands within the outer perimeter of Australia, it can be clearly seen that the above-mentioned second strategic assessment is correct. To be honest, although the United States has placed the largest part of its national military strength and almost all of its naval power in the Pacific, and although it has boasted about preparations for a total Pacific counter-offensive in all international military and diplomatic talks, in reality, it has not regained its confidence in a victorious counter-offensive since the severe blow suffered in the Pearl Harbor attack. Therefore, their recent disturbances in the Pacific are no more than an act of inner weakness, completely passive and negative. However, does this mean that East Asians do not need to be more vigilant against the enemy today? That is absolutely necessary. Always standing in a proactive and superior position, and striking the enemy without losing the opportunity, is the strategic center of defending East Asia and also the basic requirement for realizing the Axis world strategy. At a time when Prime Minister Tojo of our friendly nation was in charge of all affairs of state, he personally visited Nanyang, Malaya, Thailand, Burma, and the Philippines for the second time to assist the independence efforts of Burma and the Philippines, and the Indian independence movement centered on Chandra Bose, establishing a second anti-British front in West Asia. These new developments can explain that as the storm in Europe begins to shake people's hearts, the liberation movements of the Eastern nations will embark on a new stage, and the total collapse of the Anglo-American imperialist forces should be at its core.

### Naval Battle off Kolombangara Island: Three American Cruisers Sunk. Daytime Bombing of Rentepao Port and New Georgia Island: Great War Results Achieved by Japanese Naval and Air Forces

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 13th: (1) After the enemy forces landed in several locations on New Georgia Island on July 5th, they advanced toward Munda from both the north and south. The Japanese garrison is bravely counterattacking. (2) In response to this, the Japanese naval mine warfare squadron engaged with more than four enemy cruisers that had moved toward that area during operations in the waters north of Kolombangara Island on the night of the 12th. Two of the cruisers were sunk and one was damaged, causing them to retreat. (3) One Japanese cruiser was heavily damaged. (Note) This naval battle is called the Night Battle of Kolombangara Island.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 12:30 PM on the 13th: Japanese naval aviation units attacked Rentepao Port on July 9th, engaging 20 enemy aircraft. As a result, five were shot down and six landing craft were sunk. On July 11th, joint formations of fighter and bomber aircraft attacked enemy forces landing in the northwest of New Georgia Island, engaging 40 enemy "P.38" fighter aircraft. Twenty-four were shot down, while three Japanese aircraft failed to return.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – An authoritative source here said: After the American forces in the Solomon Islands landed on Rentepao Island on June 30th, in an attempt to seize New Georgia Island adjacent to that island, they landed not only on Rubiana Island in the southeast of New Georgia Island and several other locations, but also attempted to land north of Kula Gulf. One had already landed at Billoko in Rice Bay and was advancing, intending to attack the Japanese base at Munda from both the north and south. However, since July 5th, the Japanese army and navy garrison units have suddenly taken the counter-offensive, and Japanese aircraft have been dispatched to assist in the battle. At the moment, the American and Japanese sides are continuing to engage in fierce fighting in that area. At the same time, the Japanese mine warfare squadron, in cooperation with the army and navy, had already sunk and damaged enemy cruisers, destroyers and special service ships, a total of six ships, in the Kula Gulf night battle on the 4th and 5th, achieving great results. Now, on the night of the 12th, in the north of Kolombangara Island. Again, they encountered four American cruisers that had been dispatched to protect the landing of boats, and immediately engaged in a fierce night battle with them, launching torpedoes to attack the enemy ships. Three enemy cruisers were sunk and another cruiser was hit by a torpedo and caught fire. It fled in panic. In this battle, one Japanese cruiser was damaged, which proves the intensity of the night battle on the sea off Kolombangara Island.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The air war in the southwestern Pacific is becoming increasingly fierce. On July 9th, during the day, the Japanese naval aviation units again used joint large formations of fighter and bomber aircraft to bomb the heavily guarded Rentepao Port, engaging in a fierce aerial battle with enemy fighters guarding inside and outside the port. As a result, five enemy aircraft were shot down, and bombs were dropped to bombard the landing craft parked in the port, sinking six of them. On July 11th, the same large formation continued to attack New Georgia Island, fiercely bombing the enemy forces landing on the northwest coast of the island, in the area of Tons Bay, north of Billoko. These enemy forces had already suffered heavy damage in the night battle of Kula Gulf. After this bombing, the losses were considerable. Japanese aircraft also engaged 40 enemy "P.38" Vought Sikorsky fighter aircraft in a reconnaissance battle, shooting down twenty-four of them, achieving great results. Three Japanese aircraft have not yet returned.

Chairman Ogura Delivers a Speech. Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese economic delegation paid a long visit to General Commander Hata of the Japanese Expeditionary Force Headquarters at 2:20 PM yesterday (13th), before departing. At 3:30 PM, they met with reporters at the Capital Hotel and expressed their impressions after arriving in China. Chairman Ogura answered the reporters' questions on current Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in great detail. The main points are as follows: (Question) The Japanese economic delegation stayed in Shanghai for many days and held talks with various parties. What were the contents and what were the gains? What are your impressions of China's economic situation after the war? (Answer) Our delegation first visited Shanghai and held talks with local government officials, people, and financial circles, and gained a lot. The content was nothing more than discussing how to strengthen Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. China's economic situation after the war is showing a revival phenomenon, which is more cooperative for the future of the Greater East Asia War. (Question) What are your views on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation? (Answer) Under the wartime system, if we want to win the war, we must strengthen our combat power. The prerequisite for strengthening combat power is to strengthen economic power. Japan launched the war to destroy the British and Americans, and China also continued to participate in the war. During this war, it is necessary to strengthen economic power. It is not enough to rely on Japan alone, so it is also necessary to strengthen China's economic power. In strengthening combat power, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is the easiest to achieve. Not only China, but also all countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must have economic cooperation. The exchange of rice from Vietnam and Thailand with materials from Central and Southern China, if realized, can be effective. What is urgently needed now is the issue of ship transportation. (Question) Sino-Japanese economic cooperation focuses on the exchange of materials between China and Japan. What are your good methods for the exchange of materials between China and Japan? (Answer) China has many abundant wartime materials and also has those in great need. The same is true in Japan, so the exchange of materials between China and Japan is necessary. The Japanese authorities are currently seriously considering this and will implement it fully within the possible scope. (Question) What is the current state of affairs of the East Asia Economic Symposium? (Answer) The mission of the Economic Symposium is quite important. In the future, we must make the meeting more active in order to achieve its important mission.

### German Forces Achieve Strategic Success on the Eastern Front; Soviet Flank Attack Stopped

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – Today's communique from the German High Command states: Under the cover of the Luftwaffe, the German forces have achieved further progress north of Belgorod after defeating two large groups of Soviet tank corps. The counter-offensive of the Soviet infantry and tank units and the fierce attacks in the east and north of Orel have collapsed, with heavy losses. Yesterday, German forces destroyed another 400 Soviet tanks. At the same time, 103 enemy aircraft were shot down by German anti-aircraft artillery.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – A military correspondent for the Huitong News Agency declared: The intensity of the fighting in the Belgorod and Orel areas has increased during the past week, but has not yet reached its peak. The Soviet offensive power has weakened, but its resistance is still quite strong. The German forces have not yet achieved a decisive victory in the immediate future, but the German offensive is strategically important and does not rush for quick progress. The biggest goal at present is to eliminate the Soviet salient area in the Kursk direction. According to the Soviet forces in that area, they had planned an offensive, so the concentration of troops and military supplies was very strong. The Soviet side originally intended to launch an offensive at the same time as the British and American offensive in Sicily, so as to inflict a major blow on the Axis powers. Now, this plan has been broken by the German offensive. The German command knew its intentions and made a plan to contain the enemy forces, forcing the troops that were originally intended to be used for the offensive to switch to the defensive. Therefore, the German operation in Kursk has now completed its greatest task. Those who are unaware may think that the Battle of Kursk is only of secondary significance. But strategically, the German command is already satisfied with the current results. Although the enemy claims that our losses are heavy, they do not know that their losses are actually greater than ours. In the first five days of the battle, Soviet General Vikosovky tried his best to send tank corps from both the east and west to outflank the German armored vanguard, attempting to cut off its retreat. However, the German command had already anticipated this and adopted a completely new defensive strategy, applying new weapons to resist tanks, severely damaging the attacking Soviet tank forces. According to the German announcement yesterday, more than 1,640 Soviet tanks have been destroyed. Last weekend, the Soviet army used its remaining tank units to launch a positional war to block the momentum of the German vanguard, causing the German advance from Belgorod to slow down slightly, but it did not come to a standstill. The German military’s “attrition” strategy can be said to have been successful. The Soviet flank attack had to stop. According to the German communique on the 12th, the Soviet army lost a total of 1,400 cannons. The combat operation itself was affected, but the Soviet strength south of Orel is still very strong.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – German authorities announced on the 12th: The results achieved by the German forces in the Orel area since the 5th are as follows: 24,000 enemy soldiers captured, 1,540 enemy tanks seized and destroyed, and 14,000 guns and cannons captured.

### Tang Yinghuang Discusses Adjusting Judicial Administration: A Plan for Innovation After the Recovery of Concessions

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - To understand the judicial situation after the recovery of concessions, this reporter visited Vice Minister Tang of the Judicial Administration Department. He graciously received me and engaged in a question-and-answer discussion, as follows:

(Question) After the abolition of extraterritoriality, will there be reforms to China's judicial system? (Answer) Reforming the judicial system has always been a government policy. Since Minister Luo took office, he has been working hard to promote it. The reform plan does not begin only with the abolition of extraterritoriality. Improvements to the judicial system will be even more vigorous due to the recovery of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, so that the current system becomes more complete. (Question) What is the current state of court facilities in China? (Answer) The practice of county magistrates concurrently handling judicial matters is an abnormal system. The Ministry is determined to abolish county judicial offices and the concurrent handling of judicial affairs by county magistrates, and to establish district courts and their branches as soon as possible. This is being actively promoted and implemented. In the first phase, the following have been reorganized and established: the Jiading Branch of the Shanghai District Court, the Jiading Branch of the Shanghai District Procuratorate, the Taicang Branch of the Kunshan District Court, the Taicang Branch of the Kunshan District Procuratorate, the Shaoxing Branch of the Hang County District Court, the Shaoxing Branch of the Hang County District Procuratorate, the Haining Tribunal of the Hang County District Court, the Dangtu Tribunal of the Wuhu District Court, etc. Other counties where district courts or branches are to be established will be promoted in stages in the near future to cope with the abolition of extraterritoriality. (Question) After the complete abolition of extraterritoriality, will all foreign-related litigation cases be handled by Chinese courts? (Answer) Of course, they will be handled by our courts. The Provisional Regulations on the Exercise of Jurisdiction over Foreigners' Litigation have been drafted and are under review. (Question) How will the courts be adjusted after the recovery of the Shanghai concessions? (Answer) After the recovery of the concessions, Shanghai's judicial affairs should be handled by the local courts under a unified system. Prosecutors who have been unable to fully exercise their powers due to treaty restrictions over the years will be strengthened and invigorated under the dual circumstances of the return of the concessions and the expansion of the procuratorial system. (Question) Has our legal system reached a perfect stage? What new legal systems are planned to be drafted recently? (Answer) Our legal system is now largely complete, but some areas need to be added or revised. For example, the drafting of the Non-Litigation Event Procedures, the revision of the Law Application Regulations, and the translation of foreign laws are being carried out by a Law Compilation Committee specially established by the Ministry, which has hired expert members to conduct substantive reviews. (Question) What are the plans for foreign prisons? (Answer) The director of the Ministry's Prison Affairs Department inspected prisons in various places last month and has drafted a detailed plan. Shanghai and Hankou have been ordered to prepare prisons for foreigners. The Ministry has repeatedly and strictly improved the improvement of prisons, the improvement of prisoner life, the improvement of internal equipment, and the supervision of prisoner work. Considerable progress has been made. (Question) Are there any plans to improve the judicial police? (Answer) Since the reform of the procuratorial system, training judicial police has been the focus of the fundamental reorganization of the judiciary. Strict organization must be added to ensure flexible dispatch. Especially after the recovery of the Shanghai concessions, a sound judicial police force can cooperate with the administrative departments to become an important institution for maintaining social order.

### Japanese Military Achievements in Central and Southern Hebei

Shijiazhuang, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese army's mopping-up operations in central and southern Hebei are continuing.

The Japanese army seized 4 mortars, 1 heavy machine gun, 788 light machine guns, 1,681 rifles, and many other automatic rifles, pistols, hand grenades, and mortars.

### An Analysis of the American Race Problem

The recent incident of oppression of Black people in Detroit, the largest military industrial city in the United States, has indeed focused the world's attention. This is by no means an accidental event. The inconsistency of the so-called "cancer of the United States," the race problem, will inevitably erupt in such incidents when it touches the friction point of domestic disputes in the United States on the road to decisive battle. At the same time, it fully exposes the fundamental defects and contradictions of democracy without freedom, equality, and justice, as well as the insatiable ambition of Anglo-Saxon imperialism and the bestial barbarity of Americans. This is truly a noteworthy event.

The History of Oppressing Black People President Roosevelt has been racking his brains since this war to find a suitable war goal. Some say that this war is a war for democracy, a war for survival, and they have also raised the banner of fighting for four freedoms—namely, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom from terror, and freedom from want. But these are only superficially pleasing terms; in fact, they are means to satisfy the desires of the Anglo-Saxons themselves. Their so-called freedom, equality, and justice are denied to all other countries and all those who violate the interests of different races and their own countries. The incident of oppressing Black people is precisely this trick of the Americans burying their heads in the sand.

This riot occurred near the Detroit coast, originating from the murder of a young Black woman by a white man, which eventually escalated into a race war. It is reported that Roosevelt dispatched fully armed troops to gradually suppress it. However, the root of this problem can be traced back to the exclusive instinct inherent in American history from before the founding of the United States to the present.

There are now 13 million Black people in the United States, accounting for about one-tenth of the total population of 132 million. These Black people are the descendants of Black people who have been driven together by British and Americans since the early 17th century, using the same means as hunting wild beasts, and imported into the Americas as slaves. These indigenous people had shackles locked on their feet, two people were chained together, and they were transported to the Americas in slave ships. During the months of sailing, they were imprisoned in wooden cages on the deck and in the cabins, unable to move, and they relieved themselves on the spot. Therefore, many died of illness or went mad. Tens of thousands of people were transported to the Americas every year until 250 years later, when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1884. The total number of Black slaves in the United States was 4.5 million.

Slaves were unloaded in the New York harbor area and sold for tens to thousands of dollars per person. They were still chained, whipped, and forced to engage in cotton farming or other strenuous labor. All masters regarded them as cattle and horses. To prevent them from escaping, they often branded their own marks on the backs of Black people with iron. This fact alone is enough to deny the humanity of Americans. They have subjected Japanese, Chinese, Irish, German, Italian, Scandinavian, Slavic, Greek, and Mexican people who later immigrated to the United States to all kinds of torture, abuse, violence, and forced expulsion. History can prove this.

Driven into the Army and Factories Although Black people were legally emancipated from slavery during the era of President Lincoln in 1886, this was only a formality. They were only freed from shackles but were still subjected to the same abuse and oppression as slaves.

Let's look at two or three specific examples: First, the number of Black people who have been abused and killed by lynchings carried out by white mobs has reached more than 3,400. After the outbreak of this war, the Roosevelt government adopted various benevolent policies to alleviate the difficulty of human resources and strengthen domestic control, in order to promote the formation of Black troops or massively mobilize Black laborers to work in military production. For example, the US Navy recently announced that it would name a newly commissioned destroyer after Louis Harmon, a Black soldier who died in the Battle of Guadalcanal. However, this is only a nominal honor. Black people are subjected to absolute discrimination in the military, in military factories, and in general national life. Secretary of War Stimson once boasted that he would form a Black army of 900,000 people. The training these Black people receive is different from that of white troops, and their food and other treatment are extremely poor. They are often despised and excluded by white troops, and bloody tragedies often occur due to conflicts. On the battlefield, they are also driven to take on the most dangerous battles and areas. As a result, under the empty name of democracy, they become sacrifices for the white people.

Still Regarded as Slaves

The US Navy has never employed Black people. After the outbreak of this war, in order to make up for the shortage of personnel, it employed some Black people, but they were only assigned to lower-level tasks at naval bases and were not allowed to serve on ships with white people. In military factories, Black people are a powerful human resource, but white laborers are unwilling to work alongside Black people. Racial disputes are often heard everywhere. In March last year, a Black people oppression riot occurred in Detroit, and thousands of police officers were dispatched to suppress it. However, white people wanted to use violence to suppress the relocation of Black laborers and their families who were employed in military factories. Therefore, many labor organizations did not admit Black people as members. The largest labor organization in the United States, the A.F.L. (American Federation of Labor), openly excluded them. The general public's differential treatment of Black people is most evident in the low wages used to exploit Black people who engage in inferior manual labor. In daily social life, Black people are never allowed to sit at the same table in any situation. In the southern states with large Black populations, Black people are segregated or prohibited from entering all places such as cars, trams, buses, hotels, hospitals, theaters, cinemas, bars, toilets, schools, and libraries. In major cities from Washington to New York, Black people are not allowed to enter theaters, cinemas, hospitals, hotels, bars, dance halls, elevators, and other places where white people enter and exit. Even most Christian churches in the United States do not allow Black people to enter. Americans, who preach justice, freedom, and equality, even have such hypocritical behavior before God. Recently, the American Red Cross refused to accept condolence letters sincerely sent by Black people to army wounded soldiers' hospitals. The London magazine "New Statesman and Nation" published an article commenting on the American Black problem a few days ago, saying that the humiliation that the United States inflicts on Black people is causing increasing resentment among Black people. The United States is troubled and distressed in the war whirlpool it has brought upon itself. Taking advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, all 13 million Black people in the United States have awakened their national consciousness and resolutely raised the banner of liberation.

### German Planes Attack England

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a London dispatch, the German Air Force bombed eastern England on the night of the 12th.

### Top Communist Leaders Hold Emergency Meeting to Discuss Response to Chongqing's Demands

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to reliable sources: After the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Communist Party received the article from Chongqing (the Supreme National Defense Council) requesting that the Communist regime in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region be returned to Chongqing and that the 18th Group Army be transferred to another location, Mao Zedong, Lin Zuhan, Zhang Wentian, Qian Jiaji, and other top Communist leaders held consultations. As a result, it was decided to convene a temporary emergency meeting of the heads of the party, government, and military. Zhu De, Lin Biao, He Long, and other frontline Communist generals have all been summoned to Yan'an one after another. The top Communist leaders are aware of the seriousness of the situation, so they are proceeding with extreme caution. The final policy will be decided by a vote of all party members, so this move will determine the future fate of the Chinese Communist Party. In addition, Yan'an does not seem to have any specific expressions to Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo, and other Communist representatives stationed in Chongqing. In addition, the backbone of the Chinese Communist Party and the cadres of the Communist army, such as Zhu De, He Long, Lin Biao, Peng Dehuai, Liu Bocheng, and other Communist military cadres, admit that Chongqing's demands are not only intended to immediately eliminate the power of the Chinese Communist Party in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, but also to oppress the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the 18th Group Army. Therefore, the backbone of the Chinese Communist Party advocated rejecting Chongqing's demands and proposed counter-conditions to Chongqing (the Supreme National Defense Council). Moreover, the attitude of the Communist military cadres is even tougher, saying that if Chongqing uses military high-pressure tactics, they will not hesitate to sacrifice the national united front and resort to force. Judging from this situation, without waiting for the decision of the temporary emergency meeting of the Chinese Communist Party, it can be inferred that the Chinese Communist Party will refuse Chongqing's demands.

Beijing, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the dissolution of the Communist International, Chongqing immediately intensified its pressure on the Chinese Communist Party by air. According to recent news obtained from the local area, Chongqing's military pressure on the central area of the Chinese Communist Party, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, has greatly increased. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party suddenly felt embarrassed and took a confrontational stance against the Chongqing army with the Communist army in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Xiao Jinguang, the director of the rear guard of the 18th Group Army and the commander of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, also issued a telegram to the generals of the 8th War Zone of the Chongqing army who insisted on the encirclement, as follows: "It is rumored that Chongqing intends to launch a large-scale attack on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. However, at this time of national survival, another civil war will be launched. It is truly heartbreaking. For six years, the 18th Group Army has received no supplies. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is our only rear base. A small number of guards are responsible for defense work and engage in production and education. This is well known. Now, when a civil war is breaking out in the country, the future of the country and the nation is truly unthinkable. Domestic problems should be resolved by political methods. Therefore, it is hoped that all generals will seek a solution by peaceful means," etc., in order to alleviate Chongqing's oppression of the Chinese Communist Party. However, on the other hand, they are still instigating the Twenty-Four Banners and the Ordos League to launch a counter-offensive movement to disrupt the order in the rear. Judging from this, the full-scale struggle between Chongqing and the Communist Party in the northwestern border region may become increasingly fierce.

### Fierce Fighting on Sicily Continues: Axis Forces Recapture Airfield

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German High Command announced today: Fierce fighting is continuing on Sicily. The Axis air force is constantly participating in the ground battle and attacking the enemy's landing fleet off the coast of the island, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Twenty-five enemy planes were shot down over Sicily and Sardinia.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German authorities announced on the 12th: The German-Italian defense forces on Sicily severely attacked the British-American forces that landed on the southeast coast of the island on the afternoon of the 11th, inflicting heavy casualties. The Italian army also repelled the American forces that landed on the south coast and advanced westward to the coast. The anti-Axis forces only maintain their original positions in other locations. In order to continue the landing operations, the enemy must still dispatch a large number of reinforcements, but because the enemy did not benefit in the initial stage of the operation, even if they reinforce their forces to attack in the future, they will only be sacrificed in vain. In addition, the German authorities reiterated the battle situation on Sicily on the night of the 12th, saying that the area of the coastal area occupied by the anti-Axis forces on Sicily has been shrinking due to the fierce attacks of the Axis forces. From the overall situation of the war, after three days of fierce fighting, the area occupied by the anti-Axis forces is only a narrow coastal area in southeastern Sicily. The airborne troops are also completely unsupported and have abandoned their positions.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German authorities announced on the 12th: Since the 11th, the Axis forces on Sicily have dispatched superior forces to annihilate the anti-Axis parachute troops. By the 12th, they had occupied Gela Bay, a key area on the south coast of Sicily, recaptured the airfield occupied by the anti-Axis paratroopers, and annihilated two anti-Axis teams.

The Battle Situation in Two Days

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The military visitor of Haitong News Agency, Captain Saito Cox, declared: As of Monday afternoon, the news of the situation on Sicily obtained here knows that the war there is limited to a corner of the southeast. Furthermore, when the Axis forces attacked the southeast coast of Sicily, there were a total of two armies, one British army, responsible for capturing the cape of Cologne and Brazil, one American and assisted by Canadian troops to take charge of invading the beach from Licata to the Skaramy corner. The strategy of the British and Americans' action is to focus on a concentrated effort to encircle the German and Italian troops stationed in the southeast mountainous area of Sicily, or to force them to quickly retreat from the line of Arbarema Catania, so that the southeast part of the island has no German or Italian troops. According to the news of the situation on the island heard on Sunday afternoon, it can be seen that the anti-Axis forces are still very far from this goal. The British army has only been able to occupy a narrow coastal area from Syracuse to Brazil Cape, about five to ten kilometers in depth, and the American army has so far only been able to obtain a few bridgeheads as strongholds. On the weekend, these two anti-Axis armies attempted to quickly advance inland with the landed troops in order to meet with the paratroopers, but only a few paratroopers who landed near the coast succeeded. The majority of those who landed inland were annihilated by the Italian army.

Fierce Battles at Gela Port The defensive actions of the German and Italian reserve forces on Sunday are noteworthy. They encountered the advance of the British army five to ten kilometers from the coast, and the American army's advance was also severely damaged and forced to retreat to its bridgehead between Licata and Gela. On Monday morning, fierce battles broke out between the two sides for Gela Port. Judging from the situation at noon on Monday, the commander-in-chief of the British army fighting between the Cape of Cologne and Brazil Corner seemed to intend to maintain the area it occupied before continuing to advance, and to use the landed troops as cover to continuously transport tanks, heavy artillery, and new troops to the shore. It is estimated here that there are now about four divisions of British troops that have landed, and the number of American troops that have landed on the south coast has also reached two divisions, including one division of Canadian troops. Because of the disastrous defeat at Gela, they are adding reinforcements. The anti-Axis forces still have a large number of reserves, and they have not yet used them all. There is no doubt that they can mobilize ships. It is not difficult for General Eisenhower to double the number of troops he has landed. The war on Sicily is still in the beginning stage, and Axis people believe that there will be extremely fierce battles in the near future.

Eisenhower Lands Once Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency News: The anti-Axis side said that the Axis Command is transferring the largest number of troops to the south. It has now been found that the Axis forces are the 4th Division of the Le Havre regiment, facing the American army north of Gela, and the 54th Division of Naples, holding against the British army near Syracuse. It is said that both of these troops have German assistance in combat. General Eisenhower, who is in charge of the anti-Axis forces in Sicily, drove a destroyer to land on the southeast coast of Sicily yesterday morning. According to Reuters, Eisenhower met with General Barton, the commander of the new US Seventh Army, and then left the island. The anti-Axis side's news about the situation on Sicily is generally cautious, and warns that the Axis Command will increase its resistance, so the most difficult task for the British and American armies is still to come.

US and British Troops Participating in the War The German News Agency said: The American troops fighting in Sicily include the 1st, 3rd, 45th Infantry and a part of the 2nd Tank Division, and a part of the 82nd Airborne Division. This unit forms the new US Seventh Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Barton. Barton was the commander of the US Fifth Army in the North African campaign. The British troops fighting in Sicily are the 5th Infantry Division, the 51st Division, the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, the 22nd Tank Brigade, and a part of the 6th Tank Division. The 1st Canadian Army was transferred from the United Kingdom to Sicily specifically for this operation. In addition, there are several battalions of British paratroopers participating in the operation. This unit is commanded by General Montgomery, who previously commanded the British Eighth Army in Libya and Tunisia. The anti-Axis Air Force is commanded by British Air Chief Marshal Sir Tedder, assisted by British Air Marshal Sir Cunningham, British Air Vice Marshal Lauter, US Lieutenant General Spaatz, and Major General Doolittle. The anti-Axis Navy is commanded by Admiral Sir Cunningham, and the US fleet commander is Lieutenant General Hewitt.

### Italian People United to Defend Their Homeland: US Acknowledges Difficulties in Invading Sicily: Turkish Political Circles Take a Wait-and-See Attitude

Rome, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A dispatch from the Tong News Agency: A Rome-based qualified person commented on the Battle of Sicily, solemnly declaring: The Italian people are calmly dealing with the long-expected attack and are doing their best to defend the land of their ancestors with unwavering determination. Italians today have only one slogan: "The entire Italian nation is united under the leadership of the Prime Minister, determined to defend the sacred land of the Fatherland."

Rome, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Gheda announced in the Italian Daily that the anti-Axis forces landed in a remote coastal area of Sicily. The Axis forces there had withdrawn in advance to avoid the shelling of the anti-Axis ships. The Axis strategy is to lead the invading enemy forces into the inland and then fight them. The first anti-Axis forces to land encountered fierce battles before the majority of the Axis forces joined the battle.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A dispatch from the Tong News Agency: Confidence in the situation in Sicily is gradually increasing in Berlin and Rome, while the British side has become more cautious about the news of the landing. Berlin believes that the anti-Axis side probably launched an attack at this time, regardless of military interests, because the Soviet Union had issued an ultimatum demanding immediate action from the anti-Axis side. It is recalled that Prime Minister Churchill has repeatedly said that a military attack on Italy is of great political importance, and Eisenhower also underestimated the strength of the Italian army. This erroneous idea is the reason for the hasty attack on Sicily without being fully prepared.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A spokesman for the US Department of the Army announced in Washington yesterday: "We must be prepared to suffer severe losses in the battle of Sicily, because the battle there will be very difficult." The spokesman also said: "The well-trained and disciplined Axis forces will fight bravely and launch fierce counter-attacks. It is not easy to completely occupy Sicily."

Istanbul, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Turkish political circles expressed doubts about whether the British and American landing in Sicily would satisfy the Soviet Union, because the fighting on the eastern Soviet front is extremely fierce. Therefore, it is believed here that the Soviet Union will demand more important action than the current attack on Sicily. The Turkish side has a deep impression of the fierce resistance on Sicily and is taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the situation in the coming days.

### Anti-Axis Battleship Hit

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - A Havas News Agency report, citing German air force personnel, states that one anti-Axis battleship involved in the invasion of Sicily was hit near the island's coast, emitting thick smoke. Other reports suggest that several of the transport ships rumored to have been damaged are now considered sunk.

### Japanese Spinning Machines Moved to Burma

Rangoon, 13th (Central News Agency) - Japan decided in April of this year on a large-scale outline plan to relocate spinning equipment to the South. According to related sources, a portion of Japanese spinning equipment has already arrived here based on that outline and is currently being installed, with operations expected to begin soon. The produced cotton will be supplied to Burmese handicraft industries. This relocation of Japanese spinning machines to Burma is the first of its kind and holds considerable promise for the future.

### Italian Lieutenant General Frances Dies in Action in Sicily

Rome, 13th (Central News Agency) - Stefani News Agency reports that, according to an official announcement yesterday, Lieutenant General Frances, commander of the 13th Blackshirt Legion and civil militia liaison officer for the Sicilian garrison, died in action on July 11th. He participated in the Spanish Civil War as a volunteer and also served on the Soviet front during this war. He had been stationed in Sicily since March of last year.

### Promotion of Military Administration in the South Enters Second Phase, Construction Work in the Philippines Progressing Actively

Manila, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese military administration is promoting military government in order to establish a self-sufficient system in various parts of the South, which has entered the second stage, and is strengthening its promotion in order to complete its objectives as soon as possible. Among these,

The people of the Philippines are preparing for their impending independence within this region, and are particularly active in carrying out construction work. Recognizing the Philippines' rich resources and its extremely important position within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Philippine military administration has focused its policy objectives on reorganizing the economy and decided to continue mining manganese, chromium, and other minerals. In the agricultural sector, the plan is to increase the production of Manila hemp, coconuts, dried tobacco leaves, timber, etc., and to shift the production goals of a portion of the Philippine sugar industry. At the same time, in order to ensure the smooth progress of economic construction and stabilize people's livelihoods, the decision was made to first promote a sugar production increase campaign to ensure self-sufficiency in local sugar supplies. Thanks to the efforts of the military administration over the past year, everything is now on the right track, and the authorities recognize that establishing a self-sufficient system in the Philippines is increasingly important, especially during this Greater East Asia War. This is because

Adapting to Independence and fulfilling its role as a logistics base for the Southern front, it is essential to achieve self-sufficiency as soon as possible. Therefore, in March of this year, a five-year food production increase plan was established, focusing on increasing the production of rice and corn, the main food crops, as well as increasing the production of sweet potatoes, beans, and other grains, and entrusting the Philippine government to be responsible for its implementation. The Philippine administration also recognizes that establishing a self-sufficient food system in the Philippines is the foundation for completing Philippine economic independence and is a necessary condition for Philippine independence. Therefore, it mobilized all agricultural officials under the administration to go to various places to promote it. The Department of Agriculture and Commerce of the government has also increased the number of field instructors and used various propaganda materials to encourage farmers to pay attention. In May of this year, as the rainy season approached,

Food Production conferences were held separately in rice-producing provinces to discuss various issues such as selecting seeds, improving technology, reclaiming wasteland, and encouraging fertilization, and working with the New Philippine Service Corps to organize farmers to improve the land system. In terms of the production of daily necessities, factories for textiles, coconut oil, soap, paper making, and matches have also been restored, and domestic Japanese entrepreneurs have been entrusted to operate them. Factories participating in the organization through joint ventures have resumed work, striving to rationalize operations and improve production technology. The products are then distributed to general consumers through a rationing system by the essential goods distribution cooperative. The military administration and the Philippine government are working together to establish a plan to strengthen the industry. Recently, it was decided to transfer a portion of the factory equipment in Japan to the Philippines, so the output of the Philippine textile and paper industries will increase dramatically by three or four times. In addition, they are starting to

Increase the machinery equipment factory and fully restore factories for paint, sacks, cement, etc. The authorities also believe that in order to achieve practical results in this production plan, transportation is essential. Therefore, regarding transportation, all the original railways in the Philippines were repaired by March of this year, and plans are being made to add new lines. Regarding maritime transport, the main domestic routes are being restored, and wooden ships are being actively built locally using the rich timber resources of the Philippines. As the Philippines approaches independence, the progress of this work is also becoming increasingly rapid.

### Over One Hundred Foreign Aircraft Intruded into Swiss Airspace

Zurich, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Swiss government issued a communiqué on the 13th stating that over one hundred foreign aircraft intruded into Swiss airspace around midnight on the 12th. It is widely believed that the so-called foreign aircraft were clearly anti-Axis aircraft, as these aircraft entered from the French border at an altitude of 3,000 meters, flew over the Geneva area, and one crashed in Bouveret. Bombs were illegally dropped in three places, including Ligrisburg, destroying ten civilian houses and causing a fire in another.

### Diplomatic Officials Go to Beijing to Discuss Details of Returning the French Concession. After the recovery of the French Concession, all industries in the Nanshi area will become more prosperous.

Regarding the issue of taking over the French Concession, there have been several rounds of negotiations with satisfactory results. The French Ambassador, Ambassador Gu, and Foreign Minister Chu have all gone to Beijing one after another to continue negotiations on agreements and details of the handover. According to recent inquiries from relevant parties, Foreign Ministry Counselor Nong Rihui, Section Chief Sun Lifu, Secretary Tian Shoucheng, Minister Zhang Chao, and Geng Jizhi and others from our country left Shanghai by train at 4 p.m. yesterday to discuss the details of the return of the French Concession in Beijing, which will be implemented soon, and to continue to promote the work with Minister Chu.

Also, it is reported that the return of the Public Concession of this city is imminent, and the handover of the French Concession is also expected to be implemented within a short period of time. The news spread, and the citizens of the southern district were all inspired. It is known that the Nanshi area, which is adjacent to the French Concession, has been threatened by the forces of the concession for many years. Especially after the closure of the iron gate after the war, traffic was blocked, which not only caused inconvenience for pedestrians entering and exiting, but also hindered the development of industry and commerce in the Nanshi area for the past six years. Now it is decided that the French Concession can be taken over as soon as possible, and the iron gate system can be completely abolished, so the prosperity of various industries in the Nanshi area will bring significant development to the economy of the 400,000 citizens of the Nanshi area. Therefore, the 400,000 citizens of the entire Nanshi area are unanimously pledging to be the government's support and strive to promote the smooth development of the work of taking over the French Concession.

### Mr. Sheng You Inspires Humanitarian Spirit, Donates 100,000 Yuan Alone to Support This Newspaper's Scholarship Movement, Creating a Record for Individual Donations in the Past

This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Sheng You yesterday. He was deeply moved by this newspaper's repeated appeals for poor students and the limited amount of scholarships and the crowded application situation. He generously donated 100,000 yuan. Mr. Sheng saw righteousness and acted bravely, taking it upon himself to help outstanding young people with their studies, which is admirable. This newspaper has been organizing scholarships for five sessions, and we are grateful for the generous donations from all walks of life. Mr. Sheng's solo donation of a huge amount is the highest individual donation to this newspaper's scholarship fund. His generosity is very great, and his inspiration of human sympathy and mutual assistance will be very profound. The colleagues are deeply worried about the high tuition fees this year, the large number of applications, and the insufficient amount of scholarships to be allocated. Now that we have Mr. Sheng's advocacy and support, we are confident that people from all walks of life will follow suit enthusiastically. This year's scholarship movement will surely be perfectly completed thanks to Mr. Sheng's righteous act. Mr. Sheng's letter said: "Dear Sirs, I have repeatedly read your newspaper's editorials and news about scholarships, enthusiastically advocating and benefiting the poor, which is admirable. Especially this year, there are many people seeking help, and the estimated funding is far from enough. I am deeply moved by your sincere appeal. Young students are the backbone of the country and society in the future. If we want them to be practical and useful in the future, we must start laying the foundation today. Moreover, there are many children with good aptitude and intelligence. Because of poverty, they drop out of school, which leads to their being buried. This is painful for the students themselves and their parents, and it is an even greater loss for the country and society. Now your newspaper is advocating the scholarship movement. In addition to expressing my approval, I would like to attach a check dated July 13 for 100,000 Central Reserve Bank notes. Please check and receive it. Sincerely yours, Sheng You Bai Qi, July 13."

Yesterday was the second day of the opening of the calligraphy and painting exhibition. Despite the heat and heavy rain, visitors continued to come in an endless stream, and they enthusiastically made purchases, which shows that there are many people who are kind-hearted and do good deeds. Today, we are rearranging the exhibition again, displaying the calligraphy and painting separately, and adding精品 to fill the gaps. Among the displayed calligraphy and paintings, the "Hundred Longevity Characters" calligraphy work by the young calligrapher Qian Yilong, with its strong and vigorous strokes, seems extraordinary. Therefore, it was purchased by Mr. Shen Simin on the first day. Starting tomorrow, we will invite young painters Chen Yunlu and Chen Honglu, and young calligrapher Fang Wen, to write for guests. We welcome primary school students to visit and gather together, which is a rare opportunity. In addition, Mr. Pan Sansheng donated a 5-carat diamond ring, priced at 160,000 yuan; a true copy of the Kaihuang Lanting, priced at 50,000 yuan; jade five-dragon pendants and精玉 bottles, each priced at 20,000 yuan; a熙磁盆金套, priced at 4,000 yuan; jade knives, ancient mud, and large Qingtian stones with chicken blood stone, etc., are all extremely valuable.

The above items will be displayed for charity sale and exhibition immediately. All circles are welcome to visit and bid for purchase.

### Director of Education Lin Encourages Students to Be Frugal

Mr. Lin Jiongan, Director of the Bureau of Education of this city, gave a speech to encourage young students to practice frugality, saying, "Frugality is an inherent virtue of China, but since the introduction of European customs into the East, it has gradually been abandoned by social figures. Since Mr. Zhang Yongting, a pioneer in the educational circles of this city, initiated the movement to promote frugality last year, although it has not been long, this atmosphere has spread throughout the country, which shows that the movement to promote frugality is indeed in urgent need under the current situation. People have the same heart, and hearts have the same principles. In recent years, wars have continued, disasters have been frequent, and the people's poverty has reached its extreme. The country is currently in turmoil, and the Greater East Asia War has not yet been completed. Seeing that most of the people in Shanghai are still living a flowery and drunken life in a dream, it is very sad to say it. In the future, I hope that everyone will practice simplicity, which is equivalent to saving the country. I hope that students from all schools will practice it in a down-to-earth manner to overcome the difficulties of the war."

### Levy Table Tax to Supplement Education Funds, Restaurants and Noodle Shops That Do Not Sell Dishes Are Exempt

This city has resumed levying donations on extravagant banquets, which will be fully allocated to education funds in the southern district. All Chinese and Western restaurants or restaurants that offer package meals for business purposes within this city's area will be charged in accordance with the table tax collection regulations, with a tax rate of 10%, which will be collected by personnel dispatched by the Finance Bureau. Those who sell dishes for less than one yuan are exempt, and those who prepare their own dishes and host guests in their homes and shops are generally not subject to the tax. Noodle shops that do not sell dishes are also generally exempt. It is said that the table tax is limited to dishes, and items such as cigarettes, alcohol, fruits, dried fruits, and other advances are not included.

### Private Primary and Secondary Schools Must Submit for Approval Before Opening

In accordance with the amended regulations on private schools promulgated by the Ministry of Education, the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau has long stipulated that private schools that have not been approved by the competent educational administrative authority shall not conduct enrollment and open classes. It has been found that there have been private primary and secondary schools in the past that have failed to submit an application for approval to the Bureau before opening, and have enrolled students and started classes without authorization, which is inappropriate. Therefore, the Bureau has stipulated that all newly established private primary and secondary schools must submit an application to the Bureau for approval before opening, starting from the 15th of this month. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be shut down.

### Teacher Dies from Assault: Verdict in the Su Yizhi Case: Liu Wangshi Sentenced to Eight Years Imprisonment and Ordered to Pay 50,000 Yuan for Funeral Expenses

The case of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School, who died from injuries sustained after being beaten by Wangshi, the mother of student Liu Zhijun, has been repeatedly heard in the First Special District Court. After detailed investigation, the final judgment was announced yesterday morning by Judge Du Fuyao in the Second Criminal Court. The full text of the judgment reads: "Liu Wangshi is sentenced to eight years imprisonment for causing death by continuous assault." In addition, in the civil suit, "Liu Wangshi shall compensate Su Fengying 30,000 yuan in new legal tender for the funeral expenses of her sister Su Yizhi, and 20,000 yuan as consolation money to Su Yizhi's grandmother, Su Lushi, totaling 50,000 yuan." After the sentence was pronounced, Judge Du declared to the defendant: "The investigation of this case shows that you slapped Su Yizhi twice, as testified by witnesses, and according to the coroner's report, the deceased died from cerebral hemorrhage caused by the two blows to the head, without any doubt. The deceased was a female teacher, and both you and the defendant are women. There was no prior feud between you. It was only because your son did not hand in his homework and was spanked by the teacher that you went to confront her. If this trend continues, it will greatly hinder the future of education. However, you did not expect that this would lead to death so quickly, and considering you are a woman, the sentence is reduced to eight years imprisonment. If you do not agree with this judgment, you can appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court within ten days of receiving the judgment."

### Shanghai West Police Stipulate Vehicles Must Turn on Lights at Night

### Citizens Allowed to Report Self-Serving and Corrupt Jia Chiefs: Municipal Baojia Council Strictly Rectifies

Since the implementation of the Baojia system in the city, the Baojia chiefs in each district have failed to abide by their duties, which has not only disturbed the local citizens but has also undermined the entire Baojia system. In order to effectively rectify this situation, the Municipal Baojia Committee has issued orders to the Baojia offices in each district, severely reprimanding them. While many Baojia chiefs have reformed and improved their conduct, some Baojia chiefs are still outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant, which is regrettable. In order to eliminate long-standing malpractices, the Baojia Committee has allowed citizens in each district to report self-serving and corrupt Baojia chiefs so that they can be severely investigated and rectified.

### Responding to the "Convention on Saving Banquets" (No. 16)

(64) Mr. Zhou Dingyu (Kangqi Real Estate Company) came forward to express his willingness to participate, saying: "The 'Convention' alone cannot reach the entire society, and the effect is still insufficient. It is best to invite the managers of major restaurants and the chairmen and standing committee members of the industry associations of the wine and food industry to hold a symposium with those who participate in the convention to formulate several types of 'economical dishes' with uniform prices to popularize them in society."

(65) Lin Zhishou, Gu Siping, Zhu Biao, and Tang Xiongliang, colleagues of the Model Joint Wedding Office, jointly wrote a letter stating that they are willing to abide by the convention, with each person spending no more than 25 yuan per table, and that any banquets will not serve shark fin or drink excessive amounts of alcohol.

Economic Commentary

### Economic Morbidity

The morbidities of China's economy, as far as this reporter knows, are as follows:

First, the lack of investigation and statistics. Taking the supply and demand situation of goods in various places as an example, what is the actual production and sales volume? How much is the surplus in a certain place, and how much is the loss in a certain place? There is a lack of accurate investigation and precise statistics, relying only on hearsay, so rumors follow, leading to endless price increases, which has a great impact on the market. This is the first.

Second, the lack of equalization measures. Price stability is valuable. Extending this to stocks and bonds, which one does not value stability? The prerequisite for stability is to have equalization measures. If the price of goods in a certain place is too high, a sufficient quantity should be transported in to adjust it. If the price of goods in a certain place is too low, the government should purchase an appropriate amount to prevent foreign materials from stopping. This is the second.

Third, the dream of material exchange. Material exchange has been talked about for a long time. However, the materials of Place A and Place B, and Place B and Place C, are stagnant, and the prices are disparate. One side suffers from the lack of an outlet for materials, and the other side suffers from the lack of access to supply. What is the crux of the matter? What methods can be used to break this deadlock? This is the third.

The above three points. It is hoped that the government authorities and economic sages will pay attention to this, in order to seek a way for China's economic world to survive and seek life. This is what we all pray for.

### Domestic Raw Materials Arrive in Shanghai One After Another: Distribution Handled by Various Industry Associations: Factories Increase Production One After Another

The factories in this city were previously unable to obtain sufficient raw materials, which slightly hindered production, resulting in many factories stopping work or reducing production. It was learned yesterday that various domestic raw materials have been arriving here in a steady stream, and the responsible authorities have fairly distributed them to the respective industry associations, instructing them to distribute them to their members for use as soon as possible in order to restore production as scheduled. The distribution method is mostly based on grading and distribution, determined according to the amount of capital. First, the association determines the quota, and then immediately notifies the members, instructing them to send personnel with their seals to pay the loan and issue certificates. With the certificate, they can go to the designated warehouse to pick up the goods.

Assess Prices and Wholesale to Merchants

Once each industry obtains these raw materials, they must start work and increase production. After the goods are manufactured, they must submit a sample of the goods to the industry association with a document, along with a cost table for the manufactured goods, to be submitted to the evaluation committee for review and evaluation of the standard price limit. It is then sent to the relevant authorities for approval before replying to the approved limit for wholesale to various retailers. However, it is absolutely limited to legitimate merchants. Those who have been punished by the authorities for engaging in illegal transactions or are not members of the association should be refused wholesale to prevent hoarding.

Small Factories Spring Up Like Mushrooms

A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency learned from responsible parties in various industries yesterday that recently, due to the difficulty for large factories to collect raw materials, they have all stopped production. However, the demand for goods in the market is high, resulting in a shortage of supply. Those who are determined to produce goods do not hesitate to collect funds to manufacture goods on a small scale. To date, the development of various small-scale industries is like bamboo shoots after rain, including knitting factories, box factories, dyeing factories, canning factories, textile factories, toothbrush factories, leather factories, and others. Although their products are quite inferior, they are still able to meet the needs of the middle class because of their low cost and low price.

### Economic Bureau Investigates and Prohibits Industry Associations from Charging Special Fees

The Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau has received confidential reports that officials of various industry associations often charge special fees to member merchants, which is very wrong. The association membership fees are all implemented in accordance with laws and regulations and must be submitted to the bureau for approval before they can be collected. The additional special fee is obviously a clever name, which violates laws and regulations. Therefore, it has ordered all industry associations to prohibit this and sent personnel to investigate. If there is still a charge for the above-mentioned illegal special fee, they will be severely punished once it is verified.

### Various Associations Help the Authorities to Suppress Price

The various industry associations in this port have gradually entered the right track after being reorganized recently. It is learned that the associations have recently formulated the following key points of the important measures to be implemented to assist the authorities in suppressing prices: (1) Order members to submit the quantity of goods in stock; (2) Investigate the hoarding of goods by members; (3) Members must report the status of sales on a regular basis; (4) Members shall not change the price limits approved by the authorities and announced by the association; (5) Members shall not violate the various measures announced and implemented by the association, otherwise they will be ordered to withdraw.

### Shanghai Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market fluctuated greatly, with a sharp rise and fall. The hearts of those who were determined were already wavering. The number of rising stocks increased. Those sellers who were eager to realize profits were eager to sell. The Xin Xin Department Store was able to stand firm. The National Goods (stock) rose. Yong'an immediately fell after seeing a new high price, and the squeeze up was the least. The underwear stocks rose, and Jinglun and Jinghua followed suit, rising high with little pullback. The rise of Yong'an Textile decreased day by day. Xinhuo, Rongfeng, and Xinfeng all rose to near the major mark. Tongji also made a high price. Among the public utilities, Zhabei Water and Electricity and Zhunshang Electric rose alone and did not fall back. The Greater China Match Company still closed at the highest price. Nanyang Tobacco Company rose first, then fell slightly. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Xinyi rose the most strongly. Zhongfa and Xinya continued to rise. Among the cultural industries, the purchase prices of Commercial Press, China Book Company, and World Book Company were only seen to be rising. New real estate companies emerged one after another. Jiuan Industrial's transaction was slightly firmer in the market. Xinya Construction and Tongyi Trust were very stable. Kangyuan Canning stood out by passing the 100-mark.

### Business Summary

Gold and Silver: This morning, the Shanghai silversmith industry, Daxin Tonghang jewelry gold, was still sold at the price limit at the front desk per tael. There was no change in the handling fee, and there were a few transactions outside the industry. At noon, it slightly lowered, but it was only a small correction after a big rise. Trading was not active, and the price of silver outside the industry again exited a barrier.

Call Loan Interest Rate: The Shanghai Money Industry Association's call loan interest rate is still two-tenths of a cent, unchanged.

### Business Consolidation Committee Levies Transaction Fees: Effective from July 15th

The Business Consolidation Committee handles the approval of in/out of controlled materials and the approval of transfers, and transaction fees will be levied. It is heard that it has been stipulated: (1) For all controlled materials moved into or out of the Shanghai area, and moved out or out of Shanghai, (2) Controlled materials transferred from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and Nanjing Special Municipality, to other regions in the country, 1% of the value will be levied as the committee's transaction fee, effective from July 15th.

### Impressions of the Japanese Economic Delegation's Visit to China

As for the detailed content, it is not appropriate to make additional speculations, but the answers of Chairman Ogura to news reporters, the speech of Chairman Tang of the Business Consolidation Committee at the welcome of the delegation, and the remarks of Mr. Akashi Teruo are all worthy of our attention. When Chairman Ogura answered the question from the news reporter, he said: The central task of completing the Greater East Asia War. No matter from which side, it is nothing more than handling China-Japan relations, especially handling economic relations. Only after this issue is completely handled successfully can there be the possibility of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The new economic policy also takes this as a starting point. If the new economic policy can be promoted smoothly, then it can be expected that China's industry will develop autonomously, thereby enhancing the hope of increasing production. In this kind of cooperation, Japan's capital or technology can cooperate with China's national capital and talents, starting from resources and taking the step of increasing production, but the method and business attitude still need to be fully reviewed by the Chinese side.

According to the informal opinion expressed by Mr. Akashi Teruo: The essence of the new economic policy lies in protecting and nurturing China's national capital. National capital provides a new field of activity. We are prepared to remove all obstacles to this matter in order to implement financial cooperation.

Chairman Tang's view on China's economic problems is as follows: China-Japan economic cooperation is the established policy of the two governments. The specific problem is the mutual understanding and trust between Chinese and Japanese economic figures. At the same time, it also lies in establishing a sound economic foundation for China. Only in this way can it be enough to promote the autonomous development of China's economy and enhance production. However, when implementing this measure, there must be a minimum guarantee for the people's livelihood.

During this visit, the delegation and Chinese economic figures frankly exchanged opinions on how to concretize the principles of the new policy. A certain Chinese economic figure believed that during this meeting between the Chinese and Japanese economic circles, he hoped that the Japanese economic figures would frankly express their opinions in the future in dealing with economic problems. These few words show how eager the Chinese economic circles are for the delegation's visit to China. (Yunpeng: Translated from the July 12th Chiku Shinpo) (The End)

### Confidence and Stubbornness

— Ji Weiyi

Some people say: "Confidence is the key to a successful career; therefore, people with strong confidence are often the successful people of the future." This statement is accurate from a positive perspective; but if we look at it from the opposite perspective, we can hear flaws. Because people with strong "confidence" are often inherently "stubborn", they often refuse to humbly accept the advice of others; they refuse to calmly understand the criticisms of others; they see themselves as being as lofty as the sky... Such people are very difficult to make friends with and gain the help of others. On the contrary, they will suffer all kinds of unnecessary setbacks, and thus be eliminated, suffering the unfortunate consequences themselves.

However, let's get back to the point. The "stubborn" spirit of never giving up on a career is valuable. It is worthy of our praise. When carrying out a task, we must persevere stubbornly to achieve extraordinary achievements. We must stubbornly despise the ridicule of others, we must stubbornly overcome difficulties and hardships and use a dauntless spirit to obtain the meaningful "life" we hope for.

Usually, we may as well be more flexible and absorb the strengths of others. But in times of crisis, we must not be afraid of ridicule, and stubbornly unleash our greatest strength.

### Review of "Love Threads on the Opera Gown"

— Mu Hua

The script of "Love Threads on the Opera Gown" is an adaptation of "Man Jiang Hong". The plot development is that a popular opera singer in Nanjing falls in love with a poor calligrapher. Misunderstandings arise, leading the two to go to extremes. Later, both sides finally understand, one solves the marriage siege for her, and the other risks his life to save her. Thus, there is a happy reunion on Qingliang Mountain, ending the whole story. In terms of the viewpoint of the entire script, or the performance of each plot, it cannot be denied that it still carries some "Mandarin Duck Butterfly" colors.

However, let's get back to the point. If we compare it to the several films directed by Sun Jing in the past, then "Love Threads on the Opera Gown" is still considered an improvement among these many films. The handling of the entire film did not disappoint, although there are still many places for discussion about the director's techniques. For example, Tong Zhiling repeatedly went back and forth at the foot of Qingliang Mountain, several times, but the same shot was used to handle it, which made people feel uninteresting and lifeless. It was almost suspected that one shot was washed several times, creating a dullness.

In terms of acting, Mei Xi's performance was the most skilled and sophisticated. The emotions of trouble and grief when losing love, as well as the appearance of openly claiming to be Tong Zhiling's husband, were performed just right. Tong Zhiling's dialogue and singing, the tone is too balanced, lacking emotional expression. Only a few swift and steady shots are quite colorful, and the rest, such as Lu Yukun, are still adequate.

Like the elopement in "Yin Xian Zhu", "Love Threads on the Opera Gown" is dyed with a strong Peking Opera color.

### Reading Notes at Lang Jingshan's Tongyun Study

— Liang Yu

Zheng Yunshan and his wife will hold an exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow Association on the fourth floor starting on the 17th of this month. Jingshan is a famous photographer, and he has a wealth of experience in visiting famous mountains and rivers. Now he continues his passion, capturing the spirit of the peaks, which makes them feel fresh and free from vulgarity. Every mountain and every river is well-positioned, and the scenery and emotions blend together. This is because he has learned a lot from photography. His ink landscape paintings are elegant and pleasant, and his brushstrokes are close to Yunlin and Dachi, the former being elegant and moist and the latter being dry and astringent, each with its own merits, which shows that he has studied them deeply. Occasionally, he paints flowers and birds with delicate brushstrokes, and it is difficult to capture the spirit of the Song and Yuan dynasties. His wife, Ms. Peizhi, paints small portraits of people with clothing folds and facial features that have the style of the Jin and Tang dynasties. Her image of the Supreme Sage Confucius is dignified and solemn, which makes people feel respectful. The facial contours are good, and the clothing folds show strength. Mr. Wu Hufan's inscriptions add the finishing touch. The daughter, Yuxian, is also skilled in painting, and she has recently studied landscape painting with Qian Shu'ai. Her brushstrokes are ancestral and full of northern style, which is different from your aunt's style. Moreover, she is gifted with a keen ear, and she can skillfully create nature with the landscape blueprints taken by her father. It is clear that the family's elegance and reputation will be recognized in the art world.

### Chicken

— Shen Shen

Staff Officer Zhang thought to himself, this person is quite dim-witted; they won't move unless pushed. If I hadn't put on a brave face and confronted them head-on, tonight's matter would never have been settled so cheaply. He only cared about getting the money, regardless of the bloody cost to others. While thinking this, he followed Commander ×'s urging out the door, turning back stealthily towards Li, the town leader's, room. Li and Lu were worried that tonight's matter would not be easily resolved. Staff Officer Zhang had been gone for a long time and hadn't returned, which always meant a bad outcome was likely. They were anxious when they suddenly glimpsed a dark shadow flitting towards them from the corner. The shadowy figure's expression was dim, but seemed to show a hint of success. Half of the weight on their minds lifted, and they stepped forward to greet him.

"Staff Officer Zhang, thank you for your hard work! Did the commander agree?" Town Leader Li asked in a low voice. Staff Officer Zhang gave a slight smile, not answering immediately. He stood his ground, turned back to look at Ah Kun, who was standing dejectedly in the corner, and said slowly:

"It's alright! He finally agreed! But it was very close!"

Town Leader Li didn't quite understand at first, but upon hearing the words "finally agreed," half of the weight on his mind lifted again. He then asked:

"What was it like? Were there any other conditions? What did the commander say?"

"There were many, I'll tell you in detail another day! Tonight, let's first conclude this matter. It's already late, and further delay might lead to changes. Let's go to the room over here to talk!" Staff Officer Zhang said, leading Li and Lu into another room. There were two beds, a table, and several wooden benches here. It was Staff Officer Zhang's bedroom. The three of them sat around the table. Zhang spoke first:

"Let's not waste time with idle chatter. Let's be honest. The commander has agreed to let me handle everything. I understand both of your difficulties, and indeed, Ah Kun is very poor. However, the commander needs to save face. Even with what Town Leader Li mentioned just now, taking it all to him, there will be costs for compensating the brothers outside, so please find a way to come up with a little more. That way, you can leave tonight. What do you think, Town Leader Li?"

"Thank you for Staff Officer Zhang's help, here..." Li, relieved of his doubts, said as he reached into his pocket for banknotes, "A total of eight hundred yuan. We have also prepared a reward for the brothers. Please accept it, Staff Officer Zhang! Six hundred yuan as a 'tribute' to the commander, and the remaining two hundred yuan for the brothers to buy cigarettes. Is that enough? Furthermore, we will naturally reward Staff Officer Zhang handsomely for his help tomorrow... Ha! Ha!" Town Leader Li said, a smile on his face. Staff Officer Zhang accepted the banknotes, stood up, and said:

"Please wait a moment, I'll be right back." He went out and returned to the room shortly after, his face full of smiles, saying:

"You can go back now! Sit here for a moment while I call Ah Kun over. We'll go together! (10)"
