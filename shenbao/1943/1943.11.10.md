### Winter Relief Opportunity is Imminent

A few days ago, the drizzle was hazy, the west wind turned tight, and the temperature dropped sharply, already showing a shivering scene. There is a common saying: "The 27th of the ninth lunar month urges the sluggards, and the fifth wind of the tenth lunar month cannot be avoided." This means that the end of the ninth lunar month is the beginning of winter, and the 27th of the ninth lunar month is often a windy season. The blowing of the wind urges people to prepare their winter clothes in time, especially pointing out that those who "tear down and mess up" either forget to prepare warm clothes, or are still in the afterlife, so it is said to "urge the sluggards." "The fifth wind of the tenth lunar month" means that the west wind on the fifth day of the tenth lunar month is biting and sharp, and without warm clothes, it is "unavoidable." These dates refer to the lunar calendar, which has already passed. However, this year is considered a late cold, and people are still wearing lined clothes. However, sudden changes in the weather are possible, and to avoid getting sick from the cold, it is best to prepare earlier.

Of course, those who have the ability to prepare their own warm clothes should prepare earlier. But what about those who do not have the ability to prepare their own warm clothes? Mencius said, "The heart of compassion is possessed by all men." We naturally cannot bear to see them suffer from cold and hunger, and society should prepare for them with the power of the masses. The current season has arrived, and it is now an urgent time for society to prepare for winter relief. We have raised the issue of preparing for winter relief twice in our editorials on October 21st and the 4th of this month, which is what we mean.

The Central and Shanghai Social Welfare Funding Committee, which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Social Welfare, was recently established and held a joint meeting on the 3rd of this month, deciding to uniformly organize the fundraising for the 32nd year of winter relief. Part of the winter relief work is to solve the difficulties for those who do not have the ability to prepare their own warm clothes. Therefore, how to design, how to carry out, and how to manage the fundraising should be planned quickly and implemented early.

We reviewed the committee's resolutions on winter relief, including: setting up a separate Winter Relief Funding Committee to be solely responsible; setting the fundraising target at 10 million yuan; and setting the fundraising period from November 16th to the end of December. Analyzing these three points, first, setting up a committee to be solely responsible is of course necessary. We hope that it will be established as soon as possible, and the rules and regulations should be stipulated. Since the start date of fundraising is approaching, it is especially necessary to establish it soon, because the discussion of fundraising methods cannot be thorough in a hurry. Second, the fundraising target is 10 million yuan, which is affordable in terms of the current social and economic capacity. Although donations to public and private charities are frequent, it is inevitable that donors will hesitate. However, winter relief covers a wide range, and if fundraising is done properly, raising the amount is not difficult. Third, although the fundraising period is tentatively set to the end of the year, we believe that if the fundraising methods are appropriate and the relief methods are practical, it will not be difficult to gain the trust of all sectors of society and enthusiastically donate, and it is very possible to raise the full amount early.

In addition, regarding fundraising, we list a few difficult examples and offer some humble opinions for reference:

Yesterday's "News" newspaper's social service column published a report that "Difficulties have arisen in the budget for making warm clothes." The budget of 500,000 yuan for making 4,000 clothes, planned on October 26th, is now practically impossible. First, the cost of labor and materials has soared, and 500,000 yuan can only make a little over 1,000 clothes, and it is difficult to guarantee that it will become even more difficult later. Second, donations have not been as enthusiastic as expected. In half a month, only a little over one-tenth of the planned target has been reached. Therefore, one can only "deal with the facts as they are." This kind of practical difficulty is the best reference for winter relief fundraising and relief, and it is hoped that those in charge will pay special attention to it in the future.

The Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association was established last spring. The organization and personnel selection of the association are quite ideal in objective terms. However, the amount of donations raised in more than a year is not large. What is the reason for this, and it is worth studying and improving when donating.

The patrons of entertainment venues are always in a better economic situation. The current prosperity of theaters and dance halls in the city is a powerful illustration. We suggest adding a 50% surcharge to the ticket prices of entertainment venues to fill the winter relief fund. The results will definitely not be bad. This will cost consumers a little more, but it will be used for charity, and it is not considered abuse to take it. A 50% surcharge can also be added to banquets in British consulates where each table costs more than a thousand yuan. There should be no problem with the host's economic ability.

The west wind has risen, the severe cold will arrive soon, and the preparation for winter relief is imminent! May those in charge promote it quickly, and all sectors of society support it with all their strength, so that the displaced compatriots can reduce the suffering of cold and hunger as soon as possible!

### Naval Battle off Bougainville Island The Second World War Unfolds Japanese Naval Air Force Achieves Great Results

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 9th: Since the morning of November 8th, the Imperial Naval Air Force has been fiercely attacking enemy transport convoys and escort fleets in the sea south of Bougainville Island. The results of the battle have been determined as follows: sunk three battleships, two cruisers, three destroyers, and four transport ships; destroyed one battleship (heavily damaged and on fire), three or more large cruisers (heavily damaged), five cruisers or large destroyers (heavily damaged and on fire), one large transport ship (heavily damaged and on fire); shot down twelve or more enemy aircraft (two of which are uncertain); our side lost a total of fifteen aircraft due to self-destruction and failure to return to base (yesterday). This air battle is called the Second Air Battle off Bougainville Island.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the morning of the day, the Japanese Naval Air Force has fiercely engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy escort fleet, which is centered on transport convoys and main battleships. It has reaped a great victory similar to the Battle of Pearl Harbor. The enemy fleet suffered a painful blow and collapsed in disarray. The Japanese Naval Air Force is continuing to launch a major offensive and is currently expanding its gains. In this battle, the Japanese Naval Air Force, in the waters south of Bougainville, disregarded the fierce defensive fire of the enemy fleet and fiercely attacked with torpedoes, sinking and destroying five of them. They then attacked the escorting cruisers and destroyers, sinking and destroying eleven more. They then twice fiercely attacked the fleeing enemy fleet, sinking three of them, burning one, and shooting down more than twenty enemy escort aircraft.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – In the naval and air battles near Bougainville Island and over Rabaul, New Britain, during the six days from October 31st to November 5th, the Japanese Navy achieved a great victory that shook the world. Currently, the Japanese and American navies are still fighting fiercely in the Bougainville Island area. Rear Admiral Yano, the Navy Press Chief of the Japanese Headquarters, made the following statement on the 9th: Operations are currently underway in the waters near Bougainville. The Imperial Navy is currently expanding its gains.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from a Japanese military base in the South Pacific: Eighty enemy fighter-bombers raided Rabaul, New Britain, on the morning of the 7th. The Japanese naval fighter squadron immediately intercepted them and engaged in an air battle, shooting down ten enemy planes and destroying four. Two Japanese planes returned to base.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – A telegram from a Japanese military base in the South Pacific. On the night of the 6th, Japanese naval air squadrons bombed the enemy positions at Torokina Point, Bougainville Island, inflicting damage and returning safely to base.

### Japanese Aircraft Adopt Fierce Kamikaze Tactics to Defeat Allied Counteroffensive Attempts

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to military experts here, recently, in order to attack Japanese strategic strongholds in the South Pacific, the enemy used a large number of aircraft to attack Japanese positions in Rabaul, but 202 aircraft were shot down by Japanese naval aircraft on the 2nd. Later, they attempted to use a mobile fleet centered on aircraft carriers to attack Rabaul and its forward base, Bougainville Island, from the front of the sea. However, on the evening of the 5th, they were again severely damaged by eighteen Japanese naval aircraft. Then, the enemy attempted to break through the Japanese strategic line in one fell swoop and challenged the Japanese with a large transport convoy protected by several main battleships. The Japanese naval air squadron immediately came out to meet them and, on the 8th, destroyed the enemy's main fleet. The victory was second only to the attack on Hawaii. To this day, Japan has established its historically unprecedented "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and has maintained an undefeated rear area sufficient to support any long-term war. Japan's strategic position is now able to defeat any counteroffensive or attack by the Allied camp. The great victory won by the Japanese naval air squadron this time indicates the following points: the results of the first and second air battles off Bougainville Island had a huge impact on the enemy and have frustrated the enemy's counteroffensive attempts, completely crushing the enemy's wide-ranging strategy; the enemy tried to launch a counteroffensive, so they took aircraft carriers or main battleships to the sea near the Japanese base; Japanese naval air squadrons adopted fierce kamikaze tactics, engaging in hand-to-hand combat; the repeated victories won by the Japanese naval air squadrons are the result of day and night training by the Japanese Navy since the Washington Naval Treaty, which is enough to prove that the Japanese naval air force personnel have the spirit of killing enemies, one against a thousand.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The combined battle results of the Japanese army in the Solomon Sea area from October 27th to the present are as follows: Damage to the enemy: Sunk one large aircraft carrier, one large cruiser, four cruisers, two large destroyers, three large transport ships, for a total of eleven ships. Sunk one medium aircraft carrier, three battleships, four large cruisers, one cruiser, three cruisers or large destroyers, four returning ships, four transport ships, one small transport ship, and forty landing craft. Battleship, six to seven or more heavy cruisers, one cruiser, four cruisers or large destroyers, four destroyers, two destroyers, three large and medium transport ships, one small transport ship, totaling ten to nineteen or more ships. In addition, many small boats were destroyed, and the enemy mistakenly injured one of its own destroyers. Shot down 401 or more enemy aircraft. Damaged four aircraft.

### The Greater East Asia Writers' Conference Will Be Held in Japan Starting on the 17th for Three Days

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia Writers' Conference for this year has been decided to be held at the Greater East Asia Hall in Tokyo from the 17th of this month. Twelve people from the press from China, Japan, Manchuria, and the Co-Prosperity Sphere will attend. The conference will last for three days.

### The First Regular Session of the Philippine Congress Will Be Held Simultaneously with the Creation of a Central Bank

Manila, 9th (Central News Agency) – The first regular session of the Philippine Congress is scheduled to open on the 25th. Various bills to be submitted to the meeting have begun to be registered, and economic bills account for the majority, which is quite noteworthy. However, among the economic relations that have become problems are the report of the Price Countermeasures Committee and the budget for the next fiscal year. The Price Countermeasures Committee is currently working with the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Non-Governmental Business Association, and the Planning Institute to conduct research. As a result, based on the specific content added to the "Price Control Outline" decided under the military administration, the content is generally to strengthen the general rationing control mechanism and increase economic production materials. Regarding the compilation of the budget for the next fiscal year, each department is currently rushing to prepare income and expenditure forecasts. Among them, the welfare policy of President Laurel is reflected, and the budgets for relief and reconstruction funds and educational funds, as well as departments related to civil engineering and transportation, will increase. At the same time, in order to maintain public order, the budget of the Ministry of Interior will expand more than other departments, so the budget of other departments will be reduced considerably. However, in order to establish self-sufficiency, the expenditures of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce for increasing food production and the expenditures for irrigation and water conservancy projects will also increase compared with the previous administrative era, so the budget of the new government will be abnormally large compared with the budget of the previous administrative era.

Manila, 9th (Central News Agency) – After the independence of the Republic of the Philippines, preparations are underway to create a central bank. In his inaugural address, President Laurel strongly stated that "adopting a sound and stable currency, seeking sound circulation of funds, and striving to improve the credit system" means eliminating the Anglo-American color and establishing a new financial institution based on the concept of Greater East Asian nationalism. The economic reconstruction of the Philippines will be centered on the creation of a central bank, and will be promoted step by step.

### Sumatran Aborigines Participate in Politics

A certain place in Sumatra, 9th (Central News Agency) – The military governor of Sumatra recently made a statement on the participation of aborigines in politics, the main points of which are as follows: The case of Sumatran aborigines participating in politics has been decided and announced today. This is the realization of the Empire's goal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and I am very pleased about this. The main points of this announcement are: first, advisory bodies composed of current residents will be established in each agency and department; second, aboriginal officials will be employed as much as possible. The purpose is to implement rational governance and promote politics that loves the people. The announcement of the Sumatran aborigines' participation in politics is the final measure, and further consideration will be given in the future depending on the self-awareness of all of you and your cooperation with the Greater East Asia War.

Daiak People

Achieved Historical

Martapura, 9th (Central News Agency) – The one million or more Daiak people in South Borneo were regarded as barbarians under the rule of the Dutch government. Since the occupation of South Borneo by the Japanese army, they have been continuously implementing education and protection policies, such as acknowledging the residential areas of the Daiak people, prohibiting other races from disrupting the Daiak people's governance, delineating areas to protect the Daiak people, prohibiting other races from privately developing them, and appointing Daiak deputy chiefs to assist in promoting administration. The fate of oppression and decline that the Daiak people have suffered for the past several generations has now been revitalized under Japanese military rule.

### President Wang and Others Return to the Capital Yesterday's Important Speech Clarifies the Three Characteristics of the Greater East Asia Conference

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Propaganda Department issued the following communiqué at 6:00 PM on November 9th: My country's representatives attending the Greater East Asia Conference, President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by Vice President Zhou Fohai, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Military Affairs Committee Member Chen Changzu, Executive Yuan Secretary General Zhou Longxiang, and Deputy Secretary General Xue Fengyuan, went to Japan on the 1st of this month. Now that their duties have been completed, they returned to Nanjing at 5:30 PM today. Vice President Zhou will return a few days later to deal with economic and financial matters.

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia Conference, which aims to unite one billion people in East Asia, was solemnly opened in Tokyo on the 5th. At this Greater East Asia Conference, regarding the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the Greater East Asia policy, representatives of various countries had frank discussions and unanimously passed the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and the conference was successfully concluded on the 6th. My country's representatives, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, and attendees Foreign Minister Chu, Executive Yuan Secretary General Zhou, Military Affairs Committee Member Chen, and Executive Yuan Deputy Secretary General Xue and others returned to China by plane from Fukuoka, Japan, on the 9th, and arrived safely in the capital at 5:30 PM that afternoon. The heads of various agencies who went to the airport to greet them included Bao Wenyue, Chen Junxuan, Chen Chunpu, Wu Kaisheng, Chen Zhishuo, Zhou Xuechang, Chen Yunwen, Li Quyi, Shen Zhenwang, and on the Japanese side, Ambassador Tani, Chief of Staff Matsui, and Lieutenant General Sakae, among others. President Wang was dressed in formal attire and looked radiant. After getting off the plane, he shook hands with Ambassador Tani and other welcoming personnel to express his gratitude, and then went directly to his official residence by car.

President Wang's Speech

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – President Wang of the Executive Yuan, my country's representative to the Greater East Asia Conference, safely returned to the capital on the 9th and made the following statement: This Greater East Asia Conference differs from all previous international conferences in three respects. First, famous international conferences in history, such as the Congress of Vienna after the Napoleonic Wars and the Paris Conference after the last European War, were merely the disposition of the weak by the strong. The purpose of the conference was how the strong divided the spoils and how the weak were subjected to slaughter. The Greater East Asia Conference, on the other hand, was purely the assistance of the weak by the strong. The former was a utilitarian view, and the latter was a moral spirit, which is absolutely opposite. Second, the American Monroe Doctrine, the so-called America for Americans, is based on racial prejudice, excluding other races and preventing them from existing within America. The Greater East Asia Conference, on the other hand, the so-called Asia for Asians, is the Asian people's demand for liberation from the oppression of Britain and the United States. After liberation, resource development and cultural exchange will be shared with the world. It is truly a world for all and there is absolutely no selfishness. Third, the recent conferences held by Britain, the United States, and other countries have no other purpose than two: A, Britain attempts to maintain its existing colonies and suppress the people of the colonies, preventing them from becoming independent and free. B, the United States itself already possesses the richest resources in the world, but thinks it is not enough and attempts to monopolize everything, making the entire world its colony. The interests of these two countries are absolutely in conflict from their own point of view, but in the view of harming other races and suppressing other nations, they have to collude to do evil. The Greater East Asia Conference, on the other hand, is for each nation to strive for independence and to restore its plundered interests, not to plunder the interests of others. This is a revolutionary spirit, not an aggressive act. In summary of these three characteristics, the Greater East Asia Conference is indeed an international conference of the times. We cannot but admire the merits of our allied Japan in advocating this, and we cannot but express our deepest respect for the cooperation of our friendly countries such as Thailand, Manchuria, the Philippines, Burma, and the Provisional Government of Free India. In the future, we can only follow the will of our Founding Father, unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally, and strive together. At the same time, we deeply hope that those in Chongqing will reflect and return to us, become comrades in East Asia? Or will they make the same mistake again, be instructed by Britain and the United States, and strike against independent Burma, which is not enough, and will they also inflict their poison on Free India, becoming traitors to East Asia and leaving a stain on Chinese history that has never existed before? This is the choice of those in Chongqing.

### Japanese Army Occupies Meixi Temple

Huazhong Front, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army, which quickly advanced towards the Nuan Shui Street area, occupied Meixi Temple, which was guarded by the Yu Provisional 3rd Division, at dawn on the 7th. Dozens of Yu military barracks were found in the north of the area, which could accommodate the strength of more than one division. They were immediately occupied, and a large number of military equipment, ammunition, and materials were seized.

Huazhong Front, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army, which fiercely attacked the west bank of Dongting Lake, occupied Anxiang at 1:30 PM. The 162nd Division of the Yu 44th Army suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese army also captured a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and materials. According to Yu military prisoners, Sun Wenzhao, the commander of the Yu 162nd Division, abandoned his subordinates and crossed the Taiping Canal when the Japanese army launched a fierce attack, and fled in a panic towards the west. Yu Army's Anti-Japanese Consciousness Disappears Hankou, 9th (Central News Agency) – The new operation by the Japanese army on the west of Dongting Lake is now in full swing. According to news received here, all agencies and people on the Chinese side are cooperating unanimously and enthusiastically, which is enough to prove that the China-Japan alliance treaty has had a great impact on the general public. Currently, people close to the war zone are moving to peaceful areas one after another, and there are very few who are fleeing inland. According to those who have recently taken refuge here, the Yu army on the west of Dongting Lake, although not fully aware of the conclusion of the alliance treaty between China and Japan, has heard about the progress of Sino-Japanese relations. Therefore, even the division and brigade commanders are now superficially obeying the anti-Japanese orders from the Yu side, and their anti-Japanese will has been devastated. As for the general public, in addition to fleeing to peaceful areas, they no longer have any intention of resisting Japan. Especially after hearing the Greater East Asia Declaration, their thoughts on the rejuvenation of China are obviously converging with those advocated by the National Government. Moreover, because the US Air Force has greatly lost the hearts of the people in various occupied areas, the people in the interior unanimously hope that the Yu authorities will immediately stop resisting Japan in order to preserve China's vitality. It is expected that this operation on the west of Dongting Lake will have a great impact on the Yu side, especially on the anti-Japanese consciousness of the Yu army.

### Naval Delegation to Japan Returns to Beijing, Expresses Sentiments - Military Production Quantities Multiply Over Peacetime

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - Our nation's naval authorities, in order to investigate the state of the Japanese Navy, specially organized a naval delegation to Japan last month. It is now learned that the group, including Naval Vice-Minister Zhao Guizhang, Central Naval Academy President Jiang Xiguo, Hydrographic Bureau Director Ye Kesong, Naval Ordnance Department Director Zheng Shizhang, Military Strategy Department Director Cao Nantian, Guangzhou Naval Base Chief of Staff Li Yun, Weihaiwei Naval Base Chief of Staff Meng Tieqiao, Nanjing Naval Base Chief of Staff Chen Ruiqi, and Naval Supply Section Chief Liang Dazhi, etc., returned to the country and arrived in Beijing yesterday. The delegation representatives also specially met with Chinese and Japanese journalists at the International Club at 1:00 PM on the 9th to express their impressions of the trip. The gist of each representative's remarks is recorded as follows:

(Vice Admiral Zhao Guizhang) - Our delegation went to Japan last month and returned to Beijing yesterday, lasting approximately twenty-odd days. The main objectives of this trip to Japan were... naval education and training, the state of military production, and the efforts of the Lu army and civilians. Regarding Japan's naval training techniques, they are extremely proficient to the point that even in the dead of night, their technicians work as if it were daytime, demonstrating their high level of practice. Military production is also enough to amaze us. Their machinery is advanced and magnificent, and the speed of shipbuilding and artillery manufacturing is unmatched by other countries. Moreover, the production volume of general military factories not only does not decrease due to the war, but is several times greater than peacetime.

(Vice Admiral Jiang Xiyuan, President of the Central Naval Academy) - My general observations from this inspection trip to Japan can be summarized in three points: In terms of spirit, the Japanese people all possess a unique spirit, which is faith in the gods and reverence for the Emperor. Therefore, during the Pacific War, Japanese soldiers were often able to regard death as returning home in order to strive for victory, while the civilians in the rear worked diligently and endured hardships, all marching together towards the path of completing the Greater East Asia War. In terms of material resources, the resources stockpiled in various places are extremely numerous. The manufacturing of airplanes and warships is as easy as sewing clothes, and human resources are also exceptionally abundant. A large number of soldiers are currently being vigorously trained. Regarding the general state of society, the Japanese people are able to calmly deal with the Greater East Asia War, focusing only on work, with absolutely no panicked or abnormal behavior. The materials needed by the people are all reasonably obtained through rationing methods. On one hand, they endure hardships, and on the other hand, they prepare to create a situation of certain victory. What the people are concerned about is how the Greater East Asia War can be won, and what they need is victory alone.

(Rear Admiral Ye Kesong) - Japan's Hydrographic Department is truly the most outstanding in the world. Therefore, for many years, our country's hydrographic surveying and compilation have adopted the Japanese system. However, today, more than ten years later, Japan's Hydrographic Department has expanded five to six times compared to before. Its technologies, such as aviation meteorology, etc., have indeed made very significant progress compared to eighteen years ago.

(Rear Admiral Zheng Shizhang) - What impressed me most on this inspection tour to Japan was the progress of Japanese machinery. The organization of various departments is complete and meticulous, the institutions are sound, and the equipment is comprehensive, without being inferior to any strong country in the world. One cannot help but admire the extraordinary progress that friendly Japan has achieved through diligent research in recent years, which can serve as a reference for us. Frequent Reports of Allied Naval Victories Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - It is reported that in the recent fierce battles between allied naval forces and American fleets in the sea areas around the Mono Islands and Bougainville Island, many enemy warships were sunk and destroyed, and more than 200 enemy aircraft were shot down. These glorious war results have been announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters for days. This reporter specially interviewed Naval Vice-Minister Zhao Guizhang, who had just returned from an inspection tour of the Japanese Navy, to ask for his impressions of this naval battle. He kindly expressed the following: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the heroic allied soldiers have fought bravely in the Pacific region, destroying the enemy's strength and establishing an invincible situation. Now, in the areas of Mono Island and Bougainville Island, they have inflicted heavy blows on the enemy fleet, causing the enemy's attempt to seize the opportunity to counterattack to vanish into illusion. We, in addition to expressing our utmost respect to the heroic allied soldiers, feel even more that the attainment of victory in the Greater East Asia War is just around the corner, and our belief in completing the glorious construction of Greater East Asia is further strengthened.

### Establishment of the Sino-Japanese Alliance - Excitement in Beijing

Beijing Correspondence

Around 4:00 PM on the 30th, I was chatting leisurely at a friend's house when my friend's young son returned from outside and reported in a hurried tone, "Just now, there were extras being sold on the street, but the newsboys were running too fast, and I couldn't buy one. I don't know what it's about."

It had been a long time since an extra had been seen in Beijing. These days were the period of the Tokyo Extraordinary Conference, and the Moscow Conference was also underway. After receiving the news, everyone began making unfounded speculations. On the one hand, they sent people outside to buy the extra. Some people thought it was related to the recent rumors of North-South unification, and some even thought it was related to world peace. They argued for a long time without any result. A person passing by the door said, "Full peace has been achieved! Chongqing is broadcasting!" Before we could ask further, the person had already hurried away. This one sentence stirred up everyone's emotions. Some friends even started singing joyfully, saying, "Tomorrow is Sunday, we should have a big celebration!"

After a period of debate, the person who went to buy the extra returned, bringing a true newspaper extra. Everyone read it and learned that it was news of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in Nanjing. Although it was not full peace, because it was also related to full peace, everyone thought that it was finally a step on the road to full peace and felt very happy.

The day after the news came out, national flags were hung high throughout the streets, and the newspapers also carried the news that when Information Bureau Director Guan Yi announced this news at the All-Federation Congress, all members applauded and cheered. The authorities also ordered the entire North China to display flags for three days to show celebration. The Broadcasting Association also broadcast special programs for this purpose, and the Central and Beihai Parks were also open to the public for three days. It can be seen how much excitement this news brought to the citizens of Beijing.

These past two days, whenever I meet friends, no one does not talk about this issue. Those who are optimistic are overjoyed and believe that China's future is full of hope. Those who are pessimistic and those who are neurologically sensitive all believe that with the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, North-South unification is probably only a matter of time, and the unification of the monetary systems of the North and South has also become an important topic in their minds. In short, after receiving the news of the Sino-Japanese Alliance, the citizens of Beijing were indeed greatly excited. (Sent from Beiyan by airmail, November 1st)

### Prime Minister Zhang's Talk

Xinjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Zhang of Manchukuo recently gave a talk, the gist of which is as follows: The morale of the Japanese people is extremely high. During this decisive period, everyone is united and working together to advance towards the completion of the holy war. I am deeply grateful to witness this situation. During this Greater East Asia Conference, representatives from various countries frankly exchanged opinions, and the result of their agreement was a joint declaration clarifying the world, which can be described as a grand charter for the construction of Greater East Asia. I believe that this conference is not only an unprecedented and historic conference for East Asia, but also marks a new era in world history. I participated in the conference and had earnest and heart-to-heart talks with the leaders of East Asia, all of whom were sincerely dedicated and hardworking, which is truly admirable. Therefore, our belief in the certain victory of the Greater East Asia War and the certain success of the construction of Greater East Asia is even more firm, and we deeply feel the great responsibility we bear. I sincerely hope that all citizens will unite as one and, with even stronger determination, strive to complete the war and achieve the goal of building Greater East Asia.

### Philippine President Laurel Broadcasts to the World

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - Philippine President Laurel broadcast to the world from the Tokyo Broadcasting Station at 4:30 PM on the 8th, clarifying the determination of Asian nations to cooperate in completing the war.

### Fierce Offense and Defense Battle Unfolds on the Kiev Front - No Change in the Situation in Crimea

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - DNB reports: At the end of last week, the focus of the Soviet offensive shifted to the Kiev area. After occupying the city, the enemy attempted to expand its gains, launching an offensive northwest towards Korosten, attempting to threaten the German positions at the confluence of the Pripyat River and the Dnieper River from the flank, and pushing south and southeast, attempting to break into the rear of the German forces in the Great Dnieper Bend. In the Kiev battle, the German forces adopted flexible defense tactics, forcing the Soviet forces to repeatedly mobilize reinforcements to join the battle. Therefore, its war results will have an impact on the development of the war situation in other areas, especially the Great Dnieper River. German forces made local advances north of Krivoy Rog and south of Nikopol, improving the positions they defended and wiping out an enemy assault team. The enemy increased pressure in the Kherson area in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. There were no major changes in the Crimean battlefield at the end of last week. Although the Soviet forces achieved local breakthroughs, they have not yet crossed the Perekop Isthmus to open the way to northern Crimea. The Soviet forces only launched small-scale offensives on the Kerch bridgehead, but reinforcements arrived from the sea.

### White House Convenes Military Conference

Argentine Capital, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to Washington, President Roosevelt urgently summoned the heads of the Army and Navy to the White House yesterday for an emergency meeting. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral King, and U.S. Air Force Commander General Arnold all attended.

### Anglo-Turkish Talks Conclude - Joint Communiqué Issued - Turkey Will Not Abandon Neutrality

Istanbul, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Cairo: British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu in Cairo. On the morning of the 8th, a communiqué was issued on the results of the talks, as follows: Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu met with British Foreign Secretary Eden in Cairo on the 5th and 6th of this month to exchange views on the results of the Moscow Conference and the overall situation. The foreign ministers' talks were held in the spirit of friendship and alliance between the two countries.

Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) - Although the formal negotiations between British Foreign Secretary Eden and the Turkish Foreign Minister have concluded, according to British official sources in Cairo, there was a further farewell talk. The interests of the two countries were fully discussed.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - DNB's diplomatic correspondent claims: It is learned here that British Foreign Secretary Eden must have strongly suggested to the Turkish Foreign Minister during the Cairo talks that Turkey should provide certain bases for the use of the British Air Force. The statement issued by the Turkish government today clearly rejects this suggestion and reiterates its intention to continue to strictly adhere to neutrality. The Turkish commentary on the Cairo talks also states that its main purpose was to obtain information regarding the contents of the Moscow Conference. It should be known that if Turkey abandons its neutral policy and grants bases to Britain, the Soviet Union could also follow suit and obtain benefits.

### Major Battle Underway in the Mountainous Regions of Southern Italy - Germans Use Hedgehog Defenses to Resist

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to DNB reports: After reaching the line of the Garigliano River Estuary, Venafro, Isernia, and Vastogirardi, the British and American forces were prevented from continuing to advance due to heavy losses. German forces strengthened their resistance along the entire line and even launched a counterattack in the Venafro area, driving the American forces from the hilltops initially occupied between Oliveto and Ventura. The current situation of the front lines is roughly as follows: On the left flank of the U.S. Fifth Army along the coast of the Gulf of Gaeta, the army attempted to cross the river, but failed to establish a strong bridgehead on the north bank and was blocked at Mignano, not yet reaching the Garigliano River. West and southwest of Venafro is the main location of the main force of the U.S. right flank. After reinforcements arrived, the U.S. forces again launched an attack on the German-occupied territory on Sunday. The number of personnel and the amount of equipment were unprecedented in the Italian theater. The battle is still underway.

Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London, Canadian public relations officer Pimisi of the Allied Command in London announced: Every inch of land gained by the Allied forces in the Southern Italy operations comes at a great cost. Therefore, the Allied forces have now been forced to adopt a new strategy to counter the German flexible strategy. Pimisi also said that the German forces use hedgehog defenses, with every important stronghold, intersection, and hill being transformed into a hedgehog defense, making large-scale battles extremely difficult.

### Hitler's Speech at the National Socialist Party Revolution Commemoration

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - At the National Socialist Party's 20th anniversary commemoration, German Führer Hitler summoned Air Force Minister Göring, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, Interior Minister Himmler, Labor Front Commander Ley, Stormtroop Leader Schepmann, and other National Socialist Party leaders in Munich, giving a one-hour talk, the main points of which are as follows: On this day of commemoration of our rise, I am scheduled to stay in Munich for a few hours to meet with my comrades, recall the past, and explain the policies for the future.

Tracing the Past to Recognize the Enemy

During World War I, Germany suffered a tragic defeat due to a rebellion in the rear. At that time, the Weimar Republic (a small country within Germany), although a democratic political system, initially suffered twice the pain of destruction due to the heavy pressure from democratic countries. In fact, it was inevitable that the Weimar Republic could not prevent the victory of communism, because apart from the German people of National Socialism, there was no power that could defeat communism. I have heard people say that they can maintain friendly relations with communism and avoid its threat. This is like a chick and a duck daring to explain to a fox, "We will never attack you," and expecting the fox to become a vegetarian. Communism will never stop attacking until it falls. Did the Estonians and Latvians ever try to conquer the Urals? Did the Romanians ever covet the Soviet Union's oil? Did Finland ever attack the Soviet Union? None of these things happened. But the Soviet Union attacked Finland, moved the Estonians and Lithuanians to the Urals, and even attempted to occupy the entire Balkans. Only the German people can resist the attacks of communism. To expect to gain something from communism through etiquette is even more childish. Furthermore, to say that countries outside of Europe can defend Europe is especially wrong. It is also unknown whether capitalist countries have expectations of Stalin, but we deeply know that Stalin and his party will one day make capitalist countries aware of their myriad harms.

Exhausting All Efforts to Eliminate Threats

At the beginning of this war, the eastern enemy was only a few hundred kilometers from Berlin, and the western enemy was also within the range of field artillery. The great threat they posed to Germany goes without saying. Today, these enemies have all been driven by the German army to a thousand kilometers outside the border. The German people must have the awareness of making more sacrifices in the future, but today's sacrifices are insignificant compared to the sacrifices if we were to fail. Therefore, I must ask the German people to exhaust all their efforts and continue to resist to the end. The betrayal of the Italian King and his party has indeed had an impact on the war situation, but what the enemy expected has not been realized, nor can it be realized in the future. The enemy's initial hope was to sweep across the Italian mainland, but now they are still advancing like snails southwest of Rome, slowly and deliberately. If the enemy tries to land again on Italian soil, I fear that they will only waste their ships and troops and suffer fierce counterattacks from the German army. Churchill once said that dealing with the Italian army on the island of Sicily and landing on the European continent across the Dover Strait, or landing in Norway and Denmark across the North Sea, are two different matters. Whether the German army's continued use of preparatory strategic measures on a certain front is the result of strengthening or the result of cool-headed calculation, the progress of the war situation in the future will make it clear.

Long-Term Warfare, No Compromise

The intensity of the war on the Eastern Front is something that the German people have never experienced before, but the decision of victory or defeat lies in the final battle, and victory in the final battle will definitely belong to the German people. Regarding the blind bombing of German cities by the Allied air force, I may not give it too much importance. A nation that can destroy a 6 million cubic meter concrete fortification line will be able to quickly transport and rebuild its cities after the war, even more magnificently than before. The German people, tempered by the bombing, will form the vanguard force for retaliating against the Allied forces. At the beginning of this war, British Prime Minister Chamberlain said that the German army had missed the opportunity, but although the war has gradually become prolonged, "General Time" has failed to defeat the German army and has now become an ally of the German army. The war will continue to be prolonged, but the German army will never surrender. According to the propaganda from the Allied side, they have already achieved victory, but the facts are completely opposite. They are busy dealing with their mutual disputes in conference after conference, and that is their true situation. They want to set up various committees to deal with post-war world problems, but they do not know that it is even more important to reorganize the internal situation of the various countries now.

National Unity to Strive for Survival

Comrades, the German people are fighting for their survival against cruel and savage enemies. No matter what happens in the future, the German people will be able to overcome it, and final victory will definitely come. Regardless of whether the people on the Allied side advocate revenge or not, the time for revenge will also come. Although we cannot yet reach the United States, the countries that are considered responsible for the war are all under the control of the German army. The Allied camp has spread various rumors, saying that I have dismissed Marshal Göring from his post, or that Marshal Göring has gone to Sweden, or that Marshal Göring has taken my place, or that the military has taken the place of the National Socialist Party, or that I have arrested Marshal Göring and others, or even that Marshal Göring has a tendency to launch a revolution, and even that I have suffered from neurasthenia, doing everything possible to spread malicious rumors. But no matter what, I will never be disappointed. I have fully studied the past history and deeply know that great victories cannot be achieved without great sacrifices and arduous struggles. The German people and the German army will never allow rebellious elements to live in the country, and under the determination to conquer or die, they will be the pillars of the country, making the entire country as solid as a fortress.

### Municipal Air Defense Headquarters Holds Propaganda Rally; Mayor Chen Personally Presided Over the Meeting Yesterday

Central News Agency Report: The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters of Shanghai City, in order to make the general public understand the meaning of air defense and become familiar with various air defense and emergency rescue techniques, has specifically scheduled to hold the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Air Defense Headquarters Propaganda Rally at the Paramount Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road from the 9th to the 11th of this month, for three days, at 9:00 AM every day. Yesterday (the 9th) was the first day of the rally. In addition to the presence of the chiefs of the various branches of the First Police Bureau, all Baojia personnel above the level of Jiachang from the former Central District, Chengdu District, and Jing'an District were required to attend. Mayor Chen Gongbo, who also serves as the head of the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters, also personally attended and presided over the meeting. The rally began at 9:00 AM. First, Chief Chen delivered a sincere speech to all Baojia personnel, explaining the meaning of municipal air defense in detail. Subsequently, Gu Jiwu, the director of the First District Baojia Office, made an appeal, urging citizens to abandon individualism and work together to achieve the goals of protecting Shanghai and participating in the war. Lu Dagong, a police inspector from the First Police Bureau, and Dr. Watanabe Shigehiro, among others, gave separate lectures on practical air defense essentials and air defense rescue methods. Finally, propaganda films produced by the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters and China United Film Company were screened, and the meeting adjourned at around 12:00 PM.

Mayor's Speech

Everyone: In modern warfare, air raids between enemy countries are very common. The purpose of air raids is nothing more than to inflict military and material losses on the other side, while also disrupting the morale of the rear. Our country declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States on January 9th of this year and has actually participated in the Greater East Asia War. Thanks to the valiant achievements of the Allied land, sea, and air force soldiers, Shanghai has not yet seen enemy aircraft launching air raids. However, the Greater East Asia War is still ongoing. Although the influence of the United Kingdom and the United States in East Asia has been almost completely eliminated, cornered beasts still struggle, and it is difficult to guarantee that they will not try again. Therefore, we should immediately and earnestly prepare, based on the idea that preparedness averts peril.

On the surface, air defense work seems to be the responsibility of the military authorities to a large extent. However, this alone is not enough, and the effect it achieves is not significant. Moreover, if enemy aircraft really arrive, every citizen will be threatened with loss of life and property. This situation is quite obvious and does not need to be elaborated upon. At the same time, local order will also be affected. Therefore, for the sake of their own safety, for the sake of protecting the order of Shanghai, and for the sake of assisting the government in achieving the goal of participating in the Greater East Asia War, the general public of this city should unite and work together for the current air defense work.

We must know that whatever we do, we should have organization and training. Without organization, it is like a heap of loose sand. Without training, we are bound to panic in the face of emergencies. As a result of panic, nothing can be accomplished. Therefore, for the current air defense affairs, from the standpoint of citizens, we have established a "Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Air Defense Headquarters." This headquarters is the highest-level cadre directing the entire Shanghai population in doing air defense work. After the organization is established, we must talk about training. In the past, the municipal authorities have implemented several rounds of training for citizens in air defense, such as lighting control and traffic control, and the results have been quite satisfactory. However, we cannot be complacent and must continue to work hard. For example, how to quickly get the general elderly and weak citizens into shelters during air raids, how to quickly treat the wounded citizens, how to quickly find ways to extinguish fires, etc., we must constantly train. Finally, I want to bring one thing to your attention, that is, during various exercises, we should take them as seriously as if they were real. We must never be casual, thinking that this is just an exercise, so why be so serious? You must know that when we know it is fake during the exercise, our hearts are quite stable. If we do not practice well, we will still be at a loss when a real event comes. Most of those present today are outstanding members of the Baojia in this city, that is, the backbone of the entire citizenry. They should set an example, earnestly advocate, and widely publicize so that when enemy aircraft come to raid, all citizens can make the greatest effort within their own capabilities under the guidance of the authorities, and be able to remain calm and composed in the face of change. Only in this way can the safety of all citizens in Shanghai be guaranteed, and the order of Greater Shanghai can be maintained.

### Customs Strictly Regulates Methods for Moving Currency; Limit of 10,000 Yuan for Carrying Reserve Certificates

In addition to stipulating the methods for transporting goods into and out of the country, the Jianghai Customs has ordered its subordinates to pay close attention. Any acts that exceed the regulations will result in the detention of the goods for punishment in accordance with the law. At the same time, it hopes that citizens will assist by reporting and informing at any time.

### Meaning of Naval and Air Battles in the South Pacific; Press Officer Matsushima Delivers Speech

Central News Agency Report: The naval air force on the [Japanese] side fiercely attacked the [US] fleet on the 8th, sinking or destroying 20 enemy main battleships and other ships, and destroying 12 aircraft, inflicting a great blow on the enemy. The fact that Roosevelt hastily convened an emergency meeting with the highest heads of the army and navy on the 8th shows the enemy's embarrassment. Senior Colonel Matsushima Keizo, the press officer of the Fleet in China, gave the following speech on the significance of the naval and air battles in the South Pacific since the beginning of November:

Sinking three enemy battleships alone is a great achievement. In addition, sinking or bombing cruisers, escort ships, transport ships, etc., to a total of nine ships, and seriously damaging eight ships, can be said to be a major victory since Pearl Harbor. Recently, the U.S. military has fiercely attacked Bogenville, the last stronghold of the Japanese army in the Solomon Islands, and New Britain, to advance to Rabaul. The Japanese navy also met the enemy head-on. The main battle of the modern era has opened fiercely. Since October 31, enemy warships have moved north from the waters off Bogenville Island. After being discovered by the Japanese army, they were closely monitored. Sure enough, a part of the enemy landed on Mona Island and Buka Island, and another part landed on the west coast of Bogenville Island. The Japanese navy immediately rose up to fight, and fierce battles have been fought every day since October 31, reaching ten days. In the battle in Bogenville Island, the air force has already achieved the [illegible]. In this battle, in addition to the Second Bogenville Air War, our side's victory is becoming increasingly clear. Moreover, the Japanese army lost only 12 aircraft. The disparity in strength between the two sides can be seen from this. However, we are not complacent about this. Our soldiers will be more diligent. In mid-October, the [US] aircraft were numerous, often attacking [Bogenville] and New Britain in large formations of 100 or 200 aircraft. Recently, after the Japanese air force fiercely counterattacked, it has also suffered heavy damage. Since the beginning of November, the number of enemy aircraft attacking has suddenly decreased. For example, on the 7th and 8th, only dozens of enemy aircraft attacked. Therefore, the decline in combat power is an undeniable fact. The damage suffered by the enemy in this naval and air battle, if it is transmitted to its citizens, will cause great shock. At the same time, it will inevitably lead to deep doubts about the future of the war.

### Municipal Government Notice: Matters to Note for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday

### Baojia Associations to be Responsible for Future Mass Movements

Central News Agency Report: The Ministry of Interior recently issued an order to the Baojia Committees and related agencies of all provinces, cities, and counties regarding the division of management rights of pro-people organizations and the implementation of mass political guidance. Following the instruction of the President of the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior convened a meeting of various ministers, including Minister Chen of the Ministry of Construction, Minister Hai of the Ministry of Industry, Minister Lin of the Ministry of Propaganda, Minister Xian of the Ministry of Food, Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare, and Vice Minister Yang of the Ministry of Education. After reviewing the results of the meeting, the following was decided:

Promoting the New Movement and implementing mass political guidance will henceforth be based on the use of Baojia. The original Baojia Committee of the Ministry of Interior will be attended by members from the central ministry, the Propaganda Department, the Ministry of Social Welfare, the New Movement General Association, and the East Asia League China General Association. Baojia committees will also be established in all provinces, cities, and counties, directly under the provincial, city, and county governments. Local [illegible] Departments and local agencies affiliated with the Propaganda, Social Welfare, and New Narrative Associations, and the East Asia League will also participate. In the future, the Baojia Committee will be responsible for large-scale mass movements. Therefore, from now on, the Baojia Committee will be responsible for large-scale mass movements. It is reported that after receiving the order, the Municipal Baojia Committee has notified the relevant agencies to send personnel to participate in the organization.

### Personnel for the Cotton Control Association Have Been Partially Determined; Primarily Composed of People from the Textile Industry

The Cotton Control Committee, an external organization of the Commercial Control Association approved by the Executive Yuan to oversee the unified purchase and distribution of cotton, is actively being organized. With the arrival of raw cotton from the three major production areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the control work must be carried out continuously to find a good way to achieve [unified] sales and distribution. The organization of the committee is primarily composed of people from the textile industry, with the participation of commercial association cadres. The committee will be jointly organized by both Chinese and Japanese parties. After careful consideration by various parties, the Japanese newspaper reported that the committee will be headed by Tang Shoumin as chairman, with Yi Lüqing, Nie [illegible] Sheng, and Tei Takashi as vice chairmen. The directors are Wen Guanshi, Feng Junsheng, Liao Fangyuan, Guo Shun, [illegible] Jingtang, etc. There are still six Japanese members who have not been decided. The upper-level structure is

Economic circles [illegible] comment

### What is Valued in Lower-Level Organizations

Whether any organization is sound or not depends on whether its lower-level organizations are sound. This is especially true for control organizations that base themselves on the spirit of establishing a wartime economic control system. In order to maximize the efficiency of the controlled economy policy and economic control organizations, strengthening the lower-level organizations is its most prerequisite issue. What is valued in lower-level organizations, we said when the National South Industry Control Association was first established, can be compared to the chassis of a car and all its parts, even a screw; first, every part and every part of the chassis must be complete everywhere, without any defects or damage; second, the entire chassis and each part must be able to cooperate with each other and cooperate with the entire chassis, in addition to its own integrity. The principle of what we value in the next [illegible] organization is similar to this.

Recently, there have been reports that the Commercial Control Association will convene a meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss how to decorate the lower-level organizations. We feel that at least two key points should be included in the considerations of the Commercial Control Association authorities: First, in the undertakings handled by various trade associations, they should emulate the commercial associations in Japan and manage common undertakings as their main economic purpose. The so-called common undertaking is an undertaking that each member cannot do or is inconvenient to do even if they can. Therefore, in Japan today, they completely adopt the method of joint purchase and joint responsibility. It is not enough to only use the prevention of business malpractices and the correction of transaction methods as a plan to regulate trade associations. Second, in terms of personnel under the jurisdiction of the Commercial Control Association, it is not enough to simply use the four words "fairness and integrity" as a motto, even if it lives up to its name. At the same time, it is necessary to promote the uniformity of its type, the intensity of its work, the improvement of its technology, and the increase of its efficiency, and investigation, research, inspection, etc., are all necessary undertakings to strengthen the lower-level organizations of the Commercial Control Association.

### This City's Municipal Bonds to be Drawn and Redeemed Regularly: The Finance Bureau has Submitted a Request to the Municipal Government for Approval

It is noted that the "Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Bond Regulations of the 31st Year of the Republic" stipulates that bonds shall be drawn and redeemed three times a year. Now that the first drawing and redemption period has arrived, it is scheduled to take place on the 15th of this month at 9:00 AM at the Bank Association on the 5th floor. The procedures for drawing and redeeming the bonds have been submitted by the Finance Bureau to the Municipal Government for approval and filing. In addition, notifications have been sent to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Audit to dispatch personnel to supervise the process on site. It is also learned that the bureau has not only sent letters to the Fund Management Committee to dispatch personnel to jointly handle the bond drawing, but also sent notifications to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bank Association, the Money Exchange Association, the Shanghai Central Reserve Bank, and the Shanghai Fuxing Bank, among others, to appoint representatives to conduct the drawing, to demonstrate solemnity. All special guests and citizens are welcome to observe freely. The bond redemption procedures are excerpted below:

Redemption Procedures: In accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the "Shanghai Municipal Bond Regulations of the 31st Year of the Republic," bonds will be drawn and redeemed every half-year, with each drawing redeeming one-twentieth of the total amount. These procedures are specifically established for this purpose. The amount of each redemption period is as follows: (A) ¥10,000 notes, 30 notes, ¥300,000; (B) ¥1,000 notes, 125 notes, ¥125,000; (C) ¥500 notes, 130 notes, ¥60,000; (D) ¥100 notes, 100 notes, ¥10,000; (E) ¥50 notes, 100 notes, ¥5,000. All bond numbers issued with the last two digits matching the drawn numbers will be considered winning tickets for redemption. There are a total of 100 drawing slips, numbered from 001 to 100. The supervisors will first verify that there are no errors and then place them into the drawing box. Five representatives will each draw one slip to determine the winning numbers. All numbers that have already been redeemed will be removed during subsequent drawings and will not be included again.

### Upper and Lower Limits After the Securities Exchange Opens

The China-South Securities Exchange in this city officially opened for business some time ago, setting limits on the price increases and decreases for listed stocks: Stocks priced below ¥50 are limited to a fluctuation of ¥0.25; stocks priced between ¥50 and ¥100 are limited to ¥0.50; stocks priced between ¥100 and ¥200 are limited to ¥1; stocks priced between ¥200 and ¥500 are limited to ¥2.50; stocks priced between ¥500 and ¥1,000 are limited to ¥5; and stocks priced above ¥1,000 are limited to ¥10. Some people outside the exchange, misunderstanding the true meaning of these limits, believe that stocks with a face value of ¥10 or less can only increase or decrease by ¥0.10 and cannot exceed this amount. According to inquiries made by our reporter, the actual situation is different from what outsiders believe. The exchange's limits actually mean that for stocks with a market price of ¥10 or less (and so on for other categories), there is no limit to the amount of increase or decrease in increments of ¥0.10. For example, they can increase by ¥0.10, ¥0.20, or even ¥1.00, without any restrictions. However, they are not allowed to increase by ¥0.15 or ¥1.15. Similarly, when decreasing, they are only allowed to decrease by ¥0.10 or ¥0.20, and not by ¥0.05. Stocks below ¥50 increase or decrease in increments of ¥0.25. Therefore, there is no limit to the increase or decrease of stock prices. However, the way of rising and falling in the past was unusually chaotic. Now, it is tending towards unification.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday was the first day the securities exchange opened. Trading procedures were already proficient, and the trading volume also increased. However, telephone installations have not yet been fully completed, causing discrepancies between the stock prices quoted by various stock companies and the market prices within the exchange. Overall, the situation is still weak, mainly due to tight credit and weary sentiment. Major players are still reluctant to release their old stocks, resulting in only slight declines. Due to excessive buying of some new stocks in recent days, the buying frenzy has subsided, leading to a general decline. A breakdown of various industry stocks is provided below: Department Stores: Wing On Company briefly rallied after breaking through the barrier, but then showed a slight decline again. Sincere continued to fall. Chinese goods remained flat outside the barrier, with a slight decline on the left. Textiles: Wing On Textile is approaching the barrier. China Textile experienced the most significant decline, with Asia, Seng, and Rong also showing declines. Among the small-denomination stocks, only Lun Wah saw an increase, trading at 2.9 times its face value. Ruital, Xinji, Tianlun, Dagong, Hongsheng Weaving, and Tong, all remained flat. Jingfu and Jinglun socks also saw slight declines. Pharmaceuticals: New Asia Pharmaceutical initially rose slightly, but quickly declined. Zhongxing China France saw a slight decline. Wuzhou, Sengyi, Xinjiu, and Fook Yook Pharmaceuticals all saw slight declines. Industry: Great China Match experienced a slight decline, with Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company experiencing a larger decline. Jiu An Industrial saw a slight rebound. New Asia Construction also saw a moderate decline. Guohua Investment opened high at 80%, Shanghai Film Luo Ding, and Zhunwei MSG remained high outside the barrier at over double, with active trading. After Consoo's retreat from the barrier, it rebounded. China Cement and China Merchants Cement were both firm, while Amoy Canning saw a slight decline.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Public Bonds: Yesterday's prices suddenly rebounded after several days of consolidation, mainly due to short covering. As a result, the bullish forces were stronger, and there was a potential for a turnaround in the future. However, it remains to be seen how strong the buying power will be. Class C bonds opened firm but contracted at one point. Soon, however, buying pressure dominated, and they slowly rose, ultimately rising by over a foot compared to the previous day. Class A, B, D, and E bonds also followed suit, rising by seven to eight inches. Grains: With the exchange open, rice and grains arrived, showing a slight increase in prices. Demand for oilseeds and grains remained sparse, and the market trend was dull.

### Communications Bank Agricultural Loans Reach ¥60 Million: To Cooperate with Various Banks

Since being ordered to develop agricultural and industrial prosperity, adjust the economy, and handle rural loans, the Bank of Communications established an Agricultural Economics Department in May of this year. Based on investigations conducted by personnel in the rural areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, the implementation of loan measures has resulted in a total of ¥60 million in rural loans disbursed to date. These funds have largely been provided to the agricultural sector for grain and miscellaneous crop farming, farmland irrigation, and land reclamation. In addition to collaborating with related parties to increase food and cotton production, the bank will also cooperate with various banks in the city to handle agricultural products.

### Bank Loans to the Silk Industry: ¥70 Million

The silk industry in this city previously established a ¥100 million loan agreement with the banking industry. However, due to the later timing of the procurement season, it has been decided to reduce the amount to ¥70 million. Of this amount, ¥35 million will be borrowed by the China Silk Corporation, and the remaining ¥35 million will be jointly borrowed by various silk mills. The term is set at nine months, with an interest rate of 1.2% per month. Payments from silk mills will be made using commercial promissory notes. It is reported that the loan agreement will be provided by the Bank of Communications and other major banks such as Zhejiang Industrial Bank.

### Dialogue Between Tokutomi Sohō and Honda Kumataro – Continued from November 5th

Resolution for Decisive Battle and the Japanese People

Honda: As a result, what are the views of Britain and America regarding the war? Judging from news reports and telegrams up to the present day, all their academic ideas are nothing but deceitful talk. They are counting their chickens before they hatch, talking grandly about the League of Nations.

### An Empty League of Nations

But the League of Nations up to now is ultimately an empty theory, as it lacks military power. Churchill previously delivered a speech at Harvard University on the Anglo-American alliance, but the Soviet Union expressed great indignation because Churchill did not mention an Anglo-American-Soviet alliance. Consequently, the Anglo-American plan is to realize the world's police force. They want to suppress the Soviet Union in Europe to a certain extent, sacrifice Japan in East Asia, and place Turkey, the Near East, Western Europe, the Far East, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Atlantic region under Anglo-American cooperation! In reality, they are placing everything under the police power led by the United States. In short, they want to use international police force to punish the world.

In the past, even enemy countries could join the League of Nations, so, in order to win over Germany, the position of permanent council member was kept vacant from the beginning, waiting for Germany. The new international structure is not like that. If it is a defeated country, they want to destroy it thoroughly. This can be seen in the statement of the US Secretary of State Hull and in the speech of Grew. Regardless of Germany or Japan, they want to erase their unique national character and national identity. Roosevelt and Eden even said they would march into Tokyo. They decided to occupy it.

### Germany's Heartbreaking Grief

From the perspective of Germany, being occupied for five years in the Rhineland under the treaty is a great and profound pain. I once went to the Rhineland, but I was not interested in the European customs. What made me most uncomfortable was seeing signs on the walls of boats sailing on the Rhine that said, "Anyone who sings German patriotic songs or other similar patriotic songs inside the ship will be handed over to the military court of the Supreme Commander of the occupying forces." They want to do the same in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and other places. They let the weakest countries occupy the most important places, such as letting Belgium occupy the first zone of the Rhineland. The feeling of humiliation, "You have now failed," is deeply etched in the minds of the German people. Therefore, Germany occupied Belgium at all costs this time. If they occupy Tokyo, it will subject the Japanese to the greatest humiliation! Another humiliation is making the local people serve the occupying forces to comfort the troops. This is a burden on the local autonomous bodies. Therefore, the German people are heartbroken when they talk about the occupying forces. We should now know that if there is an atmosphere of negotiation among us, it means we have been defeated. We must not only realize what will happen after defeat, but also that our victory can easily make us complacent, so we should be very careful. We must resist to the last person. To uplift the people's spirit of decisive battle, we can do anything, whether it is speaking or writing papers, to give them a deep understanding of the war and let them know that if they are defeated, they will suffer the same cruel fate as Germany and Austria. Westerners have a very strong sense of racial difference. When the Anglo-Saxon people face Japan as victors, the conditions might be even harsher than the Treaty of Versailles, and there will absolutely be no more lenient terms.

### Municipal Facilities in Shanghai after the Takeover of the Concessions

—

In the blink of an eye, it has been three months since the takeover of the concessions. During these three months, municipal facilities have been improving every day. I believe that making municipal administration perfect is not a task that can be accomplished overnight; it requires a long period of continuous progress and improvement. Let us now review the facilities that have already been implemented.

Gates Open Day and Night: The iron gates between Districts 7 and 8 were originally obstacles of the old concessions. Although the municipal authorities have not yet planned to dismantle them, several important town gates have recently been opened day and night, providing convenience for city residents. It is hoped that the authorities will further dismantle all the iron gates in the future, so that Districts 7 and 8 can be merged into one, and that citizens will not have a psychological impression of separation.

Gradual Prohibition of Opium and Gambling: Opium and gambling can ruin a person's life. Many are addicted to opium and gambling. The areas of Hai Ning Road in District 1 and Fangbang Road in District 7 are truly full of opium dens every five steps and gambling houses every ten steps. These dens of iniquity have ruined countless people. Currently, the municipal authorities have banned opium dens and gambling houses in the Hai Ning Road area, and are also in the process of banning opium dens and gambling houses in the Fangbang Road area, as well as the jai alai hall and dog racing track on Avenue Edward VII in District 8. It is expected that all of these dens will be eliminated by the end of this year. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will use decisive measures to ban them all at once, so that these dens of iniquity will not exist in part or continue to harm citizens by changing their appearance.

Improved Teacher Benefits: The Shanghai municipal authorities, recognizing that the salaries of teachers and staff in private schools in various districts of the city are meager, have initiated subsidies for teachers in private schools, encouraging the spirit of teaching. Although the subsidies currently received by each teacher and staff member are still small, they are certainly much better than in previous years when there were no subsidies. It is reported that the municipal authorities plan to subsidize each teacher and staff member with ¥300 per month as a daily living allowance. If implemented, teachers and staff will naturally be able to alleviate a significant portion of their living expenses with this subsidy. However, under the current price index, teachers' salaries are still among the lowest. How to further secure their livelihoods in the future is also a matter of great importance.

Allocation of Daily Necessities: Currently, daily necessities such as rice, flour, sugar, and oil are allocated by the authorities according to population. As for salt, matches, and soap, these three items are also allocated according to population. Other items such as coal briquettes, towels, and cloth may also be allocated according to population in the near future. However, it is hoped that the quantity allocated should be increased appropriately in the future, so that the quantity allocated is not too far from actual needs.

Prohibition of Renting Commissions: The general second landlords in the city, when subletting the remaining rooms to third tenants, in addition to collecting monthly rent, also collect a commission, with the higher amount accounting for the full year's rent, and the lower amount accounting for half of the full year's rent. It is only for profit and is truly hateful. Recently, the municipal authorities posted notices strictly prohibiting second landlords from charging this commission, and those who violate the law will be punished. This is truly a virtuous act, but there are still a small number of second landlords who knowingly violate the law. It is hoped that the authorities will allow citizens to report them and enforce the law effectively, so that citizens can live in peace first and then prosper.

Strictly Maintain Traffic Safety: Proper maintenance of traffic will surely lead to a safe environment. The intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road in District 1 has a constant flow of vehicles every day, which hinders pedestrians. The municipal authorities, seeking traffic safety, have installed traffic steel barriers, similar to those at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Fourth Tibet Road; citizens are absolutely not allowed to walk in the middle of the road to prevent the danger of vehicle collisions. In the future, this should be promoted in other places as well, so that traffic in Shanghai can reach the realm of perfection.

### Beware of Swindlers

Around 10 PM last night, while my family was already asleep, we suddenly heard a knock on the door. I opened it to find a young man of about 20 years old, with slightly red eyes and a skilled manner of speaking. He claimed to be an apprentice from the Fuyu Transportation Company and said that our goods had arrived and that we should quickly prepare a slip to pick them up, otherwise, the company would not be liable for any losses. He then wrote down an address, "No. 134, Yanghang Street," and said that he still needed to urge others to pick up their goods and asked me to go ahead first. Upon arriving at the address, I found that there was no such house number or company. Realizing that it was a hoax, I hurried back and asked my younger brother, only to find out that after I left, the young man had returned to our shop and said that he had lost the note I had written. He then asked my younger brother to write another one. My younger brother, being young and unaware of the deception, wrote another note and handed it to the young man. Upon hearing this, I realized that I had fallen for the trick. I immediately checked the items in the shop and discovered that a woolen overcoat worth over ¥2,000 hanging on a coat rack was gone. The next morning, I found a scrap of paper discarded by the young man with a shop name and a telephone number. I checked the address and went there, only to find out that this shop had also fallen for the same trick and lost a pair of leather shoes. I hope everyone will be careful of these swindlers.

### Responding to Winter Clothing Donations

With the arrival of winter and the bitter north winds, the poor are struggling to feed themselves, let alone clothe themselves. They have no choice but to seek help from the outside world. We have recently received many letters of appeal, all requesting winter clothing. We have begun to publish these letters in succession since yesterday. Yesterday, Mr. Huang Jiepu donated ¥1,000 as a winter clothing subsidy. Mr. Ye Gong also sent a letter donating ¥500, stating: "I read in your column that a poor teacher is requesting winter clothing, and I cannot help but sympathize. The salaries of teachers in our country have always been extremely low, not even as good as the income of an apprentice in a store. Various newspapers and commentators have repeatedly published calls to improve teacher benefits, but there has been no effect to this day. I am giving this small amount of ¥500 to the poor teacher as a form of mutual assistance to remedy the situation. (Note: The funds have been received and saved. Thank you. They will be distributed evenly to each poor teacher.)"
