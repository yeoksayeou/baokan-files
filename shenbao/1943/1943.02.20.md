### Mobilizing People's Strength and Public Education

The core of all wartime policies lies in the concentration of national strength, employing it in a planned and organized manner. Therefore, the mobilization of material and financial resources is valued by the government. From the wartime economic policy guidelines to all material controls and price restrictions, everything aims to utilize national strength more effectively to ensure the thorough implementation of national policies. However, we consistently believe that the most fundamental strength of a nation lies in its human resources, especially the awakened power of the majority of the people. All enlightened modern governments pay attention to the work of "awakening the masses," especially during wartime, when they particularly value the awakened power of the people.

Given the importance of "awakening the masses," this task is not easy and cannot be achieved by chance. To "awaken the masses," it is necessary to face the people, delve into their lives, genuinely understand their hardships, and solve their problems. Only through appropriate education and training can the masses be truly awakened and organized. Moreover, truly awakening and organizing the masses cannot be achieved by tying people's queues together like the Chongqing regime, preventing them from dispersing at will, nor can it be accomplished merely with a declaration or a few slogans. Consider how Japan was able to defeat Britain and the United States; this is certainly attributed to the military, but to whom should the military be credited? Isn't it the result of decades of military national education? Moreover, it is evident that Japan's victory over Britain and the United States is also reflected in the education, training, and organization of its general populace. Only by delving into the masses, enlightening their minds, can we truly awaken the people, mobilize their strength, and achieve a state of total war.

We must strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, and we must go through an even more arduous and difficult struggle. The hardships we currently experience are far from over. Furthermore, this is an excellent test for our ancient China with its 5,000-year history. Therefore, we must now fully prepare, and the vast human resources must be thoroughly mobilized. Anyone who harbors a侥幸心理 (jiǎoxìng xīnlǐ, a mentality of侥幸 or "leaving things to chance") towards victory or a 苟免心理 (gǒumiǎn xīnlǐ, a mentality of "seeking temporary ease") towards hardship will only increase the difficulties ahead and encounter unexpected phenomena.

How can we cultivate a sound fighting consciousness among the people, how can we awaken and organize the masses to achieve the task of mobilizing people's strength and fulfilling national policies? The fundamental and targeted solution naturally starts with improving and promoting national education and public education: First, we must develop a national literacy movement to completely eliminate illiteracy. Illiterates account for more than 80% of the total population in our country. So many people do not even know their own national characters, let alone understand the state of the nation, society, and the world. Ignorant and uneducated people are an obstacle to policy implementation in peacetime, and they cannot exert the nation's strength in wartime. The government must clearly establish countermeasures, implement them within a limited time and space, and regard the eradication of illiteracy with the same importance as eradicating epidemics and bandits. Second, we must universally develop vocational and supplementary education. The former aims to provide all aspiring individuals, regardless of gender, with the basic knowledge and skills for various wartime production sectors, cultivating a large number of production soldiers in a short period. The latter aims to provide general occupational personnel or out-of-school adults and youths with the basic knowledge of citizens in the new era, enabling them to have a clear understanding of the state of the nation, society, and the world, and a correct understanding of their own positions and responsibilities. Third, political, military, police, public movement, economic, cultural, and educational departments should launch cadre training movements. All levels of staff in the above departments should participate in appropriate cadre training courses. After a certain period of training and qualification, they can secure their positions or be transferred to new positions that are suitable for them. In order not to interfere with their original work, a rotational training system can be adopted. At the same time, new personnel needed by various departments in the future should be recruited from cadre training courses. As for the content of the training, one is the business, knowledge, and skills of various departments; the second is international knowledge and wartime laws; and the third is service ethics.

The implementation of all mobilization plans and the practice of total participation in the war depend solely on human resources. Awakening the masses is the most urgent political task today, and promoting public education is a prerequisite for practicing this political task. We specially put forward this point, and we sincerely hope that all relevant parties will launch discussions and jointly formulate plans for implementation.

Attending the Anniversary Ceremony and Giving Instructions

Xuzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) At 10:00 AM today, the Chairman gave instructions at the anniversary ceremony of the establishment of the Suhuai Special Zone. The main points were as follows: (1) He highly praised the spirit of the people, security teams, and youth in the Suhuai Special Zone, as well as the achievements in reconstruction and construction. Twelve years ago, he had visited Xuzhou many times. At that time, the Executive Yuan worked on the train for a month. This time, although he only stayed in Xuzhou for one day, he could not say that he had fully engaged all five senses (body, heart, hand, eye, and mouth), but in just one day, the situation he had personally experienced and heard had greatly improved compared to twelve years ago. This improvement was achieved after the war, especially in the last two or three years. This was all the result of the concerted efforts of the officials and people in the special zone and the cooperation of friendly nations, which he was very grateful for. (2) He gave earnest instructions on the three points put forward at the beginning of this year: popularizing the spirit and training of the New Citizen Movement, ensuring public security, and increasing production. He stated that the organization and training of the youth corps and the promotion of the East Asia League Movement had made considerable progress. He expressed his gratification that the security of the Suhuai Special Zone was gradually established, the bandits were gradually disappearing, and there was no fear of food shortages. He pointed out that they should go further, strive to implement the National Spiritual Mobilization and total participation in the war, strive for the complete establishment of public security, and make the production of the Suhuai Special Zone more advanced, and make up for the insufficient. He also said that they should seek convenience in transportation and study the methods of linking needs to make the economy of the Suhuai Special Zone closely connected with the whole country. The chairman concluded this paragraph by saying that promoting the New Citizen Movement, ensuring public security, and increasing production were already very important. After the war, it became even more important. (3) In the past year, the foundation for the victory of the Greater East Asia War had been laid. This year would be the year to ensure the results of the war. He was very optimistic about the bright future of the Greater East Asia War. He then discussed the overall situation of the European war, pointing out the optimism of the future from the political, military, and economic aspects. The future of China, facing the bright future of the war, depended entirely on its own sincerity and efforts. He encouraged all staff and the public to make the greatest efforts to strengthen the country and develop the people's strength, and to cooperate with friendly nations with the greatest sincerity. (4) Regarding the unity of national politics, economy, and military affairs, he pointed out that the 21 districts under the Suhuai Special Zone were divided from Jiangsu and Anhui. Although the political regions had changed, the national politics, economy, and military affairs were unified. This unity did not change due to changes in political regions. As long as we understood this point and continued to work hard, we could contribute the most to the local area and the country while considering the local situation and enhancing national unity. Moreover, we would make the greatest contribution to East Asia with the overall strength of the country. In the afternoon, he spoke to people, students, and Japanese residents from all walks of life.

Meeting with Reporters and Giving a Speech

Xuzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) At 9:40 AM on the 19th, Chairman Wang of the National Government met with Chinese and foreign journalists at his residence and gave a speech, saying that he had been here twelve years ago. He had returned yesterday and saw that the general public was very energetic. When he inspected the security team today, he felt that their spirit was also very good, especially the young people who were particularly lively and lovely. As for the construction of streets and bridges, there had also been progress. He was very gratified by this situation. It had been five years since the Incident, Administrative Commissioner Hao had been in charge here for two years, and the Administrative Commissioner's Office of the Suhuai Special Zone had been established for a year. Looking back on the past and seeing the present, he could feel gratified. The Suhuai Special Zone has a total of 21 counties and 1 city. According to Administrative Commissioner Hao, there was no fear of food shortages. He was gratified for the people of Suhuai. At the beginning of this year, he had proposed three points: to popularize the spirit and training of the New Citizen Movement, to ensure public security, and to increase production. These three things must be achieved this year. Especially after the National Government joined the war, the whole country must work hard towards these three points. Xuzhou was the same. He hoped that all officials and the public in the Suhuai Special Zone would bravely advance and achieve the above three things, and cooperate with friendly nations to complete the Greater East Asia War in order to complete the mission of reviving China and defending East Asia.

Especially in Central China, a large-scale new operation has been launched in two aspects. One is the attack on the main force of the Lu-Su War Zone (80th Army) on the 13th. This is an annihilation battle against the Chongqing army that disrupted the rear of the Japanese army. It is being gradually reduced under the cooperation of the Japanese aircraft and thoroughly cleared. Powerful troops of the National Government army also enthusiastically assisted in this battle. In Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, the Japanese army began to attack from Shashi and Nanchang on the 15th, and the mobile units on the river closely cooperated with the Japanese army and quickly launched new actions. A bloody battle is currently underway on the shore of Bailuhu Lake in Hubei Province.

Overview of Operations of the Japanese Army in North China

Beijing, 19th (Central News Agency) After the National Government joined the war, the elite troops of China and Japan joined forces to severely suppress the remaining Chongqing Communist army, demonstrating the true spirit of cooperation between the two countries. The North China Japanese Army Headquarters announced an overview of the army's operations in January on the 18th. It is estimated that in early January, it went to suppress about 4,000 men of the 15th Security Brigade of the Chiang faction, who were active north of the Guangji Line in Shandong Province, and went to suppress about 2,500 men of the Li Xianshou Department of the 92nd Army of the Chiang faction, who attempted to cross the Yellow River from Henan Province and go north, inflicting heavy damage on them. Also, the Chiang faction army in Shanxi Province, which was planning to be active in the Hongdong County area, was dealt a major blow, and its counterattack attempts were completely crushed. Other elite troops, with the enthusiastic cooperation of Chinese military officers and civilians, launched attacks everywhere against the Communist army. In mid-January, they launched a painful suppression against the Nie Rongzhen Group Communist Army in various parts of the Taihang Mountains, completely destroying their last base. Also, in Shandong Province, they launched fierce attacks on the Shandong Column and the Jicha-Lu Border First Military Sub-District (east of Dexian), the Second Military Sub-District, and the Border Region Military Commander, who were active in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Xu Shangwu, the commander of the Second Military Sub-District, had been killed. The army abandoned more than 2,000 bodies and fled. Also, various units composed of Japanese army security forces, county police, and anti-Communist commando teams in all parts of North China launched attacks on the Chongqing Communist army, which was planning to be active in January last year, and their attempts have all been in vain. Also, General Wu Huawen, commander of the newly compiled 4th Division of the Yu Xuezhong Department of the Chongqing-Lu-Su War Zone, and General Yu Huaian, commander of the newly compiled 1st Division, led their troops to join the peace camp, causing great confusion in the Chongqing army in the Lu-Su War Zone, and its anti-Japanese consciousness was greatly frustrated.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 19th (Domei News Agency) According to a report from Washington, Ms. Chiang Soong Mei-ling delivered a speech at the US House of Representatives yesterday afternoon, with the main points as follows: "Our opponents are quite likely to be underestimated. The general opinion is to first focus on Adolf Hitler, believing that defeating Japan is a relatively secondary matter. Continuing to allow Japan to be not only a major potential threat, but also a future hidden danger, is not what the United States wants. We must not forget that Japan now has greater resources in its occupied territories than Germany. We must not forget that the longer Japan possesses these resources without hindrance, the stronger its country will become. The Allied powers have not inflicted a blow on Japan's military strength, and Japan continues to be a threat to the Allied powers."

### German Air Force Active on Eastern Front, Fierce Fighting West of Kharkov, Part of Soviet Forces Withdrawing Elsewhere, Seemingly Preparing to Fight in the Dnieper Bend

Fuhrer Headquarters, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – According to German commanders, German aircraft are very active in the eastern front regions of the Donets River basin, Kharkov, Orel, and Lake Ilmen. Following the thaw in western Caucasus and the lower Kuban River, there are only minor engagements. German forces continue to advance south of Novorossiysk. Soviet forces attacking in the Donets River basin and Kharkov region were repelled after fierce fighting. Soviet forces launched multiple attacks southeast of Orel, but were repelled and lost several tanks. German aircraft bombed enemy forces with great success. Soviet forces continued their fierce attacks southeast of Lake Ilmen, suffering heavy losses. Although Soviet forces were aided by tanks and aircraft, they were repelled in all attacks against German positions. Soviet attacks in the area between Lake Ladoga and Leningrad were also repelled, with many casualties. A Soviet unit was routed, and Spanish volunteers fought with great success. The city and port of Murmansk were bombed.

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – Street fighting in cities often causes extremely heavy casualties for the defending forces. The Soviet army, based on traditional habits, enjoys being embroiled in such fighting, but the German army, in order to cherish manpower, actually disdains to do so. The motive for the retreat from Kharkov lies in this. Now the German forces that have retreated from that city can be transferred to a wider theater of war to engage in more mobile warfare. The military effect obtained will naturally be far greater than being trapped in the city. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the area west of Kharkov. The enemy forces are advancing towards the Poltava area. Part of the enemy's forces in Kharkov seems to have withdrawn to other places, intending to fight in the Donets Basin and the Dnieper River bend. This is indeed the most important area in the southern part of the Eastern Front. German forces north of Taganrog Bay and in the western part of the Donets Basin are retreating according to a set plan. The situation in the Kuban region and the Taman Peninsula is also the same.

Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to front-line news, on the 18th, German forces destroyed all military facilities in the city of Kharkov and then withdrew from the city. The German garrison annihilated the majority of the attacking Soviet vanguard units in the southern suburbs of the city, while still holding the Poltava railway stronghold. German forces also launched counter-offensives in the areas of Raojiangbo and Godogov, 40 kilometers northwest of the city, in order to contain the Soviet offensive against Poltava. In addition, Soviet forces in the Donets Basin are advancing towards Mariupol, attempting to cut off the German rear, and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with German forces. In the Starino border area, Soviet forces have made no progress. Furthermore, in the Donets Basin to the Kharkov area, the weather has suddenly changed drastically in recent days, with temperatures reaching around 10 degrees in the morning, so the area has turned into mud, greatly hindering the operations of both armies.

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – Responsible sources stated last night that Soviet forces landing in the coastal strip near Novorossiysk continued to be repelled by German forces. The Soviet side attempted to reinforce with motorboats, but to no avail, and two motorboats were sunk.

Soviet Union Concentrating Forces, Attempting to Attack Poltava

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 19th (Havas News Agency) – In the past 24 hours, although fierce fighting has continued on the Eastern Front, no major events have occurred. The battle situation in each area is recorded as follows: (1) Kuban Region: According to Soviet war reports, the Red Army has made slight progress near the city of Krasnodar. However, the bridgehead on the Kuban River has been reduced according to the planned schedule, and the troops garrisoning the area have been transferred elsewhere to fight. The German army seems to be still adopting a "flexible defensive strategy." (2) From the city of Rostov to the city of Taganrog, the Red Army originally advanced along the Sea of Azov coast, but today the Soviet war reports did not mention any progress by the Red Army, apparently encountering strong German resistance, causing the Red Army to change its direction of advance to the north and occupy the town of Ergan. (3) The battle situation in the Donets River basin is chaotic. The Red Army has suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources, but has still failed to make progress. Soviet radio also admitted that the Red Army encountered fierce German attacks near the city of Kramatorskaya and is still engaged in fierce fighting. (4) Donets - Dnepr District, according to military observers, the war situation in this area is dominated by the railway problem. The Red Army has concentrated all its forces, attempting to attack the city of Poltava from the city of Lozovaya, but has encountered strong resistance. The Red Army General Headquarters has concentrated troops in the area of Gravron, Pogoduhov, Yameyev, and Alekseevka, attaching great importance to the city of Poltava, which is regarded as a major center in military strategy. According to the history, when Russia and Sweden went to war in 1709, Peter the Great won a great victory in the vicinity of the city, defeating Sweden. If the Red Army wins in the city of Poltava, then the Soviet propaganda machine will take the opportunity to compare Stalin with Peter the Great. In short, the Red Army General Headquarters, regardless of the losses suffered by the Red Army, will continue to adopt an offensive, during which time the weather is really favorable to the Red Army, because the mild climate has caused the ground to partially melt, making the German motorized units useless, while the Soviet cavalry can move freely. In addition, the 23rd of this month is the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, so the Soviet Union has been publicizing it to all parties.

### Goebbels Delivers Important Speech, Informing the German People of the Truth of the Situation

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered an important speech last night in the sports hall, informing the people of the truth of the situation and the German leaders' painstaking efforts, and encouraging the people to work together to strive for victory. Thousands of people responded with enthusiastic cheers, an unprecedented scene, rare since the National Socialist Party came to power on January 30, 1933. About 10,000 people attended, including the Japanese and Italian ambassadors, important officials, soldiers, wounded soldiers, and male and female workers from various factories. When Goebbels shouted slogans, the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The full text of Goebbels' speech is as follows:

Lessons Awaken Europeans from Their Dreams

We should not trace the roots at this time and make unnecessary discussions. Today's merits and demerits should be left to future generations to judge. Time waits for no one. We must immediately take swift and thorough action. The Battle of Stalingrad is the greatest warning to the German people. The lessons of this winter war should have awakened the European people from their dreams. The rulers of Bolshevism, with their strict methods, conceal their country, so that at the beginning of the war, we failed to make an accurate estimate of their combat potential. Today, the vastness of their combat power is fully revealed, so we must now deal with them with the strength of the whole country. The threat of Bolshevism to Germany and Europe is no less serious than that to the East. Germany should pay attention to the following three points: (1) If the German army does not conquer the crisis, Germany and Europe will be ravaged by Bolshevism one after another. (2) But the German army and Germany are now fighting side by side with friendly countries, and they do have the strength to save Europe from this predicament. (3) Now that the crisis is imminent, we must recognize reality and deal with it effectively. If Germany is reddened, the intellectual class and the leadership class must first be purged, and the working class will be driven to become slaves of Bolshevik Jews, and all other countries in Europe will be poisoned one after another.

Unity is the Only Way to Resist the Crisis

No one can believe that Bolshevism can stop before our borders and no longer spread. The promises of the Kremlin and the guarantees of the British and Americans are all unreliable. We have all recognized the real crisis. The German people will never be willing to suffer this persecution, and they do not want to beg for mercy from others. If Germany, the strongest military power in the world, cannot conquer this red scourge, then what country in the world can bear this arduous task? The neutral countries in Europe at present have no power to resist even slightly. The Soviet mechanized units can ravage the countries in a few days. If Europe really falls into the hands of the Soviet Union, will Britain and the United States be able to stop it from crossing the strait? Therefore, Europe must no longer be divided, but must be united under the leadership of the new order and the Axis powers, and then it can use military power to resist the Soviet Union from invading Europe. Today, no one in Germany wants to compromise. The people of the whole country have made up their minds to fight hard, but they still hope that the whole of Europe will pay attention to this. Today's crisis is not only suffered by Germany, but the whole of Europe is suffering from it. Bolshevism uses international Jews to cause trouble in Europe. Germany has seen through its treachery, so it has risen up and is willing to fight against it, vowing to wipe it out and never give in halfway. This is the duty that National Socialism should fulfill. Now that the war has developed to its highest point, Germany will not waver its fighting spirit and will end this war with victory.

Lower Living Standards, Strengthen Strength

Goebbels said that the Allies were engaged in major military preparations before the war. The suffering suffered by the Soviet people for the past 25 years was caused by this. If you want to overcome the Bolshevik danger, there is only one way to use the Soviet method to strike the Soviet Union. The German nation has now encountered the most serious problem in this war, and must take great risks to protect all it has and obtain what it needs in the future. We will not hesitate to lower our living standards again to strengthen our defense forces. Now the period of total war has arrived. We underestimated the degree of danger, so we did not use all our strength to fight. Now we must go all out. The resources of our country and Europe under our control must be thoroughly developed. The German people are sacrificing their flesh and blood to protect Europe, and Europe should also exchange labor for it. Today, there are some Europeans who do not understand the purpose of our war. In the future, they will kneel before us and apologize not far away. The method we use should not be judged on its merits or demerits, but on whether it is successful. All Germans must contribute the most active assistance, regardless of poverty or wealth, they should all engage in the same work. In order to achieve the final victory, we must make greater efforts to fully contribute to the Fuhrer, so that he can launch another offensive in the spring and destroy Bolshevism in one fell swoop.

Luxury Equipment Should Be Shut Down

The German people should only think of war, and should not think of anything else. Only in this way can the war be shortened. The largest and most active war is also the shortest war. In the event of total mobilization, all luxury equipment should be shut down. However, cinemas, concert halls, etc., which are necessary to regulate the workers' spirits, should continue to exist. The immediate priority is to make the soldiers on the front line concentrate on war, and the workers in the arms factories concentrate on production. The current measures are tight measures for the war period. The middle class will be most disadvantaged by this, but it can be restored after the war. In order to cope with the threat of Eastern Europe and Britain and the United States, this is the only way. If Britain and the United States dare to try to land, they will definitely be hit head-on. The German people are willing to be commanded by the Fuhrer, regardless of the danger. Japan, Italy, and friendly countries have repeatedly given blows to the enemy. We believe that the final victory is ours. When spring comes, the enemy will know how much our offensive power has been exerted.

The German Nation States Its Attitude

Finally, Goebbels asked various questions, such as whether you deeply believe that the final victory will be won, whether you are willing to follow the Fuhrer through fire and water, whether you are determined to continue preparing for war with all your strength in the front and rear, whether you are willing to obey if the Fuhrer requires you to work 14 to 16 hours a day, whether your faith in the Fuhrer is stronger than in the past, whether you agree to crack down on those who loaf and take shortcuts, and whether you agree with the principle of enjoying the same rights and fulfilling the same obligations regardless of poverty or wealth. Every time a question was asked, the audience responded with cheers. Goebbels said that the questions asked have all been answered by you. You are a part of the German people, and the attitude of the entire German nation can be seen from this. We can work without hindrance. We are willing to contribute to the Fuhrer and the soldiers on the front line with the strength of the whole country, and we deeply believe that the final victory must belong to us. The rise of the country must encounter storms. This is our motto.

### Stalin's New National Policy: Preparing to Rename the "Red Army" as the "Russian Army": Intelligence Obtained by Berlin

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – According to intelligence obtained here, Stalin is preparing to change the name of the Red Army to the "Russian Army," and at the same time, he plans to adopt the usual European conventions for the status and titles of Soviet military officers. The purpose of this measure is to enhance the spirit of Soviet military officers. All of these belong to the new national policy held by Stalin. Stalin's policy was planned before the outbreak of the Eastern European war, and now he is using the war period to promote it vigorously, and even using the former Russian Emperor Peter the Great and the Russian generals Suvorov and Kutuzov in the Napoleonic era as examples for the people. These people were once regarded by the Soviet Union as representatives of capitalism, but now they have reversed their previous arguments. This is not surprising. The Soviet propagandist Ehrenburg recently published an article in "Pravda," changing the terms "Soviet people" and "Soviet Union," which he had always used, to "Russians" and "Russia." This matter is contrary to the principles of Bolshevism. If it had happened before 1933, it would have been regarded as treason, but today it is done publicly. The purpose of the Soviet propaganda machine is to make the people understand that this war is being fought for patriotism. In addition, the implementation of the titles of the Imperial Russian era for Soviet military officers, the establishment of the garrison army, the use of high-ranking military officer gold thread badges, and the order that political commissars in the army be appointed as formal military officers are all measures for the same purpose. Because Soviet farmers have little interest in the war, Stalin has to implement his new national cause quickly in order to boost the morale of the people.

### Germany Prepares for Spring Offensive

(Asahi Shimbun's Moriyama Special Correspondent, Berlin, 11th) The German General Staff, anticipating that the Sixth Army trapped in Stalingrad has no hope of escaping danger, made the decision to withdraw the German forces from the Caucasus. During the withdrawal, the heroic resistance of the Sixth Army prevented the advance of the Soviet Caucasus forces, so about two-thirds of the German forces in the Caucasus were able to withdraw smoothly without suffering any damage. At that time, the German forces' operational goal was to build a solid defense line in the Rostov, Voroshilovgrad, and Kursk areas to block the Red Army, and they had no intention of occupying other places. Therefore, they were willing to abandon the winding sections of the Caucasus and the Don River area. The entire Soviet army had been struggling for the past two and a half months, reorganizing their offensive, but the result failed to meet their wishes. The Kursk position in the north first faced a crisis, and the key point of Rostov at the mouth of the Don River in the south was also under attack by the German army. The public believed that the German General Staff had made a major decision at that time, which can be seen in the German authorities' explanation on the 9th:

"The German army, for strategic reasons, has decided to abandon the Caucasus and Don River areas acquired last summer and is now beginning a planned transfer."

The starting point of last year's offensive, from Taganrog on the Sea of Azov northward, connecting the area of ​​Stalino and Kharkov, this time the German army will retreat back to last year's starting line, or will transfer its position to the west in order to obtain a foothold in the winter defense line. The current policy of the German army is to remain calm for the time being, waiting for the Red Army's ammunition to run out, and the soldiers to be tired and unable to advance, while the other side maintains the foothold for the third offensive this spring. The German vanguard generals and the rear citizens all endured their grief and lay on firewood to taste the bitterness, and the whole country was mobilized to rush to build a large number of new weapons in preparation for eliminating the Red Army's resistance forces this spring. In terms of weather in the battlefield, the thick snow will melt around mid-March, and mechanized units will be able to attack, which is still five weeks away.

At present, the weather is around zero degrees in the Caucasus, and the weather is coldest in the central area from Rostov to Lozovaya, with an average of minus 18.5 degrees to 23 degrees. Leningrad in the north is slightly warmer, around minus 7 degrees.

The area currently under fierce fighting from Rostov to Kursk is the most unfavorable battlefield for the German army in terms of weather and climate in the winter battlefield, and the soldiers are fighting bloodily in the ice and snow every day. Recently, there is a very interesting publication in the German side, which studies the German-Soviet war in the winter, recognizing that the climate of the winter battlefield is suitable for the German army to attack in the summer and suitable for the Soviet army to attack in the winter. The German army is well versed in this method, recognizing it as a famous saying that will never change. According to the operation last summer, the Soviet army adopted a retreat strategy to preserve its strength in preparation for the winter offensive. In the first offensive, the German army severely attacked the Soviet field army. Although the German army eliminated millions of Red Army soldiers, it did not prevent the enemy's resurgence of resistance. In the second offensive, it only occupied its vast territory and failed to destroy its combat power. Therefore, the German army has realized that when continuing to fight against the Soviet Union in the future, it should avoid strategies aimed at territory and must strive to annihilate the main force of the Soviet field army like the first offensive. It is expected that the target of the German army's third offensive this summer will also focus on this point. (Translator: Translated from Asahi Shimbun on February 13th)

### The Intensifying Conflict Between the British Government Party and the Labour Party

Geneva, 18th (Havas) – The British Labour Party's proposed "Beveridge Security Plan" has been rejected by the House of Commons. Consequently, the conflict between the government party and the Labour Party is intensifying. According to Minister Without Portfolio Greenwood, a Labour Party leader, the Labour Party will continue to make its utmost effort to implement the plan. Therefore, the Labour representatives participating in the government are in a delicate position due to the Labour Party's strong opposition to the attitudes of Prime Minister Churchill and Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood towards social issues.

### Gandhi's Ninth Day of Fasting: Health Deteriorating Further; Requested to Meet Nehru to Consider Handing Over Leadership of the Independence Movement

Xiong City, 19th (Associated Press) – According to news from New Delhi, Gandhi's condition is worsening. His eldest son, Devdas Gandhi, obtained permission from the Bombay government and left for Poona this morning to visit him. He is expected to arrive tomorrow evening.

Xiong City, 19th (Associated Press) – Yesterday was the ninth day of Gandhi's fast. His health continues to deteriorate. Mr. Sun, president of the India League of America, sent a special telegram from New York to Prime Minister Churchill, Viceroy Linlithgow, and Ambassador Halifax, urging them to pay attention to the danger of Gandhi's death from starvation, and warning of the consequences should this occur.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to the Asahi Shimbun, Gandhi requested to meet Jawaharlal Nehru, leader of the National Congress Party, on the 17th. Nehru, like Gandhi, was imprisoned on August 10th of last year. It is said that Gandhi's request to meet Nehru is to consider handing over the leadership of the Indian people's independence movement to Nehru in case he dies from fasting.

Stanford, 19th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from New Delhi states that the Indian Viceroy's Office announced on the 18th that Gandhi's condition remains worrying, his heart is becoming weaker, and he was very listless on the 18th, sleeping for nine hours.

As a result, forty-four people, including twenty-three female students, were arrested.

### Japan and the United States Have Different Objectives in the War; Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, Mr. Sato, Explains in the Japanese House of Representatives

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Sato, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Army Ministry, pointed out today in the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives the differences in the war aims of Japan and the United States. The main points of his speech are recorded below: Although Britain and the United States initially claimed to uphold democracy, they have combined with communism, the enemy of democracy. Therefore, their so-called upholding of democracy and liberalism cannot inspire the war spirit of their people. Last April, Roosevelt also said that this war was a war for survival, but the American people were not moved by it. By July, Secretary of State Hull also said that this war can be called a war for survival, but the American people did not believe that the United States could not survive without fighting Japan. Therefore, the Undersecretary of State was extremely distressed by the incompleteness of the war objectives, and wanted to find a way to actively explain the war objectives of the United States. Broadly speaking, there is no significance to war. However, Japan's war objectives have been clearly stated in the declaration of war, which is natural in view of the course of the war, that is, to establish self-existence and self-defense, and then to ensure the stability of East Asia in order to contribute to world peace. This is our country's traditional national policy. The United States threatened our self-existence and self-defense militarily and economically. If we continued to endure, Japan would have no way to survive, and was forced to this desperate situation, and had to rise up for self-existence, self-defense and survival. We first established this self-existence and self-defense. However, if we only established Japan's self-existence and self-defense, it would still be insufficient. Japan's current position is to ensure the stability of East Asia and to move forward in the natural way of a war that implements national policy. This is to fight to implement national policy, to rise up to establish self-existence and self-defense. This is the posture of Japan in the war, and the great purpose of the war. Prime Minister Tojo also clearly stated the guiding principles of this war in his policy speeches at the 79th Diet and the current Diet. The entire guidance of our country's war is based on this great purpose. However, they started a war with Japan without any need. Judging from the course of events, it is all Roosevelt's ambition. Japan-U.S. negotiations entered the right track in April of Showa 16 (1941), but after our army advanced into southern Vietnam, Japan-U.S. negotiations completely stalled, and by the time funds were frozen, we entered a stage where we had to fight. However, thanks to Prime Minister Konoe's documents, Japan-U.S. negotiations were able to reopen. At the beginning of Japan-U.S. negotiations, the first issue was the China issue. If Roosevelt had properly considered the China issue and sought a solution based on justice, it could have been expected to pass smoothly. However, he had been completely fooled by Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda. Secondly, although Secretary of State Hull had always insisted on principles, he was unable to restrain the hawkish arguments of the young bureaucrats in his State Department and the hawkish arguments of some within the Navy. The politics of the United States is not dominated by affairs, but by the affairs that dominate, resulting in this great war. Looking back at the situation at the time, only Japan and the United States could have saved this world from being plunged into great chaos. From the point of view of Japanese diplomacy, our side believes that the Japan-U.S. war will gradually expand the current world war, and there is a risk that it will destroy all of human culture. Therefore, Japan and the United States should cooperate with each other to save the world from disaster. If the United States speaks from the justice and humanity it advocates, it should be able to save the world war. However, due to their various mistakes, they formed a reversal of direction. We would like to clarify this point to the whole world, that is, their war objectives are contradictory, and they launched a war without a reason for war, which is their biggest mistake. There is no need to embellish this, nor is there any need to exaggerate it, but it is appropriate to announce the facts to the whole world.

### British Planes Attack Germany, Shot Down Six; France and Belgium Also Bombed

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – Reliable sources here announced this morning that six British planes were shot down by German anti-aircraft guns during the large-scale British air raid on the German coast. Enemy planes dropped many bombs on residential areas, causing considerable damage to residents and destroying many houses.

Geneva, 18th (Havas) – According to news from London, British planes bombed the railway in Tours, France, and the power plant in Aubervilliers, Normandy, today. Belgium was also bombed.

### The Tense Situation in Tunisia: Major Battles Are Just Beginning; The Central Railway Network Has Fallen into the Hands of the Axis Forces; Britain Admits That the Eighth Army's Advance Has Halted Again

Rome, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – The Italian General Headquarters announced in a war bulletin today that Gafsa and Sbeitla in central Tunisia have been occupied. The German and Italian air forces made outstanding contributions in this battle. The squadrons dropped bombs on enemy troops at low altitude and strafed them with machine guns. In this battle, 2,876 enemy prisoners, 169 tanks, 95 armored vehicles and a large number of spoils were captured, and six enemy planes were destroyed or captured. The offensive of the enemy forces in the north has been repulsed. Tripoli and Benghazi have been bombed by our forces.

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – The heavy blow given by the German mobile units to the US Fifth Army in central Tunisia at the beginning of this week is becoming increasingly apparent. Our army has now advanced to the vicinity of the Algerian border, the area west of Nefta. After Sbeitla in the north fell into our hands, we completed the occupation of Feriana and Kasserine yesterday morning. The enemy troops are still retreating, moving towards Tebessa. Central Tunisia is completely under the control of the Axis forces. At the same time, the railway network in central Tunisia is entirely in the hands of the Axis forces. The convenience of transporting troops is self-evident for the Axis forces. However, it is inevitable that the enemy troops will take the opportunity to mobilize and regain the initiative. Therefore, the major battles in Tunisia in the coming days are just beginning.

Geneva, 18th (Havas) – According to news from the Axis countries and Britain and the United States, local battles are currently taking place in Tunisia. The British side claimed that General Montgomery launched an offensive on a broad front with his Eighth Army on the 17th of this month, but according to the latest communiqué, it admitted that the British army's advance had come to a halt.

US Secretary of War Admits Defeat

Lisbon, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – Washington dispatch: Secretary of War Stimson said at an intelligence meeting yesterday that the defeat of the US forces in central Tunisia was a local defeat and should not be ignored or overemphasized. Many of our tanks were destroyed in this battle, and the equipment and personnel losses were also considerable. However, this result was not entirely unexpected. As the British Eighth Army was reorganizing and the First Army was trapped in the mud, Rommel was able to concentrate his forces to attack the US positions. The strength of the German tank forces was stronger than ours, and it was expected that they would suffer a small setback in a large-scale invasion offensive. It is expected that when the British Eighth Army launches its offensive, the pressure on the German army can be reduced.

Stockholm, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – London dispatch: The "Daily Mail" admits that the war situation in Tunisia is critical, and that the Axis offensive in central Tunisia will threaten the position of the British First Army in the northern part of the country. Therefore, the British army has had to withdraw to the Algerian border. Military observers also said that the Allied forces, except for the British Eighth Army, may be forced to withdraw from Tunisia.

### A Record of the Naval Battle off Rennell Island

(Sent from the Plateau Naval Reporting Unit, OO Base, 13th) The American main fleet, which attempted to counterattack the Solomon Islands, was ultimately no match for the Japanese Navy aircraft. The enemy's large fleet, composed of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, suffered a devastating defeat off Rennell Island on January 29th and 30th, and scattered and fled. The glorious and traditional blitz of the Imperial Navy has added a new page of victory to the naval battles in Hawaii, the Malay Sea, the Coral Sea, the Solomon Sea, and the South Pacific. Two enemy battleships and three light cruisers were sunk to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Victorious in the naval battle off Rennell Island were Japanese naval aircraft. The sea area where this naval battle took place was near where Japanese battleships were last defeated in the autumn. Now, the Naval Air Force has avenged the defeat with a victory. The twilight blitz implemented in this attack was the first since the start of the war. The daring Japanese naval aircraft overcame all difficulties and achieved success. This is a new record in the history of the Greater East Asia War. The detailed report of the naval battle is as follows, learned from the local air force unit:

Japanese reconnaissance planes had been conducting strict patrol flights in the South Pacific for days. On the morning of the 29th, they discovered the enemy's main force gathering and moving north in the sea area south of San Cristobal Island at the southern end of the Solomon Islands. They immediately issued the first report: "Enemy main force discovered!" The U.S. military had set up their favorite wheel-shaped formation, with destroyers deployed tightly to the front, back, left, and right as a close guard. Three battleships were advancing in front, followed by three Class A cruisers and several Class B cruisers. White trails remained on the sea as they advanced. The reconnaissance planes constantly sent telegraphic reports of their movements. The base received the reports and the atmosphere immediately tensed. The entire force concentrated its attention on the enemy fleet's movements, waiting for the order to attack. The enemy main force, not knowing whether it had been notified of our attention, continued to sail northwestward. The liaison planes eagerly took off towards the enemy's position. The base issued the command to bomb. The pilots' faces were filled with a desperate look. The weather was favorable and unobstructed. After a moment of preparation, the propellers began to roar, and with the squadron leader's words of "Good luck to you all," Lieutenant Commander N and Lieutenant Commander H each led a squadron and took off from the base one after another, intending to take advantage of the twilight to attack them unprepared and destroy them in one fell swoop.

The weather near OO Island was gloomy, with clouds covering the sky at a height of ○○ meters. The twilight sun was covering the sea, and the visibility was limited. The bomber squadrons descended below the cloud layer to search for the enemy, gazing at the sea like eagles eyeing their prey, and the formation moved forward towards the area where the enemy was expected to be found. The commander also reported to the liaison plane: "Attack scheduled to begin at ○○ hours ○○ minutes."

At that moment, as if by divine help, several trails could be identified on the gray-green sea. When Lieutenant Commander used binoculars to look at the distant horizon, he discovered black dots. He flapped his wings and moved forward, wanting to see clearly what he had found. The commander's plane also discovered the trails at the same time and immediately straightened the formation to follow the trails, gradually lowering altitude. Under the cover of night, the sparse trails became increasingly gray-white in color. At the end of the white trails, the dark shadows of ships floated. After each plane discovered the enemy fleet, they prepared for attack with excitement. The time was ○○ minutes after sunset. The sky was not yet completely dark, and there was still a hazy color remaining in the west. The bomber squadrons were protected by dark clouds behind them. This was still not considered an excellent opportunity to attack. The enemy was not yet aware that their own doom was imminent. The defensive fire was completely unprepared to "attack." Captain N's squadron seized this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to launch a sudden attack on the enemy's main fleet. The bombers advanced at a height of ○○ meters, passing over the enemy destroyers. The enemy had not yet retaliated at this point. The enemy's giant ships were the target of this squadron, and they flew forward at full speed, aiming at the bow of the enemy ship and launching a torpedo that was sure to hit. At this time, the enemy began to frantically open the gun doors of their anti-aircraft fire. The night was already deep, and the sea was scattered with blood-red sparks. Captain N's torpedo accurately hit the enemy ship's vital point. Before and after Captain N's squadron, several squadrons, including Lieutenant Commander N and Lieutenant T, also broke through towards the enemy fleet, targeting the enemy's giant ships. The defensive fire retaliated from the destroyers, cruisers, and battleships became a clear "beacon," piercing through the flames woven from the fire. A pitch-black battleship appeared before their eyes, like a small mountain. Torpedoes fell like hailstones. Several torpedoes were fired at the number two ship, which happened to be the enemy's flagship. Lieutenant Commander O's squadron selected the Class A cruiser protecting this number two ship as their target. The skilled torpedo accurately hit the Class A cruiser. In an instant, the bow of the ship rose and sank to the dark seabed. After each plane completed its mission, it retreated amidst the intense enemy defensive fire. The bridge of the enemy ship flew into the sky, and the remaining hulls and destroyers formed another incomplete fleet.

As the bomber squadrons crossed the enemy fleet and retreated, concentrated fire from the enemy ships poured down. Petty Officer 2nd Class M was hit in the head and shattered, dying heroically on board the plane. Lieutenant Commander N felt numbness and pain in his buttocks. A bullet pierced the telegraph machine, then pierced the seat and wounded the lieutenant commander's buttocks. When they escaped from the net of defensive fire and completed the retreat, night had already fallen. In the darkness, Lieutenant Commander H's squadron, following this squadron, arrived and used the flames of the enemy ships as their target, concentrating their torpedoes on the burning enemy number two ship. The commander's plane recklessly circled repeatedly in front of the enemy, throwing torpedoes, so that at the moment the torpedoes were dropped, the plane was hit by an enemy bullet and caught fire. Lieutenant Commander H's plane knew this early on, and heroically crashed and exploded at the same time as the plane. The enemy number two ship caught fire all over the ship after this fierce attack, and finally turned into seaweed at the bottom of the sea.

In the darkness, they blindly flew back to the base. The lights emitted from the tail of the plane were spotted by the base, and they shot out searchlights to illuminate the airfield, and the squadrons were able to land one after another. The voice of the commander reporting to the squadron leader was low and dark, like the voice of a person who had been resurrected from the dead. The enemy bullet that wounded Lieutenant Commander N was discovered by the commander's plane. It was a slender steel bullet. In this attack, the Japanese side's sacrifices, including Lieutenant Commander H's plane, totaled ○○ planes. The next morning (30th), a reconnaissance plane that took off again discovered a wounded enemy ship and a towed cruiser. The air force unit waiting at OO base received the order to bomb, ordering them to capture an enemy battleship south of Guadalcanal Island, guarded by Klamath fighters, and moving south at a speed of 4.5 knots overnight. At ○○ hours ○○ minutes, the bomber squadrons began their attack. The wounded battleship tilted to the right and was completely covered in fire and sank. The cruiser also turned into a sea of fire, with its stern flooded and submerged in the sea. The Klamath fighters that were guarding them were also shot down three in air combat, establishing a glorious victory record in the South Sea. ○○ planes did not return that day. Combined with the previous day, a total of ten planes were sacrificed in this battle. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, February 14th)

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Regularly Issues Oil and Sugar Certificates; Still Based on Winter House Tax Receipts; Metered Distribution of Oil and Sugar Not Confirmed; Total Sugar Stockpile Estimated at Approximately 200,000 Bags

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that the Council has issued Notice No. 6265, which stipulates that the eighth batch of rice and flour purchase certificates and the first batch of additional grain certificates, the first batch of cooking oil certificates, and the first batch of food certificates will be distributed starting from Monday, the 22nd of this month. The distribution period and quantity of the three types of certificates for miscellaneous grains, cooking oil, and sugar will be announced separately according to the method of rice and flour certificates. The eighth batch of rice and flour certificates will still be in four coupons, and the first batch of miscellaneous grain and cooking oil certificates will be in two coupons, with two slips numbered first and second. As for the sugar certificates, there will be one slip numbered first. Taxpayers within the boundary can bring the house tax receipt with the date clearly marked on the back to the certificate issuing office in their residential area to collect the respective certificates. Recently, there have been frequent incidents of stealing house tax receipts to fraudulently obtain rice tickets. If the house tax receipts are lost, they should be reported immediately to the certificate issuing office or to Office No. 703 of the Council. In addition, rice and flour certificates are also often stolen. Hereafter, if they are stolen, they will not be reissued. Taxpayers or residents who have doubts about the certificate collection date should inquire at the certificate issuing office in person from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day, except on Saturdays and Sundays. Furthermore, the office hours of the certificate issuing offices in each district are from 9:00 AM to noon and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day, and the office is closed on Saturdays and Sundays.

Pilot Program for Metered Sugar Distribution in Nanshi

According to the English-language "Shanghai Times," while the Sugar Merchants Cooperative is planning to pilot a metered sugar distribution program in Nanshi starting tomorrow (20th), business circles in Shanghai were widely rumored yesterday that a metered distribution system for sugar and oil will soon be implemented by the municipal authorities in the International Settlement, the French Concession, Western Shanghai, and Zhabei.

Suspension of Cooking Oil Sales; Black Market Prices Rise Sharply

The authorities did not confirm or deny this rumor yesterday, although they acknowledged that the current chaotic situation with sugar and oil could be eliminated if the municipal authorities implemented a metered distribution system. It is said that most residents of Shanghai are in dire need of cooking oil, as the suffering caused by the recent two-week supply shortage has been significant. Since the Lunar New Year, the suspension of cooking oil sales has caused black market prices to reach their peak. Although the Shanghai Cooking Oil Trade Association Wholesale Office issued several announcements regarding a metered distribution system at the beginning of this month, it ultimately did not materialize.

Sugar Rationing May Be Realized

Foreigners in the French Concession recently received their third allocation of sugar. Anyone with a bread certificate can purchase four pounds of sugar. As for residents of other municipal areas, they have not received another allocation since purchasing sugar with tax receipts at the end of January. Although sugar is not as important as cooking oil, it is said that the municipal authorities may indeed implement metered distribution soon. It is said that some time ago, the municipal authorities planned a sugar distribution method that would determine the allocation amount based on the degree of need.

Ample Sugar Supply Expected This Year

Since the Sugar Merchants Cooperative took charge of the overall distribution of sugar in Shanghai, the sugar reserves of Chinese merchants after the incident have gradually been depleted. In January, due to the Lunar New Year holiday, social demand for sugar was high, so the cooperative distributed 50,000 bags to cope with the situation. The supply quantity for this month is only about 20,000 bags. The remaining sugar stockpile is only 80,000 to 90,000 bags, which can only be maintained until May or June of this year, when there will be a shortage. In order to enrich the city's sugar reserves, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative has sought to purchase 100,000 bags from friendly countries, thus ensuring that there will be no shortage of sugar this year, with a total sugar stock of about 200,000 bags.

### Silver Trade Requests Easing of Price Limits - Authorities Have Not Yet Approved - Jewelry Trading Still Stalled - Silverware Guild Continues Petitioning

Since the beginning of the new year, the city's commodity prices have skyrocketed, increasingly impacting society and causing extreme public unease. Recognizing this, the Shanghai Municipal Council's (SMC) Commodities Control Department secretly dispatched personnel to investigate retail prices in various industries. They discovered that the four major silverware stores, Fang Jiuxia, Qiu Tianbao, Lao Fengxiang, and Xin Fengxiang, as well as major yarn shops such as Yuanchangyong, Jude, Dakangyong, Xiachenggong, Yili, Baohua, Xiongjuji, Qinfeng, Suitai, and Fengji, had violated regulations by exceeding the price limits set on January 23. Consequently, strict enforcement measures were taken, including sealing up premises and imposing fines, while requiring them to continue operating within the price limits, in the hope of thoroughly suppressing the price surge.

Silverware Guild Continues Petition

Following the strict penalties of closure imposed on the four major silverware stores by the authorities, the stores, through the Silverware Guild, dispatched representatives such as Feng Qing'an to petition the SMC. The outcome was a revised penalty of 408,200 yuan and permission to reopen. However, the price limit of 3,000 yuan was to be maintained. The silverware stores argued that the black market price of gold had already risen to over 38,000 yuan per ten taels, making it impossible to maintain the 3,000 yuan limit. To avoid incurring substantial losses, they have placed a halt on jewelry trading, their main business. According to reporter's sources, the Silverware Guild dispatched representatives, including Feng Qing'an, to petition the SMC's Commodities Control Department today, requesting an increase in the price limit to sustain their businesses, but no results have been achieved yet.

Authorities Giving Careful Consideration

Regarding the Silverware Guild's request to raise the price limit on jewelry, the matter is currently under careful consideration by the authorities in the SMC's Price Control Department. The ability to find an appropriate solution to this issue has a significant impact on the business prospects of dozens of large and small silverware stores in the city. Therefore, the Silverware Guild is hoping that the authorities can make a fair and reasonable decision in the near future.

Jewelry Trading Remains Stalled

According to a follow-up report from a reporter yesterday, although the large and small silverware stores within the two concessions have marked their jewelry prices at the SMC's price limit of 3,000 yuan, they are still adhering to their voluntary halt in jewelry trading. While some silverware stores are selling some gold jewelry to meet the urgent needs of customers, they are only selling pieces with extremely low gold content in order to maintain capital, and are only slightly increasing labor costs to compensate for the losses. This situation is difficult for customers to accept. However, given the potential loss of capital for the silverware stores, this situation is unlikely to improve until the request to raise the jewelry price limit is approved by the authorities.

Silverware Dealers Form Petition Group

According to reporter's interviews, a petition group was formed consisting of two representatives from the "Da Tong Hang" (major dealers), one representative from the "Xin Tong Hang" (new dealers), and one representative from the "Di San Tong Hang" (third dealers, i.e., smaller dealers). In recent days, in addition to repeatedly meeting with officials from the SMC's Guild Section, explaining the industry's plight in detail, and requesting a reasonable solution, they were also received by Mr. Inagaki, the head of the SMC's Commodities Control Department, on the afternoon of the 18th.

Mr. Inagaki Expresses Sympathy

It is reported that Mr. Inagaki expressed considerable understanding of the difficulties currently faced by the silverware industry, as related by the representatives. In addition to promising to give favorable consideration to the request to raise the jewelry price limit, he also expressed sympathy for the industry's recent voluntary halt in jewelry sales in order to maintain capital. Therefore, the Silverware Guild deeply appreciates Mr. Inagaki's ability to understand the merchants' difficulties.

Silver Industry Claims to Be Taking the Blame for Others

According to one representative, the silverware industry has been unfairly penalized by the authorities for moderately raising jewelry prices. Both the Gold Guild and the Silverware Guild truthfully report market prices to the SMC's Guild Section every day for verification. The prices of jewelry sold at the silverware stores are determined based on legitimate market transactions and cannot be monopolized or manipulated by the silverware industry itself. It is hoped that the authorities can make every effort to stabilize gold prices so that silverware stores will not have to take the blame for others in the future.

Increase in Price Limits Not Approved

A reporter made a special inquiry to the SMC authorities yesterday regarding the request by the silverware stores to ease the price limit of 3,000 yuan per tael of red gold. It is reported that the SMC's Price Investigation and Enforcement Committee held a regular meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday and will continue to strictly enforce the policy of severely punishing violations of price limits. It will not permit changes to price limits, and the price limits set for other industries will also be strictly enforced. Violations of price limits will continue to be dealt with decisively and without leniency. It is noted that fluctuations in red gold prices can easily amount to several thousand yuan, and if not strictly controlled, they will affect the price increases of all commodities, making it difficult to suppress them.

### Fourth Ration of Rice in West Shanghai Distributed Yesterday - Flour Rationing to Begin Tomorrow

The fourth ration of rice for the month in West Shanghai has been distributed. The West Shanghai District Office has instructed over sixty rice shops in the three sub-districts within the district to begin distributing the rations yesterday. Each person is entitled to two "sheng" of whole rice at a price of five yuan in national currency. Residents within the district can obtain the rations from designated rice shops by presenting their fourth-period rice purchase certificates. The third-period flour rationing for the month of January will be distributed by the various rice shops starting tomorrow.

### National Government Decides to Establish Price Control Bureaus in Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Other Places - Aim is to Increase Effectiveness of Price Control

A Shanghai dispatch from the Tong Meng News Agency reports that the National Government has decided to establish Price Control Bureaus in Guangzhou, Hankou, northern Jiangsu, and other parts of South China in order to increase the effectiveness of price control. Price Control Bureaus have already been established in Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and four other locations.

### Allocation of Goods Now Able to Be Transacted at Listed Prices - Coal Market Black Market Gradually Subsiding - Non-Rationed Coal Prices Still Hovering at Peaks

Various coal trade associations in this city have now taken unified action to strictly supervise the sale of coal. According to sources, the coal merchants are now able to transact allocated goods at listed prices. Therefore, the illegal coal market seems to be gradually subsiding. However, non-rationed coal prices are still hovering at peak levels. It is reported that this is due to the demand from various factories. Coal merchants with stock are taking advantage of the increased demand for spot goods by hoarding them, causing public anxiety and slightly impacting market conditions. The continued occurrence of these events is extremely detrimental to the entire fuel problem in Shanghai. The authorities concerned are paying close attention and are determined to strictly prevent it. If it is found to be true after investigation, it will be severely punished.

Eighth Batch of Allocated Goods Still Uncertain

Regarding the eighth batch of coal allocation, totaling 4,500 tons, handled by the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, although the amount has been fixed, the implementation has been delayed due to delays. As of yesterday, there is still no definite date. Yesterday, sources in the coal industry revealed that the price per ton has not yet been determined. However, as merchants are in dire need of goods, they are hoping for an early resolution, otherwise, it will affect the operations of the various coal companies. It is reported that the eighth batch of coal allocation has no confirmed date and must await an announcement from the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company.

Cooked Water Coal Awaits Fair Sale

The Shanghai Cooked Water Shop Guild, in response to the request of all its members, has resumed the sale of cooked water at parity prices. It has appealed to the SMC's Guild Section, expressing the plight of its members and suggesting that the ashes from the Yangshupu Water and Electricity Plant be authorized for distribution by the guild to avoid profiteering by contractors. Since the dispatch of the document, no response has been received, so the guild is very anxious, hoping for an early sale of cooked water at parity prices to reduce costs, otherwise, they will be forced to close down.

### Japanese Army Deputy Spokesman Issues Statement

A Shanghai dispatch from the Tong Meng News Agency reports that Mr. Matsuda, the Japanese Army Deputy Spokesman, announced at yesterday's press conference that the Japanese army has transferred troops from Guadalcanal Island to other locations in order to consolidate its positions in the South Pacific. The enemy was unaware of the transfer until it was completed and the Tokyo government issued a communique. In the future, Japan will launch a major air raid on the island. The announcement by the General Headquarters on Wednesday was the beginning. The American troops are isolated there, lacking food, weapons, and supplies, and are in a living hell.

### Japanese Spokesman Hirota Denies Prediction

A Shanghai dispatch from the Tong Meng News Agency reports that Mr. Hirota, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, pointed out at yesterday's press conference that the report in the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" on February 17, claiming that he predicted that Stalingrad would soon be captured by the Germans, was a misrepresentation. He stated that he has never predicted the fall of Stalingrad in past speeches. On February 16, a reporter asked Mr. Hirota if he still held the same opinion regarding Stalingrad, which led to the misunderstanding. Yesterday, he solemnly stated to foreign reporters that what he specifically mentioned on August 4 was, "If Stalingrad falls, it would be a blow to the Soviet Union." On the 16th, in response to the reporter's question, he only said that he was not a prophet and could not say whether Stalingrad would fall.

### 27th Ration Distribution Begins Today

Rice shops in the two concessions will simultaneously distribute the 27th-period household rice ration today. Each rice coupon can be used to purchase one and a half "sheng" of white or brown rice, and one "sheng" of broken rice, totaling two and a half "sheng", at a price of 6.3 yuan in savings certificates, and one and a half pounds of flour for 3.85 yuan in savings certificates, totaling 10.015 yuan. The household rice ration for this period has been increased by half a "sheng" compared to the previous period and will continue to increase in the future. The sale of the 27th-period household rice will last until the 27th.

### Acceptance of Large and Small Parcels to Boping and Liaocheng Suspended

Parcel Notification No. 522 from the Shanghai Postal Administration Parcel Department states that the acceptance of large parcels and large small parcel mailings to Boping and Liaocheng Bureaus in Shandong Province, and those transmitted through the two bureaus, should be temporarily suspended.

### Price Authorities Approve Self-Managed Rationing Systems in Various Industries - Rationed Items Temporarily Limited to Daily Necessities

In order to comply with the authorities' material rationing policy and to facilitate business among members of the same industry, various industry associations in this city have established "Rationing Groups," which have been approved by the relevant senior authorities. Rationed items are temporarily limited to daily necessities for the people. Rationing to various industries is also limited to items directly related to the industry and must not exceed the scope. It is reported that the associations that have already established "Rationing Groups" include the local cotton cloth, leather, and leather shoe industries. These "Rationing Groups" are similar to unlimited liability companies. Once formally established, the following steps will be implemented: (1) Control of the source of goods to ensure a constant supply of finished products and raw materials without interruption; (2) Registration of inventory to prevent hoarding and refusal to sell; (3) Regular and fair allocation of appropriate quantities of goods to shops participating in the rationing group; (4) Negotiation with the authorities to facilitate the transportation of goods and jointly expand out-of-town business; (5) Establishment of a price evaluation committee to assess prices in accordance with the authorities' established policies and instruct members of the same industry to comply, with penalties of suspension of rationing for those who violate the rules.

### SMC's Fines Collected from Stores - All Used for Charity

A public announcement from the SMC's Information Office states that the SMC is currently imposing large fines on stores that violate regulations. In light of this, Mr. Okazaki Katsuo, the Chairman of the SMC, would like to draw the public's attention to the fact that all revenue from these fines will be placed in a special account and will be allocated to charitable expenses in the future or for other purposes beneficial to the residents of the concession. This was stated in the Work Report of the Price Enforcement Section for the previous year, which was published in various newspapers on January 29.

### Public Concession Police Headquarters Recruiting Economic Talent

It is reported that the Public Concession Police Headquarters is currently planning to recruit dozens of people familiar with economic conditions. Applicants must have a university degree, be between the ages of 22 and 28, and have a clean background. Once accepted, the salary will be generous. Those who wish to apply can send a letter to the Second Section of the Criminal Special High Section of the Police Headquarters, but the envelope must be marked with the words "Application."

### Scholarship Funds Barely Adequate - Reduce Introduction of Free Students - Supplement Remaining Funds for Needy Students in Various Schools

The 4th Shanghai Newspaper Readers' Scholarship Fund has previously received letters from various schools donating free and half-fee places to support young people. Apart from introducing students for enrollment based on applications, this newspaper, thanks to the generous donations from various sectors, has found that the scholarship fund is barely adequate. Therefore, enrollment checks have been issued and efforts have been made to reduce the introduction of free places. Considering the sincere enthusiasm of various schools in supporting education, it is proposed that schools be allowed to grant free or reduced fees to needy students from their own student body to make up for the shortfall in this newspaper's scholarship fund. Schools are better informed about the true circumstances of students than this newspaper. This is the reflection that this newspaper wishes to contribute after the various schools have generously donated free places.

Extending Consideration to Others - Scholarship for Tuition

This newspaper received a letter from Wang Zuquan, a second-year student at Fu Ren Middle School, stating that he received a special scholarship from the school authorities this semester, exempting him from tuition for one semester. Feeling uneasy about this, he will donate the tuition fee of 300 yuan (150 yuan each from your newspaper and the News Daily) to your newspaper's needy student scholarship fund to express his gratitude. He hopes to receive your guidance and acceptance.

A major bank wrote, stating that they have 280 notebooks. Currently, paper prices are very high, and it is not easy for poor students to buy notebooks. They are sending the remaining notebooks and respectfully request your newspaper to collect and distribute them. (This newspaper will comply and distribute them by name when visiting the students.)

Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday - Yesterday's scholarship funds received: Song Xian 1,000 yuan, Xing Jingji 500 yuan, Wang Zuquan, second-year student at Fu Ren Middle School, 150 yuan, Xi Shishang (in memory of his late wife, Madam Bei Zhanlin, forwarded by Mr. Pu Qiting) 100 yuan, totaling 1,750 yuan in savings certificates, with a balance of 418,332.42 yuan.

### Automatically Cancel Scholarships

Wang Dongshan, junior high school 2nd grade, Zhu Zhiping, junior high school 3rd grade, Zhuang Guoping, senior high school 1st grade, Ma Wenbin, senior high school 1st grade, Liu, Zhiqiang Tai Miaolian, senior high school 3rd grade,

Approved for Change of School

Zhang Zongjiang of the Industry and Commerce Group transferred to Guan Qun Vocational School, scholarship of 31 yuan, Jin Yumin transferred to Mitsui Japanese Language School, scholarship of 40 yuan, Yi Zhenqiu transferred to Shanghai College, scholarship of 140 yuan.

### Cultural Community Received - Hayashi Fusao

Mr. Hayashi Fusao, a master of Japanese literature, recently arrived in Shanghai from Beijing. To express welcome and promote cultural exchange between China and Japan, Chen Dongbai and others jointly organized a tea party reception at the Jinmen Hotel on the 8th floor yesterday, the 19th, at 3:00 PM. Prominent figures from the city's news and culture sectors were invited to accompany, totaling more than 30 people, including Wang Ping. Mr. Hayashi, accompanied by Mr. Mon'ya Hiroshi, arrived at the meeting at 3:00 PM, creating a lively atmosphere. Chen Dongbai was elected as chairman and delivered a welcoming speech, introducing the guests. Then, Mr. Hayashi and the attendees successively delivered speeches, discussing the characteristics of Chinese and Japanese culture and how the two countries could seek closer cooperation. After exchanging views, they enjoyed tea and snacks. Finally, Mr. Hayashi stood up and expressed his gratitude, and the gathering ended happily at 5:30 PM.

### Exchange Standard Water Ladles - Extension to End of Month

Although the deadline for exchanging standard water ladles for cooked water shops in the city was the 15th of this month, it was learned yesterday that the association, considering that the owners of various cooked water shops have limited knowledge and are not familiar with the procedures, has decided to extend the deadline to the end of this month to take care of the welfare of the industry. However, exchanges must be carried out promptly during this period, and no leniency will be shown if they continue to wait. Not only will the exchange date not be extended further, but the matter will be reported to the authorities for punishment in accordance with the law.

### Measures to Improve Traffic Order at the North Railway Station

Record of Discussion

After the traffic authorities announced the measures to improve the order of entry at the North Railway Station yesterday, this newspaper expressed its gratitude on behalf of the travelers. At the same time, we hope that the authorities will continue to seek improvements to achieve the most ideal situation. We also hope that travelers will continue to report on travel conditions after the improvements and provide practical suggestions for the authorities to consider.

However, on the 16th of this month, this newspaper felt that relying solely on readers' reports was insufficient to substantiate the facts. Realizing the necessity of on-site inspection, letters were sent inviting Chinese and Japanese individuals concerned about social issues to set off for the North Railway Station for inspection yesterday afternoon. Coincidentally, the authorities announced the improvement measures the day before. The colleagues felt that the purpose and mission of the previous plan for on-site inspection had been largely achieved, so it was temporarily suspended and changed to a discussion meeting. Mr. Yoshida (Anti-British and American Association), Mr. Hirao (Asahi Shimbun), Mr. Itagaki (New Shanghai Newspaper), Mr. Oba (Yomiuri Shimbun) from the friendly Japanese side, as well as Mr. Zhang Yizhu, Mr. Li Quanshi, and Mr. Lu Gaoyi, personally participated, along with three reporters from this newspaper, to exchange views and draw conclusions, which are as follows:

Expectations of the Traffic Authorities

(1) More entrances and exits should be set up at the station and should be separated.

(2) More police officers should be assigned to the baggage inspection area. The inspection area should be located outside the station building and set up with low counters with awnings. Objects being inspected should not be placed on the ground. Care for passengers' luggage should be treated with the same care as one's own luggage.

(3) As many ticket windows as possible should be set up. In addition to the regular opening and closing times for most windows, two more should be designated to sell first and second-class and third and fourth-class tickets separately, with ticket sales available at any time from dawn to late night.

(4) Outside each ticket window, the number and name of the ticket seller on duty should be marked on a small wooden sign with white lettering on a black background.

(5) Passengers and checked baggage should enter the platform separately.

(6) Ticket offices should be set up in suitable locations in the city, or travel agencies and major hotels should be entrusted to handle ticket sales.

(7) A passenger opinion report box should be set up.

(8) Tea parties should be held from time to time, inviting representatives from all walks of life to provide improvement suggestions.

(9) A railway travel guide should be edited and distributed widely, and disclosed in the newspaper to inform travelers of the travel outline.

(10) Senior officials may as well often wear casual clothes and mingle with travelers to experience everything.

(11) Railway staff should treat passengers as customers and treat them with courtesy. Even if beggars buy fourth-class tickets, they should be treated with the same courtesy. If passengers are unclear about the order, they should be given guidance.

(12) Couriers are strictly prohibited from soliciting extra tips (such as guide fees and tips other than the stipulated handling fees).

Expectations of the General Public of Passengers

(1) Do not rush in and out of entrances and exits, and push each other; and let the elderly, weak, women, and children go first.

(2) Carry as little luggage as possible to save inspection time.

(3) Do not use the body to carry and sell objects (for example, on one occasion, a group of women from Changzhou, whose abdomens were bulging, all claimed to be pregnant, but in fact, they were all hiding several pounds of pork to sell for profit, which inevitably affects genuine passengers).

(4) Abide by all regulations promulgated by the railway and follow the good-intentioned guidance of railway staff.

### Banks and Financial Institutions Assist in Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices - Undertake Loans for Production Businesses - Stipulate Mortgage and Credit Loan Methods - Strictly Review to Avoid Promoting Speculation

In order to prevent the use of loan funds to promote hoarding and speculation, and to assist the authorities in suppressing and stabilizing prices, banks and financial institutions have decided to limit all loans to production businesses. Applicants must explain the legitimate purpose and must be approved after strict review before loans are granted. According to sources in the banking and financial industries, the regulations for mortgage and credit loans are: (A) Mortgage loans with commodities as collateral are limited to factories, shops, and firms that are members of the relevant industry association, and the term shall not exceed three months. The bank or financial institution accepting the mortgage shall report to the association and forward it to the authorities for record. (1) The name of the borrower's factory, shop, or firm and the names of other representatives; (2) the amount and term of the loan; (3) the name and quantity of the collateral; (4) the location where the collateral is stored; (5) the registration certificate number of the borrower's factory, shop, or firm and the certificate of the affiliated industry association; (B) For overdrafts and credit loans, each bank or financial institution shall stipulate the total amount of the overdraft and must have a reliable guarantor guarantee that it will be completely cleared before the end of the annual closing period. Interest rates are calculated according to the deposit and loan interest rate market published by the association at the end of each month. The term for credit loans is six months, with the annual due dates being the end of April and the end of October. Short-term loans, i.e., those less than six months, are approved by the lending bank or financial institution based on the credit of each industry and the silver supply on the market. The standards for loans are to increase production in various industries, such as purchasing agricultural products and ordering necessary raw materials.

### Committee for Reorganizing Old Currency - Handles Termination

The Committee for Reorganizing Old Currency was ordered to handle the recovery of old currency issued by the Central, China, and Communications Banks. It was established on June 8th of last year and branch offices were set up within the branch offices of the Central Reserve Bank in various places. Old currency was redeemed at a rate of two to one with new legal tender. It has been more than eight months since then. The committee has now completed the final exchange of old currency in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces and Shanghai and Nanjing special municipalities at the end of November last year. The final exchange in the Guangzhou area was completed on January 25th of this year. The final exchange in Wuhan was also completed on the 15th of this month. The work of reorganizing and redeeming old currency has now been completed, and old currency has been banned from circulation. Therefore, it has been ordered to begin the termination procedures and to send a telegram to branch offices in various places to complete the termination procedures within this month and report to the Ministry of Finance for verification.

### Noodle Product Industry - Flour Not Yet Distributed - Bread Flour Rationing as Usual - Consideration Being Given to Cut Noodles, etc.

The matter of the noodle product industry in this city requesting the SMC to resume flour rationing has not yet been satisfactorily resolved. It is learned that the SMC's Commodities Control Department has continued to ration flour to bread manufacturers as usual, but has not yet resumed rationing for various products such as cut noodles, cooked noodles, "wa pian bing" (thin, crispy pancakes), steamed buns, large flatbreads, crispy flatbreads, and fried dough sticks, which are regarded by the public as economical and convenient food. Although the rice flour rationing office has adopted a joint rationing method for raw cut noodles and cooked noodles, the quantity is limited and insufficient for the industry to distribute. Therefore, they are still petitioning for improved measures. The cake and bun industry association believes that the association has a long history and that the term "cake and bun" includes various economical flour-based foods, such as "wa pian bing," which are economical, filling, and the main food for the poor. Therefore, four representatives, including Zhang Guanshou, Zai Guisheng, Zhang Jinsheng, and Tang Miaoquan, were dispatched to petition the Guild Section and the Commodities Control Department for early allocation of flour for production and sales. It is now learned that it is under consideration.

### Assisting the Authorities in Curbing Price Hikes: Various Industries Expand Price Appraisal Organizations; Agreed-Upon Price Limits for Managed Goods; No Leniency Granted to Those Already Making a Legal Profit

Regarding the city's overall price issue, since the municipal authorities have successively taken effective measures to strictly curb the rising prices of goods, the situation has gradually changed. Currently, the authorities have decided to jointly continue to severely punish illegal merchants.

Separate Organizations of Price Appraisal Committees

Various trade associations in the city, in order to assist the authorities in thoroughly suppressing prices and to standardize the business environment, have been responsible for appraising the standard price limits for goods managed by their respective member businesses. However, their procedures are very meticulous. First, all member businesses are notified to submit the type, price, origin, and amount of inventory of the goods to the association. Then, a price appraisal committee is convened to publicly discuss and agree on standard price limits. After the appraisal is completed, the association prepares a document with a table attached and forwards it to the relevant authorities for review. After their approval, the association officially prints a price list and distributes it to all member businesses for compliance. Those who violate the regulations and secretly sell goods above the price limit will be subject to public discussion and punishment, either by revoking their membership or by suspending their various rights for a considerable period.

Inviting Experts to Participate in Price Appraisal

Currently, those in charge of the various associations, recognizing that if price increases are not stopped in time, it will not only affect social order but also increase the daily burden on the common people, consider curbing rising prices as a top priority. However, in order to deliberate on effective measures and speed up progress, they have separately strengthened the organizational structure of the price appraisal committees. On the one hand, they have sent letters to specialized talents in the industry, asking them to attend meetings on time to participate in the appraisal and carefully study concrete and effective methods to expand the appraisal work. However, all industries, considering that the price limits set in the past have already provided legal profits, have decided not to grant leniency in the future in order to achieve the purpose of the appraisal. If costs increase, they must apply to the association and must not increase prices without authorization.

### Shanghai Old Age Home Broadcasts Fundraising Appeal, Hoping for Enthusiastic Response from Citizens

Havas World News Agency, local news. The Shanghai Old Age Home, located at No. 29, Jichang Street, Nanshi, has been established for 38 years. It specializes in accepting helpless elderly men and women. Anyone close to 60 years old can be admitted to live out their lives. The annual expenses of the home have always been provided by foreign charitable organizations. However, after the war, the number of admitted people has surged, the cost of living has increased, and the supply of provisions has been interrupted. As a last resort, the nuns of the home have been begging all day long to maintain a minimal existence. Recently, the home received the consent of the director of the French Cultural Radio Station in the city to broadcast a fundraising appeal. They have also been fortunate to have the China Boy Scout Corps of Aurora University in the city volunteer to manage the collection of donations. It has started broadcasting every evening from 6:00 PM to 6:50 PM since the 15th of this month. Many enthusiastic charitable people from all walks of life have responded, and a large number of donations have been received. In the past four days, the total amount raised has exceeded ten thousand yuan, so the station staff and all the boy scouts are overwhelmed. However, in order to raise more funds and expand publicity, special programs will be broadcast on Saturday and Sunday, from 2:00 PM every day. On Saturday, a charity performance of Peking Opera will be given by famous opera singers, and on Sunday, a singing contest will be held. It is reported that the singer Yao Li is also enthusiastically joining as a guest performer. All are welcome to request songs and donate. Frequency: 1400. Telephone: 80567.

### Organizing a Cooperative for Education Workers

— Daofu

Another semester has come to an end. Looking ahead, the hardship will be even greater than today. How can we, education comrades struggling on the line of hunger, do our best to improve the situation, so as to avoid freezing and starvation, and to devote our efforts to our work? Increasing tuition fees and raising salaries are undoubtedly important. However, the increase in tuition fees may seem sufficient at the beginning of the semester, but after a few months, it will not seem like much.

What we are currently facing the most difficulty with is the scarcity of daily necessities. The amount of rice and flour per household is far from enough, and the same goes for oil and sugar. Even other daily necessities such as soap, towels, and socks are beyond our reach. It is therefore imperative to have special allocations. Currently, in Shanghai, those working for agencies in the two settlements and the city have extra allocations, which is why they can work with peace of mind, and their efficiency can be improved. Even in Songjiang, Suzhou, and other rural areas, there are cooperative organizations, and all members can enjoy similar extra allocations. Since its implementation, the results have been remarkable. Therefore, it is necessary and possible for education workers in Shanghai to organize their own cooperative and request special extra allocations from the authorities. The enlightened authorities will certainly consider this and provide strong support to make this welfare undertaking a success.

Among the special extra allocations, rice and flour should be the top priority, followed by daily necessities such as oil, sugar, and soap. In this way, in addition to increasing the quantity, the price can also be free from the manipulation of the black market, which will greatly benefit education workers. The impact will not only stabilize the lives of education workers and invisibly improve the effectiveness of education, but also gradually stabilize the instability of society. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be accomplished by the efforts of one department of education workers alone. It requires the combined efforts of several forces to achieve success soon. The Shanghai Education Association and the education guidance agencies in the two settlements and the city should all provide leadership, and we education workers ourselves should make even greater efforts to save ourselves, which is to save society.

### Authorities Take Practical Steps to Improve Transportation, Actively Plan to Build Roads, Avoid Vehicle Accidents, and Protect Citizen Safety

The authorities in the two settlements in the city have been actively planning to improve road construction in order to change the situation within the settlements, so as to make it easier for vehicles and pedestrians to travel and to regulate traffic.

Hiring Workers to Repair Dilapidated Roads

According to reporter inquiries, some roads in the Public Settlement and the French Settlement have shown signs of cracking and unevenness due to years of disrepair. Therefore, investigators dispatched by the authorities have surveyed the sections of streets that need to be repaired, reported them to the authorities, and the authorities have hired workers to repair them in order to maintain traffic.

Adding as Many Tram Platforms as Possible

At the same time, in order to ensure the safety of tram passengers waiting for vehicles, the authorities will add waiting platforms next to the main stations starting tomorrow to avoid dangers caused by excessive crowding. According to reporter inquiries, these added platforms are currently being built by the authorities. Within the realm of possibility, they will be added as much as possible at the necessary locations.

Hoping Residents Will Not Litter

As for street garbage, fruit peels, and other scattered litter, they often cause people to slip and cause accidents. The authorities have also stepped up their efforts to urge cleaners to sweep, and hope that citizens will consider public morality and pay attention. If deemed necessary, the authorities may apply the rules prohibiting spitting to those who litter fruit peels.

### Nanshi Held Terror Drill Yesterday, Cutting Off Traffic for One Hour

Yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM, a terror drill was held at the intersection of Fangxie Road and Linyin Road in Nanshi. At that time, the disguised terrorists opened fire and fled. Wang Baosui, the director of the Xiejiao Branch of the police station, led many armed policemen and all the detectives of the Eighth Detective Team, together with the self-defense corps, to search and arrest the terrorists. At the same time, the iron gates connecting the Nanyang Bridge and the Xiejiao to the French Concession were closed, and martial law was imposed. The roads around Laoximen, including Fangxie Road, Lanwei Ai Road, Lujiabang Road, and Daji Road, were closed to traffic, creating a tense situation. It was not until 4:50 PM that the terrorists were captured, and the lifting of martial law was announced, the iron gates were opened, and traffic was restored.

### Municipal Police Bureau Bans Unhygienic Habits

In order to effectively maintain public health in the city and ensure the health of the people, the Municipal Police Bureau has issued a notice banning unhygienic habits, stating that the public in the city has not fully understood the common sense of hygiene and often dumps garbage on the side of the road, urinates everywhere, and spits arbitrarily on the streets. This not only damages the appearance of the city and willingly exposes unhygienic habits, but also easily spreads epidemic diseases such as tuberculosis, colds, and leprosy, affecting public health. It is therefore urgent to strictly ban these habits in order to emphasize hygiene. In addition to ordering its subordinates to strictly ban these habits, it is hereby announced to the public that anyone who deliberately violates these rules will be punished without leniency. All citizens should abide by these rules.

### New Fruits Arrived in the City

Allied Press, local news. According to a report in the Continental News last night, 2,000 baskets of bananas, each weighing 110 pounds, and 6,000 boxes of oranges and pomelos, each weighing 40 kilograms, have arrived in the city. It has been half a year since Taiwan shipped fresh fruits to Shanghai. Although the bananas are still green, they will soon be on the market. The pomelos will be distributed to make up for the lack of Wenzhou mandarin oranges.

### Shanghai West District's Outstanding Property Tax: Finance Bureau Sets a Deadline for Payment

The Shanghai West Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau has several thousand households in the district that have not paid their property tax for the previous year. According to the financial agreement, the property tax revenue of the Shanghai West District is to be used for the Shanghai West District. Therefore, there was a significant deficit in the Shanghai West District's revenue and expenditure for the previous year, which must be strictly rectified. All outstanding property taxes and other taxes for the 31st year of the Republic must be paid in accordance with the regulations by the end of March this year. If there is any concealment, delay, or underreporting, the Shanghai West Police Bureau will be requested to revoke the residence permit and impose a penalty.

### The Philippines: Past and Present

— Elector

Politics, Finance, and Banking

Since 1908, when the United States seized full power over the Philippines from the Spanish, it has stationed a governor in Manila to rule the entire Philippines, which is essentially a disguised colonial regime. Later, in order to promote the economic prosperity of the United States and to reasonably satisfy the needs of the Philippine people, in 1934, the United States allowed the Philippines to become independent in a short period of time, passing a bill stipulating that the constitution should be completed in 1936, submitted to the US President for approval, and after the establishment of the independent government in the Philippines, the United States would completely abandon any political power over the Philippines after ten years. By 1935, the new constitution had been passed, and Quezon was elected as the first president, establishing an independent government. The president is in charge of the legislative, executive, and judicial powers.

(1) Legislative power, according to the constitution, belongs to the National Assembly. The National Assembly adopts a unicameral system, composed of 120 publicly elected members with a term of three years. It holds a regular session once a year to review laws and budgets, but everything follows the American parliamentary system. The National Assembly may send one member as a resident commissioner to the United States, occupying a seat in the US Congress and being granted the right to speak as a representative of the Philippines. Local councils include the city councils of the six major cities of Manila, Panqi, Cebu, Yiru, Nana, and Sanbaoyan, the state councils of other states, and the village councils of various villages.

(2) In terms of administration, the independent autonomous government has eight departments, including the Department of Interior, Education, Finance, Justice, National Defense, Labor, Agriculture and Commerce, Public Works, and Transportation, as well as the Accounting Inspection Section and the Civil Service Bureau directly under the President. Each department has a minister, and the directly affiliated agencies have directors and bureau chiefs. There is also a vice president, who is also elected by the people in accordance with the presidential law, and exercises his functions in the president's absence, and also serves as the Minister of Education. Local administration includes the mayors of six cities and the governors of forty-nine states. Mayors are appointed by the President, and governors are publicly elected by the state's residents, except in special cases. The mayor of the capital, Manila, is often the most powerful politician, with the hope of becoming a presidential candidate in the future.

(3) In terms of the judiciary, there are the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, the Court of First Instance, the Court of the Peace, and the Manila City Court. All officials are nominated by the National Assembly and appointed by the President.

In addition, there is also the Philippine High Commissioner's Office, representing the US government and stationed in the Philippines. Its officials are appointed by the US President and stationed in Manila. It is the liaison agency between the US and Philippine governments and the highest supervisor of Philippine administration.

The Philippine finance has always been based on complete self-determination. All government expenses are entirely borne by Philippine taxpayers. Since the Second European War, government revenue and expenditure have decreased. Looking at the comparison of the government budget for 1941 with that of 1940:

The main part of the special revenue is the tax revenue from licenses and business tax, import tax, consumption, and income tax.

The financial power of the Philippines has always been in the hands of the Americans. On March 2, 1903, the new currency system established the gold exchange standard with a rate of two pesos to one US dollar. The right to issue currency and exchange coupons belongs to the Ministry of Finance, but the Philippine National Bank and the Bank of the Philippine Islands have a small amount of issuance rights. The currency circulation situation in March 1940 was as follows (unit: one peso):

One peso silver coins: 4,198,073

One-half peso silver coins: 3,979,967

Subsidiary coins: 10,487,842

White bronze and copper coins: 4,065,741

Treasury exchange coupons: 157,573,378

Bank of the Philippine Islands coupons: 1,751,385

Philippine National Bank coupons: 3,459,853

Total on March 21, 1940: 185,523,239

Total on March 31, 1939: 189,421,464

Treasury exchange coupons are prepared at a percentage rate of 15,459,911 pesos in silver coins against 71,238,803.50 US dollars deposited in the United States.

Financial institutions are also centered on the banking industry, and the strength lies in foreign banks. Since 1939, in order to help independence, efforts have been made to strengthen financial institutions, establish agricultural and industrial banks and prepare for city banks, and establish agricultural credit cooperative organizations. Before the Greater East Asia War, there were national banks including the Philippine National Bank (head office in Manila, central bank, capital of 10 million pesos), the Bank of the Philippine Islands (head office in Manila, the oldest bank in the Philippines, a legacy of the Spanish era, capital of 6.77 million pesos), and the Central China Bank (head office in Manila, funded by overseas Chinese, capital of 10 million pesos). In addition, there are the Philippine Trust Company, Savings Bank, Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and Preparation City Bank. Foreign banks include the National Bank of New York, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Chartered Bank, Yokohama Specie Bank, and the Bank of Communications of China. Special financial institutions include farmers' credit cooperatives, postal savings banks, and "Kasiki" (a type of usury with annual interest rates ranging from 25% to 2500%).

Economic Situation Before the Greater East Asia War

The Philippine economy relies entirely on foreign trade. If the trade environment changes, the economy will be hit. Seventy to eighty percent of export trade is with the United States. Therefore, as long as US-Philippine trade is normal, there will be no problems with the Philippine economy. For example, during the huge wave of the world agricultural panic after the previous war, the production of major agricultural products such as sugar, coconut dried, coconut oil, Manila hemp, and tobacco was able to avoid the panic and pass safely due to the artificial protection of US-Philippine free trade. However, when the Second World War broke out and before the Greater East Asia War, the Philippine economy faced a crisis that was not easy to solve.

The European war caused the Philippines to lose the European market, and the intensification of world opposition exacerbated the crisis between Japan and the United States. The Philippine Asian market was also on the verge of being lost. Even US-Philippine trade, which was the lifeblood of the Philippine economy, encountered unprecedented difficulties due to the surge in freight and insurance costs. In July 1941, the United States requisitioned a large number of ships due to the urgent needs of the Atlantic, which further intensified these difficulties. Furthermore, due to the Philippine Export Control Order of May 28, 1941, and the Asset Freeze Order against China and Japan on July 26, the Philippines not only lost the East Asian market starting with Japan, but also deepened the trade crisis due to the inability to use Japanese ships.

The Philippines itself felt that its own ships were insufficient (77,000 tons of ocean-going ships), and all foreign trade relied on foreign ships. Due to the British ships leaving the Philippines one after another during the European war, and the asset freeze making Japanese ships unusable, the shortage of ships was very serious. Take a look at the changes in the ship allocation status of various countries in Philippine trade (percentage).

### Finding Ways to Eradicate Speculation - Yesterday's Commentary from the Continental News

The Continental News' commentary on February 19th stated: "In the past two or three months, prices have slightly receded, but at the beginning of this month, prices were seen to surge again, rendering the authorities' policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices ineffective. High prices are the greatest suffering for the people and a major obstacle to economic construction. Therefore, the issue of price stabilization is an urgent matter that must not be relaxed. Looking back at past price policies, they have been too lenient and passive. The key to the price problem lies in increasing production, not just in using suppression methods. In China's current environment, it is necessary to consider all special conditions, while simultaneously enhancing production and strictly curbing speculative behavior."

"The biggest reason for high prices in Shanghai is hoarding caused by speculative [activities]. If effective measures can be taken against such situations, Shanghai's prices can be stabilized. Since the [Sino-Japanese] Incident, after national capital lost its legitimate outlets, it has been dedicated to speculation, such as speculative buying and selling in foreign exchange, margin trading, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth. However, recently, due to the rigorous crackdown on speculation, large amounts of capital have been unable to be utilized, leading to a resurgence of hoarding and driving up prices. Furthermore, from another perspective, although speculative transactions have been reduced by the authorities' crackdown, they have not been completely eradicated. Margin trading and secret trading of foreign currencies are still active in the shadows. Upon further observation, targets such as hoarding are all for speculation. If this phenomenon continues, the policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices will be ineffective."

"Although the current inventory levels in Shanghai cannot be ascertained, it is estimated that 70-80% have been seized by speculators and hoarded without being released. There is no doubt about this fact. Only 20-30% remains on the market, but even this is being competitively purchased due to the excess of floating capital. If the spot goods on the market decrease, the price of the hoarders' inventory will naturally be high. The more exhausted the market's resources, the more expensive the black market prices for hoarded goods, allowing capitalists active in the black market to reap huge profits. We must first focus on this fact, while also considering the social psychology created by speculative hoarding. The motto of hoarders is that scarcity equals high prices, which leads to manifold profits. Therefore, the mentality of speculators is that they hope for low production, scarce resources, and increased currency issuance, and they do not want the international situation to improve. What ordinary people consider pessimistic, they consider optimistic. What the people are happy about, they take as painful. They must profit greatly when internal and external situations deteriorate. This kind of thinking is unimaginable to ordinary people. Most of China's capitalists today do not reflect on their actions and only know speculation, hoarding, and profiteering. We urgently hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will make a major decision to crack down on speculation, and at the same time, hope that the crackdown on speculation will not be limited to superficial work, but will be implemented effectively, ordering the cessation of all economic activities aimed at speculation, especially the crackdown on hoarding of a speculative nature."

Economic Commentary

### Floating Capital Movements and Prices in Various Regions

Since the beginning of the year, prices have risen sharply. According to those familiar with the banking industry: "Current deposits in various banks in this city have shown a decline." This is said to be a reflection of the resurgence of commodity speculation; we dare not agree. If it were a resurgence of commodity speculation, it would only promote the movement of deposits between banks, and would not cause a general decline in deposits across all banks. The recent general decline in deposits in various banks should be the result of capital moving from this city to the interior.

Since July of last year, the movement of prices in this city has generally changed from a state of sharp increases to a state of gradual progress. For example, the index in July was 2930 points, August 2996 points, September 3035 points, and October 3042 points. The indices for November and December have not yet been seen. Based on the market situation at that time, the general trend was still a gradual increase. However, since January of this year, the situation has changed, with a sharp rise in grain prices leading the way, followed by securities prices. During the red market of the Lunar New Year, this rising trend spread to the general commodity market, and is now even more intense.

Comparing the current rising price trend in Shanghai with that in the interior, there are some noteworthy differences. Let's take Nanjing's prices to represent the commodity market in the interior. In July of last year, it was 2753 points. In August and September, it showed a sharp decline, with September at 2337 points. However, starting in October, it rebounded. In October, it increased sharply to 2721 points, and in November it increased even further to 3245 points. Indices since December have not been seen, but based on the sharp rise in prices in the Qingxiang District in January as reported in yesterday's newspaper, it can be seen that the extent of price increases in the interior is actually greater than that in Shanghai at the same time.

In the past, Shanghai's prices often led to price increases in the interior. Looking at the situation above, it can be said that interior prices are now leading Shanghai's prices, which is not impossible. Therefore, the nature of capital moving from this city to the interior needs to be strictly observed.

The accumulation of floating capital in Shanghai makes everyone uneasy, because it does not engage in production and becomes a reserve force for speculation. Therefore, all sectors are eager for it to move out of the city and invest in the interior. This aspiration can now be said to be partially becoming a reality, but the result has been a situation where interior prices dominate Shanghai prices. This shows that the interior has not rationally absorbed this floating capital, but is also using it maliciously. This shows that in dealing with the problem of floating capital, paying attention to its use is more important than adjusting its location.

### Congestion at the Central Bank of China in Handling Remittances - Proof of Active Inland Trade

The Continental News of February 19th reported: "According to the Central Reserve Bank's statistics on remittances handled in the first half of the 31st year [of the Republic], there has been a gradual increase since January. This phenomenon proves the progress of material communication and the revival of inland economic power. It is expected that economic ties between Shanghai and the interior will become closer in the future. It is reported that the total amount of remittances received and paid is approximately 150 billion yuan, and the ratio of the head office to branches is the highest in Shanghai, accounting for approximately 85% of the total."

### Suspension of Trading in Chinese Stocks - Date of Resumption Undecided

Recently, local authorities in this city, in order to curb speculation and stabilize prices, have taken strict action against various transactions that have gone off track. Although trading in Chinese stocks is not within the scope of the prohibition, due to the repeated surge in stock prices since the Lunar New Year, the Chinese stock market was temporarily closed yesterday in accordance with the authorities' wishes. All stock companies in this city have also suspended trading accordingly. The date of resumption has not yet been decided.

### Su-Huai Authorities Promote Rural Production

In order to increase production, the Su-Huai authorities have decided to vigorously promote rural production this year. It is planned to establish a production promotion office with an expenditure of 100,000 yuan to handle production-related matters, and agricultural warehouses will be prepared in various counties to facilitate agricultural production. It has also been decided to allocate another 100,000 yuan to lend to farmers who lack funds for spring plowing.

### Unified Public Bonds - Category C Rose the Most Sharply

Yesterday's public bond market saw mostly flat conditions at first. Only Category C bonds rose sharply due to short covering. Other categories also rose accordingly. Later, Category C even saw new prices. As a result, all categories rebounded by a few jiao to two jiao. For example, Category C bonds initially traded at 79 yuan, a sharp drop of more than one yuan from the previous day. Afterwards, due to short covering, it rose steadily, eventually reaching a new high of 82.67 yuan. As for Category A at 8.5 yuan, Category B at 7 yuan to 7.5 yuan, Category D at 4.5 yuan to 6.5 yuan, and Category E at 5.5 yuan to 8.5 yuan, all were stable.

### U.S. Government Restricts Leather Use

Haitong Agency, Lisbon, 18th: The U.S. Production Control Bureau issued a regulation yesterday to limit the use of leather in the manufacture of everyday consumer goods, such as gloves, suitcases, tobacco pouches, and pocket leather-bound manuals, in order to ensure that military agencies receive an adequate supply of leather.

### Supply and Demand Situation of Yarn and Cloth in North China

Reliable data on the supply and demand situation of yarn and cloth in North China is lacking. However, for the whole of China, there are government survey figures, the content of which is as follows (yarn in bales, cloth in square yards):

Cotton Yarn Supply 2,027,500

Domestic Production 2,000,000
Foreign Imports 27,500

Cotton Cloth Supply 1,420 million

Domestic Production 1,000 million
Foreign Imports 420 million

Cotton Yarn Demand 2,027,500

Domestic Consumption 1,976,300
Exports to Foreign Countries 5,200

Cotton Cloth Demand 1,420 million

Domestic Consumption 920 million
Exports to Foreign Countries 500 million

In terms of cotton yarn, of the aforementioned domestic consumption of 3 million bales, 100,000 bales are used for making thread and other items, and 1.9 million bales are used for weaving cloth, which is estimated to weave 2.3 billion square yards of native cloth. Combined with the aforementioned domestic consumption of cotton cloth, it totals 3.3 billion square yards. China's population is approximately 400 million, averaging approximately 8 square yards per person. Adding in some smuggled goods, the average per person is around 10 square yards (this number is not much different from the government's report to the League of Nations of 9.5 square yards). North China's population is approximately 100 million. At this rate, it needs 1 billion square yards of cotton cloth annually.

### Preparing to Establish More Price Control Bureaus - Aiming to Unify Prices in Various Regions

The Continental News of February 19th reported: "The National Government's Price Countermeasures Committee is working to revive the economy, complete the war, and maintain currency value, based on the Central China Price Countermeasures Outline. In order to unify prices in various regions, in addition to establishing price control bureaus in seven locations including Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou, preparations are now being made to add price control bureaus in Northern Jiangsu, Su-Huai, Guangdong, and Hankou."

### Guidelines for Establishing a Limited Company (II)

(A) Key Points of Legal Regulations:

2. Company Announcements Companies must undergo public announcement procedures for opening, commencing operations, and convening shareholder meetings, etc. According to Article 88 of the Company Law: "The method for a company to make public announcements shall be specified in the articles of association." This means that the law allows the parties of the company to specify the method of public announcement in the articles of association themselves. Whether using only circulars or newspaper announcements, both will be effective. The law does not impose any mandatory requirements. According to current practice, most companies' articles of association specify that "company announcements shall be made by circular or by publishing in a widely circulated daily newspaper."

3. Shareholder Voting Rights In order to restrict large shareholders from manipulating the company, Article 129 of the Company Law stipulates: "Each shareholder of the company shall have one vote per share. A shareholder with more than eleven shares shall have their voting rights restricted in the articles of association..." This means that shareholders holding more than eleven shares must have their voting rights discounted in the articles of association, that is, calculated at a certain discount rate. Those less than one right may not be counted. The common practice is to discount by 90%, 80%, or at most 50%. Furthermore, the total number of votes that each shareholder can exercise, including those exercised by proxy for other shareholders, shall not exceed one-fifth of the total voting rights of all shareholders, as stipulated in Article 129 of the Company Law. This should be noted at any time when holding establishment meetings or shareholder meetings.

4. Qualifications for Shareholders to be Elected as Directors and Supervisors When drafting the company's articles of association, entrepreneurial individuals often set excessively high restrictions on the number of shares required for directors and supervisors to be elected, intending to make it difficult to be elected, so that the directors and supervisors produced will not be excessively numerous and cause a chaotic situation. However, Article 21 of the Implementation Law of the Company Law stipulates: "When the number of shares is used as the standard to stipulate the qualifications for directors and supervisors to be elected, the value of the shares shall not exceed three-thousandths of the total capital for directors, and shall not exceed one-thousandth for supervisors." Since the law has this restriction, the articles of association of the company shall not stipulate the qualification of shares for the election of directors and supervisors beyond the aforementioned percentage. Assuming the company has a capital of 500,000 yuan, divided into 50,000 shares, then at most it can be stipulated that shareholders with more than 150 shares are qualified to be elected as directors, and shareholders with more than 50 shares are qualified to be elected as supervisors to be legal; exceeding this number is illegal. If the number is lower than the prescribed amount, such as the qualification for election as a director being less than three-thousandths, the supervisor being less than one-thousandth, or even stipulating that all shareholders are qualified to be elected as directors and supervisors, the law does not prohibit this.

### Development of Currency Work in Central China (II)

Reasons for the Improvement of its Position:

Now we may be able to find various reasons for the rising position of military scrip.

First, it cannot be denied that it is due to the smooth implementation of the military scrip recovery work. Currently, there are material exchange offices and trade associations in Central China for military scrip recovery work, but most of the commodities distributed in the Central China peace zone are handled by trade associations and transferred to the interior in stages. This is where military scrip plays a significant role in preventing materials from flowing into the war zone. The settlement of accounts for these associations' items is carried out exclusively with military scrip under the supervision of the military authorities. After the start of the Greater East Asia War, the guaranteed reserves of military scrip became difficult to import from Japan, so the associations have also begun to use local rural materials as guaranteed reserves. Given this, the improved position of military scrip cannot be denied as attributable to the activity of the Central China Trade Association. To ensure that military scrip has sufficient guaranteed reserves, a well-functioning distribution mechanism is the only powerful pillar for the development of military scrip.

Second, the inflation of the old legal tender has also contributed to the improved position of military scrip. Even if the old legal tender still maintains its credibility among the Chinese people, its over-issuance and the productivity behind it will not support it forever. From a fundamental perspective, since the promulgation of the asset freeze order in August of last year, the old legal tender cannot be freely exchanged for foreign currencies. After the start of the Greater East Asia War, the possibility of exchanging the old legal tender for foreign currencies has become a nominal antique. In the past, it was necessary to purchase old legal tender with savings scrip, military scrip, and Lianhe scrip before being able to buy European and American goods, but now there is no need to be so polite, and the old legal tender can be directly attacked: because it has become a useless long object, there is no need to maintain the equivalence of new and old legal tender, and further recover the old legal tender and prohibit its circulation in major areas. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the amount of old legal tender issued was one hundred and several tens of billions of yuan, and now it is probably more than two hundred billion yuan, which not only leads to malignant inflation, but also in terms of its nature, that is, in its use, it is heading for a declining fate, while the active use of military scrip and savings scrip is flourishing.

Third, the objective situation also welcomes the increase in military scrip. Shortly after the promulgation of the aforementioned asset freeze order, the Greater East Asia War broke out, resulting in the recovery of the Shanghai Concession and the expulsion of European and American forces, so that European and American goods that had always been imported through the Concession also disappeared from China. However, as mentioned above, Japanese goods are traded through the Trade Association and material exchange offices, using only military scrip. Without military scrip, daily necessities cannot be obtained. This is why military scrip has made great strides even into the most difficult-to-penetrate rural areas: because daily necessities must be bought with military scrip, it is necessary to exchange one's own local products for military scrip.

The future of developing military scrip work is still not optimistic at present. Although military scrip has penetrated the countryside as mentioned above, most of the purchase of inland local products still cannot be done without the old legal tender. To completely replace China's national capital with a military scrip coat is truly a pipe dream, because the amount of military scrip issued is truly a drop in the ocean compared to the huge amount of old legal tender. (Translated by Ji from the original by economic scholar Hori Shinichi of Tokyo, January 27th)

### Cheap Bean Cakes Sold in the Market

Yesterday, bean cake transactions in the miscellaneous grain market saw a slight decline. The market trend turned slightly weak, because the military allocation group transferred 50,000 pieces of cheap bean cakes to the miscellaneous grain group, which the group sold out in the market. This resulted in a sudden increase in chips and a gradual decline in buying interest. Kaiyuanlong bean cakes: two carloads, price 121.5 yuan. Yingfei and Lizi bean cakes, March delivery: 3,000 pieces, price 122.5 yuan to 121 yuan. Shanghai factory bean cakes, March delivery: 4,000 pieces, price 122 yuan to 121 yuan.

### Lianhe Scrip Decreases Another Five Fen

Yesterday morning, the interbank loan interest rate set by the Money Exchange Association remained unchanged at 1.8 jiao.

Also, Japanese military scrip was extremely cheap, with interbank trading at 5.5535 yuan, and small money shops and bank retail sales at 5.56 yuan, with 5.545 yuan bid. Lianhe scrip decreased another five fen, with operators selling at 3.95 yuan and buying at 3.90 yuan.

### Wuxi Raw Silk - Red Opening Rose More Than 1,000 Yuan

Wuxi communication on the 13th: The red opening of this year's raw silk began yesterday. Five dan of Pi-character grade silk, with a red opening price of 19,800 yuan per dan, were purchased by local factories. It is said that it has risen by more than 1,000 yuan compared to last year's market. The rest of the grades have not yet been opened, only this single spring grade. Furthermore, it is understood that last year's business of various silk factories and silk shops was greatly reduced due to difficult transportation, which made it difficult for silk fabric manufacturers in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shengze to procure goods.

### Cotton Cloth Decreased Slightly

Yesterday morning's cloth market initially decreased and then rebounded, resulting in a small overall decrease. Fine cloth decreased by one or two yuan. Sijunzi drill opened at 12.35 yuan, and rose to 12.7 yuan at noon, a decrease of 0.2 yuan from the low. Taohua Women's Lin called 510 yuan.

### Black Tea Strengthened - Green Tea Sales Remain Stagnant

Black tea sales remain strong, and prices continue to rise. Futai Tea Shop purchased about eight dan of medium-grade black tea at around 850 yuan, and also purchased four dan of Qimen black tea at 2,600 yuan, sold by Yuanji Tea Firm. Green tea sales remain stagnant. Only Shengtai Tea Shop purchased six dan of Sanshui flag tea at 470 yuan, sold by Tongtai Company.

### Governor Isogai Explains the Future Economic Position of Hong Kong - Economic Revival Plan is Underway

Hong Kong, February 18th, Domei News Agency: Hong Kong Governor Rensuke Isogai stated at a press conference held at the Hong Kong Government House on the first anniversary of its establishment on February 20th: "Hong Kong is still handling repatriation matters, providing various conveniences as much as possible. Those who reside in Hong Kong in the future should be people with professions and jobs. As for Hong Kong's economic position, it is a relay port, so all facilities and production should be based on this point. For example, shipbuilding is currently in progress, so as to be able to transport oil and various other materials from the southern region. Several of these ships have been launched, and more ships will be completed this year, which will enhance Hong Kong's economic position. As for industry, factories under military management will be transferred to private management as soon as possible, and Chinese-run businesses will be encouraged."

### Chart of Changes in Stock Prices in the Chinese Stock Market from the Beginning to the End of the 31st Year of the Republic of China

(1) Table of Multiples of Increase in 20 Types of Uncapitalized Stocks Within One Year:

The so-called "multiple" in the table above does not refer to the adjustment of multiples above the level; the base itself constitutes one multiple, in other words, one multiple means no increase or decrease; for example, from 10 to 20 is called two times, and so on.

In addition to the above 20 types, other stocks such as Commercial Press have also risen four times; Hanyeping Coal and Iron has risen two and three-quarters times; Sinya Pharmaceutical Factory five times; Family Industrial Society four and a quarter times; and Cheng Tobacco four and three-quarters times. Among the 20 types, only Wing On Company of the department store industry increased its shares by 500,000 shares in mid-March, but because the increase was very small (one-third of the total capital), it is still included. Apart from this, all other stocks have share prices at a time when the number of shares and capital have not been changed within one year. As for stocks such as National Goods Company, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, Kangyuan Canning, and Sino-British Dispensary, all have either changed their face value or increased capital within one year, and their year-end stock prices cannot be compared with other stocks. For example, National Goods only increased by 1.25 times throughout the year; China three times; and World 2.5 times; this is because the face value has changed.

### America is Full of Black Market Transactions - Agriculture Feels Another Manpower Panic

Havas World News Agency, Lisbon, 18th: According to a report from Washington, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and War Food Administrator Wickard stated to the press this month that the U.S. market is full of profiteering merchants and black market traders, the number of whom is alarmingly large. All kinds of goods have black markets, which will endanger the government's rationing plan, especially in the area of meat. This phenomenon is most obvious. In addition, it is also understood that Secretary Wickard has requested the military authorities to allow thousands of soldiers to go home on leave to engage in agricultural work, but this plan has been opposed by General of the Army Marshall, so the manpower panic in the U.S. agricultural sector is still very serious.

### United States Prohibits the Sale of Fish and Meat - From March 1st

Havas World News Agency, Lisbon, 18th: Washington dispatch, the U.S. authorities have prohibited the sale of meat and fish. Starting from the first of next month, restrictions on the purchase of the above two kinds of food will be implemented.

### Superiority of Huainan Coal Mine; Expected Leap in Production Next Year

A report in the Continental Daily on February 18th stated: The Huainan Coal Mine has achieved exceptionally good production increases this year, reaching 90% of its target. Surprising results are expected by the end of March, which will certainly exceed the target. Although the main mining areas of the Huainan Coal Mine were repeatedly attacked by the enemy last autumn, they were eventually overcome by a spirit of hard work, resulting in exceeding the target. It is estimated that next year's production increase will be about 20% higher than this year. All business estimates have been completed, and the coordination of other materials, technicians, and funds is currently being discussed with relevant parties.

### The Insatiable Desire Pit

— Liu Po

Beggars and vagrants on the street, standing in front of porridge shops or noodle stands, only hope to be able to eat a bowl of thin porridge or plain noodles; but they have no money and cannot eat, so they feel very painful.

Poor people living in attics or kitchen sheds are heavily in debt. They hope to be able to pay off their debts, but they often spend tomorrow's income today, and have no extra money to pay off their debts, so they feel very painful.

People living in front buildings or shared tenement buildings have just enough salary to cover their expenses and live a mediocre life. They hope to save a little, but often cannot, so they feel very painful.

People living in entire lane houses have some savings. Before the incident, they only had a few thousand dollars. After the incident, following big speculators, they engaged in hoarding, buying and selling shellac, cloth, and stocks. The amount of savings has become tens or hundreds of thousands. However, seeing a group of people who made a fortune from "wartime wealth" from scratch, they are envious and jealous, feeling unsatisfied and very painful.

People living in large Western-style houses had hundreds of thousands or millions in property before the incident. When the incident was about to happen, they cleverly turned their property into foreign exchange, US dollars, and shellac like cunning rabbits. As the incident prolonged, they seized opportunities to stir up trouble, buying cotton yarn one moment, hoarding goods the next, trading foreign stocks one moment, and trading Chinese stocks the next. They are busy, they are anxious. Their hearts are very painful, not for life, but for property. Sometimes, they sigh to poor friends, saying: "It is better to be a person without money, it is really painful to have money!"

In short, to sum it up, people without money cannot survive and suffer for survival. People with little money suffer from the desire for more money. The rich and wealthy suffer from fear of loss, entirely for the sake of property.

People who suffer from not being able to survive make up the majority of society; they are the most pitiful, and their suffering must be relieved. As for those who suffer from fear of loss for the sake of property, their suffering is self-inflicted and not worthy of pity.

If there is any proper way to allow people who cannot make a living to barely survive; to allow people whose property exceeds what is necessary for life to distribute the excess portion for the benefit of society; to reduce the pain caused by too little or too much money, this would be a great act of compassion and saving people from suffering, an unparalleled undertaking.

Holding charity dances or putting on plays to help with disaster relief occasionally is understandable. If it is done again and again, it becomes ridiculous. At present, what seems more effective is to control prices and ban various forms of speculation on the one hand, and to levy income tax, excessive profit tax, and property tax on the other.

### World's Largest Fire Hazard; Impossible to Extinguish After 58 Years

It is reported that the authorities of Ohio in the United States are currently trying to extinguish a fire that has been burning for more than 50 years in a coal mine near Hocking Hills, intending to use fire-extinguishing gas and chemical methods to stop it from burning. According to reports, the coal mine has been on fire for as long as 58 years. In 1884, several striking miners set fire to a mine in Ohio, unexpectedly causing a prairie fire, turning into a huge disaster. To date, approximately 28 million tons of coal have been burned, and there is still no way to put it out. Nearby residents have also helplessly let it run its course, and when the fire threatens to reach the ground, they advise moving to a better location to avoid its sharp edge. Recently, a school near the area planned to relocate because the ground was unbearably hot. According to geological surveys, the underground flames are only six yards from the surface, so the climate is particularly warm. Whenever it is cloudy and rainy, hot air is often seen permeating and entering the doors and windows of households, and phosphorus fire can be seen from afar at night. Also, because the climate is warm, plants grow very easily, but if the fire approaches the surface, the plants growing on the ground will immediately wither. In the past, although efforts were made to extinguish the fire, they were unsuccessful. Although concrete walls were built around the fire to prevent its spread, the firepower was too strong, the mud walls collapsed, and the flames still crossed the walls. Only recently have scientists been put in charge of extinguishing the fire, and it is expected that the latest methods can stop the spread of underground flames. Investigations reveal that there have also been coal mine fires in Europe, which can serve as a lesson for American engineers today. For example, in 1860, a coal mine in Saguessou in France also burned. It is said that the origin of the fire dates back to the 16th century. The "Warm Hall" in England is another example. The British used the heat of the ground to grow tropical plants and used the hottest places to boil water, but after only a few years, the underground flames changed course and the "Warm Hall" lost its heat, and the tropical flowers and plants withered, and the "Warm Hall" lost its name.

### About "Two Generations of Women"

— Qu Jiang

Recently, it seems that someone is trying hard to promote "Two Generations of Women." If it were just a few ordinary compliments, honestly speaking, I, who rarely watch movies, would not join in the fun. But when I saw words like "strong artistic nature" and "not easily accepted by low-brow audiences," a lofty feeling immediately surged in my heart. On the one hand, I rejoiced for the weak Chinese film industry, and on the other hand, I was very willing to buy a ticket to the Great Light Cinema. This is not deliberately trying to be elegant and be a "high-level audience," but because we, who are struggling in the torments of life, need the edification of art, as urgently as we need air!

I know what ordinary Chinese movies are like. I hope "Two Generations of Women" can break my prejudice, but...

I would like to write down my feelings and impressions after watching it. Please do not think that I am deliberately arguing with the gentlemen who recommended the film, and I would be grateful for further corrections.

(1) Dialogue I agree with that gentleman's statement: "This film probably has the most dialogue in Chinese films." But I cannot agree that this alone makes it a good film. If Xi Shi had pockmarks, does that mean that everyone with pockmarks is Xi Shi? Of course, art films must have dialogue, but having dialogue does not necessarily make it an art film.

It is impossible to prove with words alone, but I did not buy a special issue, so I have to rely on my memory to record a few of the dialogues that I found to be lacking in sense:

Meng Na (who plays the mother) refers to herself as "this old woman." Although she is an incomparably dignified mother-in-law in the film, she should not be so incoherent as to say that.

Perhaps what is called "strong artistic nature" refers to this:

Meng Na: I do not belong to this era... A sacred cause has disappeared from the earth... That is the cause of being a mother...

If it were not specifically noted that this is a line from "Two Generations of Women," would you believe that these are the words of a incense-burning old lady in her seventies?

(2) Director The director is closely related to the script. If the script is not good, the director cannot make it good. But the director should still be responsible for individual scenes.

For example, the scene of looking at photos in "Two Generations of Women." If there were a good director, I think it would be very exciting. I remember a scene in the American film "The Animal Kingdom" that is very similar. A wild girl, the wife of a small farm owner (played by Betty Field, I remember), secretly wants to meet her lover. Her father-in-law is in charge of her and does not allow her to go out. There is no extra dialogue here. We only see a close-up of Betty Field's face. Everything in the room is quiet. Only the "tick-tock" of the clock breaks this unbearable silence... This is such a powerful description.

(3) Character According to the first point, the dialogue is so unreasonable. How can we talk about the "character" of Meng Na? In the film, Meng Na seems to have the most scenes. Meng Na is already like this, so the others are not worth mentioning.

(4) Picture "Picture" should mean that the director gives appropriate treatment to the characters' positions, making the entire composition a "picture." This cannot be found in "Two Generations of Women." Some people say: antique decorations, winding corridors, beautiful natural scenery... I think these are not what is meant by "picture" in film. If these are what we are looking for, why not just go and buy a set of the Ten Scenes of West Lake?

Finally, I have to admit that I did not finish watching this film. I only saw Gu Lanjun climbing on Mei Xi, saying, "Why don't you let us sleep in one room?" Then, her eyes narrowed, her hand rested on Mei Xi's back, her feet tiptoed, and she shouted, "Kiss me? Kiss me!..." and I left. Call me a defender of morality if you will, but such a "high-level art film" that is "rich in social significance" feels a bit dazzling to me.

### Third Place in the January Essay Contest My Life as a Teacher (Part 2)

— Si Yiwei

(1) Regarding the aspect of life Teaching has always been a hard work. This is the case in normal times, let alone in this special era. The school where I teach, comparatively speaking, does not have very meager treatment. However, the rise in prices is endless, and the income is only enough to take care of a few mouths. Therefore, everything has to be done in a simple and crude way. There is no way to increase income. Private tutoring is not allowed by the school, nor is it possible in reality, so I have to economize everywhere. Simple vegetarian meals, flour dumplings, and corn porridge are surprisingly delicious. I used to take third-class in the tram, and now I still take third-class. There is nothing to be said about its rise and fall in status. All the work at home, if I can handle it, I do it myself. I repair the electric lights and running water if they are broken, and I repair the tools and utensils if they are broken. I never ask someone to do it unless there is absolutely no way to do it. The clothes are patched and turned over, only seeking to be neat and tidy, not counting the style. The briefcase I am using now was passed down from my grandfather. The edges are so broken that the pencil is about to leak out. I wanted to sell it to the junk collector for a long time. Now I have repaired it, and I go out early and return late. Not only do I put textbooks in it, but sometimes even dry food is in it, and I regard it as a treasure. Lu Fangweng said in a poem, "Poverty is not a shame for scholars." This has been the case in ancient and modern times.

(2) Regarding the aspect of self-cultivation The most painful thing in my life is my health problem. Because of my many illnesses, I don't know how much I have suffered! Since the incident, life has become more and more difficult. If I get sick again, I will have no money for medical expenses! So I decided to fight against the disease. Three years ago, I started learning Tai Chi. I understood the physiological effects and the principles of exercise. I go to the park at dawn, unless it rains or snows. I dare not stop for a day in winter or summer. In the past three years, I feel that my body has improved a lot. In the past, because I was often sick, I was pessimistic about everything and felt dissatisfied with everything. The war has become a turning point for me. Now I only seek to do my best, only seek to have a clear conscience in everything, only seek to be able to endure hunger and cold for my family, and put wealth and fame out of my mind. I don't smoke or drink, and mahjong never enters my door. I rarely watch movies unless everyone says they are good. I have never set foot in dance halls. After being tired of grading papers, I either casually flip through selections of classical poems or plant some flowers and plants in pots on the corner of the window. On sunny Sundays, I always take my family for a walk in the park. I love nature. In the afternoon, I attend worship or listen to famous speakers, so that my spirituality can also be cultivated. The busier and more difficult it is, the more important I feel that self-cultivation is for myself.

(3) Regarding the aspect of duties For my duties, I only hold one word, sincerity. Twenty-some hours a week are enough to exhaust my energy and hoarse my voice. In the time I have, I grade test papers, coming and going, and I have to spend one or two hours in the car. So it goes without saying that I am busy and bitter! Teaching originally has no standards. You can give students grades without looking at the papers, and no one will notice! You can step onto the podium without preparing, and talk casually for one or two hours, and few students dare to question it. Sadly, the heavy burden of life forces many colleagues in the education field to take on forty or fifty hours a week, running around and struggling to cope, and they have to take this path that they should not take. It is painful to say. Although I am also busy and suffering enough, I have never dared to deal with this work sloppily. For the few papers that fail, I have to read them one or two more times in order to make up for it and not make them suffer injustice. When treating students, in the classroom, I have always been strict, but outside the classroom, I advocate amiability. I like them to chat casually after class. In the laboratory, I let them learn to be automatic and ask them to pay attention to accuracy. Unless there is an unexpected obstacle on the road, I never dare to be one or two minutes late to enter the classroom. I don't like to lecture with a textbook. Everywhere, I hope to speak vividly. For questions I can't answer, I honestly say I can't answer them. I advise them not to completely trust the teacher, nor can they completely rely on the book. They must all have a bit of skepticism and think carefully. I am very careful about my words and deeds, so as not to be used as a handle by them, thus losing their faith in me. I always feel that sincerity and diligence are the best methods. Not only can it move people, but if there is a mistake, it is easy to get their understanding.

Writing casually, I have exceeded the number limit. What I said is just a review of my personal life. As for the sorrows that should be sighed, there are few from university professors to kindergarten teachers who do not sympathize with each other. No one in society does not know that teaching is a poor job. I don't intend to go into details here! However, I always feel that in this poor life, education has its own great mission, and we are really responsible for these many students. The darkness and corruption in our society, such as bribery, deception, greed, and selfishness, are mostly the result of poor education. We can only stand on our own positions and work hard to do our part. We can only look at the students' enthusiasm for learning and progress as food to quench our thirst. Of course, we very much hope that society can find a way to stabilize our lives, and we must also give full play to our teaching principles.

(Note: Mr. Si is currently a teacher of biology and nature in the preparatory course of Hujiang College.)

### Model Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

When Chips entered this chaotic center, everyone immediately quieted down, followed by bursts of continuous cheers: everyone stared at him with eager, shining eyes, as if staring at a symbol of victory. He walked to a higher section of the dining hall, as if he was going to speak; they were silent for him, but after a while, he shook his head, smiled, and walked away.

It was a damp and foggy day, and he shivered as he walked across the quadrangle to the dining hall. The next day, he developed bronchitis, did not get out of bed, and spent Christmas in bed. However, after going to the dining hall on the evening of November 11, he had already submitted his resignation to the school board.

When the school reopened after the holidays, he returned to Mrs. Wickett's house. At his own request, no farewell party or gifts were given to him. Nothing more than a handshake with his successor and crossing out the word "acting" on the official documents. "The term is over."

(Sixteen)

Now, fifteen years later, he can look back on everything in the past with peace of mind. He is certainly not sick - but from time to time there is some fatigue, and in the winter, breathing is not very smooth. He does not want to go abroad - he tried it once, and as soon as he arrived at the Riviera, he just happened to catch a cold snap, an unknown cold snap. "I would rather - um - be cold in my own country - ahem -" he would say that after this incident. When the east wind blows, he must be careful, but the autumn and winter seasons are not really that bad; there is a warm fire, books, and you can look forward to summer. Of course; he likes summer the most, the summer weather suits him, in addition; there are constant visits from old students. At the end of each week, some old students will take a car to Brookfield to visit him. Sometimes too many people come at once, which will tire him; but he doesn't really care; he can often rest and sleep. He likes their visits - more than anything else in the world that still pleases him. (Forty-one)

### Relieving the Poor and Sick; Notre Dame Calls on All Sectors to Donate Funds to the Hospital

The Catholic Society for the Salvation of Souls, founded by the nuns of the Yangjingbang in Shanghai, has been in operation for seventy years. It specializes in educating children and relieving the poor and sick. The schools under its jurisdiction have 4,000 students, and the clinics under its jurisdiction provide free or semi-fee treatment to the poor, reaching more than 112,000 people a year. For poor families, they try to provide work or accommodate their children, providing food and lodging. The poor who come to ask for help every day are given food and clothing or a small amount of money. However, in recent years, with the high cost of living, it has become difficult to maintain the business. The hospital has no choice but to appeal to all sectors, asking all benefactors to donate generously. No matter how much or little the gold or material is, it can be contacted directly with the hospital.

### Origin of the Health and Longevity Lecture

— Ding Fubao

When I was young, I was often sick and physically weak. When I was in my twenties, I weighed less than ninety pounds. So I was determined to transform my weak body and adopted various health care methods such as quietness, sunlight, air, exercise, deep breathing, and vegetables, fruits, and milk. I also used meditation methods that concentrated the mind on the acupuncture point of the mysterious gate and methods for transforming destiny. Later, my sick body was indeed cured. At the age of forty, I was stronger than at thirty, at fifty I was stronger than at forty, and at sixty I was stronger than at fifty. Now that I am seventy, my physical strength and spirit are even stronger than when I was sixty. I have gained some experience in the art of conditioning my body. In order to serve society, I plan to contribute various methods of curing diseases, recuperation, health, and longevity that I have personally experimented with to those who are physically weak, anemic, dyspeptic, neurasthenic, or have excessive lust in their youth or middle age, or those who have high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries, excessive obesity, or diseases of the kidneys, heart, or liver, as well as those with chronic diseases who have taken medicine and acupuncture for years without seeing results. Regardless of gender, age, or age, they can all learn to see small results in three months and big results in six months. If they can be determined and unwavering, they will surely be able to achieve the goal of curing diseases and prolonging life without a doubt.

(Mr. Ding is now scheduled to lecture every Sunday morning from 10:00 to 11:00 at the China Health Care Company in the Meiqi Building, No. 996 Jing'an Temple Road. All sectors are welcome to join the society and attend the lectures. The company can be contacted for the regulations.)
