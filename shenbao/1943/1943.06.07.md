### The Silent Europe

The war situation in Europe, from the Mediterranean to the German-Soviet battlefields, is, strictly speaking, at a standstill on land, with only fierce air battles breaking the silence before the storm. However, no matter what, the days of silence will not last long. "All trees are silent, waiting for the rain." Perhaps Europeans today have this solemn psychology?

However, the evolution of the European situation is frantically unfolding in this temporary silence. In politics and mobilization, both sides are engaged in extremely fierce battles. And this non-military battle will be a crucial deciding force in the future war situation.

Since the recent meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, although the propaganda of the anti-Axis powers "invading Europe" has been clamorous, it is actually the beginning of a war of nerves. If they have any so-called offensive, it is only a political activity. What is most noteworthy is the announcement of the dissolution of the Communist International on the 22nd of last month. This is to ease the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and to eliminate the fear of the Red Peril among the small and neutral countries in Europe, and to promote closer ties with the anti-Axis powers. These were originally just the judgments of a few people, but now Stalin has automatically revealed them in his four points in response to questions from Reuters reporters. However, this is only one party's attempt, and the outcome is still hard to say. Roosevelt's special envoy, Davies, has returned to the United States with Stalin's reply, and there are probably many more topics to discuss between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

Secondly, what can demonstrate the new activities of the anti-Axis powers is the promotion of a compromise between the French splinter faction, the "Fighting France" faction (close to Britain) led by de Gaulle, and Giraud, who succeeded Darlan and seized French Northwest Africa (close to the United States). De Gaulle and Giraud recently held a meeting in Algiers, and with the joint efforts of Britain and the United States, they have established the so-called "French Committee of National Liberation" as the central political power organization of the French anti-Axis faction. This is a concession by Giraud under the support of the United States. At the same time, de Gaulle also sacrificed some of the original institutions of "Fighting France" and incorporated them into the "Committee of National Liberation." De Gaulle and Giraud declared in the name of this committee that they would insist on the "national restoration" war, willing to be driven by Britain and the United States. This seems to be another triumphant puppet show by Britain and the United States. Of course, everyone "dreams different dreams," and the future is not worth much attention. However, what is noteworthy is that from now on, the French fleet in Alexandria and Algeria, including one dreadnought, three 10,000-ton cruisers, one 7,000-ton cruiser, and several torpedo boats, have been incorporated into the enemy British and American camps. This is valued by every Frenchman.

Again, it is to extend the magic hand of conspiracy to neutral countries. The main thing, in addition to diplomatic and economic conspiracies, is to instigate coups and launch so-called "revolutionary" incidents. Yesterday's newspaper reported that Argentina, the only neutral country in South America, which has always resisted the threats from the United States and continued to maintain normal diplomatic and trade relations with the Axis powers, actually experienced a so-called "revolution" on the 4th of this month under the instigation of the United States. The pro-American Minister of National Defense, General Ram√≠rez, threatened some Argentine legions and important military officers, General Donaz and General Rosen, and forced Argentine President Castillo to acknowledge four demands: (1) change the neutral policy, (2) cooperation among the American countries, (3) freedom of election, and (4) reorganization of politics. Obviously, all of these are exactly what the United States has always sought from Argentina but failed to obtain. Now the rebels have established a revolutionary government. A dispatch from Stockholm on the 5th even stated: "Argentina is about to join the anti-Axis camp, sever relations with the Axis powers, and join the war." Here, we should be vigilant. The fifth columns of Britain and the United States may also appear in European and even Middle Eastern countries, and the so-called "second Darlan" is also stirring.

In terms of strategy, Churchill went to Gibraltar and also held meetings in Algiers and Tunis with General Eisenhower, commander of the U.S. Allied forces in North Africa, as well as General Montgomery, commander of the British Eighth Army, General Alexander, commander of the First Army, and the French Giraud and de Gaulle, to discuss and plan for future strategies and tactics. In military terms, the so-called "air offensive" is almost already being launched on a larger scale. However, can it be inferred from these situations that Britain and the United States already have the strength to launch an offensive against Europe? In our opinion, Britain and the United States are still hesitant, as admitted by Mr. Scobel, a military reporter for the Washington Daily, in a dispatch from Lisbon on the 4th (see newspapers on the 5th). The anti-Axis powers currently have eight major problems that urgently need to be solved, namely (1) the Soviet front. He said that this is the largest land battlefield, including most of the air force, and urgently needs the supply of British and American materials; (2) the Western European problem, including the joint use of land, sea, and air forces to invade Europe; (3) the bombing of Germany and Italy, including the establishment of a huge air force and close cooperation with the land, sea, and air forces; (4) dealing with the submarine threat, including the use of powerful fighters and aircraft; (5) the Pacific battlefield. The strength of the Japanese navy is strong, and this problem also urgently needs to be resolved; (6) the combat power of Chongqing must be made active, but Chongqing has less wartime production than the Soviet Union and suffers greater damage; (7) the longer Japan holds its occupied territories, the harder it will be to defeat; (8) the Pacific War cannot be considered won until Japan is subjected to bombing and artillery shelling by the anti-Axis forces and the trampling of the anti-Axis armies. The eight points pointed out by Scobel are exactly the most unsolvable problems for the anti-Axis powers at present, and they are also the places where the Axis powers maintain their advantages.

Conversely, on the Axis side, facing the most serious situation of world war, they maintain calm, composure, and solemnity. In fact, for the Axis powers, there is absolutely no need to shout propaganda, hold a series of large and small meetings, or carry out nerve war actions. In the current and future wars, the forces that determine victory are mainly: first, maintaining air supremacy over the Mediterranean and Western Europe. With Italy's geographical advantage in the Mediterranean and the consolidation of the defensive measures of the German and Italian armies in southern France, there is no need to worry about the southern battlefield. As for Western and Northern Europe, if Britain and the United States want to land, concentrating the full power of the land, sea, and air forces on a front of hundreds or even thousands of miles, this small base in the three islands, coupled with the power of the Axis submarine warfare, can hardly support the resupply after penetrating deep. Moreover, Britain's own supply capacity is limited, and the United States is still far away across the Atlantic. Second, the main battlefield that will determine the future war is still the German-Soviet battlefield on the Eastern Front. Obviously, in recent months, both sides have been preparing, but the goals of this preparation are clearly different. On the Soviet side, rather than preparing to attack, it is better to say that they are preparing to defend. Their best strategy is to delay time, get through the summer and autumn, and postpone until winter. At that time, after more than half a year of preparation, using the advantages of the seasons and the terrain, they may launch an offensive to seek victory. However, clearly, Germany will not let the Soviet Union make such wishful calculations. In Germany, until today, the importance attached to the Eastern Front has always exceeded all other fronts, and launching a summer offensive in a timely manner can be said to occupy the first position. After a fairly long period of silence, Germany will no longer allow the Soviet Union to prepare calmly. Now, the fierce air battles in the Kuban region have already begun, and summer is approaching day by day. The large-scale offensive by the German army cannot wait much longer. Third, the attitude of the small countries in Europe, especially the attitude of the neutral countries, which mainly includes Turkey, has a decisive impact on the future war situation. The ambiguity of Turkey can only be maintained for fewer and fewer days. Since Spain's peace proposal was rejected, it has been preparing for action when war comes. The southeastern Balkan Peninsula, the northeastern Scandinavian Peninsula, and the countries along the Atlantic coast are all preparing for a bloody anti-aggression war. And fourth, within the anti-Axis powers, especially within the United States, starting with the general strike of coal miners, the waves of anti-government sentiment and unrest aroused by high prices are boiling. From the various departments of the munitions production industry to the administrative departments, they are encountering crises. In addition, the United States in the Pacific is constantly suffering serious blows. All of these are holding back their second step of action; at the same time, they are also giving the Axis powers an opportunity for further counterattacks.

Europe is on the eve of a decisive battle. The Axis powers, with calm and solemn minds, are waiting for work in ease, preparing for a head-on blow of victory.

### The Scene of Moscow on the Eve of a Storm

‚Äî Special Telegram from Moscow Correspondent Hatanaka of the Asahi Shimbun, June 1st

The reporter stayed in Moscow for a month and departed for Kubyshev today. During this month, the area where the future German-Soviet summer war will take place is peaceful and without war. Only in the southern area, the German air force repeatedly bombed railway lines and wartime strongholds. During the reporter's stay in Moscow, I not only did not hear a single air raid alarm, but I simply did not feel the existence of a war that directly threatened the peaceful lives of the citizens. In our memory, the roads leading to Moscow two years ago were densely covered with tank trenches and fortresses to defend the capital. The situation at that time is still vividly in our minds, but today, revisiting the old place, the tank trenches and fortresses at that time have completely turned into citizen farms, which is quite unexpected.

The popularity of these citizen farms has become an important issue in Moscow today. The authorities are planning to promote the development of such farms by individuals or groups. Now the citizens of Moscow are dividing the roads and streets from the suburbs to the city into agricultural land for cultivation. The Moscow Evening News answered the naive questions of citizens regarding the operation of these citizen farms. For example, questions from amateur gardeners such as "When can potatoes be planted?" "Can't potatoes be planted on rainy days?" "Can the space between potato plantings be used for other purposes?" Bookstores are lined with people vying to buy monographs and pamphlets on gardening works. These citizen farms, which can be seen everywhere in the city, are said to number more than three thousand three hundred and forty-nine in total, with high-rise buildings that are conspicuous like Gorky Street surrounded by agricultural countries. This is because citizens have suffered from a lack of vegetables in the past three winters, so they have started this activity to seek self-sufficiency.

Another distress for the citizens of Moscow is the lack of firewood. Now, the streets of Moscow are filled with trams and cars loaded with wood, which can be seen everywhere. It can be seen that they are preparing for a rainy day to prepare for the coming winter. Traffic in the city and suburbs is strictly controlled, and citizens living in suburban villas also need special permission to enter the city. The subway operates until 7:30 pm. General traffic is prohibited after 12 o'clock, which is the same as before. Most of the theaters close at 11 pm, and the parks stop opening at 10:30 pm. The signs indicating bomb shelters that were seen in Moscow in the first few months of the war have now become indicators of gas defense rooms. On the walls of the theater, it is written: "If an air raid alarm is issued, the performance will be immediately suspended, and the audience should go to the nearest gas defense room or subway station for refuge." This announcement proves that Moscow is still under the air raid of German planes. The air defense posture to prepare for the German planes is not slack, and they continue to be alert with tension. In the dark, hazy air, barrier balloons float quietly. The scene of the German-Soviet war in Moscow is the calm before the storm. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun on June 3)

### Yu Army Lunan Commander-in-Chief Rong Ziheng Leads His Troops to Surrender, Issues a Statement Leaving the Yu Side to Join the Peace Movement, Yu Xuezhong's Lunan Base Will Be Completely Lost

Beijing, 6th (Central News Agency) According to a mine in a certain front line in Shandong, Rong Ziheng, lieutenant general, commander-in-chief of the "Lunan Command of the Lu-Su War Zone" of the Yu army, resolutely left the Yu side with 20,000 elite troops on the 6th to join the peace movement. He telegraphed the whole country at 11:00 am today and issued a statement to participate in the peace. Since Wu Huawen, commander of the New Fourth Division, first led his troops to join the peace movement on January 18th this year, Han Zigan, commander of the 113th Division, Li Wenli, commander of the Second Forwarding Column, and Li Yingping, commander of the Sixth Guerrilla Detachment, also left the Yu side one after another to join the peace movement. This dealt a fatal blow to Yu Xuezhong, weakening the Yu army's power in the Lu-Su War Zone. This time, Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng resolutely returned, so Yu Xuezhong's base in Lunan will be completely lost. The 112th Division and 113th Division under the command of Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng were all pure old Northeastern army troops, and they were direct descendants of Zhang Xueliang. This time, Rong realized that the war of resistance not only failed to contribute to the revitalization of China, but also plunged the people into deep water and dire straits. He was also moved by Japan's withdrawal of extraterritorial rights in China. He deeply felt that only by realizing peace and cooperating with Japan could China be revitalized, so he resolutely joined the peace movement. This action of General Rong has caused great turmoil among the Northeastern generals. The old Northeastern army's forces account for about 80% of the Yu army's front-line camp. The main generals are Ma Zhanshan, Fu Zuoyi, He Zhuguo, Wan Fulin, Han Deqin, Yu Xuezhong, etc. Therefore, the departure of these generals is a fatal blow to the Yu army. Yu Jiang is now trying to suppress this situation with all his might, which shows the wavering situation of the old Northeastern army.

Beijing, 6th (Central News Agency) According to a mine in a certain front line in Shandong, after Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng decided to join the peace movement, he visited the commander of a certain Japanese army unit at 10:00 am on the 6th, accompanied by Major General Sun Mengti and others. After clarifying his determination to join the peace movement, he issued a statement and telegraphed the whole country at 11:00 am. Rong and others will also visit relevant Chinese agencies and the Japanese Army Liaison Department and the Military Police Corps separately.

(Another telegram) Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng, who left the Yu side and resolutely joined the peace movement, is 39 years old this year and a native of Zaoqiang County, Hebei Province. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, he graduated from the Engineering Department of the Japanese Army Academy. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, he graduated from the Japanese Army Infantry School. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, he graduated from the Japanese Army Engineering School again. After returning to China, he successively served as an instructor at the Northeast Army Lecture Hall, guard captain of the Fengtian Northeast Commander's Office (lieutenant colonel), guard captain of the Beijing Northeast Commander's Office (colonel), commander of the Fourth Regiment of the 105th Division, and commander of the Communications Battalion of the Beijing Military Commission Branch. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, he was promoted to deputy brigade commander of the 112th Division (major general). In the 31st year of the Republic of China, he took office as commander-in-chief of the Lunan Headquarters and deputy commander of the 112th Division (lieutenant general) from the commander of the 334th Brigade, until today. Rong Zhen, the respected father of Lieutenant General Rong, currently lives in Beijing. He is a veteran of the old Northeastern Army. During Zhang Xueliang's Northeast Frontier Defense Commander era, he served as the Chief of Staff. Now he lives in seclusion in Beijing.

### Details of the Ceremony for the Takeover of the French Concession in Shameen

Guangzhou, 6th (Central News Agency) Since the friendly nation Japan has practiced the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of the special concessions, the French government also respects the friendly relations between China and France and has made the same statement as our National Government. Therefore, on May 17th of this year, the detailed clauses for the implementation of the return of the special concessions in Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou were formally signed in Nanjing, and it was decided to practice the return of the special concessions in Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou on the 5th of this month. Our National Government has separately appointed commissioners for the takeover of the French concessions. The commissioner for the takeover of the French concession in Shameen in this province was also specially appointed by the National Government to be Governor Chen. After receiving the order, Governor Chen immediately carried out preparations and held a takeover ceremony at the French concession in Shameen on the 5th. Those who participated in the grand ceremony that day included Governor Chen and the heads of various departments and military and political officers on our side, the French Consul Xie Meng stationed in Guangzhou on the French side, and the Japanese, German, and Italian consuls general, the Danish and Swedish consuls, the Portuguese vice-consul, and many senior officers of the Japanese army and navy on the side of the guests. At 10:00 am, to the sound of melodious music, the officials and guests entered the venue in an orderly manner. Chen, the takeover commissioner on our side, and French Consul Xie Meng, the representative of the French side, took their seats. First, the French consul delivered a speech, followed by Chen, the takeover commissioner on our side, delivering a reply. After the speeches, the takeover representatives of China and France exchanged salutes. The entire venue was filled with a friendly and warm atmosphere. The French flag was slowly lowered to the sound of the French national anthem played by the band. Then, the flag-raising ceremony of our country was held. At that time, the band played the Chinese national anthem. In the majestic and melodious music, everyone stood in salute. The glorious and solemn blue sky, white sun, and red earth flag fluttered high in the sky, symbolizing the bright and brilliant future of our country. All participants were infinitely excited. At about 11:00 am, the historical takeover ceremony of the French concession in Shameen was successfully completed. The following is the speech of the French consul:

The French Consul's Speech

I respectfully accept the declaration of the French government on March 23rd and, in accordance with the agreement signed in Nanjing on May 17th, hereby return the French concession in Shameen to your country. This consul deeply believes that this move by the French government will not only increase the friendly friendship that has always existed between the peoples of China and France, but will also satisfy the people of your country. This consul is honored to attend this grand ceremony.

Governor Chen's speech Governor Chen also said in his speech: I have been ordered by the National Government to take over the French special concession in Shameen, Guangzhou. I am very happy to hold the takeover ceremony in Shameen today. The existence of concessions in China has a great impact on the integrity of a country's sovereignty and political development, which is recognized by all countries in the world. This year, the friendly nation Japan took the lead in abolishing extraterritorial rights and returning special concessions to China, and assisted China in recovering the British and American special concessions. Since then, Germany and Italy have also advocated it. This proves that international justice remains unchanged. Your country also issued a statement on March 23rd this year abandoning extraterritorial rights in China and returning special concessions. After several sincere consultations with our National Government, it was fully realized today. This shows that your country maintains justice and has full enthusiasm for promoting Sino-French relations and understanding the new East Asian situation. Moreover, the time distance between the statement on March 23rd and today's implementation is very short, which shows your country's sincerity in sympathizing with us and the diplomatic spirit of acting on what it says. I admire it very much. The French concession in Shameen, Guangzhou, has a history of eighty-two years since it was designated in 1861. Today, it is returned to our country for takeover, which is a grand event to enhance Sino-French friendship. The friendship between China and France has always been very close, and the enthusiasm of the people of China and France has always been harmonious. In the future, we must take this return of the special concession by your country as an opportunity to further enhance friendly institutions. I wish our two countries will forever maintain our friendly friendship, increase our well-being, and develop our national fortunes.

I was also deeply impressed by the diligent work of the Japanese military officers and soldiers in Java." Manchurian Major General Liu stated, "Traveling through the highway between Medan and Palembang in Sumatra, I felt the greatness of the Japanese military's achievements. Seeing it firsthand is even more impressive than hearing about it. The peaceful and prosperous lives of the local residents are no different from those in present-day Manchuria. The residents' active cooperation with the Japanese military clearly demonstrates their love and respect for Japan." Thai Major General Chiuthek stated, "The inspection group was warmly welcomed everywhere, and we are very grateful. We inspected several battle sites and heard about the war situation, which further proves the strength and excellent training of the Japanese military. Java has the most abundant resources and population in the Southern regions. The residents are now living in peace and prosperity, and security has been established, making it truly a paradise of the Co-Prosperity Sphere."

Therefore, this work is only just beginning. Marshal Yamamoto's martyrdom and the belief of Chairman Wang and the Chinese people that the Greater East Asia War will be won through this spirit, along with their great courage to persevere in the victory of the war, are deeply appreciated.

### Overview of Economic Construction in Various Southern Regions: Actively Developing Resources and Striving for Production, Demonstrating the Spirit of Solidarity among Eastern Nations

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) ‚Äì Economic construction, including the development of resources and the strengthening of war capabilities within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, has already achieved great results, and a solid foundation for the strategic posture of the Co-Prosperity Sphere has been laid. As the enemy clamors for a counterattack, the construction work in Greater East Asia is becoming increasingly active. Here is a summary of the recent construction status in various Southern regions:

Philippines: The people of the Philippines have increasingly hoped for Philippine independence due to the successive visits of Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia. They have also gained a deeper understanding of the Japanese government's sincere desire to assist the Philippines in achieving independence, and their will to cooperate with Japan has become even stronger. The Philippine administrative authorities recognize that establishing economic self-sufficiency for the Philippines is the most important condition for Philippine independence. Therefore, they have previously implemented a five-year food plan and, with the cooperation of various state governments and the Philippine Service Corps, have convened food production increase coordination meetings in various places, achieving great results. At the same time, the expansion of rice purchasing organizations and the improvement of distribution organizations have also made great progress. Plans for self-sufficiency in daily necessities other than food have also been established, such as plans to increase the production of clothing by utilizing locally produced cotton, ramie, Manila hemp, and other textiles, and the establishment of production facilities for this purpose is currently underway. In addition, various light industrial factories have been added, such as paper, match, soap, soda, electrical appliance, and monosodium glutamate factories. Since then, the Philippine economic self-sufficiency system has been on the right track and is developing daily.

Malaya: Based on the basic policy of establishing a self-sufficiency system, Malaya has begun to implement measures to increase food production, strengthen industrial production, and adjust the rubber industry. Regarding food production increase, in addition to increasing rice production, there are also plans to increase the production of millet, corn, and other coarse grains. The Taiwanese-produced Penglai rice, which has been test-planted at various agricultural experimental farms, has been successful. The authorities also plan to import coarse grains from Java and are considering importing rice from Burma for adjustment. Regarding rubber, the Japanese military confiscated approximately 1.7 million acres of enemy rubber plantations in Malaya and Sumatra. Forty percent of these plantations have been entrusted to private management, while the remaining sixty percent are directly managed by the military administration, with the principle of temporarily suspending production. However, because rubber is the source of livelihood for the indigenous people, it is planned to purchase a considerable amount to provide relief. At the same time, approximately 620,000 indigenous people in Malaya have lost their jobs due to the conversion to other crops. The authorities have decided that 50-60% of these people will be reassigned to increase food production or establish businesses. Therefore, on the one hand, the labor problem has been adjusted, and on the other hand, food production has made rapid progress.

Java: Agricultural gardens and transportation facilities throughout Java have been restored to their former appearance. In order to adapt to the situation, the authorities have established a conversion department in cultivation enterprises, management parks, etc., to manage the conversion and production of agricultural products. For materials currently in overproduction, such as tea, coffee, rubber, silk, and cotton trees, the needs within the Co-Prosperity Sphere and other areas will be reviewed, and partial processing will be carried out separately. For example, tea gardens will be converted to grow cinchona bark, acacia, ramie, etc., and some coffee gardens will be cultivated with cocoa (Diris, name of tropical plants), pyrethrum and other insecticidal raw material plants. In addition, increasing cotton production has been effective, and Java's cinchona bark, which originally accounted for 98% of the world's output, is also being actively increased in production. The authorities are also seeking to rapidly increase the number of Japanese technical experts and, therefore, established a Japanese technical personnel training institute in Bogor Province on May 20th. Furthermore, as in Sumatra, unemployed farmers and workers in Java have been reassigned to other occupations and the process is proceeding smoothly, which is a major success of the authorities' administration. The above-mentioned economic situation in various Southern regions is only a general overview. Although the anti-Axis side recognizes that Japan is mobilizing the resources of the Co-Prosperity Sphere to increase its war capabilities, they all ignore the solidarity in the spirit of the Greater East Asian nations. The various nations within the Co-Prosperity Sphere no longer distinguish between each other. They all have a deep understanding of the true meaning of this war and are striving to overcome any difficulties and jointly fight for the independence and freedom of the East Asian nations. The smooth progress of economic construction in the South with the cooperation of the indigenous people is the best proof of this, and it is something that the anti-Axis countries should pay special attention to.

Guagarda, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) ‚Äì The military administration in this area has decided to establish a sugar industry association to revive the sugar industry in Java. A notice was issued on the 5th stating that the purpose of establishing the sugar industry association is to promote the healthy development of the sugar industry in Java and to manage the factories, agricultural parks, facilities, and products of the sugar industry and its related businesses. It also stipulates a production plan, cultivation methods to promote the sugar industry, and new industries based on the sugar industry, aiming to make Java the largest sugar-producing area in the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Celebes: Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) ‚Äì According to a Taipei telephone report: Okada Fumihide, the Chief of the Civilian Government of the Japanese Navy in Celebes, returned to Japan by plane yesterday to request instructions from the central government. He passed through here on the 4th and said, regarding the current construction status in Celebes and Southern Borneo, that the first task to be undertaken in Celebes is the development of the mining industry and the foundation of modern industry. Recently, the increase in the production of iron, tin, nickel, etc., has been progressing very smoothly, and the reserves of coal necessary for the smelting plant are also very abundant. Therefore, the development of the local steel industry and non-spy light industry is essential. As for this year's cotton production, it is expected to be good due to proper guidance and the cooperation of local residents, and the establishment of textile factories is possible soon. In terms of rice, the soil in Celebes and Borneo is not fertile, so it is necessary to select appropriate rice varieties and seek self-sufficiency in fertilizers to strengthen production. In the old Dutch East Indies era, coconut production was considerable, and it is now planned to extract coconut oil for food, and soap factories are also planned to be established. The authorities also plan to add a comprehensive research institute to the civil government to develop the local area using modern scientific methods. In short, all construction work in Celebes and Borneo is progressing very smoothly due to the enthusiastic assistance of local residents.

### Professor Speer Explains the Current State of German War Production

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) ‚Äì German Armaments Minister Professor Speer delivered a speech at the National Socialist Party rally here yesterday, revealing accurate figures for Germany's armament and ammunition production. He said that since 1942, armament production has doubled, reaching a new record figure. Moreover, as a result of future production processes, there may be even greater increases. Since the spring of 1942, heavy tanks, various anti-aircraft guns, and other armaments, such as naval mines and aircraft, have all seen significant increases. The production of anti-tank armaments has increased tenfold, the production of artillery above 3.7-inch caliber has increased by 400%, the production of anti-aircraft guns has tripled, and Germany's most famous flat-trajectory guns have also increased by 200%. Last year, many new types of aircraft were invented and have been added to the German Air Force. The total production of aircraft has increased several times compared to the previous year. As for the situation of raw materials, the production of coal, iron, and steel has all seen significant increases, and aluminum, magnesium, chromium, manganese, and other metals are also sufficient for application. Germany's armaments industry, fortunately due to well-planned dispersal in advance, is relatively unafraid of air raids, and Germany's production power is constantly increasing. The transportation situation on the German side is very satisfactory, and new locomotives are being built to continue to improve it. The use of wood and other substitutes for gasoline saves fuel equivalent to the establishment of several large-scale synthetic gasoline factories. The number of workers employed in the armaments industry has increased by 23% within a year, and the exchange of production experience between industries has saved a lot of manpower and materials. The two sluice gates recently destroyed by British air raids do not affect armaments production, and the water supply in the Ruhr region is only slightly affected temporarily. In the future, the German armaments industry will continue to add workers and has established new factories to massively produce armaments. Moreover, the inventive genius of the Germans is constantly researching the creation of new weapons and the improvement of old armaments.

### P√©tain Delivers Speech Clarifying France's Attitude: Insisting on Neutrality and Committing to National Reconstruction, Continuing to Supply Labor by Fulfilling Agreements

Paris, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) ‚Äì Marshal P√©tain, when interviewed by a reporter from the Petit Parisien on the 4th, reiterated France's attitude, saying, "I am determined to shoulder the heavy responsibility of reviving France to the end and will not be swayed by any changes. The only task for the French people at present is to faithfully implement France's established national policy. France is bearing the responsibility of rescuing the world, ignoring this fact and attempting to place the responsibility on other countries. Regarding the recent indiscriminate bombing of French cities by the British and American air forces, the bombing of innocent people in non-belligerent countries is an inhumane act." This statement by Marshal P√©tain can be regarded as a reaffirmation that the French government, regardless of the events in North Africa, will still stand on the Axis side and adhere to the policy of neutrality.

Vichy, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) ‚Äì French Premier Laval delivered a radio broadcast to the entire French territory on the evening of the 5th, pointing out the crisis currently facing France and strongly urging the French people to continue to cooperate with the Axis powers and strive to revive their homeland. The gist of his speech was: The French government will not change its friendly relations with Germany and Italy in the slightest. In the future, it will double its cooperation with the two countries and strive to secure its appropriate position in Europe. This war was caused by those who oppose maintaining friendly relations with Germany and Italy. Now, Germany and Italy are shedding blood to defeat communism, and France is assisting by supplying labor. Recently, Germany and France have reached an agreement stipulating that from April 1st to July 1st, France will supply 250,000 workers to Germany. This is the result of my meeting with German Chancellor Hitler, who decided that France should more actively supply labor to Germany. To cope with this situation, it has been decided to conscript all able-bodied men of 1943. Those who evade conscription will be severely punished by the government according to law. Workers in Germany receive the same treatment as French workers. They have fulfilled their due obligations to restore their homeland. I hope that the people of our country will unite and rise up, and then there will be hope for the restoration of the homeland.

### Voice of Scientific Victory (Part 1)

The victory of war is the victory of science. Enthusiasm for science has become widespread in both the front lines and the rear. Since the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese scientific community has made unprecedented and astonishing progress in various weapons and aircraft. However, as the nature of combat becomes more profound, the battle between science and science, which cannot be seen with the naked eye, also becomes more intense. To achieve victory in the Greater East Asia War, this not only requires combat but also requires a scientific war to defeat Britain and the United States and make them unconditionally submit. The victory of science is very spectacular. But this is definitely not something that can be achieved in a day or two. Instead, it requires round-the-clock, squeezing of pus, forgetting to eat and sleep, and years of diligent research before it can be won. Now we are going to talk about some of the research results that the people in the scientific community have already obtained, so as to provide reference for the revitalization of science tomorrow. Let's first take a look at the hard work of scientists published at the 10th-anniversary commemorative lecture of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

### Japanese Rice Spreads Throughout East Asia, Unafraid of Heat, Disease, and Insect Pests

There is an absolutely inseparable and close relationship between the 100 million people in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and their staple food, rice. Rice, only rice, is the source of strength for the East Asian nation, and only rice is the life element of the East Asian nation. Only rice can cultivate the basic vitality of the people who will bear the burden of the Co-Prosperity Sphere tomorrow. However, generally speaking, rice has a wide variety of species, and its performance and form are also very different. But among these countless varieties, the ones that guide agricultural rice growers in East Asia are Japanese rice. Japanese varieties have outstanding performance in both scientific and practical aspects. The harvest is several times greater than that of Southern varieties, and the new Japanese varieties, formed by combining Japanese varieties with Southern varieties, are heat-resistant and insect-resistant. These are transported to various places in the South, so that the rice source of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is constantly increased, so that the food problem of enhancing war power can be absolutely guaranteed. Scientific research targeting the rice of the entire East Asian land must be developed more and more in the future. The discovery of the world-renowned Luyu No. 132 rice has made a great contribution to Japan's food problem. Temple tail Hakuno Dr. of Agriculture, authority of five grains and Chang of the agricultural trial of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Chang of the Agricultural Institute of Tokyo Imperial University, and the recent author of "Rice and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Group", now let's take a little look.

The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Group has its own characteristics in terms of ethnic relations, climate, industry, etc., compared to other regions. However, the biggest feature is rice. Rice cultivation accounts for a large part of the world's rice, and it is all in the East Asian region. The East Asian people rely on this staple food, rice, for survival. The East Asian people prosper and grow together with rice. This is well known. However, although there are major exporting countries such as Thailand, Myanmar, and Annam in the Greater East Asia Group, there are also non-exporting countries. Today in wartime, each region in East Asia must be self-sufficient in rice. This goes without saying. Although it is convenient to say a word of increasing production, in reality it is to give technical and scientific aspects a great difficulty price. What variety should be used to fill the difficulty? Which varieties are most suitable for the South? Which variety harvests more and is resistant to insects and heat? These are the necessary objects to study in the rice of the East Asia Circle.

For the Japanese, whenever "rice" is mentioned, Japanese rice must appear in their minds. However, among rice, there is a complete system. For example, if you look at the rice in China, Thailand, Myanmar and other places, it has obvious differences from Japanese rice in all aspects. For example, rice imported into Japan, whether in terms of taste, nature, or luster, has great differences from Japanese rice. This is something that anyone can see at a glance. But in fact, there are also fundamental differences, even in the egg cells and pollen between Japanese rice and Southern rice. Generally speaking, Southern rice is taller, averaging five to six feet, and the tallest floating rice is even four meters high. And its stems are very thick. Japanese rice is very short, only about four feet. From this point, we can also know that the stem of Southern rice is heavier than the total, and the ear part usually accounts for only 20-30%. The Japanese rice ear accounts for more than 50%. At the same time, the stem quality of Southern rice is quite rough and fragile. The Japanese rice stalk can be used as mats and ropes, while the Southern rice stalk is almost useless. The Japanese pull out the roots at harvest, while the Southern only cut off the ears without moving the stalks. In the next planting, they let it rot in the field as fertilizer.

Let's compare the harvest of Southern rice and Japanese rice. The average yield of Southern rice is 5Êñó per segment (Japanese field unit, equivalent to 992 sq m), and 1Áü≥ is the best result. And sometimes there are disasters such as drought and water, so in reality the average yield is only more than 3Êñó. In Japan, the statistical figures average more than 2Áü≥ per segment, and ordinary harvests are often 4Áü≥, and the best harvests are often as high as 6Áü≥. This is because Japan uses fertilizer to increase the growth of rice. Then, will it have a good effect if fertilizer is applied to Southern varieties? If people who don‚Äôt eat rice force him to eat rice, then they will only spoil their stomachs. Similarly, Southern rice and Japanese rice have different systems, so if the fertilizer used for Japanese rice is given to Southern rice, it will only grow its stems taller, and the rice itself will become weak, so it often falls down.

Then what if the Japanese rice varieties with the highest harvest are transplanted to the South? Then Japanese rice will suffer greatly from diseases and insect pests. Then why is it that Japanese rice is excellent, but it is damaged instead? This is because Japanese rice has the biggest shortcoming: it is not resistant to insects and heat. Therefore, I thought of breeding strong Japanese rice with insect-resistant and heat-resistant Southern rice. On this condition, we must also consider the example of hybrids in animals, such as mules which are hybrids of horses and donkeys, but mules have the deficiency of being unable to reproduce, so we must design how to make up for this deficiency. Few of the mixed rice ears are solid, and most of them are almost chaff, and it can even be said that there is no harvest at all. It is necessary to prevent this reduction in reproductive power. Regarding this issue, many technical difficulties arise. Therefore, this research began in various places and received a wholehearted response. Science! Science! Science can overcome all difficulties and make the impossible possible. Soon, a large amount of excellent Japanese rice varieties will be planted in the South, and the rice business will increase at least fourfold. Perhaps such a day is not far away!

### Argentina Restores Provisional Government Announces Establishment: Strict Measures will be taken in Internal Affairs; Foreign Policy will remain unchanged

Argentina Capital, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) ‚Äì Argentine new President General Lawson has organized a new cabinet on the 5th, and the inauguration ceremony is scheduled to be held on the 6th.

Argentina Capital, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) ‚Äì According to the Reuters News Agency, the lineup of the Argentine government was officially announced last night as follows: President General Lawson, Vice President Rear Admiral Suelo, Minister of Interior Rear Admiral Storni, Minister of Foreign Affairs General Matinays, Minister of Agriculture General Mason, Minister of Public Works General Bisterlini, Minister of Finance Rosa, Minister of Navy Rear Admiral Suelo, Minister of Justice Calderon, Minister of Defense General Ramirez. Except for two members, all cabinet members are military figures.

Argentina Capital, 6th (Telegram) ‚Äì According to the Reuters News Agency, responsible persons here said that the new Argentine government will take strict measures in internal affairs, but the foreign policy will remain unchanged. The government will issue a proclamation in the near future detailing its goals and plans. The arrest of former Minister of Interior Kraciti and former Minister of Agriculture Vitaira is a clear indication of the government's determination to take all necessary measures. The Police Department has also ordered the monitoring of the Communist Party to prevent rebellious activities.

Argentina Capital, 6th (Member) ‚Äì According to the Reuters News Agency, the first proclamation of the Argentine provisional government was not signed and only stated that it would fulfill its international obligations. Military leaders who led the revolution declared that political parties did not participate in this movement, and the government did not receive political leaders. This movement was purely military in nature and was directed against the corruption of political parties. It can be regarded as a purely domestic issue rather than a result of foreign pressure.

### President-Elect Ah Sin Issues Inaugural Telegram

Argentina, Capital City, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency, General Luo Sun, leader of the Argentine revolution, issued an inaugural telegram stating: "Following this incident, I have today assumed leadership of the Argentine government's military movement. Please take note that until the necessary measures required to achieve the objectives of this movement are announced, I request that you implement all steps to ensure public order and security are not disrupted. [Signed] General Luo Sun."

Argentina, Capital City, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency, the new Argentine President, General Luo Sun, is fifty-eight years old. He entered military school at the age of seventeen and, after completing initial training, joined the cavalry. He participated in the Chaco War under the command of Rosas Teno and O'Donnell. At thirty-six, he joined the General Staff. In 1927, he was stationed in La Paz as a military attach√©. In 1930, he returned home and was appointed Principal of the Cavalry School. In 1934, he was transferred to be Commander of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment. Three years later, he became Director of the Civil Service Bureau. In 1938, he was appointed Commander of the 1st Cavalry Division and promoted to general. With the success of the Argentine revolution, General Luo Sun entered Argentine political life on Friday, assuming the office of President.

### Castillo Regains Freedom

Argentina, Capital City, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency, former Argentine President Castillo telegraphed General Luo Sun from La Plata, stating: "Military Commander, I hereby tender my resignation from the positions I previously held. [Signed] Castillo."

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a dispatch from the Argentine capital, the Argentine revolutionary government officially announced: President Castillo, along with the Minister of Interior and the Minister of the Navy, boarded the minesweeper "Doramun" and arrived at the port of La Balata, south of the Argentine capital, at noon on the 5th. They were subsequently arrested there by revolutionary forces and taken to the capital. He has now resigned from the presidency. According to a broadcast from the Argentine capital radio station, which is under the control of the revolutionary forces, President Castillo and his cabinet resigned en masse on the 5th. Dr. Castillo signed the resignation and was immediately released.

### Causes and Consequences of the Revolution

Argentina, Capital City, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency, recent news from the revolutionary party indicates that the cause of the Argentine military coup was the nomination of Costaes as presidential candidate by the National Democratic Party. Costaes was a staunch supporter of President Castillo and his neutral policy, so his nomination was strongly opposed by the military. Defense Minister Ramirez and other army officers failed to persuade President Castillo to withdraw Costaes' nomination, as the Argentine constitution stipulates that the president has no responsibility to interfere in this matter. President Castillo then ordered the dismissal of Defense Minister Ramirez, appointing General Marquis as his successor. Therefore, the military sent a representative to President Castillo, issuing an ultimatum demanding a response before 10:00 AM on Friday. The President had no choice but to board the minesweeper "Doramun" with his cabinet. At the same time, revolutionary elements on the warship took over the government. The revolutionary elements were led by Generals Ramirez, Luo Sun, and Ferrer, and Rear Admiral Su Yiluo. When General Luo Sun marched into the Argentine capital, reporters asked if the revolutionary movement would cooperate with political parties. He replied, "We are all Argentinians, and there is no distinction between political parties." This statement was a bolt from the blue for the Radical Party and nationalists who believed the revolutionary movement would benefit them. However, the fundamental principles of the revolutionary movement are still awaited by all parties. The police's prohibition of government party meetings every minute demonstrates that this revolutionary movement is purely military in nature and has no connection to political parties. However, some unscrupulous elements took the opportunity to disrupt order until the police deployed armored vehicles to patrol the city, restoring order. Most shops remained closed on Saturday, and all city traffic was at a standstill. Military police were stationed at all important locations to maintain order. During the incident, the people were unaware of the truth. Only after General Luo Sun issued a proclamation reassuring the people did they begin to understand. The proclamation stated that Costaes' planned government could not guarantee order, and some government officials were responsible for this incident.

### Attitudes of the United States and Britain

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Huitong News Agency quotes qualified sources in Washington as saying that the United States will recognize the new Argentine regime if it fulfills certain conditions. Upon receiving news of the revolution in Argentina, Washington circles generally believed that the revolution was aimed at the Castillo government's strict adherence to neutrality. Therefore, they warmly welcomed the new government's joining the anti-Axis cause. They now declare that General Luo Sun must prove his ability to maintain law and order and to recognize and fulfill all of Argentina's international obligations. However, before the situation in Argentina stabilizes, Washington's attitude can be described as cautious.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Reuters' diplomatic correspondent claimed last night that while the British government is not in a position to make any criticisms at this stage of the Argentine coup, it can be asserted that the British government will recognize the new government of Ramirez in due course.

### Spain Proposes Establishing Safety Zones, Urges Belligerents to Consider Humanity

Madrid, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In view of the heavy casualties suffered by non-combatants in various belligerent countries due to bombing during this war, the Spanish government made a proposal to all belligerent countries on the 5th, calling on all countries to pay attention to humanitarianism during bombing. In addition, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on this proposal, stating that the Spanish government's proposal to all belligerent countries is based on Spain's strict neutral stance and purely humanitarian considerations, without any suggestion from any belligerent country.

Madrid, 6th (Telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency: The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has formally proposed the establishment of safety zones, free from terror bombing, to emphasize humanitarianism. The Ministry submitted the following points to the press:

(1) Each belligerent country shall indicate the areas that include military targets. (2) Each belligerent country shall indicate areas that contain a portion of military targets, specifying the location of the military targets in detail. (3) Areas without military targets shall also be indicated, and these areas shall not be bombed. If military targets are established in these areas, the belligerent countries shall reach an understanding on this matter. (4) Appoint a standing committee of neutral countries, and each belligerent country may also send "advisors" to participate. The nature of this committee is similar to that of the "Prisoner of War Committee" during the First World War, and its task is to manage the implementation of these restrictions.

The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that this proposal is not intended to restrict the activities of the air force, but is entirely based on humanitarian considerations. Rumors that Spain is being exploited by foreign countries are completely untrue. The foreign ministries of all major powers can prove Spain's independence and its zeal for protecting its sovereignty.

### President Roosevelt to Deliver Broadcast Speech Today

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the White House announced yesterday that President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech to the representatives attending the Hot Springs Conference tomorrow.

### British Prime Minister to Report to the House of Commons on the Washington Conference

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a communiqu√© issued from London last night, Prime Minister Churchill will make a brief statement at the next meeting of the House of Commons. It is believed that Churchill will report on his recent consultations with Roosevelt and his visits to Algiers and Tunisia.

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The British Cabinet held a plenary meeting yesterday, chaired by Churchill. The meeting was held a few hours after Churchill returned to London from North Africa. At the same time, well-informed sources in London yesterday denied that Churchill had participated in the negotiations between Giraud and de Gaulle in Algiers. It is said that Churchill, accompanied by British Chief of the General Staff General Brooke, only attended the ceremony after the establishment of the French Committee of National Liberation. Churchill only met Giraud and de Gaulle on Friday at a banquet hosted by British Mediterranean Fleet Commander Cunningham. It was revealed yesterday that Churchill was accompanied to North Africa by British Foreign Secretary Eden, General Brooke, and U.S. Chief of Staff General Marshall. This group met several times with Generals Eisenhower, Alexander, Montgomery, and Anderson, as well as Air Chief Marshal Tedder and other military leaders. It is said here that these consultations are a continuation of the discussions in Washington.

### US Coal Mine Strike Resolved, 500,000 Workers Return to Work

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The United Mine Workers of America yesterday ordered 500,000 workers to return to work on Tuesday.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A dispatch from Washington: The strike dispute of coal miners in the eastern United States was resolved on the 4th thanks to the advice to resume work given to workers by Louis, who represented 10,000 unemployed people, and the decision of the Coal Mine Association to resume work. Thus, this is effectively a victory for the government. The coal mining industry has suffered enormous losses from the strike in the past five days. Reuters New York correspondent Immsion estimated that the losses amounted to tens of millions of tons. Among them, Carnegie Illinois Steel Works in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, suffered particularly significant losses. On the 5th, due to the lack of coking coal, eleven blast furnaces at the steel plant were extinguished. The company also announced that it is actively working to maintain other blast furnaces, which shows the extent of the losses.

### North China Special Report: The Future of North China ‚Äì Prospects for Self-Strengthening ‚Äì Talk by Commander Otani of the Japanese Army in North China

Regarding the various situations in North China after Japan's shift in its policy toward China, the current state of the Japanese army in North China and the results of the spring campaign, China's participation in the war and Japan's policy toward China, as well as the future problems of North China and current issues, Commander Otani of the Japanese Army in North China spoke to reporters on the 4th: The Japanese army in North China, in accordance with national policy, has been shifting its policy toward China since the beginning of this year. As a result, the people of North China have been able to re-recognize the meaning of Sino-Japanese cooperation and strive for self-strengthening. The construction of North China is also gradually getting on track. The main points can be divided into the following:

(1) The Current Situation of the North China Army and the Results of the Spring Campaign

Since the beginning of this year, the Japanese army in North China has transferred political and economic affairs handled by the military to the Chinese side for self-management. The Japanese army has basically stabilized the entire territory of North China on a large scale and is actively assisting the Chinese side in laying the foundation for self-strengthening. As a result, the North China Army only needs to bear the burden of combat affairs. In terms of attacking the Yu and Communist armies, significant results have been achieved. The tasks of the military have been simplified, so the combat power can naturally increase. Looking at the statistics of the battle results, the two items of prisoners and captured goods, up to the end of April last year, the number of Yu and Communist troops who surrendered was 739 times, with 31,647 soldiers. Up to April of this year, the number of surrenders was about 500 times, with about 100,000 soldiers. After investigation, the latter has fewer times but more soldiers, which proves that the Yu and Communist armies have realized this and can gather to return. At the same time, the Yu side's will to fight has declined, and the decline in combat power is becoming more and more obvious.

(2) The Mission of North China and Current Issues

North China occupies the position of a supply base in the Greater East Asia War and is also the central area for the construction of Greater East Asia. Its position and mission will become even more important in the future. At this moment, the duty entrusted to us is to make North China an ideal place for Sino-Japanese cooperation in material and spiritual terms. To create a true cooperative relationship, it is necessary to develop the economy in order to promote the Sino-Japanese joint war. However, there is still a Chinese Communist army in North China, which is an obstacle to the construction of North China. I am deeply afraid that ignorant people will be deceived by the Chinese Communists one day. The purpose of the Chinese Communists is to take advantage of the chaos to communize China in order to establish their dictatorial regime. At present, Chiang Kai-shek is adopting a policy of accommodation toward the Communists, but Chiang also knows the nature of the Communists and is only trying to use them temporarily. In order to build a healthy North China, the Japanese army is determined to thoroughly eliminate the Communist army. Therefore, it is urgent to recognize its conspiracy to win over the people through false propaganda and coercion, establish counter-communist countermeasures, and launch vigorous actions. In particular, the new politics of the Chinese side must be widely and deeply rooted in the people, because relying solely on military force is not enough to suppress the Communists. Looking at the Communist strategy of using popular support as a background, the new political forces of the Chinese side must closely follow the military force of the Japanese army and be widely and deeply rooted in the villages that have been communized. The Japanese army is particularly concerned about this and will not hesitate to provide full support.

(3) The Inevitable Victory of the Japanese Army in North China

Everything in North China, as mentioned above, has been painstakingly built over the past six years, and I am convinced that the path to success is not far away. Since the beginning of this year, the Japanese army in North China has followed national policy and changed its policies. At the same time, the people of North China have also re-recognized the true meaning of Sino-Japanese cooperation, and the atmosphere of active self-strengthening has suddenly become intense. On the one hand, the overall combat power of the Japanese army in North China has been actively improved. With this strength, we can protect North China, cooperate in restoring public order, and promote sound construction. In short, the Japanese army in North China is full of confidence in victory and hopes that the people of North China will trust the fair attitude of the Japanese army in order to build North China and contribute to the healthy development of the new China and the completion of the Greater East Asia War.

### Beijing Correspondence: A Corner of the Academic World in the Old Capital: A Cultural Institution of a Neutral Country

‚Äî Student

In these times when the smell of gunpowder permeates the world, neutral countries are rare indeed. To transform from a belligerent to a neutral country is even more unprecedented. In these withering times, the establishment of a cultural institution is rare enough. A cultural institution devoted solely to the study of Sinology is even more commendable. Therefore, under this double "rarity," it is not surprising that the founding of the "Sino-French Institute of Sinology" is intriguing.

The Sino-French Institute of Sinology is an academic institution founded by the French Embassy in China in the autumn of the year before last. The origins of the cultural communication between France, known as the center of modern Western culture, and Chinese culture go back a long way. In the late sixteenth century, French Jesuits conducted some sporadic research on China. However, the scientific study of China began in the early eighteenth century, with the contributions of Fathers Ma Ruose and Song Junrong being the greatest. Further efforts by Professors Remusa and Julien in the nineteenth century laid the foundation for modern French Sinology. France has long been recognized by the world academic community as the center for Sinological research. At this most delicate moment in the international situation, the French Embassy in China actually wanted to open a new path in academic culture and founded the Sino-French Institute of Sinology. Its contribution to the academic community cannot be denied.

The original location of the Institute was downstairs in the library of the Sino-French University and in several bungalows to the north (the building of the Sino-French University was lent to the Law School of Peking University, and there were few rooms left). Last autumn, the research room was moved a little further north, downstairs from the Xuexue Institute, leaving only the library and exhibition room in their original location. Now, after renovation and refurbishment, the appearance of the Institute has a certain dignity.

There are two people in charge of the Institute. The so-called Director, who is responsible for research guidance, is Mr. Dor Meng. The Chairman, who is actually responsible for administrative affairs, is Mr. Du Boqiu, the secretary of the embassy. Mr. Dor is an old China hand, having spent more time in China than in France. He came to China more than thirty years ago as a professor at Peking University, and later taught at Peking University and the Sino-French University. Now he is almost "white-haired and bearded like clouds," but he is still very energetic, always working until two or three o'clock. It was under such a diligent spirit that he succeeded in becoming a figure in the current French Sinological community, although he has no major works, he is the boss behind the famous Sinologist Granet. Mr. Du, on the other hand, is a relatively young diplomat. He is the son-in-law of a famous Chinese antique dealer. Perhaps influenced by his wife, he became interested in Chinese academics, especially Chinese ancient paintings. He has collected many Chinese ancient paintings and antiquities, and is considered an antique connoisseur. He was the main contributor to the establishment of the Sino-French Institute of Sinology. We can see him every day sitting in his most modern car traveling between Jiaomin Lane and Donghuangchenggen, a busy man in Beijing.

The Institute has four groups: Folklore Group, Language Group, History Group, and Index Compilation Group. Each group has its own special work and plans. The entire Institute has about twenty or thirty researchers, clerical staff, and secretaries. They go to the Institute all day to work, hoping to find treasures from the piles of broken ancient paintings.

The Institute publishes a journal called "French Studies." The articles published fall into two main categories: one is to introduce French, mostly translations of famous French works, and the other is to introduce Chinese, mostly translations of excellent Chinese works. It is a reference material specifically for foreigners to study Chinese or Chinese to study French.

The Institute has held two exhibitions. One was the Chinese New Year Paintings Exhibition in the summer of last year. It collected many New Year paintings from various places and made simple textual research on the characters and stories in the books, which were printed into a catalog. Later, a film company made it into a film. People in Shanghai may have seen Mr. Du Boqiu gesturing in the exhibition hall on the screen. One is the Exhibition of French Sinological Works of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries, which is still being held. It has collected seventy-five kinds of rare and ancient paintings, as well as sixteen paintings of the complete map of the pacification of the Ili Hui Region and twelve paintings of the war to pacify Xinjiang painted for the Qing court by Western painters, all of which are rare materials. Among them, "A Continuation of the Current Situation in China" by Li Ming, published in 1701, "Notes on the Chinese Language" in Latin by Ma Ruose, published in 1831, "Outline of the Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government" translated into French by Feng Bingzheng, published between 1777 and 1785, and "French-Chinese-Mongolian Dictionary" copied in the eighteenth century are the rarest. The Institute has published a catalog of the exhibited works, with brief introductions to the author's life and the beginning and end of his study of Sinology. Overall, it can be considered a lively show for the lonely academic community in Beijing.

In addition, in order to help Chinese students learn French and French students learn Chinese, there are also French evening schools and special Chinese classes. This structure is enough to be called "Sino-French."

I remember when the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica was established, Mr. Fu Sinian said that the Chinese should strive to move the center of Sinological research from Paris to Beijing. Now the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica has followed Mr. Fu Sinian and ran to the side of the Lijiang River, where "less than ten people have died two or three." In Beijing, apart from this Sino-French Institute of Sinology, there is no other organized institution dedicated to the study of Sinology. However, this is also incomplete, and besides, it was founded by the French, and the purpose is inevitably to focus on the cultivation of French Sinologists. So, when will Mr. Fu Sinian's wish have any hope of being realized? (June 2nd)

### Police Department Explains in Detail: If Police Officers Engage in Unruly Behavior, Citizens Can Report Directly to the Police Department. Baojia Personnel Should Assist from the Sidelines and Should Not Engage in Direct Confrontations.

In view of the fact that maintaining public order at the Squid Fair is the practical responsibility of police officers, and that Self-Defense Corps members and the public should assist from the sidelines, the Public Concession Police Department is issuing this notice because citizens often have various misunderstandings when police officers are performing their duties. Therefore, it is specially sending a letter to the Baojia Committee for detailed explanation. Now the Baojia Committee has forwarded the letter to the Lienpao Chiefs, instructing the residents under their jurisdiction. Our Shanghai Social News reporter has transcribed the original letter as follows: "It has been noted that citizens often misunderstand the authority of police officers when they are performing their duties, which leads to misunderstandings and disputes, which is extremely regrettable. Now, in order to strengthen citizens' understanding and respect for police authority, the following explanations are provided:

Thoroughly Investigate Unruly Behavior: This Police Department is the parent official of the local citizens, and its duty is to maintain local public order. In addition to strictly abiding by the law, citizens should also fully assist at all times and in all places. In particular, Baojia personnel should also persuade citizens who are unclear so that they do not misunderstand and cause trouble. As for police officers performing their duties, if there is any unruly behavior, citizens can record their number, date, time, and facts in detail and report them directly to the Director of this Department in writing or orally, who will thoroughly investigate and handle them. We must strive to obtain close contact between the citizens and the Police Department and clarify bad habits.

Avoid Direct Confrontations: It is further explained that the establishment of the current Baojia system is purely for the purpose of citizen self-government. Baojia personnel should bear the obligation to assist the authorities and are definitely not comparable to police agencies. It is natural for their assistance measures to directly assist public officials in performing their duties, but when reporting public officials, they must not engage in direct confrontations with the police officer, otherwise, they may be suspected of obstructing official duties. This is a key to local public order, and it is necessary to consider the citizens' own position and understanding of local agencies. Only with a deep understanding can the foundation of social order be laid.

### Today is the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Police Department is on Strict Alert

The Municipal Police Headquarters, in order to ensure public order in the city today on the lunar Dragon Boat Festival, has ordered the Detective Corps and its subordinate branches to strengthen their vigilance to ensure safety. In addition to the fact that each branch has been ordered to be on alert, the Detective Corps Commander has also instructed each sub-team to pay attention to and strictly search the ports and stations at all times. All iron gates in the French Concession have also been assigned personnel to guard and implement inspections.

### The Zhang Jinhai Murder Case Will Be Re-trialed This Morning

Regarding the Zhang Jinhai murder case, the Second Special District Local Court of this city has opened a trial twice. This morning at 9:00 AM, the court will summon Li Xiuying's father, Li Yinsheng, and his neighbor, Huang Xiqing, as well as the relevant witnesses Kang Wanqing and Chen Hongli, to court for questioning. At the same time, the two murderers, Mirai and Buckley, will also be summoned to court for cross-examination.

### Distribution of Sugar in Nanshi Phase 3: Adulteration and Fraud Discovered, Hope the Responsible Authorities Will Stop It

The Municipal Food Bureau has entrusted the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office to universally start selling the Phase 3 household sugar in Nanshi from yesterday. However, the trend of sugar adulteration among general sugar merchants has not been curbed. It has been found that Huang Jixiang and Yu Jiabin, the hosts of Hengxing Store at No. 22 Chuanjia Street, Huajin Road, Nanshi, grind the coarse granulated sugar allocated by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office into fine sugar, add powder, and mix it with cold water, in order to covertly deduct sugar. This has caused complaints from nearby residents. Moreover, the purchased sugar often feels short in weight. It is hoped that the responsible authorities will effectively curb this, severely punish it, and deter others from following suit.

### Vigilance During Air Raid Alarms: Do Not Extinguish All Lights, But Ensure Light Does Not Escape

Yesterday (the 5th) morning, the French Concession's Xuhui District Police Department summoned the district's Baojia (neighborhood security) chiefs for training. This was deemed necessary to correct and explain the lighting situation during the previous night's air raid drill in the district. A French police chief delivered instructions, which were translated by Inspector Zhong Youlin, roughly as follows: The performance of the 148th Lianbao (joint security unit) was the best during the air raid drill the previous night. The unit was completely dark, without a trace of light. However, during vigilance alarms, one should not extinguish electric lights. It is only necessary to properly cover the windows with curtains. Lamps should also be covered with black cloth lampshades to ensure that light does not shine outwards. Only during emergency alarms should electric lights be completely extinguished, otherwise the most severe penalties will be imposed. Extinguishing electric lights during vigilance alarms is a mistake. Furthermore, according to a report by the Datong News Agency, the Xuhui District will continue to hold air raid drills on the evening of the 7th (Monday). At that time, senior police officers from the department will personally inspect lighting and all air defense equipment at various locations.

### Today is the Dragon Boat Festival: Donate Festival Funds to Help Disaster Victims; Industrial and Commercial Sectors Save on Banquets; This Newspaper Will Collect and Forward Donations Again

The plight of the disaster in Northern China is already well known to all sectors of Shanghai society. Since the launch of relief efforts, there has been enthusiastic support and generous donations. The collected funds have already reached a certain amount. However, the disaster area is vast, and there are many victims, requiring huge amounts of money. Today is the Dragon Boat Festival. Leaders from all sectors of society, recognizing the urgency of the situation, are either saving on banquets to aid relief efforts or allocating business profits to relief funds, acting selflessly and justly, which is deeply admirable. Donations can be directly handed over to this newspaper for collection, so that they can be accumulated and forwarded to the receiving agencies for processing.

Basketball Charity Match Continued

The second relief basketball match, between Zhongbei and Junyu, continued last night at the China Youth Hall, with a larger audience than the previous night. Unfortunately, Junyu was exhausted from continuous fierce battles. Apart from leading twice in the first half, they were ultimately defeated by Zhongbei by a score of 34 to 30, winning a triumphant victory by two points. Last night's charity ball auction was purchased by Li Xiaobao for 30,000 yuan. Junyu donated a total of 1,080 yuan, the Shanghai side's food expenses for three days, entirely to the disaster relief fund. Tonight at 8 p.m., Junyu will play against Xilian, still at the China Youth Hall.

### Mr. Yuan Ludeng Sells Calligraphy to Aid Relief Efforts: Limited to Today Only

Mr. Yuan Ludeng, recognizing the severity of the disaster situation in North China, has accepted the invitation of the Shanghai Painting Gallery on Zhejiang Road (at the intersection of Ningbo Road) to sell calligraphy to aid relief efforts. Fan surfaces are priced at 100 yuan per page, and four- or five-foot couplets and signboards are priced at 200 yuan each. The painting gallery will collect the items on his behalf, and all donations will be sent to the collecting agency in the name of the calligrapher. This is limited to today (the 7th) only. Those who wish to acquire Mr. Yuan's calligraphy should not miss this opportunity.

### Sun Yat-sen's Calligraphy is Auctioned for Charity Relief Efforts: Donation from Senior Medical Figure Mr. Ding Cu-hu

In response to this newspaper's call for emergency relief in North China, in addition to collecting donations, we are also launching a "North China Emergency Relief Calligraphy, Painting, Photography, Antiques, and Treasures Charity Exhibition." We have invited Mr. Ding Huikang, Wang Jimei, Lang Jingshan, Xu Langxi, Xia Jiancheng, Zhang Yipeng, and Liu Haisu (in order of stroke count of surnames) to form a committee to preside over it, widely soliciting famous calligraphers, painters, photographers, and collectors in the city to sympathize with the disaster victims in North China and generously part with their masterpieces and treasures to participate in the charity auction. We have now received a vertical scroll of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's calligraphy "The World is for All When the Great Way Prevails" donated by Mr. Ding Zhonghu Fubao, a senior figure in the medical community, which is highly valuable. This newspaper respectfully expresses its gratitude and publishes a reproduction. We also hope that all sectors of society will donate treasures to jointly support this righteous cause.

### Su Yizhi Case: Wuxi Compatriots Express Support: Letter to the Court Requesting Justice

Since the Su Yizhi case, where she died in anger after being humiliated, occurred in this city, all sectors of society have been indignant, and public opinion has been in an uproar, accusing Liu Wangshi of illegality, hoping that the judicial authorities will make a decision as soon as possible to satisfy the public. However, the Special First Court held a hearing on the 2nd, but postponed it to the morning of the 11th because the autopsy report had not yet been delivered. There is much suspicion and discussion about why the autopsy report has been delayed. Yesterday was Teachers' Day, and the Wuxi Association in Shanghai sent a special representative to comfort the Su Yizhi family and sent a letter to the Special First Court, requesting justice and vowing to provide support. A board of directors meeting will be held in the coming days to discuss how to proceed. The association hopes that all organizations in this city will uphold justice and support the Su case. The association's official letter to the Special First Court is recorded as follows: "Sir/Madam: It has come to our attention that Ms. Su Yizhi, a teacher at the private Sacred Heart Elementary School in this city, was repeatedly insulted by Liu Wangshi, the family member of student Liu Zhijun, for disciplining the student, and died in anger. Whether there was fatal injury etc. will have to be determined after a forensic examination, we will not discuss it for now. It is about applying corporal punishments, respecting the importance of teaching, Xia Chu's case can be seen in the scriptures. However, the family member Liu Wangshi became tyrannical by nature, and relying on being the wife of the secretary of the Lianbao office, ignorant of observing laws and regulations, dared to take advantage of her position, arbitrarily roar, punch and kick, which is very hateful, and will not be able to maintain the dignity of education if she is not severely punished. This association has the relationship of compatriot with Ms. Su Yizhi, and now seeing Ms. Su's tragic death, the situation is deeply sympathetic, and we should give sympathy and give her support. In addition to sending letters of support, we should send a letter to request that you investigate and severely punish Liu Wangshi, to quell public anger and redress the grievance, and we are grateful for that. Sincerely, the Shanghai Wuxi Association."

### Bandit Robs Vietnamese Police Officer of Gun, Arrested

Vietnamese Police Officer No. 358 of the French Concession was on duty at the intersection of East Avenue Edward and Zilaihuo Street yesterday morning. Suddenly, two men in short clothes came from behind, intending to rob him of his gun. As one of them was wrestling with the officer, the other pulled out a sharp axe and struck his head, causing a wound about two inches deep, with blood flowing freely. However, the officer still blew his whistle frantically in pain, resulting in the arrest of one of the assailants. The other managed to escape. The arrested suspect confessed his name as Ni Xingyuan, 28 years old, from Pudong, and admitted his guilt without hesitation. The injured officer was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

### Remedying the Panic in Papermaking Raw Materials: First Batch of Pulp to Arrive in Shanghai This Month: Paper Prices Expected to Gradually Decrease

The soaring paper prices have significantly impacted cultural undertakings. The pulp, which is the raw material for papermaking in this city, had its allocation suspended previously. Therefore, personnel were dispatched to request the Japanese side to continue the allocation. However, the news has been slow in coming, leading the papermaking industry in this city to repeatedly raise paper prices, citing a lack of raw materials.

First Batch of Pulp to Arrive in Shanghai This Month: It has recently been learned that the source of the aforementioned pulp raw materials has been secured. The first batch of 5,000 tons of pulp is expected to arrive in Shanghai this month from Japan, Taiwan, Manchuria, and other places. Thereafter, if the situation remains unchanged, 3,000 to 5,000 tons of pulp will continue to be shipped to Shanghai in July, August, September, and October.

Pulp Prices Expected to Decrease:

There are currently a total of 17 Chinese-owned paper mills in this city. Since September of last year, they have not received any pulp allocation and have used old wastepaper as their main raw material for papermaking, leading to a significant increase in the price of wastepaper, and the production volume of paper mills has also decreased to 60%. After this batch of pulp arrives, due to its good quality and low price, the papermaking industry in this city can be revitalized. And paper prices are also expected to be reduced.

### Vagrant Labor Training Center Actively Hiring Workers for Construction; Salvation Army to Establish Bathhouse for Beggars

The World Red Cross Society was designated by the authorities of the three municipal districts of this city to operate the Caohujing Vagrant Labor Training Center since the beginning of last month, and a month has passed. The training center is actively hiring workers for construction, and some parts have already been completed.

Ready to Start Handling Accommodation Matters: It is said that the authorities have purchased 90 acres of land in Caohujing and are preparing to build 400 rooms. The municipal authorities and the World Red Cross Society have allocated huge sums of money for operation, and it is expected that the Vagrant Labor Training Center can be fully completed within this year. In order to maintain summer hygiene and preserve street cleanliness, although the training center has not been fully completed, it has already begun to handle accommodation matters.

The Life of Street Beggars is on the Brink of Collapse:

It has been found that most street beggars do not have residence permits, so the authorities have reason to order them to be sent to Caohujing on this basis. It is said that the life of the general street beggar is currently struggling in the border between life and death due to the hardship of life, so most of them are willing to live in the training center if the authorities order them to.

Recent Situation of the Salvation Army's Beggar Camp:

The Salvation Army's Beggar Camp held a fundraising movement for one month this year. The original target was 200,000 yuan, but the result was only 60,000 yuan, short of 140,000 yuan, and the results were very low. At the same time, according to an employee of the camp, the camp plans to set up a bathhouse for beggars this summer, so that beggars can bathe with vouchers to maintain the personal and public hygiene of beggars.

### Citizens' Consumer Cooperative: Enthusiastic Participation from All Sectors

Leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors of this city, in view of the frequent soaring prices of all goods, which is related to people's livelihood and social security, have initiated the preparation for the establishment of the "Shanghai Citizens' Consumer Cooperative." It is planned to have 50,000 people as basic members, becoming a large-scale consumer cooperative organization, to centrally purchase major goods in large quantities and sell them to members at low prices. In order to establish the cooperative as soon as possible, a first preparatory meeting was held, and Sun Zhenquan was publicly elected as the director of the preparation, and the solicitation of members was approved. It is learned that participation in the cooperative as members from all sectors is very enthusiastic, but the period is not long, until the 15th of this month. Anyone who wishes to join can go directly to the cooperative's office at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to obtain application forms.

### Shanghai Epidemic Hospital: Epidemic Department Scheduled to Open

The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital's epidemic department this year is scheduled to open on the 16th of this month and has hired seven main physicians and four special physicians to see patients. All expenses for the hospital's third-class ward are free. Patients can contact the hospital directly, and the procedures are simple. Admission is only subject to the approval of the hospital's physician.

### The Nation and Teachers

‚Äî Zhou Huarin

‚ÄîRadio Broadcast Speech on the 32nd Teachers' Day in Shanghai‚Äî

Dear teachers, fellow citizens, today is Teachers' Day. Before I get to the topic, I want to mention two recent events that are very sad. One is the suicide of Mr. Su Yizhi, a teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School, and the other is the murder of a classmate by a middle school student, Mei Lianjiang. The former is the result of a parent who has not received education casually insulting a teacher, causing the teacher to die in anger. The latter can be said to be caused by the failure of school education. Facing these two education cases, we are truly ashamed and heartbroken. And today is Teachers' Day, and I am asked to say a few words, so I can't help but feel deeply emotional. But these two events have their greatest causes and their social backgrounds. We don't have to blame anyone for being responsible. However, we ask the nation and society to bear a kind of responsibility for teachers, and teachers should also fulfill a kind of obligation to the nation and society. Now I would like to explain these two aspects.

First, the responsibility that the nation should bear for teachers: Teachers endure hunger and cold and work hard as youth, the purpose of which is certainly not to hope to get any reward from students, but to hold a lofty ideal, for the bright future of the nation and make the next generation of citizens get rid of the life of the dark ages. Therefore, they do not hesitate to sacrifice personal comfort, do not avoid spiritual and living pain, to nurture talents for the country and create good citizens for society. Teachers' aspirations are so pure and righteous, so the nation and society should show respect, fulfill the responsibility of supporting and guaranteeing them, not only expressing sympathy for their hardships, expressing admiration for their hard work, but must bear the specific responsibility of assistance. The so-called specific responsibility, the first is for the cultivation of teachers. If the country wants excellent citizens and useful talents, it must have good teachers. The creation of good teachers must have a good normal school system. Let us try to check the situation of today's normal schools. The equipment is indeed simple and crude, and the normal school students created are not necessarily engaged in teaching. Therefore, the teachers serving in schools, 70% to 80% are not normal school talents, and those who are just filling the ranks are in the majority. Looking at this situation, the lack of teachers today is really a regret in education. Therefore, working hard on the cultivation of teachers should be an important task at present. But cultivating teachers cannot be done immediately. Before the normal school system is perfect, the old teachers should be trained, that is, to create new teachers on the one hand and retrain the original teachers on the other, so as not to neglect either. The students of normal schools should be given strict training to cultivate sound normal school talents.

The second is the issue of appointment. After rigorous training, students of normal schools should be immediately assigned as school teachers. Their treatment should be equal to that of civil servants, because they are fulfilling the responsibility of educating citizens for the country, just as civil servants are serving the country. Therefore, teachers should also enjoy the same treatment as civil servants. Teachers who have been trained and qualified cannot be transferred or dismissed without reason to maintain their permanent position.

The third is the issue of security. Graduates of normal schools should have concrete security, such as regulations on annual salary increases? To guarantee their lives, they cannot be dismissed without fault to guarantee their positions, and insurance and savings systems should be adopted to guarantee the occurrence of their accidents. Other welfare matters for teachers must also be planned and implemented in detail. These are all matters that should be specially stipulated by the state.

The fourth is the issue of rewards. It is not only should be rewarding their efforts at work, not only should be rewarding their perseverance, not only rewarding their contribution to scientific education, but also rewarding their spirit of constantly seeking knowledge, rewarding theÂèëÊå• of their special skills, and the methods of reward are divided into several types: honorary rewards, promotion rewards, and special rewards. Those with excellent results should be given special cultivation and promotion by the state. The above four are just examples, but even these four are the minimum responsibility that the nation and society should fulfill for teachers.

Second, the obligations that teachers should fulfill to the country: Regarding this point, I think all teachers have already understood it, and are practicing it, so I don't need to say more, but I think that in today's era, in addition to fulfilling their responsibilities in school education, teachers should also pay attention to the issues of social education and the ideology of the times. Schools are certainly educational institutions, but society is also a place for education. Even if school education is done well, if the social environment is too bad, it is easy to make the education students receive at school disappear without a trace. Therefore, while we are committed to school education, we must pay attention to social education. That is, teachers should be loyal to their duties in schools and set an example and play a model role in society, so that the social atmosphere can be changed and a good social environment can be created. Then school education and social education can be integrated to achieve the highest efficiency of education. This is one of the obligations that teachers should fulfill. Secondly, regarding the issue of the ideology of the times, schools are for the country to educate the people, and teachers bear a great responsibility for whether the people's thoughts are correct or not. Therefore, teachers must thoroughly understand the ideology of the times. For example, the program of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building is the national education policy, and the idea of Pan-Asianism and building a new East Asian order are the guiding ideologies of the times. We must uphold the national education policy and instill the ideology of the times into the people so that they can unite with each other and work hard for the liberation of the East Asian nations. This is the second obligation that teachers should fulfill. Since teachers have received the cultivation of the country, the respect of society, and the entrustment of parents, it is only natural that they regard education as a lifelong task. However, because the position is precious and important, their knowledge must advance with the times. Otherwise, if their knowledge is outdated, they will not be able to achieve their mission. To supplement their own knowledge, they must constantly learn and constantly seek knowledge, on the one hand, seeking the increase of experience, and on the other hand, seeking the increase of new knowledge, using their life's energy to devote themselves to the joy of education. This is the third obligation that teachers should fulfill.

Finally, I would like to express a point of view. Teachers endure the pain of material deprivation and a poor life, and continue to develop their spirit of serving the country. This is something we extremely admire. There are no less than 13,000 teachers in large and small schools in Shanghai. The average living expenses of elementary school teachers per month are less than 300 yuan, and the average for middle school teachers is less than 500 yuan. This material life is really not as good as that of vendors and peddlers. However, they still hold the ambition of nurturing talents for the country and continue to serve, which is really admirable. However, we cannot think that this situation is desirable. We hope that the nation and society will provide teachers with a guarantee of life.

Finally, I want to tell you teachers that after Germany failed in the First World War, German teachers only ate two slices of black bread every day. And their spirit of teaching young people never slackened. Twenty years later, Germany is again engaged in educational work in difficult circumstances, and there will definitely be a price in the future. The price we get is the independence, freedom, and equality of the nation. When we are enduring hardship, we can only take this sentence as comfort and encouragement to everyone.

### Closing Gambling Houses and Curbing Excessive Interest Pawnshops

‚Äî Wang Shi

The evils of gambling dens have been discussed extensively in this newspaper, but the authorities have yet to take concrete measures and actions to crack down on them, which is very disappointing to our citizens. Looking at the large and small gambling dens in the various districts of the southern city, no less than tens of thousands of people are indulging in them every day, and most of them are young people. Losing fortunes and ruining reputations are the inevitable consequences for gamblers, and many people are still stubbornly persisting. On the one hand, it is indeed due to the gamblers' weak will and lack of self-control, which is their own fault. On the other hand, it is also due to the extremely strong and huge temptation of gambling dens. The temptations used are all the strongest in psychology, such as providing gamblers with satisfaction of appetite, hobbies, and enjoyment. Think carefully, the harm these two so-called entertainment and "winning makes you want to win more, losing makes you want to win back" pleasure grounds cause to our compatriots is no less than that of gambling dens. Why is that? Consider the following reasons: (1) Good Location: Although Shanghai is said to have more than four million people, the two concessions account for the majority. The two fields are located in the center of the French Concession, with convenient transportation and a central location, so their attraction is naturally greater than that of gambling dens. (2) Involvement of Intellectuals: Generally speaking, the patrons of gambling dens are nothing more than pot-bellied merchants, idle wives and young mistresses, and some hooligans. These people are parasites of society and waste products of the country, and they should have been eliminated at this time and place. What is there to pity about such "people"? As for the people who enter and leave the Jai Alai stadium and the dog racing track, they are very different from the former. The author lives on Avenue Albert and often sees young students (especially university students) entering and leaving them. Not a small number. They use their desire for money and the gambler's gambling psychology to achieve the purpose of killing people without bloodshed and devouring a large amount of gamblers' essence and blood. According to statistics, fifty or sixty families are ruined by gambling every day, and several people lose their lives every day, and it has become a breeding ground for crimes in Shanghai. The extent of the harm can be seen from this. If we continue to tolerate it, a portion of Shanghai's citizens and a portion of promising young people will inevitably be devoured by it, and the future of public security is also quite worrying.

In the past, gambling dens in the four districts of Shanghai were everywhere. Since Director Pan took office, he acted swiftly and decisively, clearing them all out in a few days. We deeply admire Director Pan's bold and resolute methods and hope that the authorities in the southern city will also do the same, closing all the gambling dens in various places, without worrying about other issues. It is better to cut out the rotten flesh than to let the whole body suffer. This is what all the citizens of Shanghai deeply hope for, so that they can live and work in peace.

Pawnshops next to gambling dens aid the wicked in their misdeeds, exploit people with high interest rates, and disregard humanity. The interest rates are so high and the pawn periods are so short that they are rare in ancient and modern times. Each pawnshop generally operates two types of business: pawning goods and pawning pawn tickets. The pawn period for goods is generally two months, with an interest rate of eight percent per month, plus additional "storage rent" and "storage box" fees of ten percent. For example, if a suit of clothes is pawned for one hundred yuan, the amount written on the pawn ticket is one hundred and ten yuan. When redeeming, an additional eight percent interest is added. If it is redeemed before one month, it will cost one hundred and eighteen yuan and eight jiao, plus a few jiao for "stamp duty." If it is not redeemed after two months, it will be confiscated. As for "pawning pawn tickets," the interest is so high that it is inhumane. For example, a pawn ticket with a face value of more than two hundred yuan can be pawned for about thirty or forty yuan, but the interest is as high as three jiao per yuan. If forty yuan is pawned, it will cost fifty-two yuan to redeem it. The term is one month, three weeks, or half a month. When pawning, the pawnshop issues a so-called "limited-price fixed-term consignment certificate," which states "Pawn ticket X, borrowed XX yuan from another place (i.e., the pawn amount), now borrowing XX yuan from this place (i.e., the pawn amount)." If forty yuan is pawned, the ticket will write fifty-two yuan, and fifty-two yuan must be paid to redeem the pawn ticket. The amount of interest is evident from this.

We deeply hope that the authorities in the southern city will make a great determination to fundamentally eliminate gambling dens and high-interest pawnshops, and absolutely prohibit the existence of gambling dens and small pawnshops and similar clothing storage facilities. The authorities have issued two orders to investigate and prohibit high-interest pawnshops, but the first order did not take effect. Those who were prohibited continued to be prohibited, and those who operated continued to operate. It is not known whether the second time will be effective. However, the main culprit is still the gambling dens. If all the gambling dens are closed, these high-interest pawnshops will disappear on their own. Otherwise, it is treating the symptoms but not the root cause. If the gambling dens are not eradicated, these pawnshops will be difficult to eliminate, or even more such things will be produced and intensified.

### Amidst the Call to Ban Gambling Dens, a Discussion on Jai Alai Stadiums and Dog Racing Tracks by Gan Zhong'an

I remember two years ago, gambling dens in western Shanghai were everywhere, with hundreds of millions of yuan changing hands every day. The extent of the harm was truly indescribable. Fortunately, they were soon banned, and the people were still celebrating when the southern city followed western Shanghai, and the establishment of gambling dens there was like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, openly welcomed by a group of degenerates. It was not until recently that various groups and public opinion circles began to notice the intensity of its harm. Therefore, they have successively petitioned the authorities to ban them as soon as possible. I think in the near future, the authorities will definitely take appropriate measures, which is unnecessary for me to worry about. However, what is strange is that the disguised gambling dens that are comparable to gambling dens, such as the most "famous" Jai Alai stadium and the dog racing track, have never been publicly proposed. Requesting the authorities to ban them.

Some people enter the field out of curiosity, with the attitude of visiting, but are attracted by the magic. One is the pampered playboys who take the ill-gotten wealth of their fathers and brothers and squander it at will. These two types of people are in their prime, and they should be accumulating energy and talent to prepare for the country's use, but they do not know this and are willing to degenerate themselves, which is truly regrettable. From the above two points of view, we already feel that there is a need to ban them. Moreover, I am stupid and do not know if there are more serious harms that I have overlooked. Furthermore, at this time of national crisis, it is incompatible to have such strange phenomena on our country's territory.

Some say: The two fields are located in the French Concession, and other authorities cannot overstep their authority. This is true, but we can try our best to negotiate with the concession authorities.

The reason why the French Concession authorities allow the establishment of these two entertainment venues is nothing more than to increase the income of the concession. However, we believe that this is illegitimate income. Is it right to harm the public for the sake of the concession's income? Therefore, I hope that the French Concession authorities will quickly ban them for the sake of the people of Shanghai. As for the use of the two fields after the ban, it should naturally be based on the interests of the people. The dog racing track occupies a large area. In addition to continuing to be used for dog racing, a part of it should be used to plant flowers and plants for public officials and students to relax during their spare time. The Jai Alai stadium can be used as a venue for public gatherings or a public canteen, which can be modeled after the Youth Association Canteen on North Sichuan Road to benefit the people) are all suitable. In this way, the French Concession's economic income will naturally decrease; but it can gain the praise of the people of Shanghai, and this kind of spiritual gain is naturally better than monetary income. What do you think, French Concession authorities? (In response to the Huabei disaster relief)

### The Eleventh Batch of Coal Distribution, Payment and Delivery to Begin Within Days, Coal Distribution Still Divided into Four Grades, 2,500 Tons Limited to Civilian Use

The eleventh batch of coal distribution will be distributed by the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association in the coming days. A total of 2,500 tons of coal will be distributed, including 960 tons of Liuquan lumps, 1,389 tons of Jiaozuo lumps, and 151 tons of Jiaozuo powder. The association will soon send letters to its members, setting a deadline for payment and delivery of goods.

Four Grades of Distribution for Members

This distribution of coal is still divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Grade A will receive 3 tons of Liuquan lumps, 4.25 tons of Jiaozuo lumps, and 0.5 tons of Jiaozuo powder. Grade B will receive 2.375 tons of Liuquan lumps, 3.375 tons of Jiaozuo lumps, and 0.375 tons of Jiaozuo powder. Grade C will receive 1.75 tons of Liuquan lumps, 2.625 tons of Jiaozuo lumps, and 0.25 tons of Jiaozuo powder. Grade D will receive 1.25 tons of Liuquan lumps, 1.75 tons of Jiaozuo lumps, and 0.2 tons of Jiaozuo powder.

Designated Collection Agencies

The Coal Retailers Association has designated more than twenty coal companies, such as Yitaixing, Huazhong, and Yuantai, to collect payments in order to centralize the collection of coal payments. All members of the association, regardless of their grade, must pay the payment to the designated collection agency upon receiving the association's notice and bring their receipt to collect goods. Failure to do so will result in suspension of distribution and cancellation of membership.

Limited to Civilian Use

This coal is limited to civilian use, such as boiled water shops, restaurants, bathhouses, and apartments. It must not be sold to factories for fuel, as the factories' monthly fuel needs are already fully allocated by the authorities, and there is no shortage. If any member is found to have sold it to factories or raised prices in an attempt to resell it for profit, or refused to sell it to civilian users, they will be dealt with according to the regulations upon discovery.

### Poet and Beggar

‚Äî Shi Jieyuan

The poet, Lin Yi, was preparing to create his masterpiece! He pondered, pacing back and forth in the room, and then said to his younger brother sitting at the table, "Move the side dish bowl away! Leave this spot for me." Following this, he placed paper and pen down, as it was time for inspiration to descend.

Sitting nearby were four or five relatives, waiting for his father for something; they were chattering away, talking boisterously. In this environment, it was not suitable for creation. Helplessly, there was only one room in the house, and only this one table in the room.

"Writing poetry? Or a novel!" The poet, head in hand, was still considering this question; according to his habit‚Äîif one were to use a technical term, one should say his creative attitude‚Äîhe always felt the need to write something before starting to think about the subject matter and deciding on the form of creation. The so-called need here included manuscript fees and fame. Lin Yi was a poet, and logically, creating beautiful poems was beyond doubt. However, today he was perplexed by this question: "Should I try writing a novel? Poems can't be long, and the manuscript fees are too meager!" For the sake of manuscript fees, he made up his mind. "However, novelists are not as respected as poets; the term 'novelist' is not as elegant as 'poet.' I've only published two poems..." When another kind of desire surged, he fell into a contradictory state of mind. A few days ago, he had published two short stories in a newspaper supplement, and his classmates had started calling him a poet, which he himself felt quite proud of. Now, having only published two poems, to switch to writing novels would inevitably be inconsistent with the elegant title of poet. Moreover, he was planning to publish a collection of poems, so it seemed he had to create a few more.

He pondered this question deeply for three-quarters of an hour, constantly circling in the quagmire of hesitation, unable to pull his feet out of the mud. Anxiously scratching his scalp, he felt a burst of heat all over his body as if pricked by many needles, and beads of yellow sweat seeped out of his forehead, his eyes still staring blankly at the white paper.

The womenfolk nearby were in high spirits, arguing and debating, their loud voices piercing the ears, as if deliberately trying to make trouble for our poet:

"I say it's not worth it no matter what!"

"It's naturally not worth it to spend money to buy bran, but this year is different from previous years. The bran grains picked out from the rationed rice are enough to feed two chickens."

"Making use of waste, without spending a single penny!"

"Second Sister-in-law is right. The next time Shun Chang goes, I have to ask him to bring back two chickens, one pound each. The money..."

"Money! Little Aunt, take your time to calculate it! The chickens there are indeed very cheap. Bringing chickens on the road, Ah Yi's father said, is also convenient, as the inspection is not strict!"

"That's good too. Anyway, we'll have to settle the accounts next time. The money that was short last time when we went 'naked' hasn't been settled with me yet!"

The poet's thoughts were like a tangled ball of thread, impossible to find the beginning; the guests were also lacking in manners, unafraid of disturbing him, turning his thoughts into a chaotic mess, seizing his mind.

"Stop talking! Stop talking!" Suddenly clutching his head, as if to grasp that lightning-like thought, he abruptly shouted out, impatiently turning his body.

"What's wrong? Feeling unwell?" His mother put down the two rice bowls she was washing and asked.

"It is indeed particularly stuffy and hot today, a bit like the plum rain season," Little Aunt touched her temple, "Look, his head is covered in sweat."

"Headache!" Mother pressed his neck, "Ah Yi, go to sleep for a while!"

"It's not a headache, no need to sleep!" The poet looked at them awkwardly, unable to explain. He tapped his fingers and shook his head.

"Not a headache, then why are you holding your head?"

"I'm thinking..."

"Stop working so hard," Mother forced him to go to sleep, "Reading more books doesn't make a difference. Making money and getting rich has nothing to do with reading!"

He stared blankly at Mother, being forcibly pulled onto the bed. "I'm really not sick! I'm thinking..."

"Still being stubborn!" Mother glared at him and went back to washing the dishes. "Don't cry when a small hole becomes a big one and you can't fix it; if you get sick, you won't be able to afford medicine!"

"Great! Like spitting out a mouthful of saliva, he started to devote himself to his thoughts, and now he has decided to write a novel. It is a tragic love story about a delicate tulip-like girl in love with a college student; "Change the names of the main characters, and revise the story a bit, and it will immediately be another novel. Good! Vow to finish it today!"

He excitedly stood up, sat down at the table, and requested his mother: "Mom, my head doesn't hurt anymore..."

"Whatever you want, what can I do if you don't listen?" Mother smiled and whispered with Little Aunt.

Holding the fountain pen that couldn't absorb ink, he wrote the beginning of the novel on the draft:

"The moon," was like a hole in the dark blue sky, leaking mysterious silver light. The wind, sighed like the sigh of the Holy Christ, whispering to itself the sorrows of a sorrowful person. The stars, flashing loving eyes, scattering down..."

Writing, writing...the fountain pen froze there; how should the light of the stars be described? Mysterious! Already used that word. Loving‚Äîthey are their eyes. Brilliant‚Äîtoo bland. Besides this, his brain was like a blank sheet of paper. There were no other words. So, he hesitated for a moment, picked up today's newspaper, and read the supplement, wanting to find a beautiful word there.

"We Need Popular Literature" This surprisingly alarming title appeared before his eyes. Need popular literature? Since it is needed, then sending such a work will surely be accepted. Thinking this, he concentrated on reading the essay. It generally discussed the bad trends in Shanghai's literary and art circles, which were entirely oriented towards superficial tastes; finally, it concluded with an impassioned concluding remark: "In this world where everyone is caught in the vortex of the times, and the new forces are breaking free from the shackles of the century, when light and darkness are pouring all their efforts into the struggle, do we still need sickly literature of wind, flowers, snow, and moon? Works that are alienated from the masses cannot be talked about in terms of combativeness and constructiveness. We need truly popular works that reflect the suffering and demands of the masses and overthrow the sickly literature of wind, flowers, snow, and moon."

"Yes!" The poet's emotions were stirred! "We need popular works!" Grasping the pen, he drew two large lines on the draft, indicating the overthrow of this sickly literature.

"However, what to write?" This time, he was perplexed again; without writing love novels about brothers and sisters, pastors, skilled stenographers, and artists, he couldn't imagine any other characters or stories. Where were the suffering and demands of the masses? He couldn't figure it out. "It seems I should go out into the streets, experience the suffering and demands of the masses, and then write!" He decided this: to experience the suffering and demands of the masses in half an hour, and with the materials, complete it in three hours.

"Ah Yi! Come back early! At six o'clock, you still have to go to Wharf No. 13 to get things for your father, which can save a few dollars in fare..." As he left, his mother wrote out a long list behind him, closed the door, and the sentences behind were vague.

The poet strolled on the road. At the cigarette shop across the street, people were scrambling to buy cigarettes, as it was the time for flat-price distribution.

"Two packs of Quanlu brand, hurry up!"

"One pack of Chicago, don't be so slow, people have been squeezing for a long time!"

"Five yuan and forty cents, three yuan and thirty-seven cents, no big bills!"

A woman with short hair held up two packs of Quanlu brand, squeezing outwards, a large hand tightly pressing her full chest.

"Damn you!" Laughing and scolding, swaying her duck-butt-like short hair flirtatiously.

"Hee...ha."

The poet craned his neck: "What are they doing buying cigarettes? Doing business themselves!"

"Tsk! Pig head!" The woman glared at him, contemptuously twisting her fat buttocks away, the poet stared in astonishment, following her back with his gaze.

"What good intentions are you thinking of? Idiot!" A worker-like man squeezed up. "If you're not buying cigarettes, please get out of the way!"

The poet staggered back two steps, colliding with the first person head-on.

"Sorry," he turned around, and it was a rice carrier selling rice. "Carrying this heavy rice, it must be very tiring?" He said with a smiling face, to experience the suffering.

"What kind of?" (Note: When buying and selling rice, the price is often quoted in the opposite way, for example, sixty-five yuan is quoted as five yuan.) "Five yuan, do you bring a scale?" That person looked at the person opposite, misunderstanding the words: a tall figure, a faded reddish-purple blue cloth jacket on his shoulders, a pile of messy hair on his head, a pair of old-fashioned glasses on his pale face, dim eyes staring at him from behind, thick lower lip. Hanging a humble smile‚Äî

"What is the market price in Caohejing today? How many yuan can you earn for each trip?" The poet planned to have a longer conversation with that person, leisurely putting his hands on his waist, asking with a very sympathetic tone, followed by a long sigh: "Hey! ...You guys work hard, carrying two dou of rice, running this long road, it is indeed a difficult thing. But, those big shots and gentlemen who are fed by the rice you carry? They don't sympathize with you at all! Humanity is a cruel and selfish animal! Hey! ..."

"Caohejing is three yuan today, carrying this long road, only earning two yuan per dou," with boundless resentment, half squeezed out by the shackles of life, half to prevent the other party from bargaining: "...You can take out your scale now! It doesn't matter if the police see it...Five yuan is the lowest price I can 'give'."

"Huh?..." The poet was stunned, being taken for a rice seller was a bit insulting to him, desecrating the poet's elegance; "Me? I'm not a rice seller! I'm a writer! Now I'm here specifically to experience your suffering! To reflect your demands!..."

"Damn it! If you're not buying rice, stop talking nonsense," that person was greatly disappointed and angry. Summoning his strength, he carried the rice bag and cursed viciously: "Making fun of people? Go away!"

The poet's courage was already half-hearted; he felt sour and uncomfortable in his heart! But for the sake of collecting materials, he strengthened his courage and continued his work of comforting and experiencing.

The masses didn't seem to feel the existence of such a poet; they didn't intend to get close to him, and they didn't need him to comfort their suffering or reflect their demands. Sometimes, they even had a strong aversion, almost suffering their bullying.

Once, turning into a quiet road, he saw two trishaw drivers struggling to drag heavy firewood, wanting to climb a gravel road in a garden.

"Go help them push it up!" Encouraging himself, he righteously pushed hard from behind. On the side, a trishaw driver, tightening his muscles and trying his best to support the heavy load, felt extremely tired, let go of his hands, and wiped his sweaty, tan face. Suddenly, he noticed someone humming heavily behind him.

"Stealing firewood, you bastard!" Scolding in a harsh Jiangbei accent, he rushed over.

Before he could explain, that person had already swung his thick hand to strike, and he could only flee like a homeless dog.

It seemed that there was an insurmountable wall standing between him and the masses, not knowing who had built it and when it had been built.

Wandering around the streets for a long time, still gaining nothing, he dejectedly returned home.

"Ungrateful, stupid people!" Thinking wildly, cursing the people, soon, home was in sight. A beggar, wrapped in rags, exposing a butt full of sores and scabies, with pus and blood blurred, stretched his head into the half-closed back door, muttering, begging.

"Get out of here! I won't give you a penny!" To vent his grievances, he sternly scolded. The beggar, caught off guard by someone driving him away, looked around in a panic for a while, wrinkled his face in a mournful expression, and dragged his tattered shoes away.

"Huh! ..." Staring fiercely at the back of that living ghost, something immediately reminded him, and he quickly changed his tone of voice, "Come! Come! Don't run away!"

The beggar turned his head in a daze, sizing up the other person's face, and stretched out his reed-like hand, "Sir, have pity, have pity on me!"

"Don't be so 'Sir! Have pity, have pity!' I'm asking you about very important, meaningful things!" He imitated the beggar's tone in a strange voice, and directly talked about the topic: "How did you fall into begging?"

"..." That person was stunned for a moment. "Sir! Have pity on our suffering. Since the war, there has been no business! I haven't had a bite of rice for two days. Sir, give me the money for a pancake!"

"Always wanting money!" The poet was not satisfied. Such plain material could not be written into a novel. "Say it in more detail, about the situation after losing your job, for example: where do you sleep at night..."

"Sir, what else do we beggars do if we don't ask for money?" The beggar's voice was even more miserable, "At night? Of course, on the street! Sir, give me five dimes!"

"Give you five dimes? Five dimes can't support you for a lifetime!" Patting his chest: "I'm not happy doing this kind of incomplete relief work. I want to do something more meaningful, to help you, to reflect your suffering with my vivid pen..."

"..." The reed-like hand slowly drooped down. ...

At this time, their conversation was interrupted; the back door opened:‚Äîit was the poet's mother.

"Looking for this, looking for that, not even a shadow! Where did you die?"

The poet raised his head high, silently, thinking it was not worth arguing, even if he did, he couldn't explain it clearly.

"Quickly pick up the cloth bag and go to Wharf No. 13!" Mother pulled him in, "It's already past five o'clock, wait a while, and your father will get angry again!"

"Bang!" The door was closed! The beggar's whole body trembled, fiercely glaring at the gray-black back door.

"The child doesn't learn well!" Mother was still nagging endlessly, her nagging was always flowing like a river, never ending: "Water flows downwards, people look upwards; you forget about doing proper things, and you even chat with beggars!"

The poet ignored her, alone thinking: "The novel can't be written! I should still write poetry!" In his mind, he first decided on the title: "Midnight Sigh‚ÄîThe Beggar's Song." So he chanted: (Inwardly boasting: "In a few days, after this poem is published in the √ó√ó supplement, I will become a 'Popular Poet'")

"Sleeping on the cold cement floor, in the dark black curtain of the night,..."

This was a week after the poet completed the poem, according to his expectation, it should be the third day after his masterpiece was published.

His father had already returned from Pinghu for the second time. The day before yesterday, when he went to the wharf to pick up his father, his father stood there blankly, with only a stack of five pounds of New Year cakes beside him. When he saw his son coming, tears fell silently, and they looked at each other in silence, losing their souls, not knowing what to do. Finally, he still weakly picked up the New Year cakes and went home dejectedly.

"Another 'naked shoulder'!" The things that relatives entrusted him to bring were all confiscated. Losing more than five hundred yuan, he said some sharp words and left. He said it was for the sake of relatives, and he would postpone the repayment for now; however, he couldn't add more, and he wouldn't entrust him to bring things again from now on. His father relied on the money from these entrusted goods to buy some goods such as cigarettes and soap in Shanghai and sell them there. Then he would buy some New Year cakes, rice, meat, etc., to bring back to Shanghai. This time, he didn't have the capital and couldn't go anymore. He slept at home for a day, just sighing and groaning! After a series of sighs, he took his mother as a punching bag.

This morning, he went early in the morning, and only came back listlessly at half past two in the afternoon.

"Buy six steamed buns, hurry up!" Panting, he gave his son three yuan; then, he whispered to his mother.

Our poet was unpacking a letter, which was a manuscript that had just been returned. His heart was beating rapidly, and the hand holding the envelope was trembling slightly. At first, he didn't believe this was his own rejection letter, perhaps it was sent to the wrong person? He thought. However, that conjecture immediately vanished. On the green manuscript, it was clearly the poem he had written after racking his brains. So, he started to look: perhaps there was something like, "Your masterpiece has already been read, admired very much, but unfortunately the environment..." But there wasn't, and the effort of searching was in vain.

"The editor is messing with me, blind and not recognizing Mount Tai!"

When his father called him to buy steamed buns, he finally raised his head from his chaotic thoughts and hastily took the money.

After buying the steamed buns and returning, he happened to meet that beggar's dirty head looking around again.

"Come over..." The poet discovered a treasure and called the beggar over. But this time it wasn't to experience his suffering and demands, but to call him to listen to the poet's masterpiece and experience the emotions within: "Come listen to what makes me shed tears! This is the crystallization of my hard work, which is also the suffering, demands, grievances, and anger that you have in your hearts but cannot express. But, damn it! The editor..."

So, his left hand tightly pinched the paper containing the steamed buns, and his right hand took out his poem and recited it:‚Äîthat person looked at him strangely, not knowing what ghost he was stirring up? Then he fixed his eyes on the steamed buns in his hand with a craving look.

"Sleeping on the cold cement floor, in the dark black curtain of the night, is my wide and boundless embroidered quilt, the hard stone steps, barely serve as pillows..."

"What? I have an embroidered quilt?"

"Stop talking! The wonderful part is in the back." The poet waved his hand and continued: "The stars smile at me and scatter loving light..."

"I've never seen the stars smile, go away!" Suddenly, in a flash, the steamed buns in the poet's hand fell into the beggar's hands.

"Hey! ..." The poet shouted loudly: "Don't run, the wonderful part is coming!" But the beggar didn't have the leisure to listen to his recitation. He tore apart the paper that was stuck to the bottom of the steamed buns, stuffing three of them into his mouth in one day, and ran to the opposite side."

The poet stood there blankly for a while, hanging his head and returning home.

"Where are the steamed buns? It's been so long, haven't you bought them yet?" Father said angrily.

"They were snatched by a beggar!"

"What? Snatched by a beggar? Useless thing!" Father scolded him in a series, talking about his own hardships, being discriminated against and bullied, and now his eldest son was not aspiring, weak, and incompetent! ...Finally, he said: "It seems that the more deeply you study, the more useless you are. Tomorrow I will definitely call you to go to Pinghu with me to learn the ropes of doing business..."

"But, at school...there will be a monthly exam!... "

"Monthly exam? Don't read at all, you still have a year and a half until you graduate, I don't have that much money!"

The poet could not restrain himself and shed tears.

"What are you crying about?" Mother said: "Father has bad luck, going back and forth three times, and he has been 'naked' twice...If two people go, they can take things separately..."

The poet stood there silently, and thought about writing again: "What to write? Reflecting, no, it should be angrily shouting out, whose suffering and demands?"

### Aspirations

‚Äî Zi Wu

School was dismissed from the F Town Central Elementary School at four o'clock, and it was still drizzling. After several days of spring rain, the playground was muddy, and the old sky presented a lead-gray face, looking down at the earth. A large group of elementary school students, like small sparrows in the snow, clamored and returned home in a disorderly manner from the school. In an instant, the school returned to silence.

Teacher Liu dragged his tired steps, having finished the sixth class, and carried a large stack of "Composition" notebooks from the sixth-grade classroom to the office.

There was no one in the office. Books and notebooks were piled messily on each desk. Faint light filtered in through the glass window, and the air was so gloomy.

Teacher Liu sat down at his seat and listlessly pushed the notebooks onto the desk. He saw that his desk was already piled with many unnecessary notebooks. Driven by a sense of responsibility, he reluctantly picked up his pen.

"Now, logically, I should rest a little," he said to himself.

However, he did not rest. Indeed, he should rest. He had already taught five classes today. Most of the old-fashioned desks and chairs exhausted him like a patient.

"I don't know why I must be a teacher?" he doubted, looking at the notebooks. "For a living, it's pitiful to say, not even enough to feed myself. Yet, with such intense work, I can't do it well..."

He looked at the campus outside the window. Everything in the campus seemed as dim as his heart. So he picked up the composition notebooks to grade. The topic for this composition was My Aspirations.

In every notebook he read, many innocent and naive ambitions were revealed. The children narrated their aspirations like dreams. He couldn't help but feel a little excited and silently prayed, "Children, may you realize all of these in the world in the near future!"

Soon, he discovered a particularly outstanding piece. It read:

"My aspiration is to eliminate all the ugliness in the world, eliminate human suffering, and become a great savior. I want to open a school so that all poor older children can have books to read, and then open a large factory so that everyone has work to do. As for myself? I will be a shipowner! To live a great seafaring life!"

Besides admiring the student's rich imagination, he couldn't help but sigh with emotion. His heart felt a pang of melancholy. Twenty years ago, didn't he have such aspirations? During his student days, he might have had even greater ambitions. But after twenty years of grinding, now, even making a living is difficult. These ambitions had long disappeared, he didn't know when. Now, he was just groping in chalk dust all day long for the sake of survival. Now, his own destiny and surroundings seemed to be filled with chalk dust-like confusion.

Thinking of this, he stared blankly at the notebooks, seemingly feeling ashamed, uneasy, and remorseful...

"People should have aspirations!" he thought affirmatively. The cute, energetic little faces of that group of students floated into his mind from the notebooks. He seemed to gain courage again. "As long as one doesn't die, aspirations should not die out."

A trace of comforting smile appeared on his lifeless face. "Yes, although my life is so hard now, my work is great. Even if I never realize my own aspirations in my lifetime, realizing them indirectly through the children is equally valuable and worth celebrating."

So he continued to grade, correcting some awkward phrases. In the last one, it was written:

"My aspiration is to farm, and also help Mom wash clothes and cook... Because my family is very poor, my father died a long time ago, and Mom works very hard."

The short and sincere narration couldn't help but bring a rush of hot tears to his eyes. Infinite sympathy and pity welled up from the depths of his heart. He looked at the crooked name "Lu Jinsheng" on the opposite page, and he recalled that thin child in the classroom during the day, with a malnourished face, silent, and prone to crying...

"Environment, a terrible environment!" he sighed deeply. "That is a child who understands life, life has educated him. In the eyes of ordinary people, that seems to be an unpromising child. He doesn't want to be a hero or a great man. He permanently inherits his father's profession, using his hands to labor for a lifetime..."

He didn't know when it had started to rain harder. The outline of things in the room could not be seen clearly. Teacher Liu's hot tears had soaked through his clothes. When he finished grading the last notebook, his whole body was so weak that he could no longer support himself. The surroundings were as silent as a cemetery, with only occasional sobs.

He took a deep breath, laboriously moved his body from the stool, and walked into the dark bedroom. A gust of cold air hit him. He helplessly pulled the tattered quilt over himself, closed his eyes, and lay quietly on the bed, waiting for dawn.

Economic Circle„ÄÄShort Commentary

### Promoting the "Spirit of Mutual Help"

The preciousness of human life lies in "mutual help." The heavens have unpredictable winds and clouds, and people have misfortunes that may occur at any time. Those who can help others will always be helped by others.

Helping others today is the foundation for others to help us in the future. The glorious and splendid history of humankind is entirely unfolded through struggle and mutual help.

Under the condition of "mutual help," there is also the meaning of "mutual benefit." We should maintain and promote this good nature of humanity. Economics is most closely related to human life, so economic assistance is also more urgently needed than any other assistance because it can dominate everything and benefit people's livelihood.

Based on this point of view, we feel that there are several things in the current economic sphere that are worth reflecting on and implementing:

(1) The North China disaster relief issue is truly extremely serious. Although various parties have promoted it, and considerable results have been achieved, it is still necessary to continue to work hard. The economic sector is in a better position and it is easier to raise funds. Is it possible that they have not fulfilled their greatest responsibility? This is worth reflecting on. We have repeatedly appealed for this, hoping to actively advocate and implement it as soon as possible.

(2) Thoroughly investigate hoarding. The government has taken vigorous action, and its purpose is nothing more than to seek stability in people's livelihood. Now that the deadline for releasing hoarded goods has passed, a comprehensive survey of materials will be conducted. For the sake of their own interests, our people should urgently assist, voluntarily report, so that prices tend to be normal and stable.

(3) The livelihood of employees should be improved as much as possible. Recently, among the many articles we have received about public life, most express dissatisfaction with current treatment and issue indignant calls. In this time of war, it is indeed true that it is not easy to develop business, but we always hope that employers will increase salaries as much as possible within the scope possible, so as to maintain a minimum standard of living. At the same time, employees should also understand the difficulties of employers and work together diligently. This is the fortune of both labor and capital.

The above three matters are just some examples based on recent observations. We deeply feel the preciousness of the "spirit of mutual help." How to promote and magnify it is the responsibility of every citizen, and it can also be said to be the responsibility of all humankind.

### Recommendation to Establish a Strong Economic Research Institute

‚Äî Xu E

To solve and improve the entire national economic life, we must actively engage in economic construction. Since the National Government's participation in the war, the entire national economy of China. In politics, it is a period of cooperation in the Greater East Asia War; in economics, it is a period of actively reviving the economy from the destruction of war. In order to practice this arduous work, the Supreme National Defense Temporary Council has passed the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy for reference and implementation; but in order to seek effective implementation, there must be a complete plan, which depends on organized economic research work.

Economic research is very developed in the East Asian countries, but it only has more than 20 years of history in China. In this short history, in addition to the countless contributions of many economists' personal research, there are also several economic research institutions that have worked tirelessly and made valuable contributions. We further make ordinary observations, and feel that the economic research work has a trend of rapid development on the surface. All important public and private institutions attach importance to economic research, such as the various ministries and their affiliated institutions related to economic facilities, and even the provincial governments and their affiliated institutions, almost all have attached organizations such as various survey offices and statistics offices; and they are constantly being added. If only the unit is counted, the number of economic research institutions in China is probably more than that of the advanced countries. So it can be said that China's economic research institutions have developed in form; as for the actual contributions, they are far from the ideal state, but we cannot deny some valuable contributions; but this seems to be an exception. Generally speaking, the results of the work of many economic research institutions, which have indeed obtained valuable contributions, cannot be compared with the development in form.

After the Incident, many of these economic research institutions were shut down, and some were dispersed. The entire economic research work can be said to have fallen into a standstill. Since the National Government returned to the capital, industry and commerce have returned to normal, and some economic research institutions have recovered, and some have been newly established, and there is a vibrant atmosphere; but in terms of quantity, it is far less than before, we do not hope to be the same as before, treating economic research institutions as the facade of institutions and groups, what we need is quality and simplified economic research institutions. Now the government has the establishment of the National Economic Commission. According to its organizational regulations, it is set up to review economic policies and regulate economic administration. At present, the total war participation is in the stage of practice, and the economy is the driving force of the total war participation. During this period of war participation, on the one hand, we must ensure military needs, and on the other hand, we must stabilize people's livelihood. A strict economic plan is essential. Therefore, within the National Government Economic Commission, it is necessary to establish a strong economic research institution. In the private sector, although there are one or two economic research institutions with a rough scale, they cannot reach the ideal state due to various reasons; and they cannot undertake such arduous work, so we hope that this new economic research institution will be realized as soon as possible. It must be stated here that in order to save public funds, the scope of the administrative part of the original institution should be reduced as much as possible. At the same time, the principle of talent should be implemented, and real talents should be absorbed, and no one should be sent casually to fill the numbers. Such an economic research institution, I believe that the advanced economic research institutions of friendly countries will be able to sympathize and cooperate with it.

Finally, organized economic research work is really not an easy task, because research requires investigation, and there is a lack of investigative talents at the moment, so we have to rely on the collective efforts of most experts and scholars. However, the National Economic Commission must formulate a complete economic research plan, and if necessary, provide them with reference materials so that they can get the correct research direction, so that their research results can be contributed to the National Government for review and adoption. Starting from this complete and comprehensive economic plan, there will be no waste of resources, labor, and time.
