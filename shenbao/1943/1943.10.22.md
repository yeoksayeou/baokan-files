### Contributions to the Rice Control Committee Authorities

The Rice Control Committee has recently been actively advancing its work. On the 19th, it convened a preparatory meeting in Shanghai for trade associations involved in rice procurement from various regions. This was followed by a consultative meeting to exchange procurement ideas. On the 21st, a joint meeting of directors and deputy directors from various regions was also held.

We have always felt that managing grain administration requires not only keenness and meticulousness, but also agility and clarity. Confusion, negligence, slowness, and entanglement are all unacceptable. The Rice Control Committee has been in preparation for over a month, but actual work remains to be launched. Regarding agility in time, we hope that the committee authorities and representatives from various regions will strive to achieve this. Especially after these several meetings, entering the practical work stage is critical.

The work of the Rice Control Committee can be roughly divided into three sections: procurement, transportation, and distribution. Of course, all three are extremely important and cannot be neglected. However, transportation and distribution are in a subordinate position because transportation and distribution can only happen after procurement. Even if the capabilities and methods of transportation and distribution are superb, they still depend on successful procurement to be effective. Therefore, the procurement work can be said to be in a major position. The representatives of the trade associations involved in rice procurement from various regions all bear the important mission of procurement. Being able to gather together in advance to exchange ideas and experiences should lead to ideal progress in the technology and methods of rice procurement work in the future. Therefore, we have particularly high expectations for the joint meeting of directors and deputy directors from various regions, hoping that everyone will earnestly abide by the agreed methods and work hard for procurement. Originally, meetings in officialdom often involve superficiality, leading to ridicule such as "meeting without discussion, discussing without deciding, deciding without acting, and acting without effort." Now, the Rice Control Committee is a commercial autonomous organization, and the representatives of the trade associations involved in procurement from various regions are also giants in the business world. We hope to correct the accumulated bad habits of officialdom meetings and promote the spirit of business autonomy, paying special attention to "deciding and acting, and acting with effort." Rice procurement work may have its own special circumstances in each location. Whether it is the regulation of commodity prices, the distinction of grain quality, or the proper storage, local merchants can handle these reasonably and appropriately based on their experience. Here, we contribute our humble opinions on principles, hoping that representatives from various regions will fully understand the importance of people's food, the purpose of the government's organization of the Rice Control Committee, and the difficulty of their own responsibilities, and handle everything with precision and agility, helping the Rice Control Committee succeed, which is helping the country's grain administration succeed.

In addition, the Rice Procurement and Sales Administration of the Ministry of Food has now been abolished. We still have two points of opinion to offer to the Rice Control Committee authorities for attention:

First, the grain storage warehouses built by the Ministry of Food in the past are now the storage places for the Rice Control Committee to procure rice in various regions. Utilize them as much as possible. The original rice in the warehouses should be transferred together and preserved as a whole. In principle, storage methods must prevent mildew and maintain good quality.

Second, among the employees of the Rice Procurement and Sales Administration of the Ministry of Food in the past, there were many technical experts. The Rice Control Committee should select and employ them so that no talent is wasted.

The Ministry of Food was originally a government agency specializing in grain administration. The Rice Control Committee is a commercial autonomous organization designated by the government, a semi-official, government-supervised, merchant-operated institution. Although there are shifts in work between them, the common goal is still to regulate people's food. From the perspective of the Ministry of Food and the Rice Control Committee, they may each have their own responsibilities, but in our view, it is the same step. We read in the newspaper on the 20th that the Rice Procurement and Sales Administration was ending its business. The person in charge of the Ministry of Food made a statement, "In order to take the overall situation into account, the Ministry of Food should have been responsible for distribution by the Rice Control Committee since October. However, because the committee repeatedly requested to continue to maintain the status quo, and with the concern of all parties, we temporarily maintained the status quo. However, we hope that the Rice Control Committee will start purchasing as soon as possible and continue to handle distribution matters, so that people's food and military rations will not be interrupted." The Ministry of Food still has such expectations for the Rice Control Committee. Therefore, we are even more eagerly hoping that the Rice Control Committee will quickly assume its mission. Taking advantage of this time when representatives from various regions are gathered in Shanghai, we dare to offer this to you all, and strive to complete the important task of regulating people's food!

### Reorganizing the Central China Railway Transportation

Today's newspaper reported that the Central China Railway authorities are actively reorganizing railway administration. They are establishing railway colleges to train employees. They are sending personnel to North China, Manchuria, and other places to investigate the status of railway education and administration for reference. We express our admiration for the Central China Railway authorities' emphasis on transportation and reorganization of railway administration. However, establishing colleges and training employees is only one aspect of reorganizing railway administration, and it is slow in terms of time. It fails to immediately correct the shortcomings of current railway transportation because training employees requires a considerable amount of time, and it is impossible for everyone to receive training. We are not saying that training employees is not necessary at present, but that the current reorganization of railway administration, which requires satisfactory results, should be thoroughly adjusted from many aspects. Consider the urgency and determine the priorities, establish a plan, and strictly implement it. Only then can the effect of reorganization be spoken of.

Before the 26th year, the passenger traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways was the highest among all railways in the country. The number of employees and the proportion of route length were also the highest among all railways in the country. The two railways had more than 10,000 employees in total. Of course, it was inevitable that there were both good and bad employees. However, because the authorities strictly stipulated personnel systems, personnel regulations, rewards and punishments, all were based on laws and regulations, without favoritism, and strictly enforced. This created a good environment of law and discipline. Even if there were bad elements, they had no way to use their tricks. In addition, continuous spiritual training gradually transformed the lazy into good, achieving the effect of changing customs. At that time, the transportation on the two railways was orderly and convenient for travelers. The credit was of course due to the efforts and service of all employees, but the leadership of the authorities above and the spirit of actively seeking reorganization were particularly commendable.

Today's Central China Railway Company manages routes that are more than just the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways. The number of employees, just Chinese, has reached 30,000, accounting for three-fifths of the total. Indeed, due to excessive employment and complex elements, management is quite difficult. However, we believe that the focus of reorganization is not on the objective difficulty of starting and achieving results due to the large number of people and the complexity of elements. It lies in whether the authorities have the determination, sincerity, and perseverance. If there is determination, sincerity, and perseverance, then starting with a strict personnel system, stipulating reward and punishment regulations, and strictly enforcing them, especially for middle and senior-level cadres and employees, preventing bad elements from hiding, leading by example, and acting decisively, we believe that it will not be difficult to eliminate corruption and create a clean atmosphere and provide convenience for passengers in a short period of time. The current selection of employees for lectures and training is only one aspect of the personnel system. If a comprehensive reorganization is not planned, it will not be easy to see the overall effect. To first have the mentality of seeking understanding for one's own responsibilities, attributing the poor conditions of railway administration to reasons such as excessive employment of Chinese employees and complex elements, we believe is unnecessary in the path of reorganizing railway administration.

Friendly country Japan has always been known for good order in traffic management. In the past, the two railways were also known for good order. Therefore, the current chaos and commotion when getting on and off the trains, and the suffering of passengers, this alone, whose responsibility is it? We hope that the Central China Railway authorities and the employees involved will jointly reflect on this and quickly seek reorganization!

### Indian Representatives Gather in Syonan, Provisional Government Established Yesterday, Ministers Take Office on the Same Day

Syonan, 21st (Central News Agency) The All-East Asia Representatives Conference of the Indian Independence League was held at the Cathay Theatre in Syonan on the 21st at 10:30 AM. Representatives of Indians from various parts of East Asia, as well as cadres of the Women's Unit of the Indian National Army, and many others attended. After the meeting began, President Chandra Bose took the stage and spoke about the great significance of establishing a provisional government, and the meeting recessed at 13:00. At 16:00, the meeting resumed, and the attendees decided to send congratulatory telegrams to Burma and the Philippines, which had broken away from the control of the United States and Britain and gained independence, and expressed gratitude to Japan and other friendly nations in East Asia that supported the independence movement. At the same time, Chandra Bose proclaimed the implementation plan for India's independence: the people of India must establish a provisional government for themselves at this time when their homeland is about to be liberated, and with the assistance of the National Army under the guidance of the government, begin the final struggle against Britain. Representatives from various regions expressed extreme excitement about the people of India establishing a provisional government for themselves, and shouted "Long live!" He nominated Chandra Bose as the chairman of the provisional government. After Chairman Bose took the stage amidst thunderous applause and described his statement of taking office, he then appointed ministers of military affairs, foreign affairs, finance, propaganda, and women, and Chairman Bose read a declaration. The Provisional Government of Free India, based on the general will of 2 million Indians in East Asia, was born, and has completed the preliminary system to liberate 380 million Indian people. The conference closed in the evening. That night, Chairman Bose gave a speech to his homeland India and the world, strongly advocating the significance of establishing the Provisional Government of Free India, and stating his determination to fight until the British forces are driven out of India.

Syonan, 21st (Central News Agency) After Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Indian Provisional Government, appointed the ministers of the provisional government that day, the ministers held a swearing-in ceremony, and the provisional government was established at this point. The list of the provisional government is as follows: Chairman Chandra Bose concurrently serves as Minister of Military Affairs and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Finance Minister Kataki, Propaganda Minister Aiyah, and Women's Minister Mrs. Lakshmi.

Syonan, 21st (Central News Agency) After the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, the Independence League will not be dissolved because of this. It is decided that Bose will serve as the chairman of the Provisional Government and the president of the League. The Indian National Army previously belonged to the Indian Independence League, and is now subordinate to the League government, and Bose also serves as the supreme commander.

Declaration of the Indian Provisional Government

Syonan, 21st (Central News Agency) The declaration of the Indian Provisional Government is as follows: Since the Indian people were defeated by the British army in Bengal in 1757, the struggle for independence has continued for a hundred years, and its history has been created by countless sacrifices. However, our ancestors, due to a lack of organization at that time, failed to form a common national front to resist the enemy, which is a matter of regret. From 1885 to the end of the First World War, the Indian people used all means to restore their lost freedom, such as expanding propaganda, boycotting British goods, riots, strikes, and even armed revolution, but they have not succeeded. Until 1920, Gandhi promoted the non-cooperation movement. For 20 years, the Indian people have devoted themselves to patriotic activities. The Indian people have not only restored their political consciousness, but will also once again form a unified political system. The achievements of the National Congress Cabinet in the provinces inhabited by the Indian people between 1937 and 1939 have fully proved that the Indian people have the preparations and capabilities for self-government. The struggle for the liberation of India is now ready. Japan and its allies have defeated the long-time enemy of the British people in East Asia. This is the only good opportunity for the Indian people to realize the liberation of their country. Today, overseas Indians have risen up and united, which is a rare event in modern history. Especially the more than 2 million Indians in East Asia are fighting bravely under the banner of a total uprising. The hypocrisy of the British people has made the Indian people groan in the abyss of despair, and their unbridled plundering has made the Indian people wander on the line of starvation. The British rule in India has long lost the foundation of people's trust and is on the verge of collapse. The current situation is to overthrow British tyranny, which is the duty of the Indian people. The Indian National Army is extremely powerful and has the assistance of allies, so it is believed that it will be able to complete this duty. The Indian people are establishing a provisional government on the eve of the liberation of their motherland and starting the final struggle under the guidance of the provisional government. However, those with strong leadership are all in prison, and the armed forces of the compatriots in the country have all been deprived, so it is difficult to establish a provisional government in India to guide the struggle. Therefore, this task is placed on the shoulders of the Indian Independence League in East Asia. Therefore, people are determined to obey the orders of the East Asia Indian League and set up the Indian Provisional Government of Independence, and with the greatest responsibility, completely expel the forces of the enemy country from India, and then establish a permanent national government based on the will of the people. Therefore, all Indian people should be completely loyal to the provisional government. The government is determined to guarantee the freedom of religion, equality, and equal opportunities for all people. The government is also determined to equally train the people to overcome all obstacles to internal opposition in the past and to seek the well-being and prosperity of the people of the country. This declaration is hereby made.

The General Strength of Building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is Becoming Stronger

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) The Provisional Government of India has been announced and established in Burma. The general strength of the East Asian nations to defeat the United States and Britain and build East Asia will inevitably be further enhanced. Especially when the Japanese army preemptively launched an offensive in Burma to crush the enemy's attempt to counterattack East Asia, the establishment of the Provisional Government of India is of particularly great significance in the active political offensive. The Indian independence movement will have great progress at this time, which is inevitable. Moreover, the completion of India's independence has increased infinite hope for this. Furthermore, the Japanese army's offensive in Burma is not only to firmly crush the enemy's attempt to seize Burma, but also to advance into India, because the enemy is now using India in an attempt to counterattack Burma and attack East Asia. Therefore, the active military actions of the Japanese army in Burma and the political actions of the establishment of the Provisional Government of India can be regarded as having the meaning of mutual cooperation. In terms of the construction of the entire Greater East Asia, it is also sufficient to show the unity of strategic politics. As far as India is concerned, the tyranny of the British and American troops has caused the lives of the Indian people to fall into a desperate state, and has intensified the Indian people's will to resist the United States and Britain. The establishment of the Provisional Government of India will further promote the anti-British and anti-American movement in India. On the day when the Indian independence movement is fiercely fought both inside and outside India, it will not only cause the enemy to be distressed and unable to do anything. Looking at the internal struggles between Britain and the United States to compete for power in India, the open strife and secret struggle are extremely fierce, and the depth of their contradictions shows that Britain is no longer able to control India. The collapse of the British Empire has been deepened by the struggle between Britain and the United States for India, and today's vigorous independence movement inside and outside India is a prelude to the collapse of the British Empire. The establishment of the Provisional Government of India can be said to be timely. Previously, Burma and the islands had completed their autonomy and independence under the assistance of Japan. Now, the Indian independence movement has established a provisional government as the cornerstone for completing independence at the time when the Japanese army launched an offensive in Burma. It is indeed doubly crushing the enemy's attempt to counterattack East Asia, which will be completely crushed by the offensive launched by the Japanese army and the establishment of the Provisional Government of India. After China has gained autonomy and independence, it not only deeply agrees with the struggle for independence and freedom of the ethnic groups in West Asia and other countries, but will also advance and cooperate with its completion. Only when the people of Asia and other ethnic groups work together to defeat the United States and Britain and win the victory in the Greater East Asia War can we lay a solid foundation for the liberation of East Asia and begin the great road to the revival of China.

Strive for National Independence, Political and Military Advancement Simultaneously

Syonan, 21st (Central News Agency) Chandra Bose, President of the Indian Independence League, delivered a speech at the All-Asia Representatives Conference of the Indian Independence League, the main points of which are as follows: The purpose of this conference is to review the activities and progress of the independence movement since July of this year, and to seek ways to achieve the goal of independence as soon as possible. After I took office as president, based on the plan of total mobilization of Indians in East Asia, I first reorganized the League headquarters, and then changed the composition and strengthened the Indian National Army, resulting in the Indian National Army being placed under my command. Its appearance has been renewed, and it will continue to be changed and strengthened in the future. Combat technology and spiritual training are now being carried out at the same time, and the recruitment is also actively proceeding. The number of volunteers has been increasing day by day. It is expected that training camps will be set up in Burma and Thailand in the future. Based on the total mobilization plan, various places are implementing the collection of funds for the liberation movement and the purchase of military supplies for the National Army, and practical results have been achieved. In recent months, the situation in India has become increasingly tense, and the suffering of the people has increased. Therefore, our movement has also been intensified and expanded. Although some compromises have been obtained in political measures, its repressive policy has not changed in the future. The famine in Bengal and the political unrest in India have become more and more intense. The cause of this famine is the squeeze of food and materials by Britain for the past four years to maintain the war. The independence of Burma in August and the independence of the Philippines in October can all be good evidence and encouragement for the Indian people to strive for freedom and achieve their goals. The Indians in East Asia now deeply feel that they must drive the British and their allies out of India and increase the responsibility for the liberation of Asia. When I visited Thailand and Burma, I obtained the promise of full assistance from the governments of the two countries. I would like to tell you that I have made preparations for future struggles and post-war construction plans. We can already imagine the situation after driving the British and their allies out of India. Therefore, you have set up a "Reconstruction Department" in the Indian Independence League headquarters to study the problems of post-war reconstruction. Therefore, whether it is the current war of independence or the national policies adopted after the war, we are now fully prepared. Now we must advance military and political affairs at the same time. We Indians in East Asia, especially the soldiers of the Indian National Army, are all eager to step into the territory of our motherland and start the war of independence as soon as possible. However, before that, there are still some political tasks that must be completed by the Taiwanese people. For example, we must organize an Indian Provisional Government of Independence to begin the struggle under it. In fact, the friends in East Asia are also eager for the birth of the Indian Provisional Government of Independence. The Indian Independence League is the only representative organization of Indians in East Asia, and the Provisional Government is also the most appropriate organization. However, because most of the leaders of the Indian government are detained in prisons, the government cannot do anything in the country. Therefore, the people who actually bear the heavy responsibility of this great cause are the Indians in East Asia outside our homeland. Moreover, the struggle outside India and the struggle inside India have a close relationship, which is a self-evident fact. Our struggle outside India is fully supported not only by the Indian people in the country, but also by most of the British Indian troops. Therefore, once our National Army crosses the Indian border and raises the Indian flag of freedom in Indian territory, a major revolution will immediately break out in India, and this revolution will certainly put the British control to death. What we have decided here is to prepare for the final struggle. Our military struggle will eventually cross the Indian border and advance towards Delhi. This advance will not stop until the last Briton entrenched in India is driven out of India or thrown into prison. This advance will not end until the Indian flag is flown over the roof of the Governor's Palace and the victorious Indian National Army is reviewed in the capital of India. Finally, I would like to tell you that I will announce the organization of the Indian Provisional Government at the conference this afternoon.

### Transfer of Ownerless Chinese Houses Between Han and Japanese Sides

Hankou, 21st (Central News Agency) The friendly country Japan, in order to respect our country's sovereignty, had first returned the properties owned by our people and transferred the management of the enemy properties of the United States and Britain to our country. On the 19th, a resident of the friendly country transferred the ownerless Chinese horses and other items managed by the Naval Attache's Office in the former Japanese Concession to the municipal government for management. The transfer ceremony was held at the Resident Group at 10:00 AM. Those present were Masuda, captain of the resident police chief of the friendly country's Naval Attache's Office. Yao, the secretary-general, represented the mayor of the city government in receiving the property. It is reported that after the municipal government receives the houses, the Real Estate Committee will manage them.

### Japanese Troops Attacking Yunnan Advance in Two Routes, Northern Route Has Reached South of Lushui

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) According to reports, after the Japanese troops advanced to the Nujiang River in western Yunnan Province, they divided their troops into two routes on the opposite bank of the river to attack the north and south sides. The northern route launched a large-scale encirclement operation against the Yu army in the Gaoligong Mountains. The southern route is still continuing to shell the Yu army on the east bank from the west bank of the Nujiang River.

Guangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency) According to the announcement of the Yu Military Commission in Chongqing on the 20th, the battle situation in Yunnan is as follows: The border war in Yunnan is still extremely fierce. The Japanese troops who advanced to the vicinity of the opposite bank of Liuku have received new reinforcements and advanced in two routes on the 16th. The northern route has reached the south of Lushui and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. The southern route advanced to the opposite bank of Lichai Dam at noon on the 18th and shelled the Yu army's positions on the east bank. Fierce fighting is also taking place in Qigongfang, north of Jietou, and near Yingpan Street, northeast of Yingpan Street.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) Yunnan Japanese Army Qian Qian 21st telegram. After the large-scale encirclement and annihilation battle launched by the Japanese army in the Longchuanhe Valley on the west bank of the Nujiang River, it has begun to annihilate the Yu army. The results of the battle before the encirclement formed on the evening of the 16th have been clarified as follows: Yu army corpses 600, prisoners 30. Confiscated artillery 3, heavy mortars 1, heavy machine guns 1, light machine guns 5, rifles 49, and a lot of other ammunition, fodder, and clothing. According to the prisoners, the commander of the 36th Division of the wounded Yu army had fled to the west bank of the Nujiang River on the 15th. The army suffered heavy losses due to the fierce attack of the Japanese army. A part of the Yu army suffered more than 300 casualties near Lunma (60 kilometers northwest of Tengyue), and then became fragmented. The Yu army in that area seems to have completely fallen into chaos due to the fierce attack of the Japanese army, and its losses will be far greater than what the Japanese side has clarified.

Japanese Troops on the Yunnan Border Cross the Nujiang River

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) The new operation launched by the Japanese army in the Gaoligong Mountains seems to have given the Yu regime a great shock. According to the telegram, the Kunming American 14th Air Force Command announced on the 19th that the American Air Force would cover the operations of the Yu army's land forces and send bombs to the Japanese army's ammunition depot in Liuku, east of the Nujiang River. Therefore, foreign correspondents in Chongqing believe that the Japanese army has actually crossed the Nujiang River. Correspondents from the Associated Press and other reports stated that the anti-Axis army wanted to launch an operation to recapture Burma, but the Japanese army seized the initiative and had begun a new operation on the Yunnan-Burma border. The most recent action seems to have crossed the Nujiang River and secured the bridgehead. Liang Hanshen, the propaganda minister of the Yu side, talked about the announcement of the US military command at a meeting with the press corps on the 20th. Foreign correspondents questioned whether the news was true. Liang replied that the Japanese troops in the four parts of Burma and Yunnan have recently shown signs of increasing in strength. It is currently unknown whether the Japanese army's operational intention is to attack Chongqing or to attack India. As for whether the Japanese army has crossed the Nujiang River, detailed information can be inquired from the Che Military Commission. However, the Yu Military Commission announced the battle situation, only stating that the Japanese army is still operating on the west bank of the Nujiang River, so it is still impossible to judge whether the announcement of the US military command is true and whether the US planes have bombed the Japanese army in Liuku. In short, the new operation of the Japanese army has plunged the Yu side and the US military stationed in Yu into chaos.

### Allied Reinforcements Aim for Concentrated Offensive, Landing in Rome Area Proves Difficult

Berlin, 21st – Central News Agency Dispatch: According to the Overseas Shipping News, the war situation on the eastern front in southern Italy is becoming increasingly fierce. Currently, only preliminary skirmishes are occurring, and the Allied forces do not have the initiative. After the German forces counterattacked on the 18th of this month and drove the British and Canadian forces out of a certain small town, they defeated a unit of American forces northeast of Capua the day before yesterday. The American forces withdrew from a certain area after fierce fighting and suffered heavy losses. The Allied attempt at a concentrated offensive has been hampered, and the destruction of transportation infrastructure and adverse weather conditions are also unfavorable to the Allied forces. However, the Allied waiting stage seems to be nearing its end. General Clark has concentrated most of the American Fifth Army on the north bank of the Volturno River and the Calore River. The main force of the British Eighth Army has also approached the front lines. General Montgomery's spearhead has clearly increased pressure west of the line from Venafro to Isernia and west of Biferno. It is said that the Allied forces have received considerable reinforcements by sea in recent days, including two divisions that were General Montgomery's main forces in the African and Sicilian campaigns. They suffered heavy losses in the Sicilian campaign but have been replenished and reorganized and are currently being transferred to Italy, indicating that the Allied forces will launch a concentrated offensive.

Berlin, 21st – Central News Agency Dispatch: According to German News Agency reports: Well-informed sources in Italy say that the Allied forces are preparing to launch a landing in the vicinity of Rome from the air and sea in the near future. A large number of troops transported by Anglo-American air power have already concentrated behind their lines, and the intense activity of the Anglo-American forces in the port of Naples also foreshadows major action to come. This speculation is also supported by the frequent movement of ships along the southwestern Italian coast by the Allied forces. Military circles in Berlin also confidently believe this news, because the source has contact with both Italian parties and is known for the accuracy of its information. Followers of Badoglio, who are dissatisfied with the Allied forces and wish to curry favor with the German side in order to establish themselves in the government of the Fascist Republic of Italy, are willing to provide important information as a means of advancement. In addition, the intensified air force activity of the Anglo-American forces on the main roads on both the eastern and western sides of Italy and their reorganization of troops on the front lines can also serve as further evidence of a large-scale Allied operation. This may be because General Eisenhower also knows that attacking the German mountain positions will result in heavy losses and may not succeed, so he will launch an offensive in a direction that deviates from our expectations to relieve the heavy pressure that the American Fifth Army is currently under from the British Eighth Army.

### Southeast of Krivoi Rog, Soviets Increase Pressure, German Reinforcements Steadily Counterattack

Berlin, 21st – Central News Agency Dispatch: According to the Overseas Shipping News, the focus of the Soviet offensive remains southeast of Krivoi Rog. The Soviet army is attempting to create a large gap for a weekend breakthrough there. The pressure from the wedge-shaped offensive from Krivoi Rog to Dnepropetrovsk has not lessened. Furthermore, the offensive is being intensified with the assistance of artillery and tanks. The German army is deploying reinforcements to the front lines, which is another reason why the Soviet army is boldly using its current superiority in manpower and material resources. The German army is steadily counterattacking, and the outcome is still difficult to predict. However, the outcome of this battle will affect the situation in the Dnieper River estuary and the fighting around Zaporozhye to the Sea of Azov. The German forces defending the gateway to the Nogai Steppe are also under intense attack. The fighting there is clearly related to the attempt to break through towards Krivoi Rog. The other battles are not as important as those in the southern sector, but Soviet attacks north of Crimea, northwest of Chernigov, near Gomel, and south of Nevel have all been repelled after fierce fighting. There is only local warfare between Gomel and Nevel in the central sector. The concentration of Soviet forces in the Leningrad region and south of Lake Ladoga indicates that the Soviet army may launch an offensive there.

The German Side Emphasizes This Battle

Berlin, 21st – Central News Agency Dispatch: The German News Agency reports: The Soviet army is making its greatest effort in the fighting in the southeastern Krivoi Rog region, but the breakthrough has not yet been expanded. The area where the Soviet army has penetrated deep into the German positions forms a triangle with Krivoi Rog and Dnepropetrovsk as the base and a point trending southwest. The Soviet army seems to be exerting its power from this vertex towards the south and north. The German command, recognizing the Soviet army's superiority in numbers, has deliberately withdrawn the first-line positions to the rear to gradually block the offensive of the main Soviet forces. According to news from the front lines, although the weather has been bad in recent days, fierce fighting continues. Both the German and Soviet armies are carrying out large-scale mobilization. In particular, the German air force is extremely active and has greatly reduced the effectiveness of the Soviet artillery positions. The outcome of the Battle of Krivoi Rog will have a major impact on all sides. Currently, the German command is adopting a strategy of retreating defensively combined with counterattacks, conserving its forces as much as possible in preparation for winter operations.

Fighting Remains Fierce

Berlin, 21st – Central News Agency Dispatch: The German News Agency reports: The major battles in the areas of Melitopol, northwest of Dnepropetrovsk, north of Crimea, south of Gomel, and along the Nevel River continued on Tuesday, with the intensity undiminished. The Soviet offensive is again heavily focused northwest of Dnepropetrovsk, where the Red Army is continuously deploying fresh troops, especially launching intense attacks on the base of the gap in that area. The Soviet army is using super-heavy tanks and the most powerful howitzers, mortars, and platoon guns to try to widen these gaps, but the German grenadiers are putting up a strong resistance and, undeterred by the enemy's fierce artillery fire, are using quick-firing automatic weapons to cut down the Soviet infantry columns in the trenches. The leading Soviet tank units in the trenches are closely followed by motorized infantry units in front of the battle. The accurate targeting of the German artillery fire has forced the Soviet motorized units to dismount in order to defend themselves. In this battle, German tanks destroyed seventeen Soviet tanks, rendering them immobile.

The Soviet Army Cannot Widen the Gap

The Red Army launched a fierce assault on the German mountain positions, but the German defenders resolutely resisted the enemy's fierce attacks. The Soviet army used all available troops, adding them to the battle more than twenty times. Although the Soviet army used several regiments and tank groups, as well as a large number of fire weapons and infantry artillery, it failed to penetrate the German lines at any point. The Soviet army also deployed reinforcements of at least five regiments and a large number of tank corps from the north in the northern sector of the gap, attempting to tear apart the German flank in order to widen the gap. Fierce fighting immediately broke out, with both sides suffering losses. Afterward, the enemy forces were repelled to the narrow bridgehead positions on the Dnieper River. In some places, they were even repelled to the islands in the river. North of the Sea of Azov, the Soviet army again tried to penetrate the Melitopol lines, but was again repelled to its original positions. A gap north of the town was immediately eliminated after a German counterattack. As a result, the Red Army was unable to make any use of this gap.

Most of the French people hope that the Anglo-Americans will choose another location in Europe as a battlefield so that France can be spared the ravages of a second war.

### Japan Strengthens Domestic Posture

Thorough Mobilization of the People

This strengthening of the domestic situation focuses on three points: expanding air combat capabilities, achieving food self-sufficiency, and thoroughly strengthening national defense labor. The national mobilization, in addition to military mobilization, focuses on expanding air combat capabilities. The seven points highlighted in the national mobilization policy are all goals that are currently presented to the people and urgently need to be materialized. In short, the people's cooperation in this regard depends on how the government fosters national morale on the path to achieving these goals and ensuring their accomplishment.

Past national mobilizations lacked organic connections to the progress of the war situation and the corresponding production relations. The national movement led by the Imperial Rule Assistance Association failed to organically connect the labor allocation in important industries and the labor services resulting from overall infrastructure development with production relations, which is undeniable.

In order to cope with "the urgent period of concentrating everything on a decisive war," national mobilization must possess an organic unity with these production relations. The awareness of the intensification of the war situation has already arisen in every citizen. The enthusiasm of youth throughout the country, not just students, but also in factories and rural areas, should be channeled into patriotic sentiments. Elevating the fervent enthusiasm of the youth at this moment is the essence of strengthening national mobilization. Therefore, the government must consider measures to ensure that the people thoroughly understand the new policies of the current situation, further clarify the national character of enterprises, and thoroughly rationalize the salary system, which are the keys to the success or failure of national mobilization. If the government first aims to initiate new mobilization among the people and eliminate the unpatriotic private lives still present among some citizens, it can be said to have laid the foundation for thoroughly implementing national mobilization.

Progress of Mobilization Plan

The seven points listed in the national mobilization policy are: first, expanding the scope of conscription for military mobilization; second, for students, suspending the deferment of conscription for liberal arts students and maintaining the current age limit for compulsory youth education; third, universalizing the requisition of male labor; fourth, promoting female labor; fifth, utilizing the surplus mobilization power generated by the streamlining of personnel from government-affiliated organizations and regulatory agencies, and the abolition of service year limits; sixth, allocating laborers to appropriate positions to ensure their efficient utilization. These are all measures that should naturally be taken to substantially increase aircraft production.

Without air superiority, there is no victory. The government has already begun implementing a 24-hour system to increase aircraft production, with a particular focus on the allocation of labor and materials. All national mobilization measures are tailored to this requirement of concentrating expanded combat capabilities on aircraft. Prohibiting men from easily choosing non-essential professions, strengthening female mobilization, and suspending liberal arts education are all measures taken directly and indirectly to increase aircraft production, ensure sufficient labor, and achieve previously set goals.

Japan's national mobilization, along with the progress of the China Incident, began planning for labor needs in the Showa 14th year (1939). Since then, each year it has been determined as part of the national plan under the name of the Labor Mobilization Plan. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it abandoned the character of simply partial labor mobilization. From the Showa 17th year (1942), it was renamed the National Mobilization Plan. Labor mobilization only reached a perfect stage after encouraging all citizens to work. In the Showa 15th year (1940) plan, unemployed women were the target of labor mobilization and were given as a source of new labor. In the 16th year (1941), in addition to general laborers, there were plans to use so-called labor service to fill a part of temporary seasonal labor, and the mobilization plan indicated a transition from labor sufficiency to national labor. The Great East Asia War had a great impact on labor administration. After the outbreak of the war, the National Labor Service Cooperation Order was promulgated and implemented, opening the way for citizens to directly serve in groups in general mobilization work. Therefore, the mobilization plans for the 17th and 18th years (1942 and 1943) broke into the preparation of national total mobilization work. Qualitative mobilization and optimization of requisition were being worked on to realize the transformation and allocation of each person's abilities into the professional categories that the state deems necessary.

Refreshing Labor Domestic Policy

An organic consistency is required between the labor mobilization for increasing military production and the production relations. Therefore, concrete measures within the government must be handled more closely and quickly between the related departments. The administrative operations of the Army, Navy, Ministry of Munitions, and Ministry of Health and Welfare should not "lose time" due to conflicts of authority in the future. In order to carry out the purpose of the decisive battle administration of "production first principle", the methods of administrative operation should be further simplified, strengthened and powerfully implemented from the viewpoint of the production responsibility system. Measures to prevent the transfer of full-time officials at the bureau chief and section chief levels in important production departments, and to thoroughly grasp production matters in the future, should also be considered.

When we observe the course of labor administration to date, as seen in the revision and abolition of the National Requisition Order and other related orders in the spring of this year, labor administration has always followed behind the reality of production. From the perspective of refreshing labor administration, there should be measures to strengthen the connection with production administration.

For labor mobilization to adapt to the principle of production first, civilian production control groups and the Industrial Service Association, which is the center of the industrial service movement, should take closer measures in terms of joint labor, and hope for a leap forward in adapting to the new situation of the industrial service movement.

Labor Efficiency

The supply and demand of labor is quite urgent, as seen in the strengthening of conscription, and the solution to this problem, labor efficiency, is becoming more and more attention. To be more precise, the lack of smooth material distribution and the uneven distribution of labor are being discussed as bottlenecks in enhancing production. At the same time, the imbalance between materials and labor must also be considered. In order to utilize materials and improve efficiency, the enterprise group system should be adopted, and the allocation of laborers should also be implemented with this industrial group as a unit. As the system organization of the general, branch, and cooperative factories is completed with the enterprise consolidation, it goes without saying that even at present, the circulation of skilled labor and the circulation of materials within the same region and the same enterprise should be utilized as much as possible to increase production. The Ministry of Health and Welfare has already admitted that most of the government-managed factories and other important munitions factories, the so-called general factories, in order to complete production by the designated date, may dispatch laborers from the general factories to the branch factories and cooperative factories.

The appropriate allocation of labor is a corrective measure for the uneven distribution of labor, and this has also been proposed this time, so its significance is extremely important. As a result of the rapid conversion of spinning factories, which are at the top of enterprise consolidation, equipment and laborers are included in the government's unified control range, resulting in many inadequacies in the use of laborers' abilities (Excerpted from the Western Asahi Shimbun on September 26).

### Meeting of Regional Directors of the Grain Control Association Yesterday - Instructions on Future Policies for Purchasing Grain

The meeting started promptly at 10:00 AM, beginning with Secretary-General Zhou leading the regional directors in paying respects to Chairman Yuan. Chairman Yuan then instructed the directors on the future policies of the offices, stating, "The significance of your presence here today is great. I believe you are all aware of the organization's objectives. I have been entrusted by the government to oversee the unified purchase and distribution of grain throughout the country. I am approaching this difficult task with the goal of living up to the government's trust and the people's expectations. Grain procurement is urgent and cannot be delayed. Regional offices should be established immediately. This is why we are here to discuss this with each other, and I hope that you will all work hard according to my instructions to complete this great mission. However, if there are any mistakes, the association will impose severe punishments." Secretary Zhou then elaborated on the differences between the previous and current regional offices, stating, "In the past, the regional offices of the Joint Operating Company were responsible for purchasing grain. Now, the purchase work of the association has been entrusted to the local industry preparedness committees. The regional offices of the association now have organizational regulations and detailed procedures for handling affairs, which are available for your review. The most important task is to inspect the quality of the grain, such as issuing transportation permits, processing and storage, and paying for the grain." Finally, Chen Zihui, director of the Storage and Distribution Department of the association, instructed the offices on the methods of inspecting the grain, and Dai Fu, director of the Finance Department, instructed on the financial procedures and the preparation of estimates. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM and was scheduled to continue at 3:00 PM this afternoon (the 22nd).

### Designated Retailers for Soap and Matches - 367 Stores - General Sales Expected to Begin Early Next Month

The relevant procedures have also been actively promoted by the authorities of the two districts. Purchase certificates have been issued, and general sales are expected to begin around the first day of next month. As for the retailers selling rationed soap and matches, the industry association of each district submitted a list of member stores to the authorities for review.

### Newspaper Deliveryman Apprehended for Forcibly Selling Newspapers Under False Pretenses - Handed Over to Police for Investigation

Central News Agency: Cases of using false pretenses to deceive and force people to purchase newspapers and magazines are frequently heard of in the city. Recently, the China Daily News discovered that someone was boldly claiming to be from the "Publicity and News Promotion Department of the National Government" to forcibly sell the newspaper and collect subscription fees. After learning of this, the newspaper immediately sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. Yesterday (the 21st), the newspaper deliveryman Wang Qingshan, who was in charge of delivering and collecting fees, was apprehended. After detailed questioning, he confessed that the mastermind behind the scheme was Chuan Jien, who resided at 226 West Shixing Road (from Dinghai, Zhejiang), and was a former subscription employee of the China Book and Newspaper Agency. The newspaper then went to the address, apprehended Chuan, and confirmed the facts. The newspaper then handed him over to the Hongkou Police Department for investigation according to law. Although such incidents are not uncommon in Shanghai, newspaper authorities deeply resent them, but have been unable to investigate due to the public's forbearance. Fortunately, this case has been uncovered, and it is hoped that the unscrupulous elements will refrain from such acts in the future.

Talk by Publicity Department Advisor Feng Jie

Because the suspect claimed to be from the Publicity and News Promotion Department of the National Government, the reporter interviewed Feng Jie, advisor to the Publicity Department, to inquire about his views on the matter. He made the following statement: "The National Government's Publicity Department has explicitly prohibited the forced sale of newspapers and magazines. Now, the China Daily News has discovered that someone in the city is boldly claiming to be from the Publicity and News Promotion Department of the National Government to deceive the public and forcibly sell the newspaper, which is absurd. The newspaper itself has its own value and should be trusted without the need for such sales tactics. In addition to the newspaper investigating the suspect and handing him over to the competent authorities for investigation according to law, I, on behalf of the Publicity Department, would like to declare that we hope the public will understand this, be cautious, and not be easily deceived. We also hope that there will be no more such unscrupulous elements who try to test the law."

### Central China Railway Actively Rectifying Railway Administration

The Central China Railway Company has a workforce of 30,000 Chinese employees, accounting for three-fifths of the total staff. Because these employees were hired too quickly after the incident and are of mixed backgrounds, the administrative operations are not smooth. When the new organization was reformed on August 1 of this year, the Railway Academy was established to specialize in two departments: general and specialized. In addition to selecting outstanding employees from various railways to attend lectures and training to enhance their knowledge and skills, recruitment for general department students will begin once the dormitory repairs are completed. Graduates of secondary schools are eligible to apply. Recently, the company appointed Councillor Hu Yi, president of the Railway Academy, as an investigator to go to North China and Manchuria to investigate the railway education administration. President Hu is scheduled to depart in early November, first going to Manchuria to inspect the South and North Manchuria Railways, and then to North China.

### Coal Ball Panic Not Reduced - Authorities Dispatch Personnel for Thorough Investigation - Strict Investigation of Concealment and Refusal to Sell

The situation regarding the supply of essential fuel coal balls has not yet returned to normal. Residents are urgently seeking to purchase them at black market prices from nearby retailers. Residents have repeatedly requested the authorities to find ways to thoroughly improve the situation and send personnel to secretly investigate the truth in order to adjust the current supply situation. According to a reliable source, the authorities, recognizing that coal balls are an essential item for cooking for low-income residents, no less important than rice, are urging manufacturers to increase production and actively clear large quantities of raw materials to reduce production costs. At the same time, they are sending a large number of personnel to the districts under their jurisdiction to secretly investigate the sale of coal balls by retailers. If any of the following situations are found, no matter who is involved, no leniency will be shown, and the matter will be strictly investigated according to law: those who have coal balls but refuse to sell them, or even hide them in secret places to deceive people; those who illegally raise market prices (limited to 32.5 yuan per dan); those who illegally profit; and those who reduce the quantity (100 jin per dan) or mix in impurities. If residents are aware of any such activities, they are encouraged to report them to the nearest police station so that a thorough investigation can be conducted.

### Coal Ball Retail Sales - Limited to Five Yuan Per Purchase

Reporters from the Central News visited the Coal Ball Industry Association to inquire about the difficulty in purchasing coal balls recently. According to them, the coal balls distributed by the association's member manufacturers to retailers are sufficient to meet the needs of the city. However, due to fears of rising coal ball prices or concerns about coal ball shortages, users are hoarding coal balls, creating opportunities for retailers to sell them at high prices on the black market. The association is currently working hard to thoroughly investigate this situation and has strictly established four rules: Retail sales of coal balls are limited to five yuan per purchase to prevent users from purchasing and hoarding large quantities, and to prevent retailers from reselling them in bulk on the black market at high prices; retailers are not allowed to sell goods midway to avoid fraud; retailers must strictly adhere to the limited price of 32.5 yuan and are not allowed to raise prices; and retailers who violate any of the above three rules will have their distribution rights immediately suspended. The association will strictly enforce these four rules.

Commentary

### Widening the Narrow Road to Increased Production

Yesterday, the focus of wartime production was on encouraging various emerging industries with wartime production potential, rather than just supporting existing production industries. The significance of this is to widen the narrow road to increased production. Wherever it can be widened, it should be widened as much as possible in order to circulate the economy and reduce the congestion of idle funds in the market. Therefore, the general public is uneasy about the stock review issue for emerging industries, which is the meaning of this.

Now, among the second batch of newly transferred enemy properties, there are also 21 cases related to enterprises, many of which are related to various production industries. This can certainly be regarded as another widening of the narrow road to increased production. What we should strive for in the future is exactly what the spokesperson of the New Enemy Property Management Committee said at the transfer ceremony held the other day: "Our efforts in managing enemy properties have always been aimed at increasing production. For example, for factories that have already started production, we must ensure their continued development. For factories that have not yet started production, we must find ways to start production." Undoubtedly, this is the wish that everyone in the production sector holds, and it is not just starting today.

What we need to supplement now is that, in terms of seeking people, the raw materials for factories after they are taken over can obtain the generous assistance of the Allied authorities, ensuring that there is no shortage of raw material allocation and no obstruction to the transportation of raw materials. In terms of self-reliance, the management of factories after they are taken over must be pragmatic and strive for excellence, especially focusing on the training of technical personnel, the improvement of labor welfare, and the increase of production efficiency, so as to jointly contribute to the wartime economic system. Only then will we live up to the goodwill of the Allied transfer.

### Oil and Grain Special Committee - Actively Purchasing Raw Materials - Edible Oil from North China is Now Being Shipped to Shanghai Continuously

The National General Chamber of Commerce's work of purchasing oil and grain is being carried out with utmost effort. The association has already ordered a large amount of edible oil from North China, which is currently being shipped by land. At the same time, the association is also quite active in purchasing raw materials for oil extraction. The above-mentioned measures will make the supply of edible oil more abundant, and the oil extraction factories that have been shut down in various places will also be able to resume work with the allocation of raw materials.

Purchasing Categories

It is learned from the committee that the scope of raw material purchases for oil extraction is very broad and can be divided into three categories: Miscellaneous grains, including soybeans, mung beans, black beans, sorghum, and corn, etc. Oilseeds, including cypress seeds, peanuts, tung seeds, sesame seeds, castor seeds, etc. Bones, including beef bones and pork bones, etc.

Branch Offices

The committee also noted that various oil and grain raw materials are mostly scattered in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. In order to achieve good collection results and facilitate unified management, it has imitated the method of purchasing wheat and established branch offices in the three provinces. It is planned to establish eleven units in total: Nantong, Haimen, and Shanghai in Jiangsu Province; Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing; Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province; and Wuhu, Anqing, and Bengbu in Anhui Province. The organization of each branch office is striving to be strong in order to achieve the effectiveness of collection work. At the same time, there are also regulations on the division of jurisdictional areas.

### Banks Prepare to Cope with the Year-End Period - Extra Caution in Reviewing New Loans

The year-end period for industry and commerce is approaching in the blink of an eye. Banks have made separate preparations and, in accordance with custom, notify that all credit loans expiring at the end of the year will be fully repaid before the end of the year in order to maintain the inherent commercial credit. However, for reputable firms, an extension will be granted, but the maximum extension shall not exceed six months. As for new long-term credit loans, in accordance with national laws and regulations and the resolutions of the joint meetings of banks, efforts will be made to tighten them. Therefore, the review of new loans is particularly cautious and limited to the proper development of productive enterprises. At the same time, contracts must be signed and solvent guarantors must be obtained. It is also heard that industry and commerce have made their own preparations for the year-end issue and are confident that they will be able to smoothly pass this period. In addition, the Money Trade Association has regularly convened a year-end internal market meeting to publicly decide on the "year-end internal market exchange rate."

### First District Health Department Issues Weekly Health Tips - How to Eradicate Smallpox

Central News Agency: In Shanghai, where the population is dense, it is truly not easy to maintain good health. First, one must understand the principles of hygiene and adhere to them unremittingly in order to maintain health and increase resistance to disease. During epidemics, extreme caution and prevention are required. If unfortunately infected, immediate treatment and isolation are necessary to prevent the spread. Promoting public health and preventing infectious diseases are the duties of the health authorities, but in order to achieve perfection, it is necessary for every citizen to cooperate enthusiastically. Unless personal hygiene is promoted first, success cannot be achieved. The Health Department of the First District Public Office has recognized this and has compiled a series of Health Tips to increase the general public's knowledge of hygiene, which are published weekly in newspapers in the city for reference.

Preventing Smallpox

Smallpox, commonly known as "chugantou," is a very terrible infectious disease. Contracting this disease is not only life-threatening for the patient, but it is also easy to transmit the disease to others, and it spreads very quickly. Smallpox is mostly transmitted through direct contact with the patient, but the patient's clothes, bedding, and all utensils used by the patient are also media for indirect transmission of smallpox. The general public always believes that smallpox only affects infants. When you get older, you won't get it anymore. This is a very big mistake. In fact, no matter how old you are, there is a possibility of contracting smallpox. However, adults who contract smallpox do not have a higher mortality rate than children. Due to the efforts of governments and people in other countries in the world, this disease has disappeared. On the contrary, smallpox still occurs frequently in various parts of our country, which cannot be said to be a shameful event. In fact, the prevention method for smallpox is easier and more effective than any other infectious disease. Now I will talk about the common knowledge about preventing smallpox, and at the same time introduce the steps taken by the Health Department of the First District Public Office of Shanghai Special City to prevent smallpox:

Vaccination Prevents Smallpox

Only vaccination can prevent smallpox. Besides vaccination, there is no other good way to prevent it. Our knowledge of vaccination is very common. We have had knowledge of vaccination for more than ten years, but because we are confined to superstition, we must choose a lucky day or wait until the Flower Birthday (February 12th of the lunar calendar) before we are willing to get vaccinated. Little do we know how many infants have been infected with smallpox and died before the Flower Birthday. This is so miserable and painful.

Every year on the Flower Birthday, thousands of infants go to the branches of the Health Department of the First District Public Office of Shanghai Special City to get vaccinated. This is an impressive sight, but we also mourn for the many infants who are delayed in vaccination and suffer misfortune. Parents, you must know that this health department vaccinates the public all year round.

Remember, children can be vaccinated within one or two weeks after birth. At the latest, they must be vaccinated before they are one month old. There is no need to wait for the arrival of the Flower Birthday. You can go to the nearest health branch at any time to get vaccinated. It doesn't cost a penny and only takes five minutes to completely prevent this terrible smallpox.

What to Do If You Get Smallpox

What should I do if I unfortunately get smallpox? Generally speaking, people still follow the old customs and lock the patient in a room, not allowing any visitors to come in to see them, and sealing the windows tightly with paper, fearing that the patient will see the light and be exposed to evil winds, making the room gloomy and unable to breathe in a bit of fresh air. Before medicine was developed, in those remote rural areas where there was no sanitation equipment, we cannot deny that this room naturally became an isolation ward, preventing many people from being infected. It seems that it also has its advantages, but let us think about it, in densely populated Shanghai, there are few houses and many people. A house is full of more than a dozen families. Once someone contracts smallpox, can you still isolate the patient? The local health authorities have long established a complete isolation hospital for infectious patients. If there is a smallpox patient in the family, don't hide the patient like before. Quickly send him to the isolation hospital. After the patient arrives at the hospital, the health department will immediately send someone to the patient's residence to disinfect it, and will vaccinate everyone who has been in contact with the patient, regardless of gender, age, or child. Only by doing this can the patient be saved, and you will also be saved.

How to Eradicate Smallpox

The following methods are all easy to do. I hope that all residents of the city will earnestly abide by them and work together to help the health authorities eradicate this terrible smallpox.

After a baby is born, whether it is winter or summer, it must be vaccinated before the baby is one month old at the latest.

Regardless of age, children and adults need to be revaccinated every three years. You can go to the nearest health branch to get vaccinated for free.

Do not visit patients with smallpox to prevent infection.

Smallpox patients must be sent to the isolation hospital for treatment immediately to avoid infecting others. The isolation hospital of the First District Public Office is located at 163 Beihai Road.

After the patient arrives at the hospital, do not move or hide his clothes, bedding, and all utensils that have been used. Let the health department send someone to take them away completely. After the disinfection is complete, send them back for reuse. The health department does not charge for this procedure.

After smallpox is discovered in the family, those who have been in contact with the patient, or their relatives and friends, whether or not they have been vaccinated, must allow the health department to send someone to vaccinate them. Do not choose. If any uncomfortable or suspicious symptoms are found within sixteen days, you must immediately report to the health department or consult a doctor to determine whether you have been infected with smallpox.

### Coffee Shop and Dance Hall Industry Holds Symposium - Discusses Thrift Issues

### Visiting the Orphanage and Kindergarten - The Unified Teaching and Management System

The kindergarten is full of vitality, but at the same time, there is also very strict management. They implement a "unified teaching and management system." Teachers, in addition to their teaching duties, must also be responsible for training and management. Therefore, they are all full-time and work in the院 all day long. They share the joys and sorrows of the students in their daily lives, and they "practice what they preach" as a model. In terms of teaching, it is even stricter. They regularly examine the students' academic performance and conduct. Those who are too poor and unmanageable are required to drop out of school. There are currently five resident staff members in the 院: one director of 院 affairs, one accountant and medical doctor, one provider and administrator, one cleaner and outdoor worker, and one nurse. There are six male and female workers. Under the "unified teaching and management system," the classrooms during the day are converted into bedrooms at night, with teachers and books. Under the principle of economy, the gymnasium also serves as a dining room and a recreation room. Meals are divided into two times, each time divided into several groups, each group of eight children, each with a group leader.

The kindergarten pays great attention to the children's upbringing. It has always cooperated with children's protection organizations and has fixed nourishment. There are standards for daily food and nutrition, and there are records. Currently, 250 kilograms of grain are made every day, of which rice accounts for one-third, sweet potatoes account for one-quarter, and the rest are red beans, wheat flour, corn flour, etc. One meal and two congees are stipulated every day, all cooked with water, so fuel is saved. Vegetables and oil, etc., cost at least 150 yuan per day, and dozens of yuan are added for teachers and staff. Rice is applied for from the district office, 13 packages per month, each package containing 1 shi and 2 dou and a half. Sweet potatoes, etc. are purchased nearby, and other foods are purchased in large quantities, making the price cheaper. Coal balls and coal layers can also be paid at half price. Therefore, in the past, the food cost was more economical than usual, averaging no more than 100 yuan per person per month. However, now, due to the continuous rise in prices, the nutritional standards have to be gradually reduced. All rely on their special attention to nutrition, so it does not greatly affect health.

In terms of clothing and bedding, each child generally has two sets of single clothes, one set of cotton-padded clothes, and two pairs of shoes. It is still visible that they are clean. Shoes are mostly not available. Most of the quilts are made of cotton blankets and are similar to army life. Each month, every two children have four or five blankets, which is enough. The cost of clothing and bedding for each child is about 10 yuan per month.

The health of the children in the past was not very good. Most of them were infected with scabies, lice, etc. Therefore, a medical room and a ward were set up, and a resident nurse was hired to preside over all medical and health affairs in the 院. Older children learn to work as assistants. Check in groups every day. Each person also has a check card. Soon scabies disappeared, and lice and pinkeye also decreased. Usually, washing is implemented. Bathing is forced, so the health status is gradually improving. There are also major hospitals of the former 工部局 Health Department and Western doctors Jiang Zhimian, Ge Futing, Guo Shu, Chen Zhanyuan, Guo Xingsun, Zhou Shuxiang, Fengsun, Mao Shouzhang, Gong Yangxian, and traditional Chinese medicine doctor Zhao Guanfu, etc., who regularly go to the 院 for free diagnosis. In case of serious illness, they are sent to the isolation hospital, the Red Cross Hospital, the Shanghai Civilian Tuberculosis Hospital, and the Yiyou Hospital. The China Leder Association and the Jimin Hospital are even close at hand, so the health of the children has been fully guaranteed.

Career and Future

From the small Shanghai Kindergarten, we can see the bright future of China, but we can also see that on the way to "light", there are many thorns.

The highest organizational volume of the kindergarten is the board of directors. The reasons for their presence are that they are well-known and enthusiastic people in social undertakings. The executive board includes Chairman Zhang Wenkui, Vice Chairman Chen Xuanzhe, Finance Director Zhu Lianxiang, Director Lin Hou, and Deputy Director Zhang Jusheng. Below the board of directors is the actual working organization of the main and branch 院s. The person in charge of the main 院 is 院 Affairs Director Ruan Bin, who presides over the three sections of affairs, teaching, and production, and the 院 Student Activities Guidance Committee. The teaching section currently has three teachers, and the general affairs section has six clerks, who are responsible for accounting, documents, supply, medical affairs, general affairs, and outdoor work. In addition to Director Li Heling, the production department also has one administrator and 师傅s from each production department. Chen Renyuan is the director of the Xu Gongqiao Branch. On the teaching side, there are three teachers, and two people for affairs and production. They use fewer people to teach the 260 "Little Heroes" in the two 院s (160 in the main 院 and 100 in the branch 院). Everyone cultivates talents for the country and society with a spirit of selfless dedication and harmony. Their treatment is very poor. The director does not receive a salary. In addition to providing very simple meals and accommodation for the teachers and staff of the 佳院, they only receive hundreds of yuan in salary. However, due to the continuous rise in prices, the 院's expenses are still very tight. Last winter, they purchased assistance from the Shanghai City Relief Association. After the investigation by the two members of Huan Huanquan and Li Lin, they believed that it was worth subsidizing. The standing committee of the association decided to subsidize 7,000 yuan per month starting from January of this year until March. Later, it was decided to continue subsidizing 11,000 yuan, totaling 32,000 yuan. Recently, according to 院 Director Ruan, the funds are already on the verge of exhaustion, and the bank has already overdrawn, so they are preparing to launch the fourth fundraising campaign. It is hoped that the fundraising will be successful and the foundation will be sufficient, so that the industries of the main 院 can progress, and the agricultural and commercial income of the branch 院 can be sufficient, and it is possible to reach self-sufficiency, and also expand the number of teaching and education industries and the number of adopted persons with surplus energy. Then, the education and upbringing of Shanghai's suffering children can achieve greater results. (The End)

### Opinions on Improving Compulsory Education

— Law

In recent years, as a result of the continuous rise in the cost of living, most school-age children and young people, except for a very few lucky ones, have been excluded from school—dropping out of school. From the perspective of the country, society, or oneself, this is undoubtedly a major damage to education and culture. Therefore, adapting to this trend, scholarship campaigns and volunteer teaching work have flourished in recent years. Although this is almost a passive educational relief endeavor, who can ignore this aspect!

Today, those engaged in volunteer teaching in Shanghai are mostly working youth or student youth. Their engagement in education is driven more by enthusiasm and interest than by volition. This is a common occurrence. Several young people with similar interests come together, raise some funds, and then rent school buildings, put up enrollment advertisements, purchase teaching materials, and test new students. A volunteer school is thus born. Thanks to the enthusiasm of these non-professional educators, the number of schools is quite promising. However, they are ultimately outsiders, and education is not something that can be accomplished with temporary enthusiasm. Therefore, if we peel back the surface of quantity and delve deeper, we believe there is a need for further exploration. "Cheap optimism" does more harm than good.

What is education? This is still a contentious issue. I don't want to discuss this big topic here, but if we say that education is not just about knowing a few characters, no one can deny this. Therefore, to achieve this educational goal, it may not be possible for amateur educators who only understand educational principles and have enthusiasm to do it! In one volunteer school I saw, it was run by twenty-odd working youths, so there were twenty-odd teachers. In this situation of too many monks and not enough porridge, on the school's daily schedule, the Chinese language subject for the same grade is taught by several different people. Zhang San yesterday, Li Si today, tomorrow... Leaving aside the educational principles, such a superficial teaching method, even the so-called extremely narrow literal education of merely knowing a few characters, would be greatly discounted. The emotional connection between teachers and students, the personality of students, etc., outside of literal education, are naturally out of the question. I deeply admire their motivation and enthusiasm for teaching. However, from the standpoint of an educator, this cannot but be said to be a failure of education.

Secondly, there is the issue of teaching materials, which is also handled with numerous errors. The new education advocates a "child-centered" approach, where the child is the center of teaching, the teacher's role is merely a guide, and the teaching materials are even more so. In volunteer schools with simple facilities and unqualified teachers, this is an excessive desire. However, the teaching materials should be based on and suitable for the needs and level of the students. This should not be wrong! However, they are too hasty in this regard. According to what I know, one volunteer school teaches complex fractions in the sixth grade—which is of no use in students' daily lives—and another volunteer school's fifth-grade entrance exam starts with questions like "Describe the cause of electricity," "Briefly describe the major cities of our country," etc. This simply leads the children into a fog. Is this "spoon-feeding" education, where they ignore the children's interests and try to instill in them as much knowledge as they consider valuable, what we should have today? Should I make an appeal for the children: "Save the children!"

To be fair, the teachers are subjectively well-intentioned and excusable, but due to inappropriate measures, they are objectively almost harming the children. This is a point that we should not ignore and is worth mentioning again and again. The starting point of this article is based on this point, hoping that the teachers engaged in volunteer teaching today! Treat it as a mirror, "correct your faults if you have them, and strive harder if you don't." This is my sincere blessing.

### Suppressing the Price of Coarse Grains

— Dai Ying

Since the establishment of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, plans regarding procurement, distribution, etc., have been decided one after another. If all plans can be implemented one by one, it seems that the price of rice can be stabilized in the coming year, and people's livelihood can naturally be less stable. However, in fact, today's livelihood issue is not only in terms of rice and grain, but also the exorbitant prices of other items, which have a greater impact on people's suffering than rice and grain. Among these, daily necessities and coarse grains are especially important, and the authorities are also planning to limit the prices and ration daily necessities, although the implementation period is not far off. However, there is no strict control over coarse grains. I believe this issue is also extremely important. Following rice and grain, it should be quickly controlled, and strict price limits should be set, otherwise the people's livelihood will still not be stable, and at most, the rice problem will be solved.

Among the coarse grains, special attention should be paid to soybeans, broad beans, red beans, and green beans. At present, the selling prices of beans all exceed the stipulated price limits for rice and grain. In this way, although the price of rice has been regulated and has fallen somewhat, various coarse grains are still being hoarded and overpriced by speculators, which is extremely unfair. Because in terms of bean prices, they were lower than rice prices in the past, but now the price of soybeans is actually twice that of rice. A picul of broad beans costs a thousand yuan, and red beans and green beans are all above a thousand yuan, which is an abnormal state. It seems that there is a need for adjustment. Otherwise, the impact on residents in rice-producing areas will be significant, and it seems too cheap for areas that grow coarse grains.

The exorbitant price of coarse grains has a greater impact on people's livelihood than rice. For example, the exorbitant price of soybeans makes it impossible to sell soybean oil, soybean cakes, tofu, soy sauce, and various soybean products at high prices. Under today's circumstances, ordinary families are unable to afford fish and meat, and even eating some tofu feels a bit unaffordable, not to mention that vegetarian dishes cannot do without soybean oil. Broad beans are also a staple food for the poor, and the new price of peanuts exceeds three thousand yuan per picul, which is even more expensive, making it impossible for people to buy. From this, it can be seen that the impact of coarse grains on people's livelihood is greater than that of rice, which is an ironclad fact.

Extending this to the excessively high prices of bran and soybean cake, which affect the rising prices of pork and meat, all have a close relationship with the people's livelihood. Therefore, strengthening the control of coarse grains and suppressing prices is also an urgent task. Otherwise, if the price of rice is low and the price of coarse grains only rises and does not fall, how can the people's livelihood problem be solved? Therefore, in the future, the prices of all items should be based on the price of rice, and those that were lower than the price of rice before the war should not be allowed to exceed the price of rice, and the price before the war should still be maintained. Otherwise, the people's livelihood problem cannot be solved. Although the price of rice is lower, the suffering and oppression of the people have not been reduced. Therefore, we are sincerely hoping that the selling price of coarse grains can also be quickly suppressed, and then extended to eggs and vegetables, so that they can all follow the price of rice and go down, so as to truly alleviate some of the people's suffering. May the authorities quickly take this into account.

### Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Native Place Association: Charity Performance to Help Compatriots in Hong Kong

According to successive letters from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Native Place Association in Hong Kong, due to the financial difficulties of refugees from Central and Northern China in the local area who wish to return home but have been unable to do so, remittances have been sent to help them in the past. However, a cup of water is difficult to achieve universal benefit, and thinking of the hometown friendship, how can we bear to sit idly by? Therefore, fellow countrymen gathered to discuss again, and a joint charity performance by famous opera stars and actors will be held at the New Stage on the evening of October 26. The proceeds from ticket sales, after deducting expenses, will be remitted to Hong Kong in full to help impoverished overseas Chinese to return to their hometowns early. It is hoped that those who love good deeds will contribute to the success of this event and benefit the refugees, so as to comfort themselves. The fellow countrymen are deeply gratified.

### Mother Xia's Birthday Celebration: Saving Money to Help Students

Mr. Xia Shikui of Zhenjiang is always eager to help those in need, is generous and righteous, and is extremely filial to his parents. On November 14 (i.e., the seventh day of the tenth lunar month), the 70th birthday celebration for Mr. Xia's mother, Madam Gao, will be held. Prominent figures from all walks of life in Shanghai have initiated a public worship ceremony at the Jade Buddha Temple on that day. Mr. Jiao Fafa, a close friend of Mr. Xia, told the author that during the period, he will fast and chant sutras, respectfully following his mother's orders. In view of the difficult times, all extravagant expenses will be simplified, and the saved funds will be donated to the scholarship fund run by Shen Bao and the loan fund run by Xinwen Bao, so as to help poor students and benefit all relatives and friends.

### Solicitation of Funds for Stone Inscriptions, Calligraphy, and Paintings for the Hongying Library

To promote culture, enlighten the people, broaden the road of governance, assist education, and provide a path for scholars to learn and a way for the public to conduct research, this is why libraries are valued in modern times. Since the establishment of this library, twenty years have passed. Through diligent management, a basic scale has been achieved. The library houses more than 150,000 volumes of books, over 300,000 pieces of various indexes, and over 1.8 million pieces of historical materials. The number of readers is in the thousands every month. However, the funds have been reduced, and it is extremely difficult to maintain. Plans to enhance the library's facilities are often simplified due to limited resources. Therefore, it is deeply regrettable that the progress of the education cause is hampered by insufficient funds. Therefore, the idea of an exhibition of stone inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings was initiated, both to promote artistic brilliance and to raise funds to support the library's expenses. By continuing our efforts, we can overcome any difficulties. Through this exhibition, we can learn from both domestic and foreign works of art and expand our knowledge. We admire the contemporary artists and famous masters in the country, whose works compete with each other in their brushstrokes and whose landscapes are rich in creativity. They excel in painting and engraving, and their reputations soar. Furthermore, we also appeal to generous gentlemen and collectors to donate their treasured collections or part with their beloved works. We humbly request your generous donations. Libraries are public undertakings for the benefit of society, and they rely on the collective strength of all, regardless of distance. We hope that you will support us and join us in this righteous cause. This is truly a blessing with no end, and its merits are not limited to a specific time or place. Sincerely, Hongying Library.
