### Production, Price Controls, and the Problem of Commodity Prices

The issue of commodity prices remains the most pressing problem, causing anxiety for everyone. Regarding recent trends, grain prices have fallen, but the prices of other commodities continue to rise in part. The general public, having become "birds startled by the twang of a bow" due to years of soaring prices, is shadowed by the concern that "grain prices might rebound." However, there is no need to worry about this point. We should instead investigate ways to prevent the rise in the prices of other commodities, as that is the meaningful way forward.

The proposed solution here will still focus on "price controls." Price controls are a step beyond price stabilization. Price stabilization uses economic forces to stabilize prices, while price controls use political power to suppress prices. As a stopgap measure, this is worth considering, but if we want to truly stabilize commodity prices, greater effort is needed. Only after solving the factors driving up prices can price controls be truly effective. Otherwise, with production reduced and poverty rampant, producers and merchants will adopt a passive attitude, hiding goods piecemeal over time. Without any orders, trade will grind to a halt. This is the lesson of history, and the logic of reality. This must be considered when implementing price controls.

Addressing the issue of commodity prices, like addressing any other issue, requires a clear understanding of the objective environment. If China were a highly capitalist country, a country with concentrated production, the problem would be easier to address. It would only require regulating a small number of major production entities. Unfortunately, China's economic situation is not like that. Modern industrial production is both dispersed and pitifully weak. In this society dominated by small-scale commodity production, we can only guide, assist, and encourage them to produce. Excessive restrictions would reduce their motivation and ability to produce. Conversely, if we can genuinely support them and enable them to greatly increase their production, the supply of goods will surely increase significantly. If supply increases, then price controls will naturally be effective.

To increase production, we must eliminate all obstacles to production, and further, solve the problem of funding for industrial production. Currently, the most difficult point is that the "profit from hoarding" exceeds the "interest rate of banks," and the interest rate of banks sometimes exceeds the profit of industrial production (if not combined with hoarding). As a result, speculative capital flows madly into hoarding. Therefore, the current priority is to suppress commercial profits and guarantee industrial profits. This will encourage a large amount of capital to flow into production. If we can strictly punish hoarding and genuinely suppress commercial profits, then with increased production, wouldn't price controls be more effective?

Next, we must discuss the relationship between commodity prices and currency value. Uncontrolled currency issuance inevitably leads to inflation. Therefore, when managing commodity prices, we must not underestimate this problem. Assuming that production and issuance develop in a scissors-like fashion, commodity prices cannot remain stable. Therefore, we must stabilize the currency value and reduce the amount of currency issued. First, to stabilize the currency value, we must not only find ways to withdraw currency but also find ways to issue less. This requires cutting unnecessary branches and reducing unnecessary expenses. Second, the currency withdrawn through various means must be channeled into the production sector. Otherwise, industry will still suffer from a shortage of funds, hindering turnover and making it impossible to increase production.

When discussing the problem of commodity prices, both currency and materials need not be compared or evaded. In the early stages of inflation, it is partly due to currency inflation and partly due to a lack of materials. Now, however, the majority of the problem lies in the general public's psychological panic, resulting in a price increase race. Therefore, calming the public's mind is the top priority. The target of commodity price administration is mostly the citizens, who are most sensitive and cannot be kept in the dark. Moreover, the seven necessities of daily life are needed by everyone. Even without publishing a commodity price index, everyone's life experience will allow them to remember the trend of commodity prices. Only through open discussion and explaining the greater good and harm to the public can we eliminate general psychological panic.

Only by focusing on these fundamental issues can price controls achieve their intended effect. Therefore, we must strive to reduce currency issuance, strive to support production and eliminate all obstacles to production, strive to strictly prohibit hoarding, and strive to eliminate general psychological panic. This may be a clich√©, but it is ultimately the path to solving the problem of material and commodity prices.

### Prime Minister Tojo Visits Manchurian Premier to Exchange Views on Japan-Manchuria Cooperation, Significant for Wartime Operations

Shinkyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo visited Premier Zhang of the Manchurian State Council and other key figures of the Manchurian government this afternoon (2nd) to congratulate them on the ten years of development since the founding of Manchuria and to express his gratitude for Manchuria's cooperation in the Greater East Asia War. Prime Minister Tojo also had an in-depth discussion with Premier Zhang in the Premier's office, exchanging candid opinions on various issues between Japan and Manchuria. It is acknowledged that this meeting has far-reaching significance in strengthening the relationship between Japan and Manchuria, including Manchuria's future cooperation with Japan and Japan's assistance to Manchuria. Previously, Prime Minister Tojo visited the friendly nation of China and held important talks with Chairman Wang. Now, he has met with Manchurian Premier Zhang. Therefore, the meetings of the three major leaders of China, Japan, and Manchuria have been held individually. This will inevitably have a significant effect on the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the completion of the operation to defeat Britain and the United States, and is therefore worthy of attention.

### Japanese Troops in Shanxi Province Continue to Launch Sweeping Operations, Remnants of Bandits Annihilated Northwest of Linyi, Shandong Province

Taiyuan, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese troops in Shanxi Province launched a fierce attack on the remnants of the Chongqing army in southwestern Shanxi Province starting at dawn on March 28th. That evening, they surrounded 1,000 soldiers of the Chongqing army near Beidong, 15 kilometers northwest of Xinjiang, and inflicted heavy casualties. Sweeping operations are still ongoing. As of March 30th, 354 bodies of Chongqing soldiers were left behind, and 100 were captured. The Japanese troops also seized 13 light machine guns, 111 rifles, 5,675 rounds of ammunition, 6 automatic rifles, and 239 hand grenades.

Jinan, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Yizhou Garrison, in cooperation with the Japanese army, launched a joint operation to clear out the remaining communist bandits in the area northwest of Linyi County on the 1st.

### Japanese Military Information Department Announces War Situation in the Yangtze River Region

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Military Information Department stationed in China announced the war situation for the week of April 2nd as follows: In the sweeping operations in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the surrounding areas of Wuhan, the enemy suffered 2,100 deaths and 500 were captured. The operations are still in progress. The Chongqing side recently believes that the Japanese army is drastically reduced in strength and attempts to take advantage of the situation to strengthen its offensives in various aspects. They are currently under severe pressure. However, the reality is the opposite. In each operation, the number of enemy soldiers surrendering or being captured has sharply increased, proving that the Chongqing side has lost its will to fight and its resistance is declining. Furthermore, last year's call to retake Burma failed due to a lack of air power and insufficient weapons and ammunition. The main force was lost after one failed attack. Therefore, they are making every effort to cooperate with the British and American forces, waiting for an opportunity to act. Looking at last year's Burma campaign, the results of their joint operations should be clear.

### National Government Orders the Formulation of Commemorative Medals and Award Tables

When wearing the New National Uniform, medals and tables are worn in the same manner as military officers. During wartime, medals are worn in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the Implementation Rules of the Tongguang Medal Award Regulations, except that medals are worn on National Day and other major ceremonies in accordance with special regulations. This order is issued by Chairman Wang Zhaoming.

### Chongqing Newspaper Criticizes Britain and the United States, Advocates Adopting Unilateral Diplomacy

Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to Chongqing news, Chongqing's rhetoric towards Britain and the United States, from the Casablanca Conference to Churchill's recent speech and the statements of Eden and Hull, is considered to still adhere to the principle of prioritizing Europe. Therefore, in a fit of indignation, it has become unbearable. The Chongqing National Daily and the China Times unanimously published articles at the end of last month, denouncing Britain and the United States and pointing out that Britain and the United States are no longer reliable. In order to seek self-reliance, unilateral diplomacy should be adopted as soon as possible. As the National Daily stated, "Since the Casablanca Conference, we have paid close attention to the strategic posture and political dynamics adopted by Britain and the United States. However, Churchill's speech in the British Parliament on March 21st not only greatly disappointed us, but also made it clear to us the attitude they have adopted. Therefore, we should now re-examine our own attitude. The content of Churchill's speech is different from that of Eden and Hull, which shows that his remarks are not representative of the highest opinions of the anti-Axis countries. At the same time, it also exposes that Churchill is merely a useless person. In the future, we should not only continue to pay attention to the dynamics of Britain and the United States, but also adopt unilateral diplomacy in order to seek spiritual self-reliance and self-renewal." The China Times stated, "After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the attitude of Britain and the United States was extremely unclear, and Churchill's speech was also extremely ambiguous. This really disappointed us greatly. Although Eden's speech was still able to clarify matters for us, its specific details are still difficult to understand. We deeply suspect whether British diplomacy has guiding principles. Therefore, we hope that it can express its highest diplomatic policy as soon as possible."

### Chairman Wang's Handwritten Order to the New Citizens' Movement Committee to Re-examine Old Music Scores and Lyrics

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee recently received a handwritten order from Chairman Wang, instructing them to re-examine all old music scores and lyrics. The original order is as follows: "Currently, the songs used in various schools and organizations often use new lyrics to old scores. This is a quick fix, but some old music score lyrics are extremely inappropriate, and even with new lyrics, the songs sound awkward and even have a negative impact. The New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee should promptly work with the Ministry of Education, the Propaganda Department, and the Military Council to re-examine all music scores and lyrics. Any old music score lyrics that violate national policy should be prohibited from use. Talented music educators should be encouraged to devote themselves to promoting the goals of the New Citizens' Movement, and make every effort to fully express the firm comradeship and passionate emotions of restoring China and defending East Asia in the music score lyrics, in order to cultivate the spirit and interests of the new citizens. This order is issued by Chairman Wang Zhaoming of the National Government." After receiving the order, the New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee has sent letters to the Ministry of Education, the Propaganda Department, and the Military Council, scheduling the first meeting to be held at 4 PM on the 3rd of this month. In addition, the Propaganda Department issued a circular on the Return to Capital Commemoration Day, ordering that all communications, news magazines, printed materials, songs, dramas, and public speeches, whether in Chinese or foreign languages, must be submitted for inspection. The inspection procedures will be announced within days, and local propaganda agencies will be instructed to comply.

### German Troops South of Lake Ilmen Turn from Defense to Offense, Launching Fierce Battles; Timoshenko's Offensive Completely Repulsed

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front reports, German troops launched a fierce attack on Soviet positions in the Smolensk area on the 1st, occupying a certain important village and completely surrounding and annihilating the Soviet 4th Sniper Regiment. In addition, German troops south of Lake Ilmen have turned from defense to offense, launching intense battles in several locations along the Volkhov Front from Lake Ilmen to Lake Ladoga. German troops are gradually advancing and have completely repulsed the so-called Timoshenko Offensive. In addition, German troops besieging the Leningrad area recently bombarded the city's nearby railway facilities, military industry zones, and the Trellergonic munitions factory with heavy artillery, causing significant damage. According to German frontline news, German bomber squadrons raided Soviet airfields in Murmansk, heavily bombing facilities in the field and destroying many Soviet aircraft parked on the ground.

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front reports, Soviet troops have launched fierce attacks on the lower reaches of the Kuban River for several consecutive days, but have made no progress. The Soviet army recently launched a general offensive north of the port of Zheleznyak on the 31st under the command of General Mansrenikov with a large number of reinforcements. As of the 1st, tank units of both armies are still engaged in fierce battles in the Anastasievskaya area north of the port. The purpose of the Soviet operation is still to advance westward to occupy Damansk and break into the central part of the main German positions north and south of the Damansk Peninsula. However, the Soviet offensive was halted by heavy bombing by German dive bombers, and the battle situation is gradually becoming favorable to the Germans. According to German news agency frontline reports, as of noon on the 1st, the Soviet army had lost 41 tanks, 13 aircraft, and a large number of artillery and other military supplies. In addition, a large unit of Soviet snipers was surrounded by German troops in a swampy area west of Anastasievskaya and is also on the verge of complete annihilation.

### German Troops in Southern Tunisia Continue to Shorten Their Lines

Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to reports from the North African front, the Axis forces in southern Tunisia are continuing to shorten their lines. It is reported that the British and American forces are eager to attack and have suffered significant losses. The British Eighth Army Commander Montgomery is desperately attacking with a total of five divisions of tanks and infantry. However, the Axis forces are skillfully utilizing the terrain to retreat from the El Hamma-Gab√®s area and have moved their main force to the north. During the Axis retreat, Rommel's rearguard forces are hindering the Allied advance. The Axis air force is also assisting ground troops by heavily bombing the British forces. Furthermore, American and French rebel forces in the central region of Maknassy-El Guettar are attempting to join forces with the British and attack Gab√®s. However, due to the strong defense of the Rommel forces, the enemy is being held back and suffering significant casualties. According to German sources, in recent days, Rommel's forces in the southern and central regions have captured 2,000 enemy soldiers and destroyed over 100 enemy tanks, capturing 50 artillery pieces and hundreds of transport vehicles.

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Regarding the situation on the Tunisian front: (1) According to the German daily communiqu√©, the Axis and Allied forces are continuing their fierce struggle, centered on the southern region. Although the German and Italian allied forces are firmly defending the Mareth Line, the British forces are outflanking them from the south. Due to the narrow isthmus between the coast and the hills, rapid withdrawal would be difficult if the situation worsened. Moreover, American forces are threatening their rear from the Gafsa area. Therefore, according to the planned strategy, they are withdrawing from the Mareth Line. The Axis forces have now constructed a defensive line in the Gab√®s-El Hamma northern region. It is expected that they will adopt flexible tactics in the future, exploiting the weaknesses of the Allied forces to inflict losses on them. This withdrawal is a skillful maneuver to completely maintain the initiative in the operation. This point can be proven by the fact that the British have reported very few German and Italian prisoners of war. According to German sources, the British have lost 215 tanks and many armored vehicles since the start of their offensive. At the same time, American forces and French rebel troops under Giraud are attacking Gab√®s from Maknassy and El Guettar, but have made no progress due to the fierce counterattacks by the Axis forces. The German forces have suitable defensive positions on the high ground north of Gab√®s and El Hamma. Therefore, the Allied attempt to encircle the Rommel forces has completely failed. At this point, the Tunisian campaign has entered its second phase.

### Internal Strife Within the Allied Camp and Prospects for Germany's Summer Offensive

(Special Dispatch from Lisbon, dated 24th) - On the European Eastern Front, the Soviet offensive has been blunted by the German counter-offensive. Both armies are now reorganizing their lines to prepare for the final battle. On the Tunisian front, the British Eighth Army has begun its offensive, and its outcome is gradually becoming clear. Meanwhile, on the political front, British Foreign Secretary Eden is flying to America to coordinate the disjointed Allied camp. The progress of the world war in the next two or three months is likely to have the most significant impact since the beginning of the war. The Lisbon branch of the Asahi Shimbun and the Buenos Aires branch recently took advantage of the opening of international telephone lines between the two cities to exchange views across the Atlantic on the 24th, seeking to uncover the truth behind this momentous opportunity, as follows:

Mogi, Lisbon Bureau Chief - Hitler and Churchill both gave speeches on the 21st, which raised interesting questions in many ways.

Imai, Buenos Aires Bureau Chief - Churchill's speech, and the purpose of Eden's visit to the United States, revealed the hopes of the British people for the direction and form of the post-war world. To soothe Soviet unease and disappointment, Churchill emphasized that Britain, America, and the Soviet Union would be the rulers of the post-war world, explained the Soviet Union's important role in building the new world, and announced a post-war four-year plan that would satisfy the Soviet Union. In short, this was just a gesture to appease the Soviet Union, and Churchill's political views were nothing more than the outdated idea of collective security, a mere replay of the failed efforts of the Allies after World War I. Such hollow pronouncements are clearly insufficient to appease the Soviet Union's deep dissatisfaction.

Mogi - Yes, from the Soviet perspective, no matter how nice the post-war agreements sound, they are not as concrete as the issue of a British and American landing in Europe. Collective security and the League of Nations, which deal with post-war issues, will eventually turn against the Soviet Union and become an anti-Soviet alliance, so the Soviet Union prefers to break free from the realistic constraints of Britain and America.

Imai - For example, the Soviet Union's desire to possess the old borders of Poland, the three Baltic states, and Haan Kai Island in the Gulf of Finland is primarily aimed at securing strategically important locations that will play a significant role in future wars. Therefore, Soviet diplomacy is far more focused on reality than that of Britain and America.

Mogi - In theory, some in Britain seem to officially recognize this sphere of influence of the Soviet Union. But in practice, it becomes a problem. For example, the recent failure of Soviet-Polish border negotiations, not to mention America, even Britain views it as a Soviet delusion and will never allow the Soviet Union to have its way.

Imai - The Soviet Union is now single-handedly shouldering the heavy burden of the anti-Axis forces, and cannot shake off the feeling that it is fighting for Britain and America. But in order for the Soviet Union to continue the current war, Britain and America must yield to the Soviet Union's realistic demands for new territories.

Mogi - Since US Vice President Wallace's speech on cooperation with the Soviet Union, the British and American ruling class's expectations of the Soviet Union, and Britain's continued mediation between the US and the Soviet Union, maintaining its original position, were already known before Eden's visit to the United States. And regarding the imperialistic ambitions of the United States, Britain also views them as being of the same ilk as the Soviet Union's expansion of power, so it is doing its utmost to restrain them. During Eden's stay in Washington, according to an editorial in the Times on March 8, the conflict between Britain and the United States is due to the fact that the relationship between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union is based on mutual suspicion. The editorial discussed the security of post-war Europe, stating that only the Soviet Union has the strength to guarantee Europe, so its priority position should be recognized. Britain, due to its original position in Europe and its traditional policies, is naturally also a major player. The United States has no direct connection to the problems of Europe, so everything should be decided by Britain, which is located between the two continents. This self-centered assertion naturally irritates the United States. Churchill's speech was intended to revise this view.

Mogi - Some suspect that this editorial may have been written by Eden, but this seems to be a superfluous question. Eden himself has stated that this editorial does not represent any official British views. The anti-Soviet and anti-British sentiment in the United States is being heavily hyped by the British newspapers. According to recent weeks, this trend seems to have a considerable basis. The Washington correspondent of the Daily Mail said:

"Recently, another group in the United States, which does not support isolationism, is gaining power. They are demanding the occupation of military bases and the construction of a large national defense force. The atmosphere among the American people is far more tense than in Britain. In short, the United States is now pursuing its blatant imperialism."

The British economy is now heading towards national socialism at a very rapid pace. The production concentrationism mentioned in the proposal of Minister of Munitions Production Lyttelton at the beginning of this year is actually munitions production firstism, so the government's control over enterprises is extremely strengthened.

According to the above policy, Britain is now focusing on three production sectors: aircraft and their parts, ships, and anti-submarine defense equipment. Ninety percent of the new labor force and surplus labor force is concentrated in the above three sectors.

Imai - Within the Allied camp, Chongqing's position is the most pitiful. In Churchill's speech, Chongqing was kicked aside. He said: In the current situation, Britain, America, and the Soviet Union are in a leading position, and in the coming year, or the year after, aid to Chongqing will only be provided after victory is achieved in Europe. Chongqing is the stepchild of the British and American camp. Compared to the important role played by Chairman Wang and Japan in the common front, Chongqing's position in the Allied camp seems particularly weak.

Mogi - British and American views on this point are slightly different. Britain does not view Chongqing as being equal to zero, but the United States is only superficially dealing with Chongqing because it is directly confronting Japan in the Pacific. On the British side, they are very unhappy due to the recent disastrous defeat on the Burmese front, so they do not have much hope for the Chongqing army. (To be continued)

Fumikazu Takeuchi, Director of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry
Toraji Kurimoto, Managing Director of Yinghua Trading Company
Nobutane Kiuchi, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of Yokohama Specie Bank

Binhe Chen, this Newspaper

Mr. Binhe Chen: It is truly a great pleasure for Shen Bao to jointly hold this roundtable discussion with the Continental News today. We are especially honored to have the leaders of the economic circles from Japan and the authorities from our country's economic circles participating, and we should express our deep gratitude.

Mr. Osaka: I apologize for taking up everyone's precious time this evening, and my colleagues and I feel very honored. There are various forms of roundtable discussions, and I know that all of you present here are very experienced. However, I would like to emphasize that this roundtable discussion jointly held by newspapers is probably the first of its kind. At the same time, this is also the first time that both Japan and China have jointly held such a meeting. The results of the roundtable discussion will be published by the Continental News in Japanese newspapers, and by Shen Bao and New Shen Bao simultaneously in Chinese newspapers. A few days ago, an agreement was reached at the News Federation meeting on Sino-Japanese cooperation and advancement. This roundtable discussion is the first thing that was decided to be implemented in that agreement. Thanks to Mr. Chen's enthusiastic expectations, it has finally become a reality today. It is a great honor for the long-established Shen Bao and the young Continental News to jointly start doing this. Also, I would like to ask Mr. Takeuchi to preside over today's roundtable discussion. Now, let's ask Mr. Takeuchi to speak as chairman!

Mr. Takeuchi: It is presumptuous of me to act as chairman, but I don't know how to proceed. I really feel a bit flustered. Today's newspaper published the issue of purchasing the distribution mechanism, which I think is a good opportunity. I believe that the issue of purchasing the distribution mechanism itself is the first economic manifestation of the fact of the Sino-Japanese diplomatic policy shift announced on January 9, which everyone felt very happy about. At the same time, it is the most important starting point for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in the future. Regarding this relationship, I would like to ask Mr. Li to express his brilliant insights first.

Discussion Topics:

(1) After the transformation of Japan's new policy towards China, the new direction of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation with Shanghai as the center.
(2) Countermeasures for the current price problem.
(3) The revival of Shanghai's industry and the issue of increasing production.
(4) The issue of Shanghai Chinese stock trading and the stock exchange.
(5) Opinions on the establishment of a National Commercial Control Association and the easing of restrictions on the movement of goods.

Mr. Quanshi Li: (1) First, we must demonstrate true equality and cooperation in fact to seek the spirit of coexistence and co-prosperity. On the one hand, ease restrictions on the movement of goods between Shanghai and other ports, and on the other hand, establish a National Commercial Control Association to assist the government in implementing national policies. For these two points to proceed smoothly, we must rely on the sincere cooperation of friends from the friendly country and not yearn for the monopolistic interests of the past few years.

(2) There are two main countermeasures for the current price problem: one is to increase the supply or production of goods, and the other is to stabilize the people's anxiety and panic about currency. To eliminate the people's anxiety about Central Reserve Bank notes, we must make the people believe that the Axis powers will surely win the final victory and that the new order in East Asia and the world will surely be established, and prove it with ironclad facts, so that speculators and hoarders who spread rumors and confuse the public will have no place to use their skills. If we can severely and fairly search for hoarded goods and distribute them comprehensively to consumers, we will be able to obtain the satisfactory results of a low-price policy.

(3) To revive Shanghai's industry and increase production, we must first unblock the source of raw materials. The starting point for Shanghai's industrial revival is the textile industry, so we must first unblock the source of cotton. To unblock the source of cotton, we must first sell Shanghai's daily industrial products, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, cigarettes, matches, candles, soap, and sugar, to cotton farmers at low prices. Recently, the Central China Cotton Control Association, in order to save the lives of inland cotton farmers who are deeply threatened by speculative merchants, plans to distribute a large amount of cotton yarn and cloth and "Five Oceans" products to cotton farmers at official prices to stabilize their lives and increase the quantity of cotton purchased, which can be said to be truly in line with my wishes. If it can proceed smoothly, it will not be difficult for Shanghai's textile industry to revive quickly, and other industries will also be revived and increase production. Furthermore, exchange cheap industrial products for cheap agricultural products in rural areas. In this way, internal and external support, urban and rural assistance, the people's livelihood will be stable, and the rear will be consolidated.

(4) Shanghai Chinese stock trading and the stock exchange may be allowed to resume operations, but on the condition that they do not engage in speculation and gambling to stimulate other price increases.

(5) Since the Provisional Regulations of the National Commercial Control Association were published in the newspapers, many Chinese and Japanese merchants have been quite apprehensive, thinking that their activities will be restricted to the smallest possible extent, or even to none. This is actually an unnecessary worry. Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations clearly stipulates that "The National Commercial Control Association shall, in principle, not directly engage in the buying and selling of goods... Commercial organizations that have not joined the National Commercial Control Association shall not obtain the distribution of controlled goods." From this, we can know that although the activities of merchants will be greatly restricted in the future, they have not been completely stopped. However, under the new method, their profits will certainly not be as generous as in the past. Everyone should suffer wartime hardships, and it must be equal. We must never allow a few speculative hoarders to take the opportunity to seek exorbitant profits and make war money. Therefore, in all fairness, Chinese and Japanese merchants have nothing to complain about regarding this new method.

Mr. Takeuchi: This issue also stems from the great transformation of Japan's policy towards China. Because of this, the expectations for the future operation of the Commercial Control Association are very high. Regarding this policy change, the new direction of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation centered on Shanghai, and the issues mentioned by Mr. Li, I would now like to ask Mr. Aoki from the Japanese side to express his views.

Mr. Aoki: From my observation, the war between China and Japan, which has lasted for seven years, is not about to end, is it? It is Japan that is entrusting everything to the Chinese economy and the Chinese government for the sake of China. The return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritoriality, etc., which were eagerly awaited before the incident, are all provided to the National Government. Japan's spirit of righteousness is expressed so clearly and explicitly. Moreover, Japan is doing its utmost to implement these matters. Japan's intention is to make China improve its domestic system. The so-called improvement of China's national system is Japan's consistent policy. Japan's enthusiasm for China's independence is sometimes even misunderstood by the Chinese side. Isn't that the reason for the outbreak of the China Incident? Now, Japan has declared war on Britain and the United States for the sake of liberating the Asian nations. China also follows Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Asian nationalism and declares war. Looking at this environment, I cannot help but forget what disputes there are between China and Japan. Japan's policy in the future will undoubtedly be to assist China in improving its domestic system. As the issue of the purchase and distribution of goods and the abolition of movement restrictions announced today is also an example of its implementation. To put it plainly, the improvement of China's domestic system is to make China's economic people and politicians complete it as their own responsibility, and Japan will wholeheartedly assist them. From this point of view, China's economic people and politicians must at least first devote themselves to devising ways to make the economic machinery in the current peaceful areas run smoothly and make the people live comfortably; secondly, to make the areas under the jurisdiction of the Chongqing government also be affected by it, so that the improvement of the whole of China will gradually be established.

Until now, no matter what, because Japan has war behavior in China, or Japan, although unwilling, has had points that cannot fully meet the wishes of all parties in China due to the inevitability of combat. This is due to the unavoidable reason of Japan's war behavior. This is something that I would like to ask everyone in China to understand. Because of the National Government's participation in the war, for the sake of the Asian nations, the two major independent countries of the East have declared war on the world. We are completely embracing the same belief and rushing forward on the road of co-existence and co-prosperity for the Asian nations. That is, Japan is within the scope of its duties, and China is within the scope of its duties. The two countries mutually enter the era of improving the war participation system.

As mentioned earlier, Japan's policy towards China is nothing more than hoping that China will develop as a respectable independent country in the East. Therefore, what Japan is doing this time is just putting the policies it has previously held into practice. In the future, the Chinese side should unhesitatingly accept Japan's moral heart and proceed with the improvement of all national systems that can be expected to lead to the advancement of an independent country in the East. The first point is to attempt to adjust the economic dynamics. That is, to take stabilizing the lives of the Chinese people in the normal static economic state as the first priority. In order to implement this policy, all aspects of the Chinese financial world must unite and strive towards this great goal. To this end, we Japanese economic people are also very willing to cooperate with you and work hard to establish Japan's trade relations with China. If everything that Japan has now liberated to China is only used by a local economic person's interest behavior, and not used for the huge purpose of urgently improving China's domestic system, then China is simply destroying itself! On this point, Chinese economic people, the press, and politicians must never forget the existence of China, never forget that China and Japan are in the same boat to deal with their Europeans and Americans. It is enough to clearly recognize only this fundamental problem; other trivial matters, China's actions towards the Japanese, or the Japanese's actions towards the Chinese, even if there are mutual grievances and dissatisfaction, are of no great importance.

However, these sound Chinese economic people and sound Japanese economic people, if they truly recognize these situations, will definitely be able to completely correct them. These various conflicting aspects must be eliminated through mutual understanding, and the establishment of a war system is the only task. We Japanese economic people wholeheartedly wish for the complete success of the measures taken by the Japanese government this time. And the Chinese people, for the good political implementation and the good economic progress they have gained as a result, will undoubtedly praise them in the same words, which can be expected. And we Japanese economic people are prepared to wholeheartedly assist them. With such intentions, even if various problems arise in the future, Chinese and Japanese economic people will surely be able to trust each other without suspicion and resolve them on the basis of genuine righteousness.

### Adapting to Citizens' Needs: Edible Oil Universally Sold Throughout the City Starting Today; Four Ounces per Person Calculated Based on Household Population; Purchase Once with Housing Donation Ticket and Distribute Independently; Landlords Must Not Shortchange

The supply of edible oil in this city will be sold based on housing donation tickets starting today, with a stipulated amount of four ounces per person. This is essentially a trial run of rationing oil based on population. However, the purchase method is not based on the edible oil coupons issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council, but is separately stipulated as follows:

Sales Method

Calculate: (1) In the International Settlement (including Hongkou), purchase with winter housing donation tickets and the citizen ID cards of household members. (2) In the French Concession, purchase with November/December housing donation tickets and the residence permits of household members. (Another report: To facilitate residents, the edible oil wholesale depot has specially stipulated that residents may now use the January/February housing donation tickets and the head of household‚Äôs ID card.) (3) In Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, and Pudong, purchase with household registration certificates, house number certificates, and the residence permits of household members. (Those who have not obtained a residence permit may purchase with the application receipt.) Four ounces are sold per person, based on the number of people noted on the back of the housing donation ticket. However, the head of household must combine the total household population to purchase the entire amount at once and distribute it independently. Landlords are absolutely forbidden from shortchanging. Violators will be severely punished. The price is set at 2.55 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per four ounces.

367 Retail Oil Shops

Only soybean oil is sold in this period, totaling over 10,000 dan. The distribution of edible oil will be based on the population of each district's Baojia system. Designated retail oil shops are supplying the edible oil, with a total of 367 shops in the city: 104 in the International Settlement, 66 in the French Concession, 46 in Huxi, 48 in Nanshi, 23 in Pudong, 1 in Longhua, and 79 in Zhabei. Each retail oil shop has a number plate with its assigned number displayed at the entrance. The distribution is universal, and the hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily. Citizens can purchase the full amount from the designated retail oil shop within their Baojia area during this period, so there is no need to rush or crowd. The list of designated retail shops with their addresses has been posted at each shop for citizens' reference. If there are any questions, citizens can inquire at the nearest oil shop.

Rationing to Be Evaluated Based on Results

Regarding the question of when the plan for rationing oil based on population will be implemented, according to a staff member of the allocation section of the wholesale depot speaking to a reporter, this current purchase of oil based on housing donation tickets and calculated by household population is already a trial run of rationing based on population. Formal implementation will depend on the results of this period. Furthermore, it is understood that special allocations of oil to various organizations in the city are currently temporarily suspended. However, police officers in the city and the two settlements will still receive their regular allocation, but in very small quantities.

### 31st Installment of Household Rice on Sale Yesterday; Shortage of Household Rice in Huxi; Public Rice Distribution Office Explains Reasons

Rice shops in the two settlements began selling the 31st installment of household rice yesterday, consisting of half a sheng of broken rice and two sheng of unpolished rice, sold for 7.5 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, and 1.8 jin of number two flour, sold for 3.5 yuan. The sales period for this installment of rations ends on the 9th.

Household Rice in Huxi to Be Distributed Next Week

The Municipal Food Bureau has stipulated and announced the quantity and price of grain rationed per capita in the city in each installment, in order to prevent malfeasance. However, it is reported that designated public rice distribution centers in the central district of Huxi often violate the regulations and change the prices. It is heard that the Food Bureau will order the district governments and public rice distribution offices to comply. A reporter from the Datong News Agency visited the Huxi District Government and the Huxi District Public Rice Distribution Office yesterday to clarify the actual details. It was said that due to certain circumstances in the Huxi district, a shortage in quantity is often found when each installment of household rice is shipped and allocated. Therefore, the amount of household rice distributed in the previous few installments was slightly less by one or two he. However, it is claimed that the selling price is calculated in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Food Bureau, so the selling price varies slightly each period, but this is all due to the rice quantity and there has been no covert raising of prices. It was also learned that 5,650 bags of the 8th installment of household rice for the 22nd two-fang in the Huxi district could have been shipped out this week, but due to procedural reasons, it may be distributed starting next week.

### Pickpocketing Activity Increases Again; Authorities Launch Second Round of Crackdown; Scheduled to Commence Citywide on April 12th; Hoping for Cooperation to Ensure Personal Safety

The English "Times" reports that according to the Chief Inspector of the Police Department speaking to a reporter, the weather is gradually warming up and residents are wearing less clothing, so pickpockets have increased opportunities for activity. Therefore, the Police Department plans to launch a second round of pickpocketing crackdown starting on April 12th.

Previous Campaign Already Effective

It is said that the Police Department, in view of the increase in pickpocketing, launched a crackdown four months ago, and the results were almost as expected. In the past four months, pickpocketing cases in this city have greatly decreased, and the police have found it easier to solve crimes.

Most Thieves Already Released

Most of the thieves have been punished according to the law. These individuals were sentenced to three or four months of imprisonment, while some, who committed more serious offenses or were repeat offenders, were sentenced to six months. It is said that almost all of the pickpockets have now been released from prison, so public order has been newly challenged. The police have been receiving continuous reports of pickpocketing cases every day, so the police have decided to launch a second crackdown.

Police Officers Conduct Close Surveillance

Starting on April 12th, slogans and publicity materials will again be posted in trams, theaters, restaurants, and other public places, warning the public to be aware of the activities of petty thieves. At the same time, the police and Baojia personnel will conduct close surveillance of pickpocketing activities. Once discovered, they will be subject to severe penalties. The Chief Inspector of the Police Department concluded by saying that the scope of pickpocketing activities has expanded, but they are often quickly caught. The public must cooperate to ensure their own safety.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Levies Summer Municipal Tax; Collectors Carry Certificates; In Case of Questions, May Be Reviewed with Collectors

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Tax Bureau is now collecting the summer municipal tax. Collectors are being dispatched separately. It is understood that the collectors are carrying certificates issued by the authorities. If citizens have any questions, they may review them with the collectors.

### Xinzha Baojia District Solicits Second Round of Baojia Funds

The Xinzha District Baojia Committee solicited Baojia funds from the residents of the district once last April, when the Baojia system was first established. However, this was temporary in nature, and the funds would be returned once a base fund was raised. For a year, because the base fund has not been secured, the committee has resolved to solicit a second round of funds from the citizens. The donation books have been distributed by the District Committee to the Lianbao, which will forward them to each Bao for door-to-door solicitation. It is also announced to the Baojia heads that this solicitation of Baojia funds is still voluntary and no coercive action should be taken.

### Smoking Strictly Prohibited for Tram Passengers

For safety reasons, the Shanghai Municipal Council Tram Company authorities strictly prohibit passengers from smoking. If a passenger is found smoking, the ticket seller may stop them. At the same time, the words "No Smoking" have been painted in red inside the carriages to alert passengers.

### Infant Health Competition Finals Tomorrow

The Infant Health Competition Committee, in celebration of Children's Day, held infant physical examinations from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily from March 28th to April 1st for five days, and scheduled the finals to be held at the Nanshi Experimental Public Education Center on Children's Day, April 4th, with awards given on the spot. The time is from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, and a grand occasion is expected.

Yesterday's newspaper publication time was 7:35 AM.

### Short Commentary: Please Read the Overview of Relief Work by the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association

"Poverty" and "sickness" are both painful aspects of life, but being both poor and sick is the most unbearable of all suffering. Those of us who are fortunate enough not to suffer from the torment of poverty and sickness should, with a sense of human mutual aid, put ourselves in the shoes of our poor and sick compatriots and try to find ways to fulfill our duty to alleviate their suffering. The simplest way is to contribute money and entrust a fair organization to centrally handle the relief work.

The establishment of the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association, as can be inferred from its name, was motivated by the aforementioned duty by the founding gentlemen. After its establishment in the early summer of last year, the association presided over and handled emergency relief for epidemics, provided medical care, medicine, clothing, and porridge, and adopted the policy of not directly organizing but doing its best to subsidize established charitable organizations. The responsible personnel within the association are all enthusiastic and fair, fulfilling their duties to the best of their ability, and are very strict and serious in auditing and inspecting, not wasting a penny, taking one point from society and using it for one point in society. This kind of work ethic is indeed worthy of praise and admiration.

However, a close reading of the total amount of donations, compared with the population of Shanghai, would have to be called a failure, which directly affects the weakness of the relief effort. Let's take another look at a certain large restaurant that recently opened on Nanjing Road, which has a monthly turnover of 1.2 million yuan. Truly, a single banquet costs thousands of gold. If we compare these two things, we can see the true face of luxury and parsimony in society. "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road, there are corpses frozen to death" is confirmed here.

The summer season is fast approaching, and we earnestly hope that the association will not plan for a passive end, but will continue to strive actively. With the compassionate desire to save the poor and sick, it is believed that the responsible gentlemen of the association, with their broad minds, will never allow this work to be interrupted.

Today, this newspaper has specially published this long article, "Overview of Relief Work by the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association," in the space of the fourth and fifth editions, while temporarily suspending the Free Talk section, which shows our slight support for this social undertaking. Please readers, understand. Although this article is biased towards reporting on names and figures, from here we can measure the extent to which people from all walks of life support social undertakings, so we hope that readers will read it carefully.

### Economic Affairs

The Municipal Finance Bureau recently received a confidential report that unscrupulous people are extorting water and land transportation and preserved meat taxes in the name of the Bureau. After investigation, the Bureau has no such tax regulations. This is clearly a case of treacherous villains cleverly establishing a name, which is extremely illegal. Therefore, in addition to issuing a general order prohibiting such activities, it also orders the relevant industries to pay attention. If unscrupulous people dare to collect taxes under false pretenses, they should report to the Bureau, which will impose severe penalties.

### Commentary: On Prices

Starting on March 12th, the authorities of our friendly nation, Japan, in order to respect China's sovereignty, specially returned the right to control material resources to our country, so that it could achieve independence and autonomy. In order to control material resources, centralize allocation, and adjust prices, our country's authorities established the National General Association for Commercial Control. It goes without saying that the association will become the highest organ of economic control in an epoch-making way. However, there is one thing that must be said regarding the issue of thoroughly adjusting prices.

Recently, the prices of daily necessities have seemed to turn downward in part due to the strict control and allocation adopted by the authorities, with the black market for white rice being one example. But since grain is the center of the price problem, why are the prices of most daily necessities still higher than they were a month ago? The crux of this matter must be briefly discussed: In fact, the selling price of goods at the retail level must be based on the prices opened by the wholesalers, and the wholesalers are based on the so-called "factory prices" of the manufacturers. Therefore, the fundamental solution to thoroughly adjust prices lies in the unified planning of "prices"; the most reasonable calculation should be made for the costs of the manufacturers (including raw materials) and expenses, etc., and then the most reasonable price should be determined based on this calculation, so that wholesalers and retailers have no excuse or way to raise prices. At the same time, the gradual raising of prices by wholesalers and retailers should be quickly sanctioned, and the excessive purchase of goods by anyone should be strictly restricted. This is a stopgap measure. As for the fundamental solution, the fundamental is indeed more important than the stopgap, but the stopgap and the fundamental should be implemented in a complementary manner.

### Morning Business Organizations in the City to Be Under the Jurisdiction of the Food Bureau

Shanghai News from the Central News Agency: After the official reorganization and establishment of the Municipal Food Bureau, the internal structure and personnel allocation of the Bureau have been adjusted separately. According to reporters' inquiries, the first, second, and third sections of the Bureau are responsible for promoting the administrative work of the Bureau, with two sections set up under each section. The Secretariat has three sections: document, general affairs, and accounting. The Food Allocation Office has three sections in the first group: regulation, allocation certificate, and procurement. The second group has three sections: public rice distribution, warehousing, and transportation. The third group has three sections: sugar, oil, and miscellaneous grains. It is also heard that the Donggou Farm and Forestry Experimental Area in the urban area, the Donggou Agricultural Improvement Area, and the Zhenru Agricultural Improvement Area will also be placed under the jurisdiction of the Bureau because they are related to agricultural production matters, so that they can engage in supervision and increase urban agricultural production.

### General Commercial Control Association to Close Yarn and Cloth Registration; Today Is the Last Day

Shanghai News from the Central News Agency: The National General Commercial Control Association entrusted the Joint Association of Cotton Mills, the Yarn Industry Association, the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association to handle the registration of cotton yarn and cloth inventory. The original deadline was March 31st, and the registration was also handled by the Japanese Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Later, the Chinese Chambers of Commerce jointly submitted a letter stating that the number of people requesting registration was too large at one time and they were unable to complete the registration within the time limit, requesting an extension of three days. Therefore, in order to take care of the interests of the holders, the inventory registration date has been extended to today (3rd) at 4:00 PM. No further extensions will be granted beyond this limit. Therefore, there is still one day for registration today. It is hoped that all yarn and cloth holders will hurry to the designated agencies to complete the registration procedures and not wait and see and delay themselves.

### Local Financial Authority Explains the Exchange Rate Between Central Reserve Bank Notes and Allied Bank Notes

Shanghai News from the Central News Agency: According to reporters' inquiries with local financial authorities yesterday, there is no problem with the exchange ratio between Allied Bank Notes and Central Reserve Bank Notes in substance. The high-flying situation in the market today (i.e., the 2nd) is not without merchants and civilians misunderstanding the various reasons, and being disturbed by the instigation of the general market manipulators. The relationship between military scrip and Allied Bank Notes is a special kind of linkage, so military scrip and Allied Bank Notes are circulated at the same value in North China. Now that the new issuance of military scrip has been stopped in Central and South China, the exchange between currencies in North China and Central and South China should be based on Allied Bank Notes and Central Reserve Bank Notes as the exchange unit. In substance, the value of Central Reserve Bank Notes has not changed in Central and South China, and there is no difference in value even in North China. The smooth circulation of materials is still the main factor in the various stages. Moreover, Allied Bank Notes have not yet been used as a medium for purchasing materials in Central and South China, so Central Reserve Bank Notes and Allied Bank Notes are only in a direct exchange relationship and there is no substantial conflict. If there is no inducement from speculators, there is no reason for volatility in the minds of legitimate businesses.

### All Banks and Money Exchanges Closed for Three Days Starting Today

Today (3rd) is the Spring Festival holiday. As usual, all banks and money exchanges in the city will be closed for the Spring Festival for three days from the 3rd. The 6th will be a make-up day because the 4th is a regular Sunday holiday. It is heard that the Material Movement Permit Office of the National General Commercial Control Association will also be closed for one day today (3rd).

### This Month's Industry and Commerce in the City More Developed Than the Previous Two Months

It is learned that the number of newly opened industries and businesses in the city this month (March) includes eighteen banks, ten money exchanges, two property enterprise companies, one department store, two preserved meat shops, and one restaurant, totaling forty-seven. In addition, there are two companies that have resumed operations.

Industry and Commerce More Developed Last Month

One battery factory and one money exchange have closed down. In addition, a total of nine money exchange enterprises were founded and established in the past month. Compared with January and February, the situation of opening and establishing businesses this month is significantly more developed. According to statistics, two new banks were opened in January, seven money exchanges, and eight insurance companies and enterprise companies. Fifteen new banks were opened in February, ten money exchanges, and ten insurance and enterprise companies.

Development Has Reached Its Peak Only in the first half of this month were most of the new banks, money exchanges, and enterprises opened. Very few new banks and money exchanges were opened in the second half of the month. Therefore, the development of industry and commerce in the city reached its peak in the first ten days of this month.

Chen, director of the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch, stated that Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and its relationship to the national economy and people's livelihood is extremely important. As the second phase of Qingxiang work begins, in order to strengthen wartime economic construction and improve the people's livelihood in the Qingxiang area, an economic office has been specially established to handle all economic matters in the Qingxiang area, and it officially began operations on April 1st.

### Deliberations on the Implementation of Commercial Control (3)

‚Äî Gao Maoxun

(4) Eliminate the Buying and Selling of Factory Slips The above-mentioned warehouse slips are enough to promote speculation, help hoarding, and undermine control. This is the situation after shipment. If before shipment, there are orders placed with manufacturers and the manufacturers issue factory slips, the issuance of such factory slips allows manufacturers to record less than the actual shipment, and at the same time, they can transfer and sell them for speculation, hoarding, and undermining control. This is similar to warehouse slips in terms of having different effects from the same source. Therefore, in order to control materials, in addition to implementing warehouse management, it is also necessary to eliminate the buying and selling of factory slips. The establishment of a unifying permanent inventory system is for the control of materials in terms of quantity. Warehouse management and the elimination of the buying and selling of factory slips are for the control of materials in terms of physical objects. The two are like shadows following their forms, and neither can be neglected. If they can be implemented simultaneously, then manipulation and hoarding will have no way to use their skills.

What has been said above may be difficult to implement in reality at present. There are two reasons for this: (1) Talents are not easy to recruit, and (2) human emotions are not easy to reject. Regarding the first point, there is a greater shortage of senior statistical accounting talents than before the incident, and we should immediately recruit them in various ways to specialize in planning and guiding the implementation. As for the low-level personnel engaged in mechanical work, we can recruit some students who have studied statistics and accounting and have some warehouse experience, give them short-term training, and they can be employed. Regarding the second point, paying attention to private interests and not being willing to enforce the law is a common problem of our country's citizens. Therefore, it is most worrying to manage control in a way that is autonomous by merchants. I humbly believe that if this kind of concept cannot be resolutely eliminated, it fundamentally violates the spirit of control. The object of control is material resources, those controlled are merchants and civilians, those who feel inconvenienced are merchants, and those who look forward to obtaining benefits are civilians. Benefiting the people is the way to benefit the country. This is the highest goal of implementing control. As the ancients said, "Why cry in one family when you can cry on the road?" Understanding this is enough to talk about control. Based on this, control must be based on academic theory and framed by laws and regulations. If it is mixed with the concept of personal interests, narrow sympathy, avoiding difficulties and seeking ease, in order to cater to the psychology of accumulated evils, and only focus on the issuance of permits, it seems to lose the original meaning of controlled economy. If this article by yours truly can arouse the consideration of the responsible authorities and the research of academic experts to conduct further deliberations, so that a strong and effective method of controlled economy can be established, it would not only be the good fortune of academics, but also the blessing of the people.

Now, the subsidy periods of the above-mentioned charitable organizations have successively expired, and prices are increasing daily, making it increasingly difficult for the general poor and sick compatriots to maintain themselves and making relief more urgent. They have successively sent letters requesting the Association to continue subsidizing them to overcome the difficulties. However, the Association has already distributed all the donations it has received and finds it extremely difficult to cope. It sincerely hopes that the leaders of various trade associations in the city and charitable people from all walks of life will promptly donate to support this good cause, so that this only fundraising group in the city and the surviving well-managed charitable organizations will not be interrupted.
