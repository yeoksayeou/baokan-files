### Further Discussion on the Living Problems of Civil Servants

The increasingly serious living problems of civil servants, and their significant impact on national politics and social customs, need no further elaboration. The necessity of improving the lives of civil servants, and its importance, seems to have been recognized by all parties. The current problem is how to improve the lives of civil servants, demanding concrete measures and effective implementation. Regarding these issues, we offer further suggestions, earnestly hoping that the relevant authorities will study them and find the most appropriate solution to the current problems.

First, based on past facts, the relevant government authorities have paid considerable attention to the difficulties in the lives of ordinary civil servants, and have tried to improve them, such as repeatedly increasing the multiplier of living allowances and the Executive Yuan's decision on a system of material remuneration. However, there are several fundamental issues that must be studied and reformed first: (1) Is the civil servant salary system appropriate? The national legislation on civil servant salaries has always been a hierarchical system, partly inheriting the old practices of official salaries of past dynasties and partly referring to the systems of advanced countries. However, the former has time differences between the past and the present, and the latter has different national conditions in space. Especially due to the development of the current world war, if fundamental considerations are not made on the system, then all "improvement" measures will inevitably be far from reality and will not achieve the expected results. What we want the authorities to consider fundamentally is to address the objective wartime environment (mainly the gradual decline in currency purchasing power, the increase in material consumption and the gradual reduction in its supply, and the inevitable gradual rise in prices), and to formulate a wartime salary system that is most appropriate for the times, based on the different political and economic conditions of the country and various regions. The authorities' decision to implement a payment-in-kind system is a good method, but it must be determined appropriately in time and place to achieve practical results. (2) Is the problem of civil servant salary increases. Before the most appropriate and accurate system is established, to meet the urgent needs, a temporary measure of increasing salaries should be implemented first. Whether the previous increases have actually benefited the lives of civil servants is questionable, and this method needs to be adjusted. The real meaning of increasing salaries is not to maintain the relationship between the authorities and their subordinates, but to enable civil servants to concentrate on public service without worrying about their livelihood. If increasing salaries is only a negligible amount in practice, it will not only fail to solve the problem, but also cast a shadow on the psychology of every civil servant, and it will only reduce the civil servant's prestige for the government and enthusiasm for work. Therefore, we firmly believe that if we do not mention increasing salaries, then so be it; once we mention increasing, we must effectively solve the actual difficulties in the lives of civil servants. The above two points are the basic principles for improving the material lives of civil servants.

Second, from the perspective of improving the material lives of civil servants, the civil servants we are talking about are relatively broad, that is, all those whose work directly or indirectly promotes national policies and laws, and whose service departments have national, social, and public characteristics. From government agencies, the military, the police, culture and education, to the staff of important economic sectors, who live on fixed salaries, can be said to be civil servants. Due to the disparity in the ranks and status of various civil servants, due to the differences in service departments and their salaries, due to the different living conditions in different regions and periods, and even more due to the different family burdens of each civil servant, the improvement methods cannot be completely uniform. Therefore, what we want to suggest is that the authorities adopt differential methods, and the focus should be on genuine fairness and practical improvement. As for the standards of differentiation, they should be: (1) In order to improve administrative efficiency or work effectiveness, for civil servants in particularly important departments, for specialists and genuine talents that the country particularly lacks, and for those who actually have work to do and do it well, the most superior improvement conditions should be given, which also includes the meaning of encouraging specialized talents and work competition. However, those whose original material lives can be maintained are better given honorary treatment, and there is no need to increase their salaries. (2) In order to demand that improvements are practical, we repeatedly propose the method of basing on the minimum cost of living index in various regions. From the facts, the current minimum cost of living index in various regions, that is, the labor cost of living index, has increased from at least 100 to 3,372 or more compared to the pre-incident year of the 25th year of the Republic (according to the Shanghai Municipal Council's index in November last year). In fact, there is of course a greater increase today, but considering the salaries of any civil servant, almost none have increased from 100 yuan to more than ten times. The serious focus of the civil servant's life we are talking about lies here, and the reason why we advocate the method of improving the lives of civil servants based on the price index also lies here. Otherwise, the problem will never be solved! This rate of salary increase may increase the difficulties for the authorities, but, more practically speaking, even if salaries are increased based on the cost of living index, it is still not very thorough, and it is always behind the actual figure of the cost of living, because the cost of living index is already the actual performance of at least the past month, and the rate of salary increase is at least for a number of days or even a year in the future!

As for the authorities' difficulty in increasing expenditures, we should also have thorough consideration, but it should be noted that the differential standards we require also have the following conditions, namely (1) the old salary system and official system originally had many that were not in line with the times and wasted national funds. After the implementation of universal improvement of civil servant treatment, this old system will of course be eliminated. In any agency and department, it is not allowed to have the phenomenon of receiving dry salary without doing anything, and it is absolutely not allowed to have the phenomenon of holding concurrent positions and receiving concurrent salaries or holding concurrent positions without receiving concurrent salaries but receiving public funds. In this way, a large amount of floating expenses can be saved and used to increase the salaries of necessary civil servants. (2) Increasing salaries is mainly for civil servants who cannot maintain the minimum living standards for themselves and their families, especially for middle and lower-level civil servants, soldiers, police, and teachers; as for senior personnel, or those with fewer family burdens, their increase should also be relatively reduced. However, we can say truthfully that there are no people who bring money to become officials, at least there are few, and according to the current cost of living index and the actual situation in the Chinese officialdom, the salaries of senior civil servants also feel insufficient. This insufficiency only has a difference in degree compared to middle and lower levels. In order to truly improve administrative efficiency and rectify the political atmosphere, their salaries must still have necessary increases.

### The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday The War Results of the Army Air Force Assisting Ground Troops in Combat in Jiangnan Shot Down More Than 100 Enemy Aircraft in Eastern India

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 p.m. today: (1) In China, the Imperial Army's Air Force cooperated with the ground troops in the Jiangnan campaign, and the damage inflicted on enemy aircraft as of June 6 was as follows: 17 shot down, 22 enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground. During this period, the damage to our aircraft was a total of four self-explosions. (2) In Burma, the Imperial Army Air Force continued to carry out offensive operations against eastern India. From May 1 to June 5, the damage inflicted on enemy aircraft was as follows: 63 shot down, 40 enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground. During this period, the damage to our aircraft was a total of nine self-explosions and non-returns, and 24 seriously injured.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Recently, the elite Japanese air force has continued to launch courageous and decisive attacks to cooperate with the Japanese army in the operations in China and the Indo-Burmese border, destroying enemy military facilities, airfields, and important bases of the British and American air forces. It has also attacked Kunming, Chongqing, Jian'ou, Chittagong, India, and other base bases of the British and American air forces, giving them thorough blows. The Japanese Imperial Headquarters now announced the great war results of the new army air force cooperating with the Japanese army ground troops in Hunan, Hubei, and Arakan, Burma. In the operations in the Hunan and Hubei areas, a total of 39 enemy aircraft were shot down as of June 6. In the operations in Burma, a total of 130 enemy aircraft were shot down from May 1 to June 5. Among them, when the Japanese army launched the Hunan and Hubei operations on the Chinese front, the Japanese army aircraft launched fierce air battles near the combat area. As of June 5, × Chongqing aircraft had been shot down, and three were shot down by shore-based artillery fire. Then, on the 6th, it attacked Liangshan, Sichuan, and Enshi, Hubei. The Japanese aircraft's surprise attack on Liangshan was completely successful. Twenty Chongqing aircraft, ten supply vehicles, and five freight vehicles on the ground in Hubei were all hit and burned. Also, when the Japanese aircraft attacked Enshi in this battle, the bombs hit the runway and thoroughly destroyed it. They fought with seven Chongqing aircraft and shot down one of them. Also, in the Indo-Burmese border area, the British and Indian troops attempted to launch a counter-offensive again before the rainy season due to the failure of the previous Arakan operation, so they repeatedly sent aircraft to launch guerrilla warfare. The Japanese air force met them head-on and dealt them heavy blows, sometimes actively attacking, and breaking the enemy aircraft's attempt to move in advance each time. At present, Chongqing is on the verge of crisis in terms of military and financial affairs, and since Pang Bingxun, commander of the 24th Army Group of Chongqing, Rong Ziheng, deputy commander of the 112th Division, and other anti-Japanese generals have successively participated in the peace movement, the combat power of the anti-Japanese camp in Chongqing has been greatly reduced. According to recent news, Chongqing is aware that it will face a major crisis this winter, so it urgently hopes that Britain and the United States will provide assistance as soon as possible, in an attempt to continue the futile anti-Japanese war, but the Japanese army will resolutely and thoroughly destroy this act of being a traitor in East Asia.

They placed infinite hope on the backbone of the new air force in this issue. It lasted for half an hour before it was completed, and then a recreational performance was held.

### Chairman Wang's Speech

The original text of Chairman Wang's speech read by Chen Changzu is as follows: Today, the first class of aviation students of the Air Force Training Corps held a graduation ceremony. I, the Chairman, am deeply gratified, and I would like to say a few words to encourage all the graduates. All military personnel should be loyal and trustworthy, and contribute everything to the country in order to complete the great cause of peace, anti-communism, and national construction, and shoulder the mission of reviving China and defending East Asia. This should be consistently followed by military personnel of the army, navy, and air force. Speaking of the air force, the responsibility of our comrades is even greater. Recalling that in the tenth year of the Republic, the father of the nation repeatedly instructed the air force to save the country, and it has been more than twenty years since then, and the Chinese air force is still in its infancy. Every time I think about it, I feel frightened. Since returning to the capital, thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of friendly countries, we can see the lineup of today's new air force. Now, the first class of aviation students has completed their preliminary studies in a short period of two years, forming the strongest foundation of the air force. There is hope in sight, and I am deeply happy. The current task of the military is, first, to be able to recognize the mission of the times, and it must be known how to work hard in their respective positions. The above-mentioned great cause and mission have become more and more significant since the start of the Greater East Asia War and our country's official participation in the war. All our military personnel should firmly believe that we should combine the three mentalities of loving our country, loving friendly countries, and loving East Asia into one, so that we can complete the task of the present era. Be worthy of being a military man of the present era. In terms of the air force, the most important thing is to strengthen the awareness of building a new air force. We must know that it is extremely urgent to restore the material equipment of the air force, and the spiritual training is even more important. We must first have the spirit of diamond and a hundred refinements, and then we can create the great cause of diamond and a hundred refinements. There are three points that should be noted in this regard: (1) We should constantly train, and every military man must be able to implement every word of the training regulations for military men of the army, navy, and air force. (2) We should eliminate the past individualistic and factional wrong ideas of the air force, and take one doctrine as the center and wholeheartedly serve the country. (3) We should cultivate the spirit of bravery, diligence, hard work, and endurance, and be able to undertake the most difficult and greatest work, and be competent and happy. The above three points are the essential elements for creating a cadre of the new air force. The graduation of the students today is only the completion of one stage of the school year. Time is limited and knowledge is endless. Especially at the time when the Greater East Asia War is progressing, the knowledge and skills that all military personnel should use are hundreds of times more than in the past, so we should be new every day and keep pace with the times. I deeply hope that the students will be awed by the severity of the situation, feel the greatness of the burden, and strive for progress with their sincerity. Every morning and evening, we will not forget it in every meal, so that we can lay the foundation for the construction of the new air force and fulfill the responsibilities that should be fulfilled in the Greater East Asia War. I have deep hopes.

### The Japanese Army in North China Announced a War Situation

Beijing, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese North China Dispatch Army announced at 5 p.m. on the 8th the main war situation in May as follows. The Japanese army in North China has become more and more closely connected with Japan's policy of cooperating with China, and its combat power has been further enhanced. After May, it has exerted the true spirit of the field army, thoroughly and fiercely attacking the Chongqing army in the entire North China, and smashing the false propaganda made by Chongqing that it would win in two years and that the Japanese army would withdraw from North China. In particular, the Japanese army's Taihang Mountain operation this spring gave the Chongqing communist army a great blow in both material and spiritual terms. The total offensive against Japan that Chongqing had advertised to this point was completely in vain, and now the Chongqing army is only avoiding clashes with the Japanese army and preserving its remaining strength in remote areas. The main operations in May can be described as follows. (1) In Hebei Province, the Japanese army began a fierce offensive in mid-April in order to destroy the communist army base in the northern Taihang Mountains. In the Jixi operation, it fiercely attacked the Chongqing army that had fled into the Taihang Mountains. In May, it formed an encirclement, defeated the combat power of the communist army, and separately encircled and annihilated them, and crushed various facilities and secret organizations of its guerrilla base. In addition, the Japanese army launched a sweeping battle against the remaining communist army in the "Tianjin-Bohai Special Administrative Region." Since mid-May, it has cooperated with the government's army and police to carry out skillful encirclement and suppression, and gradually promote the work of cooperation between China and Japan to suppress the communists. The communist army in eastern Hebei and northern Pingbei has been on the verge of collapse due to repeated fierce attacks by the Japanese army. It has lost its will to fight before the pressure of the Japanese army and has fallen into a state of scattering and lurking. (2) In Shandong Province, the Japanese army closely cooperated with the Shandong Army commanded by General Wu Huawen, who had surrendered and was in the peace movement, against the Chongqing-Lu-Su War Zone Headquarters and the 51st Army Headquarters, the 104th Division, etc., which were based in the northwest of Yishui in central Shandong Province. In mid-May, they launched a fierce offensive under the joint air and land forces. The Chongqing army left about 4,000 corpses and prisoners, and was given a fatal blow. (3) In Shanxi Province, the Japanese army began the Taihang Mountain operation in late April in order to destroy the Chongqing-Communist armies that were based in the border area of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces. In ten days, it brought the main force of the 24th Army Group of Chongqing to its death. Generals Pang Bingxun, Commander of the 14th Army Group, and Sun Dianying, Commander of the Newly Organized 5th Army, then took the lead in participating in the peace movement. As a result, the last stronghold of the Chongqing army in North China was completely destroyed. In the later stage of this operation, the Japanese army turned north and fiercely attacked the headquarters of the 18th Army Group, the command center of the Chongqing-Communist army, and the army group of Liu Bocheng's troops, pushing and breaking through their group strength and thoroughly reducing the facilities of their bases.

Jinan, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to Japanese army information: "Qi Zixiu, commander of the 6th District Security Team" of Chongqing-Lu Province, previously led 30,000 of his subordinates in an attempt to move in the Donglin Road area of Shandong Province, and forcibly conscripted able-bodied men and grain, etc. Each unit of the Japanese army began to take action at dawn on May 31 in order to destroy them, and launched a surprise attack. When they surrounded the so-called headquarters of the Communist Party in Gaozhuang, and other strongholds, they dealt a fatal blow to them. By the evening of the 3rd, the confirmed war results were 2,967 prisoners, 238 enemy corpses abandoned, and a large number of spoils of victory were seized.

Kaifeng, 8th (Central News Agency) - The comprehensive war results obtained by the elite troops of the Japanese army in Henan Province last month are as follows: 111 operations, 4,575 Chongqing army troops, 653 Chongqing army corpses abandoned, 383 prisoners, 5 heavy machine guns seized, 9 light machine guns, 258 rifles, 9,399 bullets, and countless other military supplies.

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch: He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs of the Chongqing government, reported on the recent war situation on the mainland at the Second Production Conference in Chongqing on the 7th. At the time, he tried his best to cover up the facts, saying that this was only a fabrication of propaganda by the Japanese side, and that Commander Pang and Army Commander Sun were captured by the Japanese army due to a temporary personal relationship. From this, it can be seen how deeply embarrassed Chongqing is. He went on to explain the summer offensive launched by the Japanese army in the Hunan and Hubei areas, saying that the offensive of the Japanese army was extremely fierce at the beginning, so the Chongqing army suffered considerable blows, but later, due to proper command and the deployment of American aircraft, the Japanese army was severely damaged and the original situation was restored. After that, the victory of the Chongqing army was used to cover up the defeat of the Chongqing army by referring to the restoration of the original situation of the Japanese army. This kind of false propaganda by the Chongqing side was immediately self-defeating. According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 7th, the military authorities in Chongqing said that the combat effectiveness and quality of the Chongqing army in this battle in the Yangtze River basin were obviously low, so it was decided to change the policy on reorganizing the troops, that is, to change from emphasizing quantity to emphasizing quality.

### Vice Minister Chen of the Ministry of Finance Discussed the Current Status of Various Tax Revenues

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Finance held a regular meeting with newspaper reporters at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (8th). Vice Minister Chen of the Ministry of Finance personally met with Chinese and Japanese reporters and answered questions from the reporters on the spot. Various issues related to the tax revenue situation in our country were released. The summary is recorded below: "The main income of the Ministry of Finance now is (1) salt tax, (2) customs duty, (3) unified tax, (4) special tax, of which the unified tax revenue is the most. We are currently trying to promote the increase in customs tax revenue, because most of the current customs tax regulations are ad valorem taxes. It seems unreasonable to still do so when prices are high, so we are now planning to change to ad valorem tax collection. Regarding the salt tax, the previous monthly income was 7 million yuan, but after the efforts of the authorities to rectify the salt-producing areas such as Su, Huai, and eastern Zhejiang, the total tax revenue for the next month is expected to increase to more than 10 million yuan. As for the income tax, it was only more than 1.5 million yuan per month when it was first levied, and now it has reached more than 5 million yuan per month, which has made significant progress. The results of other transit tax revenues are very good. Since the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Industry, and the General Association for Commercial Control have actively worked to deal with the price policy, prices have become more stable. However, the recent rise in prices in the market is due to the Dragon Boat Festival. It is expected that it will be restored within a day. Regarding the current status of industry, the Ministry of Finance has discussed with various banks in Shanghai to handle loans, so that the banks can provide appropriate loans to various legitimate businesses under the assistance and guidance of the Ministry of Finance. However, in terms of the current situation, there seems to be no problem with the capital for revitalizing various light industries and handicrafts. Also, the lack and inconvenience of materials and transportation capacity are currently being worked hard to improve, and the Bank of Communications has now launched loans in the interior, which will greatly benefit the encouragement of handicrafts and light industries in the interior.

### Specific Items of the Japan-Germany Clearing Payment Regulations Signed Yesterday - Demonstrating Close Financial Cooperation Between the Two Countries

Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: After Japan and Germany signed an economic agreement and payment regulations on January 20th of this year, it was decided that the Yokohama Specie Bank's Berlin branch (Japanese side) and the East Asia Bank's Tokyo branch (German side) would be the implementing agencies, responsible for the direct clearing of Yen and Mark. At the same time, relevant authorities from both countries continued negotiations in Tokyo on the specific items of the agreement between the two banks to implement the payment regulations. Now, opinions have been completely unified, and at noon on the 8th, the president of the Yokohama Specie Bank and Mr. Rosenberg, representative of the German East Asia Bank, formally signed the agreement at the Tokyo branch of the Specie Bank. Therefore, with the establishment of this agreement between the two banks, the direct clearing of Yen and Mark can proceed smoothly. The clearing method between the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and other economic zones has now been established. It is expected that the overall transactions and technological exchanges between the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the European economic zone will be further promoted. Furthermore, at the time when the two banks signed the agreement, an official from the Japanese Ministry of Finance issued a statement saying: "On January 20th of this year, Japan and Germany concluded an agreement on economic cooperation and attached regulations. Today, the Yokohama Specie Bank and the German East Asia Bank have also signed an agreement on payment. I am extremely pleased. Clearing between Japan and Germany has been extremely smooth in the past. With the establishment of this agreement, the direct clearing method of Yen and Mark will definitely become smoother. After the establishment of this new agreement, it will contribute greatly to the establishment of a clearing method for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere with areas outside the sphere. At the same time, as a demonstration of the close financial cooperation between Japan and Germany, I believe it can promote the trade and technical cooperation between the two economic zones."

### Ramirez Succeeds as President - Argentina Still Maintains Neutrality - General Rawson Steps Down to Facilitate Cabinet Formation - New Government Officials Sworn in the Day Before

Buenos Aires, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: General Ramirez declared: Argentina will not tolerate foreign interference and will maintain its neutral policy towards foreign countries. The new government's message is as follows: "The Argentine Republic will fulfill its traditional friendship and faithful cooperation with other American countries in accordance with all existing agreements. As for the rest of the world, it will temporarily maintain a neutral policy. The interim government believes that in the current situation, it is particularly important to uphold the principle of its absolute autonomy and to allow the provinces to organize autonomous governments in any way. Since the Argentine people have decided to maintain their republican system in accordance with their constitution, foreign interference cannot be tolerated.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: General Rawson, after assuming the presidency on the 4th through a military revolution, stepped down only 28 hours later on the dawn of the 7th and was succeeded by General Ramirez. It is rumored that Rawson stepped down due to conflicts with various parties regarding foreign policy opinions. According to well-informed sources, the leadership of the revolutionary regime discussed foreign policy all night on the 6th. General Rawson advocated practicing Americanism and supporting the anti-Axis side, but other cabinet members unanimously opposed it. Therefore, it was decided that General Ramirez would succeed as president, as he advocates a neutral and Argentine autonomous policy.

Lisbon, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: According to a telegram from Buenos Aires, Argentina, the Argentine interim government issued the following announcement on the morning of the 7th: 1. General Rawson resigned as president, and General Ramirez succeeded as president. 2. The swearing-in ceremony of the new government, scheduled for the 7th, has been postponed. The domestic situation in Argentina has taken a sharp turn due to this revolution, so rumors about the new government are rampant. Although the surface is extremely calm, the inside seems very shaken. It is rumored that a unit of General Rawson's troops is advancing towards the capital from La Plata, 35 miles from Buenos Aires, due to conflicts in opinions between Ramirez and Rawson. Although the Argentine government has denied these rumors, public sentiment has not yet stabilized.

### Full List of the New Government

Buenos Aires, Argentina, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: The Argentine new government, led by General Ramirez, was sworn in at 6:00 PM yesterday. The full list is as follows: President General Ramirez, Vice President Rear Admiral Sa Saero, Minister of Interior Colonel Gilbert, Minister of Foreign Affairs Rear Admiral Storni, Minister of Economy Marina, Minister of Agriculture General Mason, Minister of Army General Farrell, Minister of Navy Rear Admiral Benito Sevi, Minister of Public Utilities Admiral Grintes, Minister of Justice Colonel Anaya. According to Reuters, the cabinet reshuffle of the Argentine new government was due to differences in opinion on foreign policy between General Rawson and some cabinet members, as some cabinet members did not agree with his pro-anti-Axis and Pan-American attitude. According to well-informed sources in Uruguay's capital, Ramirez is in favor of a neutral policy. Furthermore, the Argentine radio station announced last night that President Ramirez has no intention of resigning and that the troops have expressed their support in maintaining order.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: General Ramirez declared to cabinet members and representatives of the navy and army today: "May God help me perform my duties, and I hope for national cooperation in order to implement my peaceful construction work." He strongly urged his people not to believe the rumors spread by the opposition revolutionaries. The so-called opposition refers to the left-leaning extremist parties and other frustrated politicians. General Rawson's sudden resignation was for the sake of facilitating the formation of a satisfactory cabinet. The President then gave a speech to the public in the May Market outside the government building. The crowd applauded and was extremely enthusiastic.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: Many senior officials of the city government, including Mayor Pan Laiteng, have resigned. Mayor Pan has served for 40 years. In addition, the managers of traffic, sanitation, and refrigeration businesses, as well as the manager of the Tie Jieluo Aige Lun Cinema, have also resigned. The new government is currently issuing strict orders to control food and rubber in order to prevent hoarding and adjust the entire economic life. All municipal offices are heavily guarded by the military.

### After the Collective Resignation of the Chilean Cabinet - A New Government Declared Established - The Minister of Defense and the Minister of Interior Concurrently Serve as the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army and Navy

Buenos Aires, Argentina, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: According to a telegram from Santiago, the Chilean cabinet had previously scheduled a cabinet meeting for 5:00 PM on the 7th to discuss the current state of the political situation.

The list of the Chilean new cabinet is as follows: President and Prime Minister Li Oqi, Minister of Foreign Affairs Fu Na Shaozi, Minister of Interior Admiral Alade, Minister of Finance, Economy and Commerce Betegraer (reappointed), Minister of Defense General Odalola, Minister of Public Works and Transportation Basque Nen, Minister of Justice Quiga Du (reappointed), Minister of Education Marshall, Minister of Labor Bustos (reappointed), Minister of Agriculture Serrano, Minister of Public Health Dr. Li Wo, Minister of Colonization Langes, Minister of Defense Odalola concurrently serves as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and Minister of Interior Alade concurrently serves as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy.

### Fierce Battles Between German and Soviet Forces in the Donets River Area

Stockholm, Sweden, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: The Soviet army launched three offensives in the Kuban bridgehead area, consuming a great deal of combat power, and is no longer able to launch large-scale offensives. On the 7th, they attempted to recapture a high ground northwest of Krymskaya, but only launched a weak offensive, which was repelled by concentrated German artillery fire. The Soviet army still seems to be planning a counterattack. According to frontline news from the German News Agency, the Soviet High Command ordered powerful units in the Kursk area to reinforce the Kuban area. At present, fierce battles are taking place between the German and Soviet forces along the Donets River front. It is noteworthy that the offensives are often launched by the German army. At the same time, the German air force in the northern front echoed the units that bombed Gorky, fiercely bombing Leningrad, causing great damage to its tank and aircraft factories. They also bombed the Moscow-Arkhangelsk railway, the key transportation hubs of Lovacki, east of Kharkov, and northwest of Sc, causing great damage to the Soviet army's corps, fuel depots, ammunition depots, and transport trains.

### French Government Announces Establishment of New Regular Army

Vichy, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: The French government recently announced that it has decided to form a new French army with draftees conscripted in 1942, directly under the command of Chief Laval. Since the establishment of the German-French armistice agreement, France has had no regular army. Although a militia was formed in February centered on veterans, this is the first time that a regular army has been officially formed.

Paris, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: According to German news reports, Vichy newspapers reported that the first batch of French regular army units, totaling 3,000 men divided into three companies, will be stationed in a province in central France.

### US Army Chief of Staff Marshall Returns to Washington - Eden Meets with Soviet and US Ambassadors for Long Talks - Britain and the United States Continue Propaganda for Attacking Europe

Lisbon, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: According to a telegram from Washington, US Army Chief of Staff Marshall returned to Washington on the 7th after participating in important military talks in North Africa.

Lisbon, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: According to a telegram from London, British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky and US Ambassador Winant yesterday for long talks. Diplomatic circles in London believe that Eden informed the Soviet and US ambassadors of the discussions he and Churchill had in North Africa.

Stockholm, Sweden, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: The Haithong News Agency reports that the British press continued to wage psychological warfare against the Axis powers yesterday, exaggerating Roosevelt and Churchill's decision at the Washington conference to launch a large-scale attack on Europe. One news item stated: "The unprecedentedly largest anti-Axis combat organization, assisted by aircraft, warships, transport ships, and assault boats, can launch an attack on Europe with three million troops in a matter of days or even hours." From the broadcasts of American radio stations, it can also be seen that the United States is equally nervous. Many American radio commentators have hinted at an imminent attack on Europe, with one even saying: "The time has come." According to the London Times, "Churchill's main purpose in visiting North Africa was to conduct a final inspection of preparations for launching an attack on the Axis fortress. The attack on Europe can only be seen as the greatest undertaking in military history." The News Chronicle reported: "The most important result of Churchill's discussions will soon be the implementation of a vast land, sea, and air war." However, there are also warnings, saying that the defense of Europe will be undertaken with great suffering by an unyielding enemy, so easy victory cannot be expected. Even The Times stated: "Since the Battle of Dunkirk, Britain has faced the most dangerous stage of the war, but the coming war may be the longest, most difficult, and require the greatest sacrifices."

### Philippine Secretary of the Interior Assassinated - Japanese Prime Minister Sends Condolences - Official Report Says Laurel's Life Not in Danger

Manila, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: Philippine Secretary of the Interior Laurel was shot and wounded by a rogue assailant with a pistol from behind while exercising at the Wack Wack Golf Club here at around 7:00 AM on the 5th.

Upon learning of this, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo sent a telegram of condolence, which was greatly appreciated by Philippine Administrative Director Vargas and other key figures. Furthermore, the Philippine Administrative Government issued a statement on the afternoon of the 7th, saying: "Secretary of the Interior Laurel's condition has improved, and doctors believe that there is a good chance of a full recovery. His life does not seem to be in danger at present."

### Current Status of Malayan Industries

Shonan, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: It has been a year and a half since the implementation of military administration in Malaya. During this time, thanks to the efforts of the military administration authorities, there has been rapid development in all aspects. Malayan rubber production accounts for seven-tenths of the world's total rubber production, so it is not an exaggeration to say that Malaya is completely located in a rubber forest. Because trade with various countries in the world has been cut off, digesting this large amount of rubber has become an important issue for Malaya. For this purpose, the Japanese military administration established a rubber liquefaction plant in Lanka. The liquefaction work of the plant is still small in scale, mainly because everything is still difficult at the beginning of its establishment. It can be asserted that it will develop into a large-scale industry in the future. Therefore, the digestion of this rubber is a major turning point in the field of oil production. Regarding the issue of increasing food production, Malaya's food production is not very abundant due to the scarcity of paddy fields, insufficient farmers, and the immaturity of cultivation methods. Therefore, the main source of food, rice, has relied on imports from Thailand, Vietnam, and Burma. After the Japanese implemented military administration, they made the greatest efforts to establish a self-sufficient food base, encouraging residents to reclaim forests and idle land that has been turned into open space due to the war. At the same time, they also established farmer training schools and farmer training centers to train farmers and actively increase production. Thanks to the efforts of the indigenous people, the increased production of alternative foods such as sweet potatoes has now yielded significant results. Other handicrafts, paper, textiles, soap, and other daily necessities have also been revitalized since the Japanese military administration, aiming at self-sufficiency in daily necessities. Since the implementation, the results have been quite good.

### Algiers Radio Announces Establishment of "French Committee of National Liberation" and Sets Up "War Committee"

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from Algiers reports that the "French Committee of National Liberation" was formed on the morning of the 7th, with de Gaulle and Giraud serving as co-chairmen.

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Algiers Radio, the so-called French Committee of National Liberation, under the joint chairmanship of de Gaulle and Giraud, has decided to establish a "War Committee" which will be responsible for commanding the operations of the French rebels. At the same time, the committee has appointed members to various departments, including Philip as head of the interior, Massigli as head of foreign affairs, and Monnet as head of armaments and supply. According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, five members of the de Gaulle Committee in London, at de Gaulle's request, will soon travel to Algiers to participate in the merger of the de Gaulle and Giraud regimes. Two other members will remain in London to handle affairs.

### The Sound of Scientific Victory (3): Capturing Enemy Aircraft in the Stratosphere: The All-Consuming "Fighting Radio Waves"

The aviation radio and anti-aircraft radio researched by the Academic Promotion Association is a kind of "secret matter." To what extent has the research progressed? What kind of items are being researched? Even whether a certain item has already been successful? We cannot elaborate on these questions, lest the enemy know. Therefore, Dr. Masaji Hoshiai (Professor of Engineering at Tokyo University) can "only talk about a little bit of the theory of radio waves applied to aviation." Let's take a look at the main points of Dr. Hoshiai's lecture.

"In the past, it was thought that as long as an airplane could fly, using radio waves on the plane was a luxury or a nuisance. However, today, airplanes must have radio equipment. Especially in modern warfare, airplanes and radio waves can truly be called the two bright flowers. Radiating radio waves can detect the enemy, and at the same time, because you are radiating radio waves, you will also be detected by the enemy. Or, we are currently using radio communication methods that do not make the enemy aware, or radiating radio waves to interfere with and disrupt the enemy's radio waves, or using radio waves to identify enemy aircraft—airplanes and radio waves are so intricately intertwined and carrying out立体 activities."

As soon as a new weapon is created, a new defensive weapon is immediately created to counter it. In order to overcome and surpass it, new weapons are created again. The newest of the new weapons is the radio direction finder—the radio wave locator. Let's look at a foreign example. Three years ago, the German air force brutally bombed London, switching to night air raids, but soon stopped completely. Two years later, they began bombing again with absolutely massive formations. Why is this? As former British Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook, declared, it was because "Britain invented the radio locator, which is a countermeasure that can predict the German air force's bombing on the first ship." Currently, the Women's Auxiliary Air Force manages it. Britain immediately recruited a volunteer corps of American radio technicians. Before and after that, the United States also invented this equipment and equipped it on the front lines in the Philippines. Many of these were seized by our army. Dr. Hoshiai explained: "By the time it takes for the radio waves to be emitted and reflected back from the enemy aircraft or ship, the distance can be determined. If this is used in conjunction with direction finding methods, the position can be accurately determined. With this equipment, it is easy to detect enemy aircraft approaching within a distance of 200 kilometers, and it can also aim and fire at enemy aircraft in the clouds or stratosphere."

Even in the dark night and during rainfall, you can accurately shoot invisible enemy aircraft; this is the power of the new weapon. This radio wave uses ultra-short waves. This was accidentally discovered when studying the ionosphere. After sending radio waves towards the ionosphere, which is 100 to 300 kilometers away, they are reflected back. When calculating the time to measure the height of the ionosphere, the radio waves hit an airplane flying in the sky and are reflected back. In another example, when broadcasting television, if an airplane flies over the transmitting and receiving equipment, the television radio waves are reflected back, and two layers of images appear on the screen of the receiver. Ultra-short waves used for television are aimed at the aircraft to measure the time it takes for them to be reflected back. Thus, the radio wave locator is produced. The speed of radio waves is 300,000 kilometers per second, so for an enemy aircraft at a location 15 kilometers away, the radio waves will be reflected back in one ten-thousandth of a second. The device that can accurately measure this short period of time is the radio wave locator. "The reverse is also true," so the radio waves emitted by the aircraft can be reflected back by the earth, and the "extremely short" time can be measured to determine the height of the aircraft itself. In the past, barometric altimeters could not show the distance from the direct ground. That is, the "ground height." Measuring with sound waves is also difficult. Therefore, the "radio wave locator" is used in reverse, which is the "radio wave altimeter." It is said that no country is actually using this type of altimeter yet. As for our country, Professor Hoshiai said:

"Dr. Kujirai of Tokyo Imperial University noticed the radio wave locator a long time ago. When he returned from abroad, in 1933, when everyone was still desperately researching methods of using sound waves to detect direction, he was already paying attention to the method of using radio waves, but unfortunately, he passed away before he could begin."

At the beginning of the China Incident, the research of the Academic Promotion Association was not inferior to that of the United Kingdom and the United States, and it was concentrated on this issue. Whether it has now been successful, we can only look at the words of Army Ministry Military Affairs Bureau Chief Sato on April 14.

"We have invented a warning device that uses ultrasonic waves to predict the approach of enemy submarines and aircraft, thus greatly limiting the scope of submarine activities, and aircraft can be predicted hundreds of kilometers before they reach their destination. This makes surprise attacks ineffective. At the same time, it is possible to further measure the direction and distance of the aircraft and direct anti-aircraft guns to hit invisible aircraft regardless of clouds or nighttime. On the enemy side, the United Kingdom used it first, and the United States obtained the manufacturing license and has already deployed it on the front lines last year. Our country has recently completed something more advanced than those of the United Kingdom and the United States, and is gradually deploying it to important supply stations."

But behind this, the contribution given by the research of the Academic Promotion Association must be significant.

### Starting Next Month, Japanese Residents Will Implement a Cotton Product Rationing System. Other Necessities Will Also Be Rationed with Coupons. The Chinese Side Will Organize Consumer Cooperatives.

According to Japanese newspapers, the rationing of cotton products will begin with Japanese residents. After implementing rationing for white rice, charcoal, sugar, bread, butter, milk, and laundry soap, the threat to the livelihood of Japanese residents in Shanghai in terms of these goods has been eliminated. Starting in July of this year, cotton products will also be rationed, because the prices of cotton products have recently skyrocketed, and even things like absorbent cotton and khaki cloth have almost disappeared from the market. In order to alleviate these difficulties, the Chinese side will form consumer cooperatives, and the Chinese authorities have also announced that they will implement cotton product rationing for Japanese residents. The Japanese residents have high expectations for this.

Eleven Types of Cotton Products to be Rationed

The Japanese Consulate General and the Residents' Group are considering rationing daily necessities at low prices in response to public opinion, and implementing a coupon rationing system to bring consumption savings into normalcy. Daily necessities such as cotton products will also be rationed at low prices, which will eliminate hoarding. The cotton products that will be rationed include towels, absorbent cotton, cloth socks, yarn socks, undershirts, shirts, and a total of eleven types. In addition to cotton products, coupon rationing systems for other items such as cosmetics, soap, and cooking oil are also being considered for implementation.

### After the Postage Increase, Nine-Cent Stamps Will Be Issued

After the Shanghai Postal Administration adjusted postal rates on the 1st of this month, it has been learned that a small portion of letters deposited in mailboxes have not yet been affixed with postage stamps in accordance with the revised postage rate schedule. The postal authorities believe that this phenomenon is due to the fact that a small portion of residents have not yet learned of the postage increase, so they hope that all parties will pay attention to avoid underpaid postage and unnecessary losses. According to the Datong News Agency, the postal authorities will issue nine-cent stamps in order to complement the previously issued sixteen-cent stamps, so that they can be combined to make twenty-five cents, which will facilitate delivery.

### The French Concession Issued the Eleventh Batch of Rice and Flour Certificates the Day Before Yesterday. Each Certificate Is Accompanied by Rice Flour Certificates for Attached Households, Which Are Collected by Second Landlords.

### The Path of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation (1): The General Chamber of Commerce Will Help Promote Autonomous Organizations

— Masutaro Kimura

This time, Japan's promotion of a new policy towards China has been met with goodwill not only from the National Government but also from people in financial circles in general. Observing the trends in the financial world proves that goodwill has indeed been expressed.

Although it has not been determined how Japan's settlements and public concessions will be handled in the future, the consistent principle is to strengthen the autonomous organizations of people in financial circles. People in Chinese financial circles also feel the same way. Therefore, they not only welcome Japan's new policy towards China, but also believe that Japan has great sincerity in abolishing extraterritoriality and returning concessions, and they all praise it. Although the Three Principles of Konoe were revealed in the past, the average Chinese still harbored a heart of doubt towards Japan. Since Japan promoted the new people's policy, suspicion and fear have been fundamentally eliminated. They believe that Japan has sincerely adopted a new policy towards China, which has a huge effect on people in financial circles.

Why is it able to give such great goodwill to the Chinese? This is because the rights to control supplies in Central China have been completely transferred to the Chinese side for self-management, while the Japanese side handles this matter by private individuals themselves.

Creativity in Economic Operation

Since the incident, what Chinese financial people have felt most painfully is that the movement of materials has been extremely restricted, preventing Chinese financial people from developing based on their own creativity, and the businesses that they have been operating for many years have also been restricted. This situation has been alleviated a lot since the relaxation of restrictions on the movement of materials and the establishment of the National Chamber of Commerce and Trade Control Association, and in the future, we can follow this plan. How can they not applaud and welcome such wise measures?

However, there is still a problem here. They have no experience in controlling materials, and they have no preparation in their hearts, but they have no choice but to take responsibility and do it in the future, so Chinese financial people are probably a little anxious about this. As for this point, the Japanese side must also wait for some time with a magnanimous mentality, and then there will definitely be considerable achievements.

Originally, China's national economic life and politics were not related in the past. The controlled economy implemented by state rights, as practiced in various countries today, is extremely inconvenient in China's view. In China, the so-called government cannot control the lives of the people like Japan. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible for such a country to use political power to control the national economy. However, although political power has not penetrated the people, the economic autonomy of the people is very developed. This is because they have established social control in their economic life. Although there is no political control, social control can be regarded as the most developed in the world.

The Mission of the General Chamber of Commerce

Therefore, the economic control in the future will be centered on the General Chamber of Commerce, and trade associations will be organized separately. Using this so-called autonomous organization of trade associations as a foundation, "in China, other than using this kind of autonomous organization to control, I believe that there is no second way to control the economy. This organization is currently being prepared, but it will take a considerable amount of time. At the same time, the original trade associations only sought to protect themselves, but in the future, they must be given a public service nature, so the General Chamber of Commerce, which is in the central position, must be given various kinds of guidance.

For this reason, it is unreasonable to demand the control of materials from the Chinese side. Before last year, no matter how you persuade them to organize trade associations, those who could gather together to proceed were not established merchants, but only brokers who wanted to seek temporary profit.

Understanding Japan's Policy

This time is different. Those who are enthusiastically engaged in organizing associations are established merchants who have been in business for many years. From this point alone, it can be seen how they understand Japan's policies and how clearly they understand their responsibilities. They are willing to cooperate with Japan to rebuild the economy of Central China. Therefore, after some time, the Japanese side will also do its best to assist, and I believe that it will not be difficult to achieve the goal. (Yun Peng: Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun)

### The Emergency Relief Association is Contacting Banks to Arrange Loans to Purchase Grain, Find Ways to Transport Corn Seeds North to Cultivate, and Encourage the Planting of Domestic Yams to Increase Food Supplies.

Various Industries and Sectors Enthusiastically Donate

Since this newspaper has collected North China disaster relief donations on behalf of it, we have been receiving daily donations from all sectors of society to create blessings for the disaster victims. There is no limit to what we can do. Yesterday, we received a generous donation of 10,000 yuan from Yao Jishen Hall. In addition, Shao Jingfan, two directors of the Criminal Division of the Central Police Department, especially advocated for donations of more than 2,000 yuan from Chinese and Japanese personnel. The staff of Daqing Restaurant on Wuma Road donated more than 1,000 yuan in three days of small accounts. Students at all levels from Yangzheng, Qunying, and Shulan primary schools and Aurora University either saved candy expenses, saved pocket money, or held recreational activities to collect relief funds. All of this shows the importance that all sectors of society attach to North China disaster relief and the enthusiasm of their sympathy. We deeply hope that everyone will follow suit, so that we can gather the strength of the masses and work together to support this righteous cause. It is not only the North China disaster victims who will be grateful.

On the 21st of last month, this newspaper reported that Mr. Yuan Lvdeng's charity sale of famous cigars, Yang Fusheng of Heming Shoe and Hat Store, was willing to bid 10,000 yuan. Now, Mr. Yang has directly transferred the 10,000 yuan to disaster relief donations. Mr. Pan Sansheng has increased the price of these cigars for charity sale, and we still hope that all sectors of society will actively bid to support this good cause.

Christian Churches Jointly Raise Funds

The committee immediately proceeded actively and held a general meeting of representatives from various churches and Christian organizations in Shanghai at the association's office at 3:00 p.m. on the 5th of this month.

The Grandeur of the Charity Match of Military and Film Stars

In order to raise funds for disaster relief in North China, the municipal government specially held a charity basketball and football match for disaster relief in North China. The Capital Military Team, led by Mr. Wang Mengjin, the son of the chairman, came to Shanghai from Beijing specifically to compete. The basketball game has been held for three consecutive days since the 5th and has already ended. Yesterday (the 8th), a small-scale charity football match was held. The Military Team won 4 to 2 in the first half. In the second half, the film stars temporarily pulled in strongmen, and invited football masters Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Zhang Lingen, and Jin Jiabiao to come down to earth to boost their strength. As a result, the score was tied 5 to 5. Although the weather was cloudy and the ground was muddy yesterday, the game was held as usual in the rain. An unusually large number of people went to watch the game. Many female stars came to the scene to cheer, so the atmosphere was lively, no less than the grandeur of a major game held on a normal day. Referee Shen Huichun and side judge Zhang Le, Lin Jiongan, director of the Municipal Education Bureau, sounded a silver whistle to open the ball.

First Game

The film stars were overwhelmed and showed a one-sided slump. Zhao Shouting of the Military Team scored the first goal, and then lost two more goals, scored by Zhao Guanghua, Zhan Daozhi, etc. Then, the film stars transferred personnel, and Wang Naidong, Wang Chunquan, and Li Pingqian were sent down to the field to save the situation, and Shu Shi knocked on the door to pull back a goal, forming a 3 to 1 situation. After Chen Yiqing's pass, he attacked the goal and created a 3 to 2 situation. The Military Team launched a counterattack, and Zhan Daozhi's deep breakthrough scored another goal, and the Military Team took the lead 4 to 2 in the first half.

Charity Ball

Lemon was auctioned off the charity ball, reported by side judge Zhang Le, and the price rose sharply in a straight line. As a result, Mr. Pan Sansheng bought the charity ball for 20,000 yuan on behalf. At this point, the film stars transferred personnel again, and invited four famous generals, Dai Lin, Jia Youliang, Zhang Lingen, and Jin Jiabiao, to come down to the field. Goalkeeper Yue Feng was transferred back, and Wang Chunquan took over. The Military Team remained the original team.

Draw

Re-battle, the Military Team was still unwilling to show weakness, and soon Zhan Daozhi made another contribution and scored another goal, making it 5 to 2. Then the film stars launched a counterattack one after another and built three goals in ten minutes, tying the game at 5 to 5. Negotiate. The Military Team's challenge in Shanghai this time has been successfully completed after four consecutive days of battle, and it is said that it is scheduled to return to Beijing by car within days.

Confucius Society Appeals for Disaster Relief

The Chinese Confucius Society appealed to members to provide relief for the drought in North China. Its announcement stated, "The disaster situation in North China is serious. How can we, who are warmly clothed and well-fed, bear to see it? Members of this association should quickly contribute money if they have money, and contribute efforts if they have strength. We should use the strength of the group, and it is easy to raise the strength of the masses to rescue the dying and starving North China victims. Mencius said, 'The heart of compassion is possessed by all men.' Yu thought of the world as if he were drowning, and he was still hungry. As the saying goes, 'Plant one seed in spring and reap ten thousand seeds in autumn.' Contributing money and effort, even if the cause is small, has its own fruit of happiness. This is an opportunity for members of the Confucius Society to practice the 'benevolence' of the sages. From the perspective of conscience, disaster relief is like fire fighting, and righteousness does not allow sitting idly by. From the perspective of karma, rewards and punishments are never wrong. The Buddha said, 'Firm wealth' means that the money and wealth in the world are all things that come by chance, they come quickly and go quickly. It is better to do good deeds and give alms to plant blessings widely, which will benefit descendants. We hope that all members of the Confucius Society will open their benevolent pockets, the more the better, and the less the better. Be sure to contribute money if you have money, contribute effort if you have strength, or widely publicize it to save our victims. The merit is immeasurable." (Donations can be sent directly to the Social Service Department of this newspaper for collection and transfer to the Shanghai All-Circles North China Emergency Relief Association, or to No. 954 Aidoa Road for collection and transfer.)

### Consolidating Resolve to Destroy Britain and America: Huge Donation from Japanese Residents in Shanghai; More Than Five Million Yuan Donated in One Month

Central News Agency reports that recently, on the Pacific front, the decisive battle between Japanese and American forces has become increasingly fierce. In particular, the heroic death of Marshal Yamamoto at the head of his command and the complete annihilation of the Sakibe unit on Attu Island have further strengthened the resolve of 100 million Japanese people to consolidate their resolve to destroy Britain and America. The Japanese people have recently launched a fervent campaign to donate military aircraft and a campaign to increase air power a hundredfold. The 100,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai are also responding to their country's donation campaign, launching an even more enthusiastic campaign to donate funds for military aircraft.

Today, the Japanese people vow to follow in the footsteps of Marshal Yamamoto and strive to complete the war. If one aircraft is lost, two more will be built. If one warship is lost, two more will be built, so that they can strive to thoroughly destroy Britain and America.

### French Concession Actively Trains People in Air Defense; Previous Exercises Have Been Unsatisfactory; 100 Yuan Fine for Light Leakage

In order to familiarize the public with air defense measures, the French Concession authorities began air defense training on the first of this month. Each district and Lian Bao is holding sessions at various times. The reporting method is that the district police stations issue orders, notifying the relevant Lian Bao by telephone in advance to prepare, and then issuing orders by telephone at the time. When the alarm begins, each Lian Bao relays the order to each Bao, and the reporters ring bells to inform residents to take air defense measures. The method of canceling the alarm is the same. During the exercises, the heads of the police stations in each district personally inspect. In the past few days, each district and Lian Bao has held separate sessions one after another. The authorities believe that the results have been unsatisfactory, especially on the night before last, because of the Dragon Boat Festival, 19 out of 10 households were still celebrating, with light leaking out, which was clearly visible from a high place. The authorities expressed great regret and have ordered each Lian Bao to inform the Baojia chiefs to pay close attention and strive to improve the situation.

Many Fines in the Route Mailand Area

Also, the Lian Bao in the Route Mailand area has held exercises several times, but the results have also been very poor, and many residents have been fined. The method of punishment is that during the exercise that night, the police stations send personnel to inspect. If any light leakage is found, the house number will be recorded. The next morning, the police station will issue a summons. After receiving the summons, the resident must go to the police station to pay the fine and receive a penalty slip. The fine is 100 yuan per household, but the Baojia chief will also be held jointly liable and punished for dereliction of duty with a fine of 100 yuan as a warning.

Route Joffre District Opens Bao Chief Meeting

It is also learned that the exercises on Route Joffre have not been satisfactory. At 4:00 PM yesterday, a meeting of Bao chiefs was held at the Route Joffre Police Station. The head of the detectives instructed on the shortcomings and the air defense measures that should be taken, and cautioned the Bao chiefs to inform each household that if there are any "light leaks" or unsatisfactory measures in the future, once verified, a fine will be imposed.

### Zhang Jinhai Case Support Association Issues Another Public Announcement

The Zhang Jinhai Case Support Association yesterday issued another public announcement to the residents of this city to uphold justice for the Zhang case. The following is an excerpt of the original meaning: "The essence of the Zhang case is the issue of upholding human justice and fairness. If the national law cannot thoroughly punish such a serious case of arbitrary killing, what guarantee will the millions of citizens in the French Concession have in the future? The day before yesterday was the second public hearing of the Zhang Jinhai case. Judge Wang Lansheng was prevented from passing by the chief of the central district of the French police force on his way to the court. Although Judge Wang showed his identification, it was ineffective, and there was even an incident of the jacket being torn due to obstruction. This kind of behavior is both ridiculous and hateful. Leilei is the perpetrator of this case, which the French authorities also acknowledge as a fact. There is no need to avoid mentioning that the French consul intends to file a public prosecution and imprison him. However, when the French police brought the main perpetrator to the Special No. 2 Court for questioning the day before yesterday, he simply made us unable to say that he was a murderer. That kind of smug and nonchalant attitude already shows a lack of sincerity in punishing the perpetrator. Guo Shiyuan is a laundry owner and translator for the tram company who has been doing evil in the concession for a long time. Everyone who has lived in Shanghai for a long time knows this. After the Zhang case occurred, it was already obvious that he was the main perpetrator in the case, so there is no need to argue about it further. However, Guo and the others are shifting the blame to Miele, so that the case is indefinitely delayed, in order to achieve the purpose of not resolving it.

Today, we should seek a reasonable solution for this case under the principles of upholding justice and humanity and safeguarding national sovereignty."

### Special Self-Defense Corps Formed in Public Places in Various Districts; Old Zhabei District Has Completed Organization

### Brief News

Vietnamese Police Awarded: At 3:50 AM on the 6th of this month, a first-class Vietnamese police officer from No. 358, French Concession, was on duty at the intersection of Route Edward VII and Zilaihuo Street when he noticed two people nearby walking forward. Just as he was about to check their identification, the two people suddenly fled into the alley. The Vietnamese police officer immediately chased after them and when he tried to arrest one of them, the other suddenly attacked him with an axe, causing him serious injuries. However, despite his injuries, the Vietnamese police officer was still able to alert his other colleagues to come to his aid and eventually captured one of them. Afterwards, the Vietnamese police officer fainted due to excessive blood loss. The French Consul-General, upon hearing of the above facts, immediately commended him and awarded him a silver shield with a medal from the Municipal Council to show his encouragement.

### Characteristics of the Gambling Scene

— A Famous Scholar

Gambling in Shanghai takes many forms. For example, within the concessions, there are horse racing gambling events every spring and autumn; there is a charity lottery roughly every two weeks; and there are dog races lasting three days each time; and there is the T'ung-li [betting on] ball game every night. However, the harm these cause is far less severe than that of the gambling dens in the Nanshi [Chinese City].

I myself have visited four or five gambling dens in Nanshi. Summarizing the impressions I gained after these visits, two points were most striking: the luxuriousness and the pervasiveness of the gambling dens. Why do I say "luxurious"? I saw large-character slogans hanging near the gambling tables in a certain hotel, stating that each bet by a gambler was limited to 200,000 yuan. I also saw young men in Western suits and elegantly dressed young ladies throwing chips worth 5,000 yuan each onto the gambling tables as if they were bamboo scraps or wood shavings. In today's era of material scarcity, we saw cigarettes being tossed in front of the gamblers like flowing water in the gambling dens, and we saw waiters in the dining halls and opium dens distributing sumptuous food and addictive substances to the densely packed crowds like shuttles weaving through a loom. In such a scene, the words "thousand" and "ten thousand" became very small numbers.

Why do I say "pervasive"? Here, there are white-haired old men, young girls, and even children brought by their mothers to be breastfed. Here, there are tycoons who throw away 200,000 yuan in one go, as well as petty clerks who wager a month's salary, and housewives who pawn their hairpins as gambling funds. There are also mailmen in green uniforms and policemen in black uniforms, and even coolies who place a stack of fractional notes on the gambling tables.

Thinking about it again and again, I feel that we can tolerate the "luxuriousness," but we absolutely cannot tolerate the "pervasiveness." Therefore, I hope that the authorities can truly ban gambling altogether. If they cannot, they should at least temporarily preserve its "luxuriousness" and strictly prohibit its "pervasiveness."

Fortunately, each gambling den has a special room with regulations that those who are not neatly dressed are not allowed to enter, and bets below 100 or 50 yuan are generally rejected. Therefore, those inside are almost all members of the propertied and leisurely classes. This is somewhat similar to the scene in clubs in civilized countries. Since we preserve these special rooms, it does not detract from the dignity of civilized countries. Moreover, these gamblers, even after the gambling dens are banned, will inevitably go to the horse racing tracks, dog racing tracks, and T'ung-li ball game venues to squander their money. Why should we be more lenient towards the disguised gambling dens in the concessions and more harsh towards the official gambling dens in Nanshi?

As for the gambling dens outside the special rooms, there is an immediate need to ban them. This is because they absorb all classes of society, and these people are the pillars supporting society. Destroying them is tantamount to the collective suicide of the entire society. We see missing person advertisements in the newspapers, news of murders, fathers and sons turning against each other, husbands and wives separating, clerks absconding, and workers losing their jobs. In short, the increased instability of an already unstable society is almost entirely due to the existence of these gambling dens. If there were no gambling dens, they would all be hardworking and diligent individuals striving for progress. Dog racing, T'ung-li ball, and other aristocratic and specialized forms of gambling do not attract them. Only the popularization and simplification of gambling dens lead to their downfall.

What the backstage bosses of the gambling dens hope for is nothing more than money. Since they already have gamblers who bet 200,000 yuan in one go, why should they harm the majority of people standing on the brink of starvation, sucking the blood from their lives, forcing them to take risks or wait for death?

I have heard the highest authorities say that they want to preserve "human resources" for East Asia. Gambling dens are clearly dens of demons that consume "human resources," where the lives of countless people are destroyed, and the time of countless productive soldiers is wasted.

In addition to urging the government, we also hope that social leaders will automatically boycott gambling dens. If the managers of various companies stipulate that any employee who goes to a gambling den will be dismissed without pardon, this will not only save some employees from falling into depravity, but also greatly reduce cases of embezzlement and flight. If schools have regulations to expel students who go to gambling dens, then the traces of lovable young people in the dens of demons can also be reduced.

### Creating Interest

— Bai Liao

"Interest can increase work efficiency." This is something everyone understands.

The reason is simple:

First, because of liking, one can be thoroughly automatic; second, because of liking, one can be single-minded. However, it is a pity that a person cannot be interested in everything. Therefore, many people often use the excuse of not being interested to reduce the opportunity for a lot of training.

Friends, ask yourselves, have you ever thought this way? Have you ever used this excuse?

You might say, "The generation of interest is natural, how can it be forced?"

Yes, interest cannot be forced. It completely lies in a person's inner desires; it is completely the heat in a person's heart. But, friends, please don't forget:

—Interest can be created.

When you are doing something you think you should do, but suddenly find that you are not interested, you can easily become annoyed and have to believe that interest is a difficult enemy to conquer. However, it is a pity to give up the opportunity to do what you should do just because you are not interested. Moreover, not being interested means there is no way, which is even more shameful. To avoid shame, to seize opportunities, we should think of a way to save ourselves from the abyss of disinterest, to achieve the goal of increasing work efficiency and enjoying work, which is to create interest.

The beginning of creation is painful, because it is always painful to do things you don't like to do. However, friends, look at the bigger picture. Once you have successfully created interest, what is the joy of victory compared to the slight pain you are experiencing now?

Which achievement of great people was not achieved through suffering, and which one was afraid of suffering? They conquered suffering, and finally they created interest, so their careers had a day of success.

You have to know that the success of a career is multifaceted, so you have to have multifaceted interests. If you lack interest in a required thing, and it affects the entire career, isn't it a pity?

Friends, this is undoubtedly true, creating interest is a necessary condition for success.

Furthermore, if you can truly create and generate a strong interest, the taste is excellent and beautiful, even better than the taste your original interest gave you. Would you like to taste it?

Work hard to create your own interest!

### Learn and Think, Think and Learn

— Yu Huairui

To maintain physical survival, one needs to eat. But a person who only has a physical body and no spirit is just a walking corpse. To maintain spiritual survival, one needs to read.

However, reading is primarily about thinking. A person who has never thought or does not think, even if they have read thousands of volumes, their value is at most equivalent to a mobile bookcase.

Reading is just fragmentarily and sporadically collecting the thoughts and opinions of others. Moreover, these thoughts and opinions are not all beneficial to us. On the contrary, many contain strong toxins. We must use the power of thought to compare them, criticize them, organize them, filter out the toxins, and remove the dross to retain the essence. Only then can they become useful knowledge of our own. The difference between a polymath and a bookworm lies here: the former has put in some effort of thinking after reading, while the latter has not.

The reason why human culture has progressed is that humans have used the method of reading to collect the thoughts and opinions of others, able to chew them carefully, think slowly, and then combine them with profound observation and personal experience. Only after cultivating them for a considerable period of time can some truth be discovered, or new theories be created, so that human culture can take another step forward. Therefore, to acquire knowledge or elaborate on academics, reading and thinking are indispensable. To use an analogy: reading is collecting raw materials, and thinking is processing them artificially. Raw materials can only become excellent products after being polished by artificial work. So, if there are raw materials but a lack of artificial work, it is equivalent to having artificial work but a lack of raw materials. The result is nothing.

Therefore, we must read, and we must also think.

### Saving Wealth and Saving Knowledge

— Mei Fang

Wealth and knowledge are indispensable elements of life. Among the two, knowledge is especially important, because saving knowledge is the basis for saving wealth. If there is no knowledge, how can wealth be saved? Therefore, saving wealth must first start with saving knowledge.

Saving knowledge should be based on self-cultivation, exploring the true meaning of morality from knowledge, such as the ability of diligence and frugality to nurture integrity, and then passing it on to the family, applying it to the country, so as to achieve the great path of cultivating oneself, managing the family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world. Moreover, it is necessary to explore the truth of the universe and strive for scientific knowledge, in order to achieve the purpose of saving the world and benefiting the group, then the true meaning of saving knowledge will not be betrayed.

Saving wealth should be based on diligence and thrift. If everyone handles matters with diligence and thrift, then saving wealth should not be difficult, and this is indeed a shortcut to saving wealth. People in middle age should focus on saving wealth, but when they are old, they should focus on distributing wealth. In our country, it is customary to pass this wealth on to descendants, but descendants cannot protect the ancestral property, and hate to see it squandered away. Therefore, when one is old, one must distribute this wealth to benefit society.

In summary, saving wealth and saving knowledge are the same as physical fitness and mental fitness. Physical fitness must first have mental fitness. With a healthy mind, it is easy to seek a healthy body. If there is a healthy body but no healthy mind, it is equivalent to having wealth but no knowledge. Therefore, people should first save knowledge, and then use their knowledge to save wealth, and then use their knowledge to distribute wealth, so they will not betray their saving of wealth and knowledge.

### Light is Ahead—Dedicated to Friends Who Have Lost Their Way

— Yinqing

Dedicated to Friends Who Have Lost Their Way Yinqing

Your voice is so plaintive,

Your words are so sorrowful,

I cannot help but sigh deeply for you.

Look!

The flames of the era are burning,

Listen:

The songs of the era are sonorous,

The weak have all quickly risen up,

They no longer have!

Cowardice,

Fear,

Hesitation,

Lamenting,

Their hearts are boiling desperately,

Advancing toward the light of the era,

Friends who have lost your way!

Get up!

Use everything you have,

Advance toward the shining journey!

(In response to the Scholarship Fund)

### The Evolution of Selfishness

— Wenzhong

When a person is standing at a station waiting for a tram, they always hope that the vehicles, crowded with passengers like sardines, will stop to let them squeeze in. Even if half of their body is inside the door and half is outside, using the "cloud riding" technique to hang on, they seem to be completely unconcerned!

Once inside the carriage, they hope that the tram will not stop and open its doors at stations along the way, shouting: "Crushed to death!... No one is getting off..."

But when they reach their destination station, they "change their style," raise their voice, and shout: "Hey! Ticket seller! Someone is getting off, open the door... Ah! Friend! Sorry! Move over..." If the tram does not stop, they utter complaints: "Damn it! I'm paying money but still have to take a detour, exhausting my legs."

From this ordinary event, in a short period of time, the selfish psychology of human beings is exposed without reservation.

Some people, seeing others' wallets swell because of speculation, very sternly satirize them for making a fortune from the country's misfortune, their conscience as black as coal. But once they themselves make a fortune through speculation, they say elegantly: "A small amount, it doesn't count for much." They know in their hearts: if I don't grab a slice of the pie now, when will I get such a good opportunity?

Alas! The heart of selfishness, where does it end?

### Snippets

— Zuhong

I would rather I accommodate others than others accommodate me.

Temper should be restrained, and heart should be kind; body should be labored, and heart should be eased.

If it can be said but not done, do not say it. If it can be done but not said, do not do it. Conquer the strong with the soft, move people with sincerity, and subdue anger with reason. It is not difficult to deal with affairs. (In response to poverty relief)

### Public Interest and Private Interest

— Leifeng

The so-called "interest" can be divided into two types: one is "private interest," and the other is "public interest."

Hoarding and speculating, raising prices, focusing only on making money for oneself, regardless of the life and death of others: this is "private interest," which is despicable and sordid.

Initiating social welfare undertakings, running charitable organizations, sacrificing one's own spirit, seeking the welfare of society and the interests of the country: this is "public interest," which is noble and sacred.

But in today's society, everywhere you look, there are people of the first kind; and people of the second kind? They simply do not exist. For the same word "interest," people who work for the first kind of "interest" are like maggots in a latrine, while people who work for the second kind of "interest" are like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. If things continue like this, how can society be peaceful, and how can the country prosper?

If the numbers of the first two kinds of people could be swapped, or even if one percent or one-thousandth of the first kind of people could become the second kind of people, that would be great. However, people's psychology always tends toward "self-interest." Moreover, the first type of people have been blinded by "private interest," lost their humanity, lost their reason. With themselves, who cares about others, who cares about society!

### Mirror of Life

— Jieya

Life is essentially a long dream, a mystery. By the time the dream is awakened and the mystery is solved, it may be too late to deal with everything.

A person who speaks but does not act is the most useless. They deceive others, and they themselves are buried by their boasting. Conversely, a person who does not often open their mouth, who is taciturn, will instead do agile, amazing, and great things!

Before all things, the initiator is always driven by humanity, and it must not be created by being driven by others.

The light and charming singing voice: makes you listen and become intoxicated, numb, and it softens you, making you feel weak and unable to lift your limbs, sinking down. And the majestic and passionate singing voice: can make you rise to boundless heights and boundless enthusiasm; igniting your passionate ambition!

A positive person cannot avoid having a shadow side.

Often there are people who advance but then retreat again, even shrinking into the abyss. This is too terrible. Friends! You should affirm your firm will, exert your mind and body! Invigorate yourselves and continue to work hard: you cannot relax for a moment. Wipe your eyes clean and correctly examine everything, and move forward regardless of all gains and losses! Do not wear gray glasses to view people and things.

The great Jewish mathematician? Einstein said: "Throw away all rules, and be independent and do not be dominated by other opinions."

This sentence, at least, can have a powerful effect on those who are not hesitant.

A person who wavers on the way forward lacks perseverance and self-confidence, and cannot overcome the current obstacles!

### Appeal for Disaster Relief in Chaoshan

— Wen Yingshi

Chaoshan is located in the lower reaches of the Han River in eastern Guangdong. It was originally not a barren area, and fruit tree cultivation is especially abundant. Mandarins, sugarcane, longans, and lychees are its most notable products. However, because the land is mostly mountainous, the cultivated land is relatively narrow, and the population is dense, the annual grain production only accounts for one-half of the consumption. In the past, the deficit was supplied by Saigon, Bangkok, Yangon, and Wuhu. Since the Incident, shipping has been difficult, but grain ships still occasionally arrive. Although they cannot fully supply the shortage, middle and upper-class families can still live in peace. However, the poor are already commonly starving to death due to high grain prices.

Chaoshan rice is harvested twice a year. The first crop is sown in early spring and can be harvested in late summer. Since this spring, very few grain ships have arrived. The only hope is the late summer harvest. Unexpectedly, drought has been rampant, with no rain for several months, and the crops have withered and died, making the harvest hopeless. External assistance cannot be relied upon, and local production has become a pipe dream. Grain reserves are running out, and grain prices are soaring, with each stone reaching a price of about 6,000 storage certificates. People are starving to death, and the number must exceed a hundred every day. Eating children is still rarely heard of, but selling daughters and abandoning infants is already common. If relief is not provided quickly now, then in another three or two months, the grain reserves will be completely exhausted. The nearly two million residents of Shantou City, Chaoan, Chaoyang, and Chenghai counties in the peaceful area will all become starving corpses. Currently, in addition to the Guangdong Fellow Association having tearfully telegraphed the authorities for relief, it is hoped that people in society will urgently launch a relief effort. The Chaozhou people in Shanghai are not lacking in wealthy merchants, and it is hoped that they will quickly start saving their hometown. The following are several relief methods:

(1) Immediately organize a small relief organization to take charge of all relief matters.

(2) Collect large sums of money to purchase [grain] in the Changjiang River basin or Saigon, and then transport it to Shantou via special ship for relief. It is hoped that the Japanese authorities will provide convenience in grain procurement and allocate ships for transportation.

(3) For Chaozhou people in Shanghai who privately remit funds to Chaoshan to help their families, it is hoped that the authorities of the Central Storage Bank will provide convenience so that their families can survive while the grain reserves in Chaozhou have not run out and the relief grain has not arrived. (According to recent reports, readers have requested that the newspaper collect Chaoshan relief funds on their behalf. It is our duty to serve. Yesterday, Mr. Chen Xuliang of the Nanyang Enterprise Company donated 100 yuan first. Thank you.)

Economic Affairs Short Comments

### "Welfare Lottery"

In order to absorb idle funds and improve people's welfare, the National Government recently announced the "Provisional Regulations for Welfare Lottery." We still remember that on February 15 of this year, when Mr. Shiwadu Zhuangtailang, the highest economic advisor to the National Government, entertained news reporters to discuss the financial and economic issues of China after the war, he revealed that the National Government might consider issuing lottery tickets and rewarding prize-linked savings as one of the ways to recover currency in the future.

The "Welfare Lottery" is issued by the Central Reserve Bank and the Central Savings Association entrusted by the Ministry of Finance, so it is a national lottery. The power of its appeal is naturally extraordinary. The reason why it can appeal lies not in the future welfare issues, but in the current huge bonus. The target of its appeal lies not in the small number of wealthy classes, but in the majority of the middle and lower classes, because the methods and ways for the middle and lower classes to get rich are ultimately scarce and narrow.

Because of this, we cannot help but interpret its name and explain the welfare issue of the "Welfare Lottery." Article 9 of the "Provisional Regulations for Welfare Lottery" states: "The funds received from the Welfare Lottery, after deducting the bonus and all expenses, the remaining net profit shall be allocated to the Central Reserve Bank for special deposit and storage, for the purpose of improving people's welfare." Due to such a clear regulation, those who purchase "Welfare Lottery" should broaden their horizons, and should not take "the first prize winning a bonus of one million yuan" as their one and only goal, but should take the future common happiness of compatriots and the people as the object of their investment today. In this way, even if I do not get the prize tomorrow, the final welfare will ultimately be mine, because society is made up of small selves, and social welfare is my welfare.

Then, how should the words "People's Welfare" be interpreted? The elderly, weak, disabled, and poor in society have nowhere to turn, and there are countless cases of middle-aged unemployment and youth losing their studies. How to help them? How to resettle them? How to cultivate them? Which one is not a people's welfare issue? And which one is not a national economic issue?

We sincerely hope that the people's welfare problem will be truly resolved due to the issuance of the "Welfare Lottery," then the "Welfare Lottery" will truly be immeasurable merit. We also hope that the wealthy classes will buy more "Welfare Lottery," because we do not rejoice in the small number of middle and lower classes getting the bonus, but cherish the large number of middle and lower classes getting the welfare.

### Unified Procurement and Distribution by the Food Department, Strict Management of Rice Merchants, Promulgation of Provisional Regulations for Rice Merchant Registration

In order to unify the procurement of rice and grains and centralize distribution, the Food Department, in addition to establishing the "General Administration for Public Grain Procurement and Sales," ordered various localities to organize joint rice and grain cooperatives and promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Rice Merchant Registration, stating: "The Provisional Regulations for Rice Merchant Registration have been promulgated and implemented by the Executive Yuan on March 17th. The rice and grain merchants referred to in Article 3 of the above regulations also include miscellaneous grains. According to the categories of food materials under the jurisdiction of the Ministry as approved by the Executive Yuan, miscellaneous grains such as wheat, barley, naked barley, etc.; beans such as soybeans, peanuts, broad beans, red beans, etc.; sorghum, sesame, millet, corn, etc. Anyone engaged in the procurement, transportation, and sale of the above-mentioned miscellaneous grains, as well as intermediary trading or distribution and retail business, shall be considered a miscellaneous grain merchant and shall immediately comply with the Provisional Regulations for Rice Merchant Registration and apply for registration with the competent authorities.

### Current Reserve Funds Have Been Paid Up; Banks and Firms Are Allowed to Discount Bills with a Term of Seven Days

In order to protect the interests of depositors, the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the Provisional Measures for the Administration of Financial Institutions and the Detailed Rules for Implementation, requires all banks and firms to deposit their deposit reserve funds into the reserve account opened with the Central Reserve Bank. (1) No less than 5% of time deposits and special current deposits. (2) No less than 10% of current deposits. The amount of deposit reserve funds to be paid shall be determined according to the closing balance of each of the above-mentioned deposits at the end of each month, and shall be done before the end of each month. In order to comply with government laws and regulations, various banks and firms have paid up their deposit reserves for time deposits and special current deposits. However, the deposit reserves for current deposits were previously extended by the Ministry of Finance due to the tight money supply. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance approved the request of the silver and money industry and allowed them to borrow cash from the Central Reserve Bank with their deposit reserve passbooks in order to regulate finance. It was stipulated that banks and firms paying deposit reserve funds should issue promissory notes at 80% of their face value, which would be discounted by the Central Reserve Bank with a term of seven days and a particularly low interest rate. However, it was required that the industry association guarantee that the discounted funds were for legitimate business turnover needs. It is reported that various banks and firms have already reached a compromise for regulating finance, and there will be no difficulties in business turnover in the future. Therefore, the deposit reserves for current deposits have been paid up in accordance with legal regulations starting from June.

### Company Re-registration Extended to the End of August

The deadline for company re-registration, which had been extended to the end of May of this year, has expired again. Merchants and the public in various places have been unable to convene shareholder meetings due to an insufficient number of directors and supervisors, and relevant documents have been stored elsewhere, making it impossible to complete the application procedures in time. They have requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to extend the deadline for another ten times. After reviewing the situation, the Ministry deemed it to be true and, in order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of merchants and the public and assist industry and commerce in increasing production, approved another extension of three months for the re-registration, from June 1st to August 31st of this year, so that the companies concerned can register with the Ministry within the extended deadline. A public announcement was made yesterday, and a report was submitted to the Executive Yuan for the record, requesting the provincial and municipal governments to take note of this.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks suddenly fell sharply amid a generally stable trend. Although the Dragon Boat Festival has passed, the money supply remains tight, and the optimism of various parties after the holiday has begun to waver. New and old investors holding positions have turned cautious, and those seeking to sell have increased their supply due to the poor market sentiment. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Sino-French Pharmacy saw an unprecedented new high price in the morning, but it was difficult to maintain, and there were reports of a sharp decline in gold prices, so it saw a retreat, eventually closing slightly more than a yuan lower than last Saturday. New Asia Pharmaceutical also saw a slight consolidation; Minyi saw some trading at the support level; Sino-Western Pharmacy was slightly boosted. Among department stores, Sincere Company remained flat, while Wing On and National Goods Company both reversed from gains to losses; Underwear fell by several cents, while Jingfu Cedar Socks alone rose by nearly a yuan due to a certain buyer's massive purchases. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile's major support level was difficult to maintain for long, and both it and Mayar Silk Factory saw declines; Defeng Knitting Factory's new shares opened at 30% above par value. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press and World Book Co. remained stable, while China Book Co. saw another sharp decline. Among public utilities, Chapei Water & Electricity and China General Edison were the most stagnant, with the former's price slightly weak. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and Great China Match Co. also saw little change. Transactions of Tung Yih Trust, Jiu An Industrial, and Chung Hsing Timber were similar to those before the holiday. New Yi Land saw stable buying interest at low prices, while most other stocks showed a flat or weak trend.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds: Yesterday morning, in the gray market for unified government bonds, Series C was slightly higher by a yuan, Series D remained the same, and the rest all increased slightly.

Gold and Silver: In this city, large jewelry stores of the Great New Association are still exchanging ornaments at the limited price of 200 yuan per tael for handling fees. Prices in the market inside and outside the industry rose first and then fell back, but the increase was minimal, and transactions were not active. The market for fine silver remained the same.

Yarn and Cloth: In the yarn market, demand seemed genuine after the Dragon Boat Festival, but sellers were holding firm, so yarn prices all rose sharply, but transactions remained sparse. In the cotton cloth market, sentiment was optimistic, and demand for Longtou fine cloth remained strong after the market opened in the morning, and the trend remained firm. However, Four Gentlemen Serge saw many people competing to sell, and the trend turned weak. As a result, Longtou fine cloth closed several yuan higher than before the holiday, while Four Gentlemen Serge closed several cents lower. Miscellaneous Grains: The supply of miscellaneous grains in the market was limited, and the sales floor was lively, so prices were slightly higher than before the holiday. There were futures transactions in bean cake.

### Letter

To the Editor: In your newspaper on the 8th of this month, you published a news item about the Egg Industry Association strictly prohibiting members from smuggling eggs, which is not in accordance with the facts. Guotai Egg Company delivered 41 cases of chicken eggs and 9 cases of duck eggs to the Association on the 2nd of the month, as evidenced by the receipt. The shipment that arrived at Guohua Egg Factory on June 5th was not related to Guotai. In addition to inquiring with the Association, we are afraid that the public may not understand the facts, so we hereby write this letter requesting a correction. Sincerely, Guotai Egg Company.
