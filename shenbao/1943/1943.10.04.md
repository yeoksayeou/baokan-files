### Editorial: The Future of Jiangsu Province's Politics and Police Administration

Jiangsu Province, among all provinces in the country, occupies an extremely important position in terms of geography, politics, economy, education, and culture. Therefore, Jiangsu Province's political measures serve as a model and guide for all provinces nationwide. We deeply recognize this, and when personnel in Jiangsu Province were being changed at the beginning of last month, we wrote two commentaries on September 11th and 12th, listing the gains and losses of past provincial administration and offering several suggestions: Currently, both central and local politics need reform. Local political reform can begin in Jiangsu Province, with a six-month trial period before being implemented in other provinces. Hereafter, Jiangsu Province's politics absolutely requires expert governance, eliminating bureaucratic politics. The content of modern politics, from decision-making to implementation, requires the application of scientific thinking at all times and in all places, emphasizing time and striving for efficiency, which cannot be handled by bureaucracy, perfunctory measures, or procrastination. Local self-government work should begin as soon as possible, establishing popular opinion institutions, raising the people's awareness of political participation, and promoting integration between the government and the people. Abolish local miscellaneous taxes and levies to reduce the burden on farmers.

At the same time, it is particularly emphasized that Chinese politics has always failed due to personnel constraints. Although there are sometimes reform proposals, they cannot be adjusted to adapt to the facts. This reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government is a good opportunity for central political reform. From the selection of government personnel, senior officials to all levels of civil servants, the standard for employment should absolutely adopt "meritocracy," reversing regionalism and factionalism. Absolute emphasis should be placed on integrity and honesty in the assessment criteria. At present, China has not yet established a solid foundation for the rule of law, and the talent, competence, and integrity of civil servants remain the greatest factors for good governance. Therefore, the issue of personnel selection deserves careful decision-making.

Secondly, the police affairs administration in civil affairs is extremely important. The police are the civil servants closest to the people. The quality of police administration most easily causes direct feelings among the people. The people's faith in politics is most effectively gained through the service of the police. The Ministry of Interior convened the Second National Police Administration Conference at the end of last month. We deeply feel that police administration is even more important during wartime and also wrote commentaries to contribute opinions, especially advocating for improving the legitimate treatment of police personnel, so that those with excellent knowledge and aspirations to serve are willing to join the police force and enrich police personnel. Of course, clearing out the bad elements in the police force and eliminating the corrupt elements of bureaucracy are particularly active and necessary.

Now, the Governor of Jiangsu Province and senior officials have been announced one after another. Governor Chen Qun was transferred from the Minister of Interior, which shows that the central government is able to value the importance of Jiangsu Province's political status. After the order for Chen's transfer was issued, he still presided over the National Police Administration Conference in the position of Minister of Interior. Therefore, based only on common sense, we judge that in Jiangsu Province's politics, at least the police administration is most likely to have a refreshing appearance, in order to inspire the people's faith in politics.

However, we cannot help but feel emotional after examining the list of senior officials of Jiangsu Province recently released by the government. We have absolutely no preconceived notions. Speaking only from the perspective of police affairs, its important responsibilities and arduous tasks are as described above. Therefore, the choice of person to preside over it must undoubtedly possess rich experience in police administration and a history of integrity. Even as a second choice, it must be a police administration expert who is versed in administration. If someone with absolutely no police administration knowledge is appointed, someone who does not know what police administration is, and this is said to be employing talent from the fields and selecting outstanding talents from the common people, it is simply self-deprecating and treating politics as child's play. The people still have the intellect to distinguish, and if the person in charge is an ignorant and incompetent person, it is inevitable that peers will be cited, and everyone will rush to them, acting surprised, and the result is not difficult to predict. We do not know whether the authorities considered and considered the future of Jiangsu police administration and even the entire Jiangsu Province's administration when proposing or deciding on personnel. We originally had great expectations for the new personnel of the new provincial administration of Jiangsu, but judging from the personnel of the police affairs, it has undoubtedly given the public great disappointment. We, in the position of the people of Jiangsu, in the position of the Chinese people, motivated by the enthusiasm to protect the Jiangsu authorities, the enthusiasm to protect the central government, looking forward to the future of Jiangsu politics, looking forward to the future of Chinese politics, if we do not thoroughly seek to refresh personnel and value the way of talent, then the dim and miserable environment will be impossible to break through. Alas! We only wish to worry needlessly! How could we wish to deliberately make pessimistic remarks!

### North China Purchases Food: Local Officials Responsible: Chairman Wang Issues Statement

Central News Agency Telegram from Beiping, 3rd: Wang Kejiao, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, spoke on the 3rd at the Provincial and Municipal Leaders Conference regarding the purchase of food. The main points of his instructions to the leaders are as follows: During this period of implementing the purchase of coarse grains, the provincial and municipal leaders should quickly decide on the amount to be supplied and the deadline for completion of the purchase for each county and district under their jurisdiction, strictly ensuring the coarse grains in the fields. Therefore, the provincial and municipal leaders need to allocate the amount to be supplied to each county and district, stipulate the amount of purchase funds allocated, and release them quickly in order to engage in appropriate purchase work. The local officials of each county and district should strictly supervise and guide the collection and transportation agencies and cooperatives responsible for the purchase, so that they can be rewarded or punished separately according to their performance. Those who behave poorly among the purchase workers and local officials and Baojia chiefs should also be severely punished. In addition, during this purchase of food, low-price distribution should also be implemented for the daily necessities of farmers, but this must be in the hands of the farmers, and private embezzlement is absolutely not allowed, so that the distribution can be appropriate.

### Fierce Battle in the Middle Reaches of the Dnieper River: German Troops Retreat from the Taman Peninsula

Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 3rd: The German Supreme Headquarters announced on the 2nd: The Soviet army launched a major offensive southeast of Chai Puluqi in recent days but was repelled. Due to the electric shock of the moon, only small-scale attacks were made on the 1st. The Soviet army is still launching offensives in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River, attempting to seize bridgeheads.

Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 2nd: The German Supreme Headquarters issued a bulletin at noon on Sunday, stating: The enemy army carried out partial offensives on Saturday in the Kupen bridgehead and the southern and central parts of the eastern front. After fierce fighting in several strongholds, the enemy army was repelled. After destroying all important military equipment, the German army withdrew from the town of Taman, without being noticed by the enemy at the time.

Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 3rd: According to a Huitong News Agency report, well-informed sources in the German military declared last night that the Soviet army continued to exert pressure on the German army in the Gomel area of the central route of the eastern front. Despite the extremely bad weather, the Soviet army still dispatched large numbers of tanks, artillery, aircraft, etc. to fight, attempting to attack the flanks of the German rearguard, but ultimately failed. At the same time, the Soviet army applied heavy pressure to the German positions along the Smolensk Highway and launched several offensives, all of which were repelled by our defending troops.

### German Troops in Eastern Italy Adopt Mobile Tactics: German Troops Retreat North of Naples and Defend the Highlands

Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 3rd: According to a Huitong News Agency report: The German withdrawal from Naples was a pre-planned plan by the German Command. Currently, German troops are using artillery to control the military operations of the plains in the foothills of the Apennines. Small units of enemy troops advancing between Vesuvius and the Apennines are immediately stopped. The right wing of the US Fifth Army's thrust towards Benevento also encountered significant difficulties. Only small units of the British Eighth Army have advanced to the foothills of Puglia, where there are intense local battles. However, the enemy army has no room for maneuver in southern Italy, because塞林 avoids large-scale battles and continues to advance north. When this evasive action will stop, the German Command is temporarily keeping it a secret, and the Allied forces are very anxious about this issue.

Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 3rd: According to a German News Agency report: The German military operations in the Naples area were not interfered with by the British and American forces. Sometimes enemy troops, under the cover of tanks, attempted to obstruct the German army's actions, but were repelled as a result. Several villages near Mount Vesuvius and the town of Ottaviano have been completely evacuated, and the German army has retreated to well-prepared and shortened positions. There is no news of war in the vicinity of the new front line, except for reconnaissance activities. The war activity in the eastern part of the southern Italian front in the Castelnuovo區 (Castelnuovo area塞拉加浦奥拉區 (Serracaqhriola) area has greatly increased. General 蒙高茂萊's troops, under the cover of tanks, attempted to break through the German front line, but the German army's mobile tactics were enough to resist all large-scale attacks. At that time, thirteen enemy "Xu Men" tanks were damaged and unable to move, and sixteen armored vehicles were destroyed or caught fire. The British artillery units protecting the battle were unable to break through the German resistance. After General 蒙高茂萊's attempt to break through failed, he stopped the offensive. Near Castelnuovo, British troops attempted to encircle the German rearguard, but were attacked by neighboring German detachments. The battle is still in progress.

### Berlin Denies German-Soviet Understanding

Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 3rd: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry yesterday strongly denied reports from British, American, and Soviet sources that there was a possibility of a German-Soviet understanding. The spokesman told foreign reporters that the Soviet government's motives for spreading this rumor were roughly threefold: First, to make people think that the Soviet Union's position is now extremely strong, so Germany is preparing to compromise with Moscow. Second, to make the anti-Axis countries worry about Germany and the Soviet Union making peace separately, thereby forcing the anti-Axis countries to step up their military operations on the second front. Third, to make the anti-Axis countries more willing to accept the Soviet Union's political demands. On the other hand, the UK also has its reasons for spreading this rumor, which can be used as an excuse to make its further concessions to the Soviet Union seem justified. The spokesman pointed out that regarding this matter, the Swedish newspaper 　 also has the same view as the canal, and 　 the truth has been stated in Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's recent speech.

### Wartime Soviet Diplomacy: Analysis of Soviet War Power, Part 3 (2)

Discord Between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union

The discord between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union has been a recurring problem since the start of the German-Soviet war. Especially during each British-American summit, although the anti-Axis camp had high expectations, Stalin never participated, thus repeatedly becoming the subject of discussion.

It would naturally be a misguided and very dangerous view to overestimate the antagonism between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Taking the start of the German-Soviet war as an opportunity, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States united on the point of carrying out the war against Germany. But although they are united, they are still somewhat distant.

In extremely formulaic terms, the Soviet Union is a socialist country, and its ultimate goal is not only to complete communism in one country, but also to make the world red. Even if it is currently preoccupied with the German-Soviet war and concentrates all its national power on promoting the war against Germany, Stalin will not forget this matter in his dreams—making the world red.

Conversely, the United Kingdom and the United States are typical imperialist countries, and their ultimate goal is to dominate the world through imperialism. This world war was triggered by the imperialist ambitions of the United Kingdom and the United States. The United Kingdom and the United States fear Germany, which is moving towards building a new order in Europe, but they fear the Bolshevik doctrine of the Soviet Union even more.

Because the fundamentally incompatible Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States are united on the point of carrying out the war against Germany, they naturally want to take advantage of each other to make their own position advantageous. It is also natural for dramatic 　 to arise in the interests of the three countries with conflicting interests.

Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States, 腼, and the future situation may even provoke armed conflict. In this regard, what the Soviet Union hopes for is to demand the opening of a second front, while what the United Kingdom and the United States hope for is the prolongation of the German-Soviet war. That is, the Soviet Union is unwilling to resist Germany with its own strength alone, 　 　 war power, but wants the United Kingdom and the United States to open a second front, saving its own war power and, at the same time, wanting to offset the war power of the United Kingdom and the United States.

On the other hand, the United Kingdom and the United States are delaying the opening of the second front within the possible range, prolonging the German-Soviet war, in order to save the war power of their own troops and consume the war power of the German and Soviet armies, hoping that the German and Soviet countries will suffer heavy losses if possible. But the problem is not that simple.

First, as a result of the re-evaluation of the Red Army's war power, the United Kingdom and the United States are clearly far behind. If they completely lose their existing rights and interests in Europe, it will be extremely difficult to realize their imperialist ambitions in Europe. But if the second front is opened based on the above reasons, then the purpose of reducing the Soviet Union's war power cannot be achieved, and the United Kingdom and the United States are caught in a painful vise.

Therefore, at the 加　勃期加 talks in January of this year, no conclusion could be reached on the question of how to deal with the second war, and opinions were not consistent at the Washington talks in May of this year either. Soon the battle of Sicily came to an end, and how to deal with the second front became an increasingly pressing issue, to the point of this Quebec conference, but if the above-mentioned complicated situation is not eliminated, then the United Kingdom and the United States will ultimately be unable to reach a conclusion on the second front issue.

Moreover, there is also a difficult-to-overcome divide between the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the issue of Germany. The United Kingdom and the United States say on the surface that the purpose of the war against Germany is to overthrow the Nazi regime, but secretly they are attempting to implement imperialist all-encompassing distribution of the German people.

In response, the Soviet Union intends to handle it with its own views. This opposition can also be seen in the attitudes of the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union towards the Italian policy.

That is, at this Quebec conference, although the British and American public opinion circles hoped that Stalin would participate before the meeting was held, not to mention Stalin, not even one representative of the Soviet Union participated, and the Soviet government issued an extremely rate-producing statement through TASS on August 12, saying:

"The Soviet Union was not invited to the talks. In terms of the nature of the talks, there was no need for a representative of the Soviet Union to participate, so they did not participate."

Despite this, Roosevelt and Churchill 　 然 hoped that Stalin would participate. After the talks came to an end, it was reported that the American side's Hull　Wells and the British side's Churchill and Eden would visit Moscow.

Why did TASS issue a statement that was not only extremely inappropriate from a diplomatic point of view, but also unnecessary? Although there can be various explanations for this, in any case, we have again recognized the misalignment of the pace of the United Kingdom and the United States.

The above-mentioned discord between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will inevitably intensify as the war situation progresses. How the Soviet Union will handle this issue and carry out the war against Germany is an extremely interesting question. (End of the full text: Xiang　from Allied World Returns One Two Two Three)

### Gauze Factory Registration Discrepancies: Forty-One Factories Sealed Up: Awaiting Instructions from the Authorities for Disposition

According to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry to the council, if the rice purchase plan formulated by the council this time can be carried out smoothly according to the established plan, or there are no other inconveniences, the goal of balancing the people's food and not lacking anywhere can be achieved. However, this kind of wish cannot be achieved by the sole power of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, and it still requires the cooperation of all relevant parties.

### Salt Rationing to be Implemented Pending Ministry of Finance Approval

Shanghai's salt supply is steadily arriving from production areas, with no shortage. Shipments are being further expedited to ensure an even more abundant supply. The authorities are currently planning for rationing. However, salt is a state-operated business, and salt affairs regulations are comprehensive and well-defined, unlike ordinary commodities such as rice, flour, oil, and sugar. The Songjiang District Salt Affairs Administration is responsible for salt affairs and handles everything in accordance with salt laws. Any matter that should be initiated or reformed but lacks a legal basis, no matter how big or small, must first be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval before it can be implemented. Previously, the Economic Department of the First District Public Office of this city sent a letter to the bureau outlining the implementation of salt rationing. The bureau considered the matter significant and requires the Ministry of Finance to approve concrete and thorough measures to ensure that salt affairs administration is not obstructed. Therefore, salt rationing in this city will be implemented pending approval from the Ministry of Finance.

### Health is the Dawn That Bears a Deep Relationship to the Nation and is the Foundation of a Person's Career

Health is the foundation of all human endeavors. A strong nation and a healthy society cannot be built on a weak and sickly population. This is an irrefutable fact. Dr. Takata Yasuma, Director of the Japanese National Research Institute, once said, "If a nation desires to overcome poverty and hardship, it must possess a strong body and mind. This is the driving force for the nation's eternal survival and development." These unbreakable words can deepen our understanding of the profound relationship between national health and national survival. Therefore, we feel that how to improve national health is a very important issue. At the same time, we feel that the health movement that has emerged in recent years is the only answer to this important question.

### History of Healthcare

Speaking of healthcare, countries around the world have long been pioneers and have reaped great benefits. Their success can be said to be entirely due to the establishment of a disease insurance system. This disease insurance system originated in 1871, and Dr. Baylor of Baylor University in the United States was the first to successfully try it. In 1929, the doctor insured 1,250 school teachers, with a premium of only five cents per person per month. The success of the experiment attracted great attention from the general public. In 1935, Miss Harlene Hoess of New York City, together with several apartment staff members, started this business. Within a year, the total number of members reached 84,000, and the number of new members joining each month was about 5,000. The progress was rapid. On the one hand, this was because the disease insurance system was urgently needed by the people, and on the other hand, it was due to the general public's deep understanding of the significance of healthcare. This is why it was able to attract their enthusiastic support. This is an inevitable trend of cause and effect. Now, this disease insurance system is becoming more and more complete. In terms of organization, there are public and private distinctions. The former is compulsory, and all employees of shops and factories, as well as general civil servants, are forced to insure. The insurance premium is borne by the authorities of the service institution for one-third and by the insured for two-thirds. This insurance premium is about 4% to 7% of the employee's monthly salary. There are designated doctors and hospitals that serve the insured all year round. The latter is completely different from the former. All housewives and children, as well as general freelancers, can freely join private disease insurance organizations. There are no restrictions on seeing a doctor or being hospitalized, and the expenses can be recovered from the insurance organization after the fact.

### Beneficiaries Precedent

The people of various countries who have benefited from the disease insurance system are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. Now, let us cite one or two examples to summarize the rest. In the United States, there was an old man of 57 in New York. In the beginning, someone persuaded him to join the association, but the old man was very opposed to it. However, three weeks after joining the association, he was sent to the hospital due to severe pneumonia. When he recovered and was discharged from the hospital, the cost on the hospital bill was only $2.60. He was really surprised and could not help but sing praises. There was also an unemployed friend who fell and was seriously injured. After being sent to the hospital, he was treated with X-rays and medication. He was hospitalized for about a week, recovered and was discharged from the hospital without paying a penny. There are countless people who have benefited like this.

### Environmental Needs

In this great era, the issue of health is the most important. On the one hand, due to rising living costs and difficulty in obtaining food and clothing, how to shoulder the burden of life is a major issue that most people are looking forward to. On the other hand, the country is embarking on a new path of restoration and construction. Everything requires the cooperation of the people. As a member of the people, how can we not fail the expectations of the country and assume the responsibilities that everyone should bear? This is a big problem. To sum it up, these two heavy burdens placed before us cannot be borne by weak and sickly people. There is absolutely no doubt about this. Therefore, in this great era, people cannot but pay attention to health for their own survival, and they must pay even more attention to health for the survival of the country. In addition, from the perspective of social and economic conditions alone, due to the high cost of medicine now, most people cannot afford to see a doctor. The impact of this on public health and social productivity cannot be said to be small. Under the above-mentioned circumstances, we feel that it is urgently needed by the environment to vigorously implement healthcare to improve national health. In the minds of the general public, it may be like waiting for clouds in a severe drought.

### The True Meaning of Healthcare

The importance of healthcare has been described above, and we believe that healthcare work is not only in the area of medical treatment. Because after a person becomes ill, he or she starts to seek medical relief. Even if the treatment is appropriate and he or she can recover his or her health early, he or she will inevitably suffer considerable losses in terms of economic time, spirit, and work. Therefore, preventing trouble before it happens is better than mending it afterwards. The real healthcare work lies in promoting all disease prevention work. This is the true meaning of health, and it is the shortcut to improving national health.

The Chinese Healthcare Association is a new healthcare organization that has been established under the ardent hope of society and with the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. In order to adapt to the urgent needs of society, and with reference to the healthcare systems of various countries, the Guidance and Service Departments were established first. Now, the association is soliciting members from the public in order to provide ordinary services to the society, and people from all walks of life are enthusiastically joining.

### Purchasing Wheat to Produce Flour, Public Agreement on Collection and Distribution Signed, Violators Will Have Their Qualifications Revoked and Be Punished

After the Wheat and Flour Professional Committee unified the purchase of wheat from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, as well as Shanghai and Nanjing cities, and with the efforts of bank loans, the committee stipulated that all entrusted merchants collecting wheat and flour mills distributing wheat must sign a public agreement. The agreement is excerpted below:

### Public Agreement for Entrusted Merchants to Collect Wheat

"I am willing to follow the general strategy of the National Commercial Control General Association for the unified collection and distribution of flour and wheat, and apply for the business of buying wheat. In addition to selling the collected wheat directly to the entrusted flour mills in accordance with the distribution quota stipulated by your committee, if there is a surplus, I will listen to your committee's purchase at the given price and abide by all regulations of your committee regarding the purchase of wheat. If there is a serious violation, I am willing to accept severe punishment."

### Public Agreement for Flour Mills to Distribute Wheat

"I am willing to follow the general strategy of the National Commercial Control General Association for the unified collection and distribution of flour and wheat and apply for the manufacture of flour from wheat. I will absolutely abide by all the regulations of the committee regarding the collection and distribution of flour and wheat, as well as the following clauses. If there is a violation, I am willing to accept the revocation of registration qualifications and severe punishment. The purchased wheat must absolutely comply with the stipulated distribution quota and must not exceed the quota. The purchased wheat must be handled by the entrusted merchants registered with the responsible committee. The purchased wheat must never be resold. If the total amount of wheat purchased is insufficient, I will allow your committee to collect it at the officially set price in accordance with the original distribution ratio and will never sell it elsewhere."

### Commodity Prices in this City Gradually Stabilizing

In recent months, commodity prices in various industries in this city have gradually stabilized due to the authorities' efforts to adjust and improve them reasonably. In particular, since the government purchased cotton yarn and cloth, most of the floating capital has been absorbed. However, speculators tried to make a final struggle, but they were discovered by the relevant personnel and punished according to the law, resulting in several cases of suspension of business for several days or fines. As for the construction of various cloth markets, due to the authorities' rapid expansion of the control system, most hoarders were extremely anxious and eagerly sought to release their stockpiles. Shops in various industries also sold off goods to obtain cash, and the phenomenon of large price reductions and special sales also competed to sell off goods. Therefore, commodity prices have naturally become more reasonable. The financial market situation in Shanghai is still as calm , with no changes in the market prices of Chiwen silver, military tickets, joint banknotes, and interbank lending rates. Government bonds and stocks were once weak due to unfounded rumors in the market, but they soon returned to normal. Currently, stock trading is still the most active , and with the Central Reserve Bank's efforts to regulate funds, the money supply has become looser. Food rice is becoming more stable due to the active preparations for purchase by the Rice and Grain Control Committee, and the market price is low and flat. Market prices of other miscellaneous grains, beans, and wheat have also decreased. The publicly set prices of daily food items are stable and unchanged, and the trend of rising prices in the black market has completely stopped. The entire industrial and commercial situation in Shanghai is more stable than before.

### Black Dates and Dried Lychees are Scarce and Expensive

The first batch of new black dates have appeared in small quantities in this city and Nanjing. Due to the poor harvest, the quality of the goods is relatively poor, but the price is slightly higher than that of the old goods. As for the old goods stored for a long time, the interest and warehouse rent have also increased significantly, so the market is also expected to tighten.

Due to the poor production and difficult sourcing of Jinshan column incense this year, prices have risen again according to recent telegraphic information. As a result, the price in City A has also risen. The number of glutinous rice branches is even smaller, and the degree of increase is higher.

The arrival of rice substitutes is lacking, but actual sales are still slow, so in addition to slight trading among peers, inquiries from customers are also rare, resulting in a very soft market situation.

### Chinese Dominance in Tennis, French and Portuguese Annihilated in International Competition, Japan Defeated by 1-2 in Championship Game (Honghu)

This international charity tennis tournament, with four strong teams from China, Japan, France, and Portugal participating, began on the preceding Saturday (September 25). The preliminary round schedule was determined by the organizing authorities. Japan faced France on the opening day, and China faced Portugal the following day (September 26). The competition used an elimination system with two singles matches and one doubles match. The preliminary round results showed that Japan and China each won 3-0, eliminating France and Portugal respectively, and both qualified for the final. After a week of rest, the two giants, China and Japan, held a fierce battle at the same location the day before (October 2). China had outstanding singles players, winning two groups, and Japan had excellent doubles cooperation, also winning. As a result, China defeated the Japanese team to win the championship. Japan narrowly lost and finished as runner-up. From then on, in the national tennis world, China took the lead and became the leader. In the sports history of Shanghai, the Chinese have added another glorious and brilliant page. The competition began after Mayor Chen's representative, Secretary Zhao, delivered the opening remarks, and Mayor Chen personally presided over the awards ceremony and closing ceremony. Over the past three days, Minister Chu, Minister Ding, the French Consul General, the Portuguese Consul General, and Chairman Shen Siliang of the Municipal Sports Association have all attended the matches. However, the level of tennis was high, and the audience was not enthusiastic during the first two days of the preliminary round. The final was sold out. This still needs promoters to promote its popularity. Under the leadership and supervision of Chairman Pan of the Three Provinces Sports Association, the arrangement of the tennis court was orderly. The ticket sales were also considerable due to the efforts of Chairman Pan of the Three Provinces, which will help the charitable organizations in China, Japan, France, and Portugal, which is not insignificant. The benevolence and righteousness are not only in the sports field.

### Japan Eliminates France

In the Japan-France match, Japan's Kanda Michio faced France's Courenzeff in the second singles match. Kanda, experienced and steady, remained calm and unhurried, which was his strength. Courenzeff, on the other hand, was young and impetuous, with powerful forehand shots and sharp serves, but his backhand was extremely weak, becoming a point of attack for his opponent. Courenzeff won the first game with his serve, but Kanda returned the favor, making it one game each. After Courenzeff won another game, Kanda quickly took it back. Courenzeff kept losing and gaining, becoming visibly flustered. Kanda seized the opportunity and made it 4-2, eventually winning the first set 6-3. In the second set, Kanda scored twice with his serve, while Courenzeff's serve failed, leading to three consecutive lost games. At this point, Courenzeff seemed to wake up from a dream and tried to stay calm, using high-speed hitting, forcing Kanda to run around, and winning six consecutive games, leaving Kanda in the shadows, losing the set 3-6. In the third set, Courenzeff, having exerted too much effort in the previous set, showed weaknesses again. Kanda, like a whirlwind, won a set easily. In the end, Japan won 2-1. In the doubles match, Japan's Yamagishi Seiichi and Fukushi Sanya faced France's Jourdan and Bruns. The strengths of both sides were almost equal. The closeness of the score shows the intensity of the competition. Yamagishi was more steady than Fukushi, while Jourdan was more powerful than Bruns. The French team's defeat was due to more errors and self-inflicted mistakes. Bruns' serve was broken, and Yamagishi took the second game. Suddenly, Jourdan and Bruns took the lead 3-2, but then Yamagishi and Fukushi led 4-3. The situation was extremely unpredictable. Jourdan and Bruns then created a 5-4 advantage, but Yamagishi and Fukushi eventually won 7-5. In the second set, both Bruns and Yamagishi failed their serves, making it one each. Then the French side took the lead twice. The Japanese side won three consecutive games, making it 5-3. The French side returned the favor, making it 6-5, but they failed to capitalize. The Japanese side saw the opportunity and regained their advantage, eventually winning 8-6. As a result, Japan won in straight sets. Japan also won the final singles match, with Japan's Maba facing France's Avigue. Maba had unique skills in both forehand and backhand, while Avigue, despite being France's main player, paled in comparison. Avigue won the first game with his serve, but Maba then won five consecutive games. Avigue resisted stubbornly, bringing the score close to 4-5, but eventually lost the set 4-6. In the second set, Maba broke his opponent's serve, and Avigue immediately won three consecutive games in return. However, this did not dampen Maba's momentum. Maba then won five consecutive games in one go, ending the second set 6-3. Japan won by a net two games. The overall result was 3-0, with Japan eliminating France.

### China Easily Defeats Portugal

The China-Portugal match was held the day after the Japan-France match. The scorching sun was even more intense than in mid-summer. This was an unusual weather for after the Mid-Autumn Festival. The match started at 2:30 PM, right under the scorching sun. Players who played in the match would inevitably sweat profusely and feel dizzy. Fortunately, the strength of the two sides was vastly different. The Chinese team's victory was as easy as turning over their hands, so they did not exert much effort. Otherwise, in such harsh weather, it would have been difficult for the players' bodies to avoid being affected. In the second singles match, China's Zhang Dingzhao faced Portugal's Rocha Liao. Zhang Dingzhao was a veteran of the Chinese team. Although his skills were not at their peak, his unwavering spirit was unmatched by ordinary players. Moreover, he was able to maintain his normal state. Therefore, even at his age, he could still compete with top players. Rocha was a rising star, and together with his teammate Soares, was considered to have great potential, but he lacked experience and his skills were not yet refined. When he met Zhang, the outcome was obvious. After Rocha won the first game with his serve, Zhang immediately won three consecutive games. Rocha won the fifth game with his serve, and then took a 5-2 lead. Then it became 5-3. Zhang finally missed a set point, but still won easily 6-3. In the second set, the situation was one-sided. Zhang controlled the game freely, doing whatever he wanted. Rocha lost six consecutive games. As a result, China won 2-0. In the doubles match, China's Liang Deguang and Cai Guoji faced Portugal's Sunner and Soares. Among the four players, Liang and Sunner both had considerable experience, but Sunner did not perform as well as he should have. Soares was not skilled enough and was too impetuous, while Cai was talented but prone to panic. Although Sunner and Soares attacked Cai Guoji's weaknesses, they failed to capitalize, leading to their defeat. Liang and Soares each won a game with their serve. Liang and Cai then took a 4-1 and 5-2 lead, eventually winning 6-3. In the second set, Soares won the opening serve, but Liang evened it out. After Portugal made it 2-1, the Chinese team won four consecutive games. There was a fierce battle in the fifth game, with both sides missing several game points. This set also went to the Chinese team with the score remaining 6-1. As a result, China won 2-0. Next, in the final singles match, China's Tao Guanqiu faced Portugal's Carvalho. Carvalho was not weak in technique due to his father's influence, but compared to Guanqiu, he was still inexperienced. However, his style showed the potential of a great player, only needing diligent practice. The score was 6-2 and 6-1. Carvalho only won the first and fourth games of the first set and the fourth game of the second set. The powerful shots of both players were admirable. Tao was praised, and Carvalho also received good reviews. It was a wonderful match. The overall result was China defeating Portugal 3-0.

### Championship Finals Process

The Chinese and Japanese teams both qualified for the championship finals, which were held on the day before yesterday (October 2nd). After being washed by a rain shower, the court was even more beautiful. The autumn sun was not strong, but the wind was a bit strong. Overall, it was a good day. In the second singles match, China still sent Zhang Dingzhao, while Japan replaced Kanda with Isobe Kameo.

Isobe was as steady as Kanda, but his smashes were even more powerful. He was especially confident with his backhand. Zhang's defense failed, and he lost three consecutive games. Then, he quickly caught up, tying the score at 3-3. Isobe then took the lead again twice, making it 4-3 and 5-4, putting Zhang in a dangerous situation. However, Zhang did not lose heart and won two games to tie the score again. In the twelfth game, Isobe missed two game points, losing the opportunity to make it 6-6. Zhang then won 7-5, breaking the tie and winning the set. In the second set, the situation changed dramatically. Zhang had a clear advantage. Isobe was exhausted and struggled to defend, losing his ability to counterattack. Zhang won the first two games, but Isobe broke his serve in the third game, making it 2-1. Isobe still showed no improvement and lost three more games. Zhang finally won again with 6-2. There were three deuce games in this set, with Zhang winning two and Isobe winning one. As a result, China won 2-0. In the doubles match, China's Zhou Guanjun and Cai Guoheng faced Japan's Yamagishi Seiichi and Fukushi Saburo. Doubles was the only weakness of the Chinese team, and Zhou and Cai played even worse than expected, especially Zhou. In international competitions related to national honor, victory or defeat is a common occurrence, but choosing Zhou as a representative shows the selection committee’s negligence. The skills of Yamagishi and Fukushi were not top-notch either. In the first set, the Chinese team suffered a crushing defeat of 6-0. In the second set, Zhou and Cai finally improved slightly. After Japan won two consecutive games, they tied the score twice at 2-2 and 3-3. In the seventh game, Cai and Zhou made mistakes and missed game points, failing to catch up. Fukushi missed a match point, but Japan eventually won 6-3. As a result, the Chinese team was defeated 2-0. The final singles match was the deciding point, a matter of life and death. China's Tao Guanqiu and Japan's Maba Shigeru then started their match. The Chinese audience cheered for Guanqiu. Guanqiu lived up to expectations, easily defeating his opponent and allowing Mayor Chen's championship trophy to be brought back to the Chinese team. Tao's skills were high, and even Maba had to admit defeat. Guanqiu won the first set without much effort. After Maba won a game with his serve, he lost two more games. Tao then won with 6-1. In the second set, Tao was unstoppable, winning five consecutive games. Then, he showed mercy, allowing his opponent to avoid a shutout, and won again with 6-2. As a result, he won in straight sets 2-0. The overall result was China winning the championship with 2-1, while Japan ranked second.

### General Assessment of the Strengths of the Four Teams

Looking at the overall strengths of the four teams, the Chinese team's singles players can be described as invincible. Tao Guanqiu was born into the profession. He had sparred with the world champion Tilton Barnes (Tilton had come to Shanghai to perform), and his skills had indeed reached the realm of perfection. Even when competing with Carson, who had dominated the entire event before, he did not concede much, except that he was not seen volleying. He defeated Carvalho and Maba without much effort, and Avigue was even less of a challenge. He was the Shanghai champion and was definitely worthy of his title. Zhang Dingzhao's heroic spirit remained, and he could be described as invincible in the second singles. He was seven parts sure to be able to beat Avigue who had competed with the first singles player Carvalho. The doubles pairing of Liang and Cai was superior to Zhou and Cai, but still not a match for the Japanese team. They were similar to Jourdan and Bruns. Maba Shigeru of the Japanese team could be ranked second among all the singles players in the competition. Isobe was better than Kanda, and in the second singles, he could be ranked first, second only to Dingzhao. With Yamagishi and Fushi, while Shanghai lacked doubles talent at the time, they rightfully revealed their silvery edge. If the doubles had not been held so early, then our Tao and Liang pairing, or Wang Wenzheng, would have had a chance of success against them. The Portuguese team had Carvalho as their strongest player. Whether Nicolai Kranshar chose to conceal his skill or not was unknown, but if Carvalho played cautiously, Maba would be sure to be able to win. Rocha Liao had not yet demonstrated his true level. He was like Liao Hua, a minor character in the Three Kingdoms. The doubles pairing of Sunner and Soares was even weaker than Jourdan and Bruns. They were the weakest of the four teams. Avigue of the French team was not a top-tier player, and Couronzeff was even less impressive. The doubles pairing of Jourdan and Bruns could pose a threat, but not much. In summary, the Chinese team deserved to win the championship, and the Japanese team's second-place finish was also reasonable. If France and Portugal were to compete, it was expected that France would win the doubles. The first singles would belong to Portugal, and the French team was likely to win the second singles.

The above discussion is based on the performance of the players who have participated in the past three days. It is difficult to make predictions about those who have not yet played, so this competition cannot be used to determine the rankings of all Shanghai tennis players. In the entire competition, only one match was decided in three sets. The rest were concluded in straight sets. However, the players were already showing signs of fatigue. Compared to the exciting five-set matches of the past, this was not the same. This shows that in an era of a lack of tennis courts, players lack opportunities to practice, which affects their physical strength and the improvement of their skills. If we want to improve the level of tennis, isn't it difficult?

### Tidbits from the Sports Scene

The psychology of spectators at any ball game is extremely cruel. If a ball is won, the whole stadium cheers and praises. If a ball is lost, there is a loud boo. They are sent to the 18th level of hell. The change from honor to disgrace takes less than a minute. This kind of expression is enough to affect the players' fighting psychology. There was such a phenomenon at the International Tennis Tournament the other day.

The Wuxi Sports Field held a fundraising basketball game last week. Four teams from Shanghai, Changzhou, Suzhou, and Wuxi were invited to participate in the competition, bringing together the elite from four regions in one event. This was truly an unprecedented event in Wuxi. Shanghai was represented by the "Yu Ren" team, the champion of both the junior and senior basketball leagues. As a result, "Nani" of Wuxi defeated "Yu Ren" by six points, winning the championship.

The skills of the Huaying basketball team have recently improved rapidly. In the Jianbei Cup, they unexpectedly defeated the strong Tongren team. This is truly commendable. It is said that on Double Tenth Day, they have accepted an invitation from the Xichang team of Wuxi to compete in Wuxi.

The establishment of the Huaying women's basketball team is truly a glorious record in Chinese film history. In the past, famous actresses such as Hu Die and Ruan Lingyu, although their acting skills were superb and they were admired by everyone, they inevitably had shortcomings in terms of athleticism. Therefore, the creation of this team is of great value. It is said that Qian Xuzhi, the coach of the Huaying men's basketball team, will also serve as the coach of the women's team. Since taking office, he has been instructing the team.

### Coral Sea Blitzkrieg: Enemy Aircraft Carrier Sunk

May 4th, 00:00 AM, "Enemy Mobile Unit Discovered!" The telegram broke the silence. The ○○ Attack Force immediately prepared to attack, anxiously awaiting the order to depart. However, the departure order never came. Instead, the order was to stand by. The enemy escaped the action area of our blitzkrieg force. We, who were full of confidence in victory, were very disappointed. Each time the enemy mobile unit appeared, they would immediately flee upon seeing us. This greatly displeased us.

### Enemy Mobile Unit Discovered

However, at 00:00 AM on May 6th, we received another message: "Enemy Mobile Unit Discovered!" The enemy was lurking there, surely with some intention! We cannot but decisively destroy this enemy.

"Ah! The enemy mobile unit is out!"

"Good! We won't let them escape this time!"

"They're coming out so boldly; it must be their death day!"

My comrades were already predicting that victory belonged to us.

"Aircraft ○ Team, assemble!" This order was received in all the rooms.

"The order is down. Are we preparing to attack?"

That question was on everyone's energetic face.

In groups of three or four, their faces excited, they were talking about the mobile unit.

"It seems to be a very large force!"

"The telegram from the aircraft said that there are four battleships, one or two aircraft carriers, ten cruisers, and more than ten destroyers!"

"Goodness, the entire Pacific Fleet is here!"

"Never mind. The four battleships and two aircraft carriers are the most important. Let's sink them first."

Among us, without a word, we knew that the battle was gradually maturing, and the decisive battle was about to begin. That decisive battle will be carried out by our hands.

"Each squad, line up!"

We learned the details of the enemy's situation from the pilots. The situation of the battle. We were ready for the surprise attack, but waited and waited for the order, which finally came down. The arrow left the string. The airfield immediately turned into a busy battlefield.

Those transporting torpedoes, those preparing to launch angles, those loading fuel, those maintaining the engines, each person, according to their assigned work, with bloodshot eyes, used skilled methods to run back and forth and work.

The torpedoes were brought in. The souls of the torpedo crew were entrusted to the torpedoes. Under the thin layer of paint, they faintly and sharply emitted the luster of precision. One glance was enough to know how much power they contained! Once launched, they were bound to hit. No matter how strong the giant ship, it would be shattered in one hit. The torpedo crew was praying:

"How can we launch it to hit the target?"

For this, they forgot about eating and sleeping, focusing their entire nervous system on maintaining the torpedoes.

And we were also praying: "How can we hit the target?" So, we stroked the head of the torpedo like stroking the heads of children.

The location was bad, and unlike the units in the homeland, everything was at hand. Eating and drinking were hasty. The comrades overcame all the adverse conditions with their mental strength and gradually equipped themselves.

The sun was sinking towards the western horizon, and in the twilight, a glimpse of bright sky still clung to it, unwilling to leave. The surrounding scenery soon changed completely. The night covered the sea. Quietly, the sound of insects could be heard from there. However, in a battlefield under a blackout, bright lights could not be lit. We could only work under dim electric lights. Thus, in the darkness, one after another, preparations were quickly completed.

"It's finished now. It's very reliable!"

All obstacles were completely overcome by my comrades. After that, there was only the waiting for the order to depart. The faces of the comrades, after finishing their hard work, reflected joy.

In the sky, before it was completely dark, I had prepared the engine in its entirety. "Now it's good. No matter how we fly! We can rest assured." Fuel and torpedoes had also been loaded. The battle preparations for my beloved aircraft were completely completed.

Late at night. Countless fireflies. Aircraft intertwined. Flickering on and off. Under the bright shining of the Southern Cross, I felt the sweat-soaked skin on my back and the night wind blowing in gusts. In my heart, I was thinking that if I could take a bath before participating in the great naval battle, my spirit would be even better; however, when I thought about the inconvenient battlefield, where there was not even a sip of water to drink, I could only lie down with my clothes on, ready for the order to come at any time.

The duty non-commissioned officer announced the schedule for tomorrow. "Scouting aircraft ○, depart at ○:○○!"

"Assault team, line up at ○:○○! Everyone, wake up at four o'clock!"

Tomorrow we would fight to the death with the American fleet representing 100 million people. We held great expectations, praying silently:

"Tomorrow we must find a way to meet the American fleet!"...

After the blood of the sea eagles burning with the spirit of battle boiled, it was not easy to calm them down. I reluctantly lay down in anxiety. The thought of the battle tomorrow made me too excited to sleep soundly. I could only count one, two, three, four... I fell asleep unconsciously.

### Morning of Departure

Dawn broke, May 7th, 4:00 PM.

"Everyone, wake up!"

I kicked off the blanket and jumped up.

In the southern country's morning, the sky was not yet bright. The bright moon still hung in the sky. Countless stars were twinkling. The autumn breeze was blowing, and the air was very fresh. I stretched out my hands, stretched, and took a breath of fresh air. In the homeland, spring had not completely passed yet! But here, winter would soon be here.

The aircraft was covered with morning mist, lying there quietly.

Suddenly, the sound of the engine turning broke the silence of dawn and roared.

I ran to the side of the aircraft. I started the motor and turned the engine.

Today was the day that would decide my life. Whether I live or die, only God knows.

"My beloved aircraft! Please give it your best shot. Fight!"

I stroked my beloved aircraft and prayed in my heart.

The results of the motor test run were very good. There were no obstacles. The engine, on which my life depended, could be used with confidence, no matter how long it was used. However, I still carefully checked each part, as small as a needle, as big as a bolt. If there were any problems, the lives of several pilots would be in danger. Because I felt the importance of my own duty—directly preparing the engine—I carefully checked it. So, together with the ground crew, I cleaned the aircraft for the naval battle as if I were tidying up my own clothes.

X number of mobile units had already moved their propellers and taken off. They were heading in the direction of the reconnaissance line. The direction of the naval battle had a great relationship with the reconnaissance unit. If one of them discovered something, I believed it would surely make our operations favorable.

"Line up!"

The crew members nervously lined up.

The captain told us about the enemy situation and the precautions that should be taken during the attack, telling us to wait for thirty minutes before we could depart. This thirty-minute wait made us a little disappointed.

"Ah! We're going to be caught in the net again today!"

I shook my head uncomfortably and bent over, practicing aircraft operations.

"At least I'm going to sink one with one shot today."

I would sink one, even if I died without regret.

"We must sink them!"

The determination to die was overflowing from the faces of my comrades.

"Altitude ○○, speed ○○, distance ○○, launch! Evacuate at ○○ full speed!"

"As soon as we get close to the enemy ship, the gunner will use the machine gun to strafe and kill everyone who appears on the deck!"

"The gunner had already aimed the machine gun and was ready to shoot. If we encountered the enemy, we would definitely bomb and sink several battleships. If some of us couldn't return safely, our comrades would definitely avenge them to comfort their souls in heaven. They would laugh with joy when they saw us sink large battleships and aircraft carriers, even in the darkness!

We were eager to depart, running around anxiously, waiting for the departure order. My comrades became impatient, and often ran to the aircraft to check the torpedo loading status and inspect the various parts of the engine.

What was the reconnaissance aircraft doing? There was no report back.

### Departure

"Line up!" The whole line!

This command echoed in every corner of the airfield.

"This is truly a sortie. Column ○○1, start engines, form

I started the engine and lined up the plane in ○○1 squadron. The engines of the elite planes roared together.

The propellers spun rapidly, bathing in the sharp light of the morning sun, reflecting a strong, dazzling silver light.

"Line up!" Commander ○○ Captain, slowly ascended the platform, issuing orders.

"Several enemy fighters have appeared!" "According to the telegram, the enemy mobile force is approaching us. ○○ aircraft are searching for the enemy. We will now also go out to search and attack the enemy mobile force."

On each person's face, a tense yet joyful expression floated, their eyes shining with an unusual brilliance.

How fortunate we are! To be born as men, and to be able to participate in this glorious naval battle.

The unit commander issued simple and strict attack orders to the airmen!

"The enemy is gradually approaching. From now on, we begin our search and attack. I hope everyone will remain calm, composed, fierce, and decisive, displaying the skills honed in daily training with a hundred percent accuracy. XX squadron is also launching. However, this squadron has no assistance. We should independently destroy the enemy fleet, and must not fall behind others! Finally, I wish you all success! Depart!"

As the time of departure was approaching, those departing and those seeing them off, grasped hands tightly in a moment of excitement:

"Ah! You're going off to war! Be sure to return safely!"

Though they said this, they did not necessarily hope for survival. Thinking that this farewell might be the last with the battle companions who had maintained the same aircraft for a long time, their hearts were filled with an indescribable emotion.

The engine was started again, and after confirming that everything was in order, it was handed over to the pilot, and the plane gradually departed. The battle companions who remained behind, lined up on both sides of the runway, to see us off into the sky. The battle companions stood in the billowing sand, waving their caps, and we waved back in response:

"We're going out to fight! We will definitely return victorious!"

Having left the squadron, whether we live or die, we only know to complete the mission, to do our best and await fate.

The aircraft squadron gradually left the land in the desert. Below, was the airfield where we had lived and worked for so long.

Saying a final farewell to the airfield, we bravely advanced toward the battlefield. Forming a squadron, we searched for the enemy in the boundless sea.

The military assault force was charging forward.

The blue sea connected to the sky. Patches of white clouds lined up one after another, and as far as the eye could see, there was nothing but the sea and sky.

In the midst of it, a large formation advanced bravely, filled with the spirit of hitting the target with every shot. Riding the Yamato spirit, they went to attack.

The clear blue sea of the South, the scorching sun, shone brilliantly, it was truly a beautiful time. Wasn't the atmosphere on that day, February 20th, when XX aircraft were dispatched to search for the same enemy mobile force over the South Sea, just like today?

In that naval battle, the enemy's aircraft carrier was sunk by us, but we also lost nine aircraft to kamikaze attacks. Many battle companions became guardian deities of the nation. The thought of revenge arose spontaneously. If we were to destroy the enemy fleet, how happy the comrades at Yasukuni Shrine would be!

### Waiting for "Enemy Spotted!"

At 8:05 AM, the search aircraft sent a telegram:

"Enemy sighted, at 150 degrees from Panay Island, 130 miles, heading 30 degrees."

The telegraph operator grabbed the telegram.

Ah, we have been waiting for this news of "Enemy Sighted!" for a long time.

The intelligence officer marked the enemy's route on the map according to the telegram, and determined the expected location and estimated time of the naval battle.

The telegraph operator watched the receiver, waiting for orders and enemy information reported by the search aircraft.

The search aircraft's second telegram arrived:

Enemy position, 145 degrees from Panay Island, 165 miles

The enemy seems to be trying to attack our base, gradually approaching the base

The expected time of the naval battle is between 12:00 and 1:00 PM. Our fate will be decided in three hours.

At an altitude of several thousand meters, we peered at the sea, searching for the enemy. Upon seeing a ripple like a white ribbon, we immediately became tense.

The search aircraft sent another telegram: "Two battleships, two heavy cruisers, two destroyers, speed 20 knots."

Then: "The heavy cruisers are ahead of the two battleships, eh, where are the aircraft carriers?"

The aircraft carriers were nowhere to be seen. That was strange.

Yesterday's telegram said there were four battleships, two aircraft carriers, and more than ten heavy cruisers. Where did the rest go?

The staff in the aircraft seemed displeased that the numbers were different from what was reported in yesterday's telegram.

"It's a shame that the aircraft carriers aren't there!"

But today, we will personally witness the enemy's masts being destroyed in the sunset over the sea, not in a dream.

Looking through the window, the engines on both sides sounded imposing and extremely stable.

At X:XX, the search aircraft sent another telegram: "175 degrees from Panay Island, 105 miles, heading 180 degrees, speed 30 knots." Complete contact.

We thanked the search aircraft and rushed forward.

The enemy changed course at 180 degrees, fleeing south at a high speed of 30 knots.

That was like a moth to a flame. They had already entered our assault aircraft's operational range. No matter how hard the enemy tried, they could not escape.

The warplanes became increasingly mature.

Soon, dark "battle clouds" covered our heads, and a torrential downpour descended. The drastic change in weather caused a slight inconvenience. Flying out from under the clouds at XX altitude, we dodged left and right and broke through the rain. Inside the aircraft, the raindrops leaped and rolled. (To be continued)

### The Tragedy of Life

— Yu Ruowen

A series of rustling sounds, "嚓嚓嚓嚓," suddenly arose from under the bed, startling Ah Ming, the coppersmith, from his sweet slumber. Although the sound was so faint as to seem insignificant, to Ah Ming, it sounded like the explosion of a five-hundred-pound bomb, frightening him and making him feel cold all over!

"Damn it, rats seeking divination, not a good omen!"

He quietly opened his sleepy eyes. He muttered. Then, he vigorously stomped his feet on the bed several times. The small animals under the bed seemed to "know better" and scurried into the corner of the room.

Lately, he had often heard this "rats seeking divination" sound. It was said to be a bad omen. Ah Ming originally did not believe in ghosts or spirits, and had always strongly opposed this so-called "rats seeking divination" nonsense. But in the past two years, after the death of his father and the incurable illness of his sister, he suddenly became a loyal believer in this "rats seeking divination" legend. Because in the days leading up to these two "major events," Ah Ming had heard that strange sound at night. From then on, he regarded the "嚓嚓" sound with both fear and hatred. Tonight, he heard this cursed sound again. Was something else about to happen? Ah Ming's heart began to feel uneasy.

He gently touched the child sleeping beside him, and felt that the child was sleeping peacefully. Only then did he slowly close his eyes. He was very clear that tonight he would be so alert that even such a faint sound would startle him awake. So the scene from last night vividly played out before his eyes, causing him to sigh painfully.

It was about seven or eight hours earlier, just as the sun had sunk below the horizon, and dusk was thickening. Ah Ming silently dragged his little Ah Ming, who had only been born a little over a month ago but was already as thin as a little monkey, to his child's mother's place on Tongfu Road to steal milk. The term "stealing milk" was not an exaggeration by the author, but was very "true to its name." Think about it: his own wife was a wet nurse for someone else's family, and her milk was supposed to be given to another child. Of course, his own child had no share. But this child was born unlucky. It was bad enough that he couldn't drink his own mother's milk, but his father didn't even have the money to buy him milk powder every day. So he dragged him to his biological mother's place to drink a little milk that he wasn't supposed to have. Wasn't that stealing? Even Ah Ming himself admitted that he was stealing, so every time he carried his child to steal milk, he always did it secretly and quietly. This time, of course, was no exception.

He walked to an agreed-upon alley on Tongfu Road, and after a short while, the child's mother hurriedly came running. Without even saying a word, she pulled out her breast and stuffed it into the child's mouth.

"Sigh, I feel like the child is getting thinner every day—look, he's already terribly thin!... Is he eating milk powder?... Alas! Milk powder is so expensive... Poor child!" Ah Ming's wife hugged the child tightly, tears falling drop by drop.

"He eats some rice porridge, but he hasn't wanted to eat much these past few days," Ah Ming said worriedly.

"Doesn't want to eat much?..."

But before she could finish speaking, Ah Ming's wife's expression suddenly changed! She saw her employer's mistress coming in from the alley entrance.

She quickly handed the child back to Ah Ming. The child was sucking contentedly, but suddenly the milk in his mouth was pulled away, and he frowned heavily.

At this time, the employer's mistress, her face ashen, was standing in front of them. She pointed at Ah Ming's wife and scolded fiercely:

"Good! You have the audacity to come outside to feed your own child! I gave you freedom to come and go, originally because I thought highly of you, trusted you, but I never imagined you would be so heartless! I ask you, are you trying to kill my child! Let me tell you, I've been following you secretly many times already, and today I finally caught you!"

"Mistress!..." Ah Ming's wife was so frightened that she couldn't say a word.

"Very good! Very good! Leave tomorrow! Good food and good meals I give you, is to feed another child! Saying that, the employer's mistress angrily went back.

"These wet nurses are really detestable!" One of the bystanders muttered.

"Alas! This is truly a multi-layered social question!" Another young man sighed.

Ah Ming had no heart to listen to any more of their words. He hurriedly dragged the child back home. Regardless of the child's hunger, cold, or heat, he simply collapsed on the bed. Reliving the events of last night in a flash, Ah Ming sighed weakly again. At the same time, he felt all the cells in his body seemed to be expanding, expanding. He yawned, stretched his legs, and snores came from his nostrils again.

But not long after, Ah Ming was awakened by another terrifying sound. He opened his eyes. The room was already bright. He only saw his wife, Ah Ming's wife, squatting by the bed, pushing the child on the bed, and crying desperately. He suddenly asked blankly:

"What's wrong with the child...?"

"What's wrong with the child! You dead ghost! The child has already stopped breathing! You're still lying there... Ah! My darling, my darling, Mom shouldn't have left you! Ah, my darling, you died so tragically... My darling. My little darling..."

Ah Ming's wife wailed while banging her feet on the floor.

"But you... how did you come back now?..." Ah Ming was already stunned. He never expected the child to die at this time. Even more, he never expected that he would be so muddleheaded that he didn't even know when the child had stopped breathing. Especially unexpected was that his wife would come home at this very moment. He steeled himself and asked falteringly.

"How could I not come back! Have you forgotten what happened last night? The employer's mistress canceled my job. No matter how I pleaded, I couldn't get her to change her mind, so I had no choice but to go home. But when I came in and saw the child, he was already dead, and his body was already ice-cold. It seems he had been dead for a long time. You useless corpse! How could you be so muddleheaded... My darling, my darling, Mom harmed you, didn't give you milk to eat, starved you... My darling..."

Ah Ming stared unblinkingly at the child's corpse on the bed, tears flowing uncontrollably!

### Son of a Farmer

— Xu Yang

I am a farmer's son, not knowing the end of hardship, living a life like endless hard labor, the plow and the harrow are my shackles; I do not raise my head to look at the sky, only silently watch the rice paddy field, the moon's reflection quivers slightly, returning with a shoulder of sunset, going to caress the ox before sleeping.

### Quiet Night

— Zhao Xiang

Closing the book, stretching, yawning, I seem to have been on a magical dream tour!

I find the surroundings so quiet, the city noises of the day gone, the whole world as if fallen into a death trap.

The only clock, reaching ten fifteen, also stopped with a "clank," tired? Or maybe ?

The wind, slightly blowing in from the window, has a brain-cooling chill. The turbid mind begins to clear from the disorder. Suddenly, I feel: one rain makes autumn! The rain that was still drifting in the evening, has stopped since when I don't know.

The black sky, not a single small star shoots a faint ray of light, nor can I find the silver bud like a crescent moon!

Quickly close the windows, pull up the curtains, I want to cut off that wisp of fragile melancholy from the outside world. No longer sad for it!

There is only a faint light in the room, evenly falling on the walls, table, and floor, without a sound, as silent as an ancient temple in the deep mountains, and I am like an old monk in the ancient temple: doing ascetic practices: but with an ancient heart, I can not help but stir up a ripple, perhaps the six senses have not yet been cleared, the mind is still inevitably entangled with knowledge and feeling!

I often have bizarre and strange dreams, heavy like old bronze, fine like silver threads, light like fallen red petals, melancholic like purple lilacs—I am immersed in the realm of ideals, longing for the bright place, a wisp of light smoke sighed! However, when the whip of life lashes my back, I wake up from the pain, rub my heavy eyelids, I look up and see the scene of reality—a fierce arena of survival!

From that picture I see all kinds of strange faces, but after all I see one thing clearly: the cowardly fall, the fearful fall into the abyss of death, the shrinking are trampled underfoot, only the brave, sharpening their teeth forward, then step on a smooth road to victory!

Quiet night, but in my ears there is a sound of fighting!

### Classroom Jottings

— Shi Zhen

Walking into the classroom door, a buzzing, noisy sound echoes throughout the classroom. Clusters here and there, people talking and laughing about everything.

"Check! Check!... Good! Block the chariot, check!..." A very smug cry comes from a group of people by the window.

"Don't always, check with the chariot... block the chariot, check your ass!"

"Yeah, I said you can't check, what's the fun of this kind of chess. It's better to move the cannon..." One student complained. Bang! Someone hit another student on the back of the head, "Damn it! Who hit me? Don't get angry because you lost the chess," and he concentrated on the chess again.

"Haha! Good! Move this one, you won't have anything left, check..." Another student said excitedly. Several students were pulling him and pulling each other.

"Don't make so much noise? You'll mess up the good chess pieces, you should go and ask for compensation..."

"Who's making noise with you, it's your fault, look, move this one, checkmate... checkmate what?" A burst of chaotic noise.

"Good! Checkmate, at least you lose..."

"Don't be so proud, just because you know how to play," a game of chess ended with each arguing about who won and lost, one word after another.

Someone threw a ball at a student's head. Coincidentally, it bounced from this student's head to another student's head, causing a burst of laughter. He quickly picked it up, preparing to retaliate. A student kicked it away with his foot, and the classroom became a ball field.

A student got the ball, "Hey! Pass... pass! Quick!" A ball immediately went from one student's hand to another student's hand. Carelessly, it fell to the ground.

"Ah!. Grab it!... A group of students immediately crowded over, all pressing on the ball, some rolling on the ground.

"The class monitor is coming... The class monitor is coming!" "So what if the class monitor is here, what's wrong with playing ball!" The class monitor appeared at the door. Seeing a lot of students mixed up on the ground, shouting loudly: "What are you doing! What are you doing!" He ran up and pulled up the students who were pressing on the ground, "Stop fighting! Stop fighting! Don't blame me for not being polite, write small characters!" One student got up, straightened his clothes, and said with a smile: "Pretending like he didn't grab anything, see! ...Hey!" And threw the ball to another student again.

"If you throw again, two pages of small characters, don't regret it," the class monitor put on a dignified expression, so the students stopped and said behind their backs: "How boring. Write small characters, behaving like elementary school ... "Ai! Behaving like a big deal, write small characters...."

### Snippets

— Hui Chi

The thickness of the meeting cannot determine the size of a person's ability; conversely, the diligence of work can determine whether a person's future is bright or not.

A person who cannot grasp reality, diligently working, and only yearns for the future, ends up falling into the abyss of pain, never able to escape.

Young male and female students, without the word "love" hidden in their minds, wholeheartedly pursuing knowledge, the results are quite amazing. Conversely, spending all day immersed in the sweetness of love, studies gradually become neglected, the future gradually becomes dim, and contributions become pitifully scarce.

There is no eternal pain in the world, nor is there eternal happiness, because when suffering reaches its end, the sweet spring will constantly gush out, and conversely, when happiness reaches its peak, sad and bitter things will follow. This is mutual cause and effect, without any error.
