### Further Discussion on Jiangsu Provincial Politics

Since the Nationalist Government's return to the capital, public attention has been focused on the political measures of the central government, while neglecting those of local governments. In our observation, this perception stems partly from a subjective illusion that the central government is primary and the local government is secondary, believing that if the central government manages politics well, the local government will also do so. It is also partly due to an objective illusion that the world situation is constantly evolving in tension, and dealing with this tension is the responsibility of the central government, so everyone only pays attention to the central government's movements. However, in reality, the central and local governments have a relationship like that of lips and teeth, an inseparable whole. Therefore, local governments must earnestly cooperate in implementing the central government's policies in order to achieve their effectiveness. If local governments fail to cooperate in implementing central government policies, or even act independently in the opposite direction, the result will be a disruption of the system and the policies will not be implemented. Therefore, we should give local governments' political measures the same attention as the central government's.

We recently discussed the future of Jiangsu provincial politics, sincerely pointing out the various weaknesses of the past, hoping to correct them in the future. While the government should be held responsible for the existence of these weaknesses, it is also our inescapable shortcoming that our people's attention was focused on the central government while neglecting the local government, thus failing to urge for improvements at all times and in all places.

Now, Chen Qun has been specially appointed by the National Government to succeed as the Governor of Jiangsu Province. We firmly believe that he will bring about a new look and facilities to meet the expectations of the public. We hope that the central and local governments' policies will be unified and not disjointed. At the same time, we remind everyone to attach equal importance to local politics. Chen Qun has served as an official for a long time and has rich political experience. Now, having been transferred from the Minister of Interior to a local official, he will be able to handle the role with ease in theory. He naturally has a clear understanding of the advantages and disadvantages and the key points of the promotion of central and local politics, and has a clear plan in mind. However, driven by the desire to improve Jiangsu's politics in the future, we reiterate the few points we raised a few days ago as follows:

First, we emphasize the importance of the issue of personnel. Because currently, Chinese politics, undeniably, has not yet established a solid foundation of the rule of law. The talent and integrity of civil servants remain the biggest factors for good politics. Therefore, the future personnel matters of the provincial government should take "talent-only" as the standard for selection and evaluation. Existing personnel should be screened and retained or eliminated according to standards. For new entrants, there should be no regional bias, eliminate bureaucratic habits, and emphasize vigor and spirit.

Second, governing does not lie in empty words. Local politics should focus on promoting central government policies and be pragmatic. What people need most are practical benefits and virtuous governance, not high-sounding political programs or grand visions. We hope that those in power can grasp this public sentiment and work earnestly.

Third, although Jiangnan is a rice-producing area, the people of Jiangsu Province are still most distressed by the shortage of food. How to achieve the goal of increasing food production and reducing the suffering of the people of Jiangsu should be the first priority of virtuous governance in the future. We hope this will be seriously planned.

Jiangsu is where the national capital is located, where the famous commercial port of the East is located, the center of the country's economy and culture, playing a model role in national politics, and the most important province in the peaceful area. At the time of the reorganization of the provincial government, take this opportunity to thoroughly refresh politics and assume the important mission!

### Review of the Internal and External Situations of Various Countries in the Fifth Year of the European War (II)

Soviet Union

When the European War broke out, the Soviet Union joined hands with Germany, not participating in any of the belligerent countries, maintaining neutrality, and standing outside the whirlpool of war.

Post-War Issues - The Soviet Union Has a Part

After the start of the European War, Germany occupied the eastern half of Poland, Karelia, the three Baltic coastal countries, Serbia, and Pskov. Twenty-six months ago, the German-Soviet war broke out. On a three-thousand-kilometer-long front, an unprecedented continental offensive and defensive war in history unfolded. The Soviet Union alone bore the brunt of the German army's attack, becoming a major player in the European War, while Britain took this opportunity to gain a chance to breathe and recover. And indirectly helped the United States to have a European operation, that is, the Soviet Union's war power. From this point of view, the current Soviet Union is launching offensives on all fronts, and in order to facilitate wartime operations, it is not unreasonable to demand the immediate opening of a second front. However, in the public announcements of the Soviet-British Treaty in May last year and the Soviet-Turkish Treaty in June, although it was agreed to launch a second front against Germany in Europe in 1942, Britain broke its promise and failed to do so. Also, at the Casablanca Conference in January, it was decided to prepare for a second front before September this year, but to this day, no new front has been opened to threaten the rear of the German army.

Second Front - Longing

Related to this second front issue is the post-war issue that the Soviet Union has frequently mentioned in recent statements. The post-war issues advocated by Britain and the United States are by no means the embodiment of the Soviet Union's war plans. For example, the recent article "On War Aims" published by Minilin in the Zhenli Bao magazine "War and the Working Class" clearly shows the Soviet Union's attitude towards the post-war issue. Minilin said, "We have no war aims, but even so, some British and American people are discussing war aims and putting them on par with the post-war issue. If the post-war issue is to be raised, then the Soviet Union, which accounts for one-sixth of the earth, should of course participate." He sharply expressed the Soviet Union's unique views on Southeast Europe, including the Balkans. When this direction of speech is combined with the request for a second front, we can fully see the Soviet Union's intentions in the future development of the war.

### More Than 200,000 Italian Troops Completely Disarmed - Battleship "Roma" Sunk by German Aircraft

Berlin, September 12th, Central News Agency - To date, more than 200,000 people in Italy have laid down their weapons. The Italian military detachments in Greece and other regions of Southeast Europe are not included. The number of Italian troops joining the German army cannot be announced. The number of Italian troops in mainland Italy and Southeast Europe who voluntarily accept the control of the German command is increasing daily. According to careful estimates, to date, at least 25 to 30 regiments and many special detachments, including paratroopers, anti-aircraft artillery defense forces, and motorized units, as well as their officers, have joined. Some of the Italian troops in various ports have also voluntarily accepted the control of the German authorities.

Lisbon, September 12th, Central News Agency - The Allied Headquarters in North Africa has just admitted that the Italian battleship "Roma" (35,000 tons) was sunk by German aircraft today when it attempted to escape to Malta. The ship was built on September 13, 1938, and was completed after the outbreak of the current war. It is the newest battleship, possessing nine 15-inch main guns, twelve 3.5-inch anti-aircraft guns, carrying three aircraft, and a crew of 1,600.

Algeciras, September 11th, Central News Agency - Spanish news agency reports: As of the afternoon of the 11th, no Italian warships or merchant ships were seen in the port of Gibraltar.

Berlin, September 12th, Central News Agency - Havas News Agency military reporter Satorius said: After the Badoglio government of Italy surrendered to the enemy, the German army in Italy had a dual task. On the one hand, it had to disarm the Italian army, and its activities spread throughout Italy. If it encountered resistance from the Italian army, it had to overcome it after fierce fighting. On the other hand, it had to respond to the British and American forces landing in the south and occupy the coastal areas in time to prevent the enemy from landing in central and northern Italy. The events of the past 24 hours have proved that the German army has been able to grasp the situation. The work of disarming the Italian army has been largely completed and will soon be fully completed. More than one army corps of defense forces in Milan, Rome, and other places have all surrendered to the German army. Key areas such as Bora, Genoa, La Spezia, and the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Tyrrhenian Sea, and the Adriatic Sea have also fallen into the hands of the German army. At the same time, the German rearguard has successfully prevented the advance of the vanguard of the British Eighth Army in Calabria. The landing of British and American troops in the Gulf of Taranto has been met by the German army, and their actions have been hindered. At the same time, part of the German army under General Kesselring has begun to attack. The battle with the American Fifth Army landing in the Gulf of Salerno is as fierce as the battles in North Africa and Sicily. The Allied side has transferred the transport ship fleet that was originally sailing to other places for another landing to the Gulf of Salerno to assist in the battle. Enemy forces continue to land in the Gulf of Taranto and on the west coast of Apulia. It is estimated that the enemy forces will first occupy Apulia as a springboard for attacking the Balkans. It is still unknown whether the enemy forces there are reinforcements from the American Seventh Army or are mainly British troops. It is now known that the main force of the British Eighth Army is based in northern Calabria and is advancing along the west coast towards the Gulf of Salerno. One enemy force is planning to advance towards Taranto. The enemy's vanguard and the German rearguard are in contact. Generally speaking, the enemy has abandoned its original plan to maintain its main force three days ago and is now planning to land in southern Italy as much as possible. As for the German forces that have come into contact with the enemy, only a small number of troops. The main forces of General Kesselring and General Rommel are currently busy disarming the Italian army. This task is about to be completed, so a major battle may break out within days.

### Rommel Prepares for a Strong Resistance

Berlin, September 12th, Central News Agency - German commander in northern Italy, General Rommel, is making plans for resistance in northern Italy and will soon be at peace. The enemy is still using its tanks, aircraft, and its great war machine and will encounter strong resistance.

### Minister Hagiwara Delivers a Speech

Tokyo, September 12th, Central News Agency

Major General Hagiwara, Director of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, gave a speech on the 11th regarding the surrender of the Badoglio government of Italy to Britain and the United States. The main points of his speech were: "The world policy of Britain and the United States is to sacrifice other peoples in order to seek their own comfort, and to profit from the conflict between others. This is their golden rule. Therefore, they instigated China and Japan to fight each other in East Asia, and provoked Germany and the Soviet Union to fight in Europe. They use various tactics to exhaust the national strength of countries that hinder their world policy, and support the exiled governments of France, Poland, and Greece in Europe. This time, they are carrying out this conspiracy against Italy. The establishment of the Badoglio government is the most obvious example. Therefore, the surrender of the Badoglio government after the Italian coup is also the result of the British and American schemes. It is still remembered that in the late stage of World War I in 1918, Britain and the United States carried out extensive propaganda. According to British and American propaganda, it can be divided into five stages: public enlightenment, hopeful propaganda, propaganda of strife and opposition, and propaganda of inciting revolution. This time, they are repeating their old tricks on Italy, making the Italians feel desperate, creating war-weariness, and inciting the Italians to overthrow Mussolini and Fascism in order to achieve peace. Until recently, they forced Italy to surrender unconditionally, resulting in the Badoglio cabinet's betrayal of the Three-Power Alliance and the treaty of not making a separate peace, stopping the war against Britain and the United States, and taking hostile actions against Germany. This is not allowed by humans or gods. All of us in East Asia believe that the Badoglio faction is suffering from neurasthenia and mental illness due to the threat of war. They have left a stain on Italy's glorious history and caused their compatriots to shed blood in vain yesterday. The unconditional surrender of the Badoglio cabinet is despicable. However, Germany had long foreseen this and taken all necessary measures. After the Badoglio government defected, Germany has reduced a considerable burden in political and strategic terms, and can fully unleash its strength in future operations against Britain and the United States. However, as far as Chongqing is concerned, even if it stops resisting the war now in order to cope with the internal and external situations, it cannot be compared with the unconditional surrender of the Badoglio government, because the purpose of Chongqing's resistance has been achieved by the National Government. Because in the six years of Chongqing's resistance, Chairman Chiang has inherited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and abolished the unequal treaties. China's pursuit of independence and freedom has been realized. Today, what remains is only the joint effort of Greater East Asia and the nations of the world to build a new East Asia. Therefore, Chongqing should quickly participate in this great cause of the 20th century and jointly build East Asia."

### Foreign Minister Chu's Speech on Inspecting the Situation in Guangzhou

Guangzhou, September 12th, Central News Agency - Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Executive Yuan, came to Guangdong from Nanjing on the 9th to inspect the situation in Guangdong Province. He arrived in the province on the afternoon of the 10th. At 2:30 p.m. on the 12th, he met with Chinese and Japanese reporters at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association branch and answered the questions raised by the reporters separately. The main points are as follows: Guangdong is the source of the revolution, and comrades working in all aspects of the party, government, and military are extremely busy. All parties have made considerable progress. I had already heard about it in Nanjing. This is due to the efforts of Governor Chen and other colleagues, as well as the cooperation of friends. Therefore, there have been good results in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects. Although I have only been in Guangdong for three days this time, what I have seen and heard makes me feel that there has been great progress since my last visit to Guangdong. Now, I will summarize the questions raised by everyone and answer them as follows: Regarding the surrender of the Badoglio cabinet of Italy to Britain and the United States, we had already expected that the Badoglio cabinet of Italy would betray within three to five weeks after Prime Minister Mussolini resigned in late July. At that time, Badoglio stated that he would continue to resist the war, but it was only to prepare for the surrender. The betrayal of Badoglio this time is the same as the situation in Italy during the First World War and is not worthy of attention. It has no impact on the overall situation. At the same time, the Italian Fascist government has also been formally established in northern Italy. We are very pleased that well-known members of the Fascist Party will continue to work for the survival of Italy. The village cleansing work has now entered its third year. At the beginning, the village cleansing work was launched in Jiangsu Province. The National Government established a Village Cleansing Committee to handle everything, with Li Shiqun as the Secretary-General. Therefore, Li made great contributions to the village cleansing work. We deeply mourn his death this time. Later, the area of the village cleansing area was expanded to Zhejiang and Shanghai. This year, the village cleansing agency was transferred to the Executive Yuan, and the village cleansing work has been strengthened, people's livelihoods have been stabilized, public security has been ensured, and the people have been able to live and work in peace. The village cleansing work is continuing to be carried out, and the area will be further expanded. The New National Movement has now moved from theoretical propaganda to practice. The youth military movements and production increase movements in various places are very active, especially in Guangdong Province, where the results are the best. I had already heard about it in Nanjing. The training of young people in various schools can be said to be a model for the whole country. In this Greater East Asia War, the training of young people is an extremely important task. The authorities in various places are working hard to promote the production increase movement, and the results are also quite good. Therefore, since the National Government joined the war, due to the promotion and implementation of the New Movement, our country's human and material resources have been stronger than before. With this cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, the Greater East Asia War will be completed soon.

### Zhejiang Agricultural Agencies Placed Under the Management of the Department

Jiaxing, September 12th, Central News Agency - The first high-level village cleansing zone in Zhejiang Province has entered the strengthening stage.

### Thailand and Myanmar Issue Statements on the Surrender of the Badoglio Cabinet

Bangkok, September 12th, Central News Agency - Prime Minister Phibun broadcast a speech on the evening of the 11th entitled "Thoughts on Italy," the main points of which are as follows: I express my deepest sympathy for the misfortunes of the Italian people. The collapse of Italy this time is due to the lack of unity among the Italian people. Therefore, Italy has become a battlefield for Germany and Britain and the United States, Germany and Italy, and even fellow countrymen to kill each other. The Thai people should unite to fight, overcome all difficulties and enemy strategies, and absolutely trust the leaders and the government to move towards the final victory.

Yangon, September 12th, Central News Agency - The Burmese government convened a special cabinet meeting on the 11th. All cabinet ministers, including Prime Minister Ba Maw, attended and reviewed the situation in Italy. A statement was issued in the afternoon as follows: "The unconditional surrender of the Badoglio government of Italy to Britain and the United States has no impact on the Burmese people's belief in final victory. In this great war, changes in the situation are inevitable, but the fundamental spiritual and material preparation is an indispensable requirement. This is the key to determining the final victory or defeat. Burma, based on this principle, is fighting together with Japan, Germany, and other allied countries. Only victory can preserve our existence. If the country does not exist, everything else will be reduced to nothing. Finally, for this serious situation, we will support Japan, which supports Burma's independence, and will do our best to achieve our common war goals and work together to the end."

### The Serious Problem of Buying Books

— Ao Ao

The Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers have enthusiastically managed the student aid movement, reducing the burden on many poor parents and relieving the suffering of many out-of-school children.

Tuition has been taken care of, but it is still not enough to study without books. Although the problem of books is much simpler and should not be a problem, the reality is not necessarily the case.

We will not talk about the past, book fees are several times higher than before. We will temporarily ignore that as well. What deserves close attention at the moment is the doubling of prices on September 2nd.

A certain printing house, an authority in the book industry, and a certain bookstore, a leader in the pirated edition business, surprisingly implemented a complete "double price" for all textbooks starting on September 2nd. Although printing books with white paper was discounted by 30%, it is said that this 30% discount is only a temporary "favor," and soon there will be "no more 30% discount." In any case, books like Yilin Paper are guaranteed to double in price.

Since the implementation of the purchase of gauze, all prices have been trending downstream, which is true. White paper and other papers also seem to be following the price limits and have not increased in price. To say that the price is doubled because of printing, binding, and other reasons does not seem to have sufficient reason.

A book that cost ten yuan now costs twenty yuan, and a book that cost fifty yuan now costs one hundred yuan. A semester that originally required buying five hundred yuan worth of books now requires one thousand yuan if bought on September 2nd. To say that such a shocking change in one day is still a legitimate profit, then we have nothing to say except to admire their previous willingness to sacrifice.

However, it seems that we should say something else. Poor students still have a special 10% discount, but how is this 10% discount calculated? Is adding one times the price and then discounting by 10% not the same as adding 80%?

Bookstores do not bear the direct responsibility of education, so they cannot be compared with schools, nor can they be dealt with in the same way as "school stores." However, in any case, they should be a part of the cultural industry. The rise and fall of the complex cultural industry is clearly closely related to this link, so it cannot be purely for profit. Reading is not entertainment, books are not cosmetics or luxury goods, and students are not profit-making objects. It seems that one should not be exploited in this way in order to obtain spiritual food.

We believe that there are many people of insight in the book industry, and there are many people with extremely high reputations in the education and cultural circles. We sincerely hope that they will automatically reduce the selling price, and we sincerely hope that the authorities will spare some energy from their busy schedule to correct this. We also hope that the public will closely monitor this. Although they do not have a direct stake in it, relatives and friends will always have children who need to buy books for their studies. We believe that with the force of supervision and attention, all distorted and unreasonable phenomena will be eliminated.

### After the Price of Cigarettes Increased, Profits Increased, and the Number of People Buying Rations Decreased

The Thames News reports: Since the Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association increased the price of rationed cigarettes on September 9th, the queues in front of the cigarette exchange shops every morning when selling rationed cigarettes have almost completely disappeared. At the same time, black market activity in cigarettes has also decreased. As a result, the fixed market price method has also achieved results. According to the Thames News reporter, an investigation of various retail cigarette shops revealed that they are making considerable profits from cigarettes such as Daqianmen, Meili, and Laodao. At the same time, because the supply of goods has increased, domestic goods cannot be hoarded. After the price limit was raised, the profit margin of wholesalers increased from 5% to 7%, and the profit margin of retailers increased from 15% to 20%.

### Shen Bao Letter to the Business Community

To the attention of the industrial and commercial circles: Shanghai's industrial and commercial enterprises have always been prosperous. In the past, there were specially compiled and published directories such as credit directories, which were convenient for review. In recent years, there have been many new creations and changes, but there is still a lack of detailed investigation and systematic records. Moreover, due to the high cost of paper and labor, few new editions have been published, making it inconvenient to check and reference. This newspaper, in view of this, plans to start compiling a "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Directory," striving for comprehensive collection and accurate investigation. It has repeatedly received assistance from industrial and commercial associations and people from all walks of life, either by providing information or introducing surveys. However, the purpose of compiling this directory is to facilitate reference for the industrial and commercial circles, so the investigation records must be as detailed and accurate as possible. We hereby make another public announcement, requesting all factories, workshops, companies, and firms in this city (regardless of the size of capital or the scope of business, all industrial and commercial enterprises are welcome) to provide accurate survey information. The content of the information should mainly include the following items: Name, Address, Telephone, Telegraph, Mailbox, etc., Date of Establishment, Organization (company, partnership, sole proprietorship, etc.), Type of Business, Names of Important Officers, such as Chairman, Directors, Supervisors, Managers, Deputy Managers, Factory Directors, Directors, etc., Shop Owners, Shareholders, etc. Please provide detailed item-by-item information and send it directly to the "Industrial and Commercial Directory Information Department" of this newspaper so that it can be incorporated accordingly. From the standpoint of this newspaper, it can achieve the goal of being detailed and accurate. From the standpoint of industry and commerce, it not only indirectly promotes business but also gains recognition from all sectors, which is tantamount to free advertising. We firmly believe that people in the industrial and commercial circles will understand and be happy to assist. Compilation and printing are imminent. Please fill out and submit the information as soon as possible. Shen Bao News Agency respectfully announces.

### Ample Salt Allotment for Vegetable Industry; Approved by Salt Authorities

The Shanghai Special Municipality Vegetable Bean Sprout Industry Association, after someone impersonated the association and was investigated by the authorities, has been approved by the Ministry order to maintain the original state. The chairman of the association, Chen Xialin, has been working tirelessly to rectify the association's affairs, sparing no effort. Recently, due to the soaring prices of vegetables and food in the market, the general public uses pickled vegetables as the main food to accompany meals. The reason for pickled vegetables is that they can not only save cooking oil and salt, but also can be eaten raw or cooked, and have become a popular food for the people. At this time, when fresh cabbage and snow vegetables are on the market, the general members of the association have been asking the association for salt by the jin for days in order to meet the needs of preparing for pickling. After learning of the situation, the chairman immediately presented the case to the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and the Songjiang District Salt Affairs Administration for approval to register and allocate salt, which has been approved by the authorities to provide ample allocation.

Shanghai Market Conditions for Finance, Industry, and Commerce Last Week

Shanghai's financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions were generally lower last week. Also, with raised, there was still no normal transaction. Money supply, through the Central Bank and the United Reserve Bank, was supposed to be loosened as much as possible in the interbank lending business. But due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival settlement period, the balance of payments was still tight. The listed interest rate has always been 2.3 cents. Public bonds and stocks have slightly increased due to the situation. The market prices of various commodities have declined due to the increasingly tight control work of the authorities. The officially set market price for rice and sugar rationed per capita remained unchanged. People's hearts were calm, probably because the rationing was about to be implemented generally. In particular, the Rice and Grain Control Committee established by the authorities is actively preparing, and there will be responsible persons in charge of rice and grain regulation in the future, so the supply of people's food will not be lacking.

### Banking Industry Organizes Zhejiang East Financial Investigation Group

In order to develop trade in eastern Zhejiang, the banking industry decided to send representatives from the banking and money industry associations, together with relevant parties, to organize a Zhejiang East Financial Investigation Group to conduct on-site investigations in Jinhua first. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency recently learned from the financial community that the organization of the investigation group has become concrete, and the list of members has also been determined. They will go to Hangzhou and then to Jinhua from Shanghai within days.

Mass Life

### The Life of an Office Worker

— Mu Tao

I am an employee of a public utility, and my monthly salary is only 430 yuan. In addition, the company gives each of us an extra rationed rice purchase certificate (this certificate can be used to buy 1.35 dou of whole rice at the price of household rice each month), but there are a total of four people in my family, and we all rely on this money to live each month. I have no other income, so I have to take on at least 400 yuan of debt each month!

It's really true that you don't know the price of firewood and rice until you're running a household. Seeing my two children always being very lively and playing all day long, but as a father, I have to think hard for several hours every night about the next day's life until I am unable to think, and then I fall asleep.

This kind of suffering of living in the ninth hour every night is really impossible to understand without experiencing it personally. Like my life in the past two years, I never dreamed of going out to see a movie once during holidays or free time to relieve boredom. I have never used side dishes to stop my children from crying. I have never thought about the worn-out and unfashionable clothes of myself and my family. In addition, if illness befalls any of my family members, I can only resign myself to fate and endure it.

I often hear people say that the best way to solve life's problems is to "increase income and reduce expenditure." In my current situation, there is nothing more to save in terms of expenditure, so I can only think of ways to increase income. Therefore, I would like to find a side job, hoping to earn more money to supplement the household. However, many things I have tried, they (the officials) have already prepared. The so-called recruitment, registration, interview, and other affairs are just for them to deal with the shareholders. I have also heard people in the examination room ask for things like "I can do without salary if I can get room and board." Naturally, people like me who need salary the most are the easiest to fail. My eloquence is not fluent, and I have little social interaction, so the business of being a guest is out of the question. My body is so weak that I went to Jiangwan to carry rice last winter. Although I made some money, I fell on the bed for several days after returning home. I don't dare to ask for advice on hard work from now on. At the same time, I am also too incompetent myself, and I have few friends to help me. Of course, it is more difficult than climbing to the sky if I want to achieve something.

This situation is definitely not common among my friends. They think that the life of an office worker is not so comfortable, at least it can be lived through, but I am worried and distressed all day long. I am afraid that the general public in the society can not understand it easily!

### The Yamazaki Unit on Attu Island: Eighteen Days and Nights of Heroic Battle; Courageous Spirit Even the Enemy Admired

The heroic sacrifice of the Yamazaki Unit on Attu Island is sufficient to demonstrate the great spirit of the Imperial Army. This earth-shattering and soul-stirring battle truly inspired unparalleled fear in the American enemy and earned the admiration and praise of people worldwide. Unit Commander Colonel Yasuyo Yamazaki, along with over two thousand officers and soldiers, must have been on that isolated island in the North Sea, with hearts of stone, fully believing in the victory of the Empire, and calmly sacrificed themselves. This reporter wishes to use my clumsy pen to recount the eighteen days and nights of the Yamazaki Unit's struggle at death's door, as a warning to those at home.

May 12, 1943, enemy aircraft began indiscriminate bombing from 2:00 AM. Ever since the Imperial Army occupied the island on June 8th of the previous year, the American forces, attempting to reverse their decline, relied on their superior number of aircraft to bomb the island day and night. The intensity, as the Yamazaki Unit described it, was like "Roosevelt's conviction," but the defending troops remained unmoved. The most intense bombing occurred on this day, May 12th. Unit Commander Yamazaki immediately realized that it was a prelude to enemy landing. He then issued an order:

Order to Mobilize All Troops

"All troops mobilize!"

Behind the high grounds everywhere, and hidden in the deep trenches, the soldiers prepared to kill the enemy. The wildfire in their hearts began to burn fiercely. The long-awaited final duel had finally arrived. The soldiers spontaneously shouted, "Americans, just you wait!" The enemy's bombing increased and intensified. At this time, the sky over the Aleutian Islands at 2:00 AM was already bright. On Attu Island, gradually brightening through the clouds and mist, due to the increasing distribution of propaganda by enemy aircraft, it felt as if the god of night had descended again. Countless enemy aircraft flew to our positions, dropping leaflets. They were ridiculous attempts to instigate surrender.

"Are the American soldiers going crazy? Take those leaflets back to Washington and sweep them away!"

Early that morning, soldiers monitoring the northern part of the island discovered a fleet of ships fully loaded with American soldiers advancing toward Holtz Bay in the fog. After receiving this report, Unit Commander Yamazaki immediately ordered all soldiers to deploy along the coast of the bay. At this point, the gunfire of both sides crisscrossed, and the rumbling of artillery shook the valleys. In an instant, Attu Island, slumbering in the mist, became a battlefield of decisive battle.

At 10:30 AM, relying on their overwhelming advantage, the enemy concentrated a large number of boats in Massacre Bay on the southern part of the island, began to spread out and land, and engaged in fierce and brutal combat with our forces. At 7:00 PM, the American forces landing in Holtz Bay in the north of the island advanced along the west coast of the bay, engaging our first-line defensive units in close combat. Similarly, on the Massacre Bay side, the main enemy forces, after the initial landing, continuously increased their strength.

The attackers were aggressive, but the defenders did not show weakness. On the first (12th) and second days of the American landing, the Imperial Army truly demonstrated the unparalleled spirit of the Imperial soldiers. This was especially true for the annihilation battle carried out against the invading forces landing in the eastern part of the island. In the afternoon, our first-line defensive units discovered enemy forces moving in the fog and rushing towards the coast of Sarana Bay. The timid enemy soldiers, before even discovering us, had already wasted bullets. Our troops waited in silence. After a short while, enemy boats, one by one, approached the shore and prepared to land. We did not miss this excellent opportunity and opened fire on the enemy. The enemy soldiers, caught by surprise, fell in the boats, in the water, and on the beach. The screams of the American soldiers, the sound of gunfire, and the echoes of boats being blown up... it was simply a hell of wailing ghosts and howling wolves. The surviving American soldiers used the boats as shields and advanced towards us.

"Charge!"

The captain shouted this, and then first drew his sword and charged into the enemy ranks. The battle cries filled the beach.

Encouraged by the arrogant battle cry of "certain victory, certain conquest," the American soldiers, who had come from afar, saw this Japanese "human bullet" tactic, and charged left and right, attempting to escape. Our unrelenting mortars and bloody bayonet fighting caused the enemy to fall in disarray, crying out in pain. After ○ hours, no enemy soldiers could be seen on this beach.

On the 13th, the American forces, forgetting their miserable defeat of the previous day, again attempted to land in Sarana Bay. On this day, the confident Imperial Army also braved the artillery fire and repelled the enemy at the water's edge. From then on, until the Yamazaki Unit's complete sacrifice, the enemy dared not attempt to land again at Sarana Bay.

Frontal Night Assault Battle

In this critical situation, Unit Commander Yamazaki stubbornly defended the position, hoping to annihilate the enemy in the darkness of night and achieve a surprise attack. The nights in the Aleutian Islands come late and are short-lived. The intent was to use such a dark night to strike the enemy. After sunset, our army first launched a fierce attack against the enemy on the Massacre Bay front. The traditional night assault of the Imperial Army was fully and bravely demonstrated on this isolated island in the North Sea. Amidst the shouts of our army, the enemy's ranks were disrupted under the melee and bayonet fighting. The enemy soldiers fled in disarray, clutching their heads and screaming in pain. After such a night assault, the enemy retreated one to two kilometers.

The sky on the 13th, which was slightly less foggy than yesterday, allowed for visibility of three to four hundred meters on the ground. Because the enemy's landing on the eastern coast had been repelled twice yesterday, and three companies of enemy soldiers had been annihilated once on the southern coast, while our forces were facing the enemy on the northern and western coasts, our soldiers were in high spirits, with the strength to reach the stars.

From early on the 13th, the enemy again fired at us intensely, with bullets falling like rain. Artillery shells stirred up sand and stones, causing the valley to change completely in an instant. Our army often took the opportunity to launch surprise attacks, inflicting great losses on the enemy. The enemy's attacks on the southern coast were particularly fierce. Our troops decided to strike them hard first, thereby preserving the original position. At noon, the enemy launched a unified artillery bombardment from the northern and southern coasts, with the fiercest fire on the southern coast directed at the summit of Massacre Valley, strongly attacking our positions. The enemy had twice as many soldiers as we did, fired ten times as many bullets as we did, and had naval gun bombardment from the sea, which we lacked. Furthermore, there were aerial bombardments, which we also lacked. Our side, under such fire and bombardment on this day, still maintained its position and did not yield an inch. The enemy's attacks near the high ground in Holtz Bay in the northern part of the island were extremely fierce. Although our army suffered considerable losses, it did not retreat a step. Our army, occupying the high ground on the southern coast, faced off against the enemy entrenched on the northwest high ground of Massacre Bay, and as a result, two enemy companies were destroyed by our bombardment.

As night fell on the 13th, the enemy had reinforced many more troops on the northern coast, and they seemed to be well-trained in climbing mountains. At the same time, relying on their numerical superiority, they continued to advance. In Holtz Bay and Massacre Bay, enemy fleets, with battleships as flagships, moved back and forth, threatening our army. This phenomenon could be seen where the smoke dissipated.

Enemy Warships Fled in Panic

At that time, a strange phenomenon occurred. Our guard units monitoring from the high ground in Massacre Bay on the southern coast saw enemy destroyers from that day on in Massacre Bay. The enemy warships were anchored, constantly bombarding our positions. At noon, one of the anchored destroyers suddenly began to move and quickly sailed towards the direction of the anchorage. Our troops thought that the enemy warship was moving to another location, but the enemy warship was rapidly moving towards the land.

"What's going on?"

None of our defending troops understood the mystery. At this moment, a tall and powerful column of water suddenly surged up on the port side of the enemy warship.

"Submarine!"

"Our submarine!"

Reinforcements had arrived from the sea. Our submarine fired torpedoes from the sea. The enemy warship ran aground on the beach close to shore.

At the same time, a similar phenomenon of warship running aground occurred in Holtz Bay on the northern coast. This was when the enemy fleet was carrying out a fierce bombardment of our positions. Suddenly, next to the enemy warship, a towering column of water shot up, followed by another one. This massive enemy warship, like an island, began to tilt and flee towards the ocean, disappearing into the mist in an instant. The remaining enemy warship fleet immediately became disorganized and began to scatter in confusion. The enemy warship fleet, which had thought it had the upper hand, sailed back and forth triumphantly, arbitrarily bombarding our positions, and was actually sent fleeing in panic by our invincible submarine. Our submarine bravely overcame the most difficult natural conditions and came to Attu Island from thousands of miles away to fight the enemy. By May 24th, it had damaged one battleship and one cruiser.

All-Out Bayonet Charge

From the 1st to the 15th, although there were fierce battles every day, our army maintained its original position. Although the enemy outnumbered us tenfold, we only suffered dozens of casualties in four days. The enemy continued to increase its forces. On the southern coast, soldiers were constantly landing. The enemy's strength gradually increased to more than ten times our own, and they used ○ artillery pieces to suppress us. The defending troops in that area were determined to fight to the last drop of blood and stop the enemy's advance. On that day, the enemy's front-line troops charged over and engaged us in hand-to-hand combat. Unit Captain ○ also believed that continuing to stalemate like this was simply a suicidal act of waiting for death, so he prepared to order all troops to launch a general bayonet charge. Everyone tightly wrapped white bands around their sleeves, tied white cloths over their heads, and fixed their bayonets, waiting for the opportunity to charge. The all-out charge began. Battle cries echoed through the valleys. When bayonets broke, they grabbed the enemy and bit their throats. Although the enemy was hit hard by our attacks, due to the overwhelming numerical disadvantage, our northern high ground defending troops all bravely sacrificed themselves.

On the 16th, the enemy continued to land on the southern coast, and enemy tanks appeared on the summit of Massacre Valley. Our troops in the eastern part of Holtz Bay again launched a night attack, causing confusion in the enemy camp.

On the 17th, enemy aircraft came to bomb at 5:00 AM. North American B-25 aircraft indiscriminately dropped bombs on their own positions. This accidental bombing caused the enemy to suffer great losses.

On the 18th, land battles were still very fierce, and the enemy air force and navy continued to carry out intimidating attacks. Enemy soldiers continued to land in Massacre Bay. A mixed battle between the enemy and us unfolded on the northern coast.

On the 19th, enemy aircraft flew in to bomb from early in the morning and continuously dropped supplies and ammunition by air. This was the first time this had happened since the American landing, and this proved that our submarine's activities were effective, causing difficulties in the enemy's maritime supply replenishment.

On the 20th, our army launched a counterattack while the enemy was advancing inland. As a result, the two sides became entangled in the most tragic melee and grappling combat.

Reinforcements: Sea Eagles Arrive

After the 20th, the enemy's troop reinforcements came to an end. On the 21st and 22nd, our army bravely attacked Massacre Bay. Although the enemy suffered great losses, our losses also increased.

On the 23rd, when we heard the sound of airplanes, we thought that the enemy was coming to bomb again, but when the airplanes flew closer, we saw that they were Japanese airplanes. Our sea eagles soared in the sky, and the officers and soldiers of the Yamazaki Unit waved their hats, shed hot tears, and shouted "Banzai!" In an instant, our sea eagles flew towards the enemy warships in Chichagof Harbor to drop bombs. Aerial torpedoes were dropped, and one enemy warship caught fire and sank to the bottom of the sea in the blink of an eye.

Our soldiers on the ground suddenly cheered, "Banzai! Banzai!" The results of our sea eagles that day were one cruiser sunk, one destroyer sunk, and another one on fire.

The arrival of our sea eagles was simply a mystery to the Americans, who did not know where they had come from. Our Yamazaki Unit cheered them as "millions of reinforcements."

Unit Commander Yamazaki was constantly preparing for a counterattack, stubbornly defending his own position. The artillery gunners and engineers all picked up rifles and launched attacks.

On the 24th and 25th, enemy aircraft did not come, and only a few warships bombarded our positions. This was due to the activities of our submarines and air force. Unit Commander Yamazaki took advantage of this opportunity to reorganize and strengthen the army. Our sea eagles flew in and dropped a lot of food and ammunition.

On the 26th, the enemy's attacks were extremely fierce. Unit Commander Yamazaki already knew that this was the final battle. At this time, Unit Commander Yamazaki's communications were cut off, so amidst the hail of bullets, he recorded the enemy's strength, tactics, equipment, etc., that day, and reported it to his superiors.

Since the 25th, due to the enemy's fierce attacks, our unit's strength had been reduced to only a hundred and several dozen men. At this time, the only option was to give the enemy a fatal blow. Maintaining our own forces in the position and confronting the enemy for a long time was not a viable option. That would cut off supplies and lose the opportunity to strike the enemy hard. Rather than eking out a miserable existence on this isolated island, it was better to sacrifice oneself valiantly. So, he reported this decision to his superiors and destroyed important documents.

"Tonight, we will definitely carry out a final night assault. Please conduct aerial reconnaissance of the results of tonight's attack." This was the Yamazaki Unit's final tragic report. From then on, no matter how they called the Attu Island radio station, there was no response. This was because the radio station had been destroyed. Wounded and sick soldiers committed suicide by disembowelment with a smile on their faces. Unit Commander Yamazaki gathered the remaining soldiers and gave a final farewell speech.

"When bullets run out, use bayonets. If bayonets break, use your hands. If your hands are injured, use your teeth. In short, kill as many enemies as possible. Even when your heart stops beating, your soul must still charge into the enemy ranks."

After speaking, he led all the officers and soldiers to pay their respects to the Emperor in the direction of the Imperial Palace. Firearms were also distributed to non-combatant military personnel. The faces covered in soot were full of smiles. On the night of May 29, 1943, they desperately charged towards the American positions on the summit of Massacre Valley. This superhuman and supernatural power of the Imperial Army shocked the American soldiers. According to enemy intelligence, fierce fighting continued until June 2nd. Although the Yamazaki Unit parted ways with the world on June 2, 1943, its spirit will forever remain immortal.

### Burning Books

— Yeren

Two years ago, my uncle startled me by sending me to the Yueying-style firm as an apprentice. I didn't know anything, and when I started working, I was ridiculed by my colleagues; that was still alright. What I found most painful was—the firm forbade me from reading books!

At first, I didn't know the rules of the firm and brought my beloved books to the firm, but I didn't dare to read them in front of so many people. I only secretly read them in a small room behind the loan warehouse. One day, a colleague who was my closest friend told me:

"Xian, be careful not to let people tell the manager. It's not a joke; you'll definitely get a 'scolding'. There used to be a colleague who liked reading books like you, and after being scolded by the manager, he left that very night!" But I said:

"Thank you for your advice. But reading books is always better than going to dance halls or brothels..."

One afternoon, I was reading a book in a small room behind the warehouse again. Just as I was enjoying it, the manager suddenly appeared behind me like a bolt from the blue, and said loudly:

"I've been calling you for a long time. So you're here reading books, having a good time!" Then he snatched the book from my hand and tore it to pieces. How heartbroken I was! It was as if I had lost a treasure. But the scolding continued ruthlessly.

"Did we bring you here to learn business or to read books? If you're here to learn business, you should throw away the book and focus on learning business. If you're here to read books, you should go back home. We don't want people like you here!"

I remembered the words my mother told me when I left home: "Axiang! Be good and follow others' example, listen to the boss, and never be too proud. Pride will lead to suffering..." Unconsciously, tears welled up in my eyes, and from then on, I dared not read books during the day.

For two or three weeks, I didn't read any books, and I felt very bored, even worse than not having food to eat. One night, after my colleagues had gone to sleep, I quietly turned on a five-watt lamp and opened a book that I hadn't read for many days. I was reading under the dim light, and my heart couldn't help but beat nervously. Half a year passed like this. One night, as usual, after my colleagues had gone to sleep, I turned on the lamp and read under the light. My eyes became blurred, and I gradually fell asleep. When I woke up the next morning, I realized that the lamp was still on, and several colleagues had already woken up and were staring at me.

"No matter how Uncle scolds him, this little devil is still not afraid. He keeps the light on so brightly in the middle of the night, preventing me from sleeping last night. I'll definitely tell Uncle today and give him a lesson..." said Afang, the manager's nephew.

Sure enough, that morning, as soon as the manager came out, he called me into the accounting room and asked me if I read books every night. I just stared at him blankly without saying a word, so he shouted angrily:

"Why don't you answer when I ask you something? You're a blockhead—Afang, go and get all the books hidden on Xiang's bed."

When Afang walked into the accounting room with a pile of books and sneered at me, I really wanted to rush over and bite him a few times.

"What now? Let's burn the books!" he asked me coldly. I didn't answer. "Burn them all!" the manager said.

Afang lit a match and set the books on fire. Watching the books that I had accumulated and bought over the past six months being swallowed by the fire one by one and turning into ashes, I felt infinite anger and grief in my heart. Suddenly, the manager sneered, stroking the old whiskers on his mouth and saying to me:

"Haha, does it hurt? Now you have no books to read, oh, haha..."

The last sentence was said very mockingly.

But the next day, my uncle called me in and lectured me.

"From now on, you are not allowed to read books in the firm... Do you hear me?"

Returning from my uncle's place, I still didn't understand: What harm is there in reading books?

In this way, I lost a spiritual treasure and became a soulless burden! I don't know when I will be able to enjoy the taste of reading again!

### To Lin

— Song Lan

I'm going to be hospitalized tomorrow. I have to have surgery at night. I feel very lonely and uncomfortable.

Last night, my father came and talked to me with a stern face: "First, after you leave the hospital the day after tomorrow, you can only stay in a third-class ward. Don't spend too much money. I've signed the papers, and I won't have time to visit you later. Second, you can't come home. I don't care where you live outside. Third, you have to get married this year, otherwise, I won't have the money to marry you off later. I can't help it. You can't say I'm unfair."

After my father left, I couldn't control my emotions. I covered my face and cried bitterly. My tears flowed out uncontrollably. I could only sob. I opened my tearful eyes and asked people, "Was that my father who just came?" People said I was silly, but I wondered: Am I my father's child? How was the three-year married life that my mother, who died at the young age of twenty-two, spent with my father? These are all mysteries!

At night, I stood weakly on the balcony. The early autumn evening breeze licked my short hair with a soft tongue, the white crescent moon kissed my cheeks with gentle lips, letting the stars wink their quiet eyes and smile, letting the beautiful and deep night sigh mysteriously. I caressed the scars in my heart and opened the history of my life...

Lin: Where are you now? We've been separated for more than half a year. You're wandering everywhere, traveling north and south; I'm drifting in a foreign land, falling to the ends of the earth. Now, illness brings me pain and loneliness. My father is cold to me, others don't care about me, no one understands me, and no one loves me sincerely. I think of you with tears in my eyes, but I haven't heard from you in a long time. How are you? Haven't you seen that spring has gone again and autumn has come? The blood and tears of the azaleas, the distant neighing of horses, bring me so much sadness!

Ah! Tell me, when will we meet again? My love!

I remember in early spring, when I was sick, you left me. We separated so abruptly, without a word, without a goodbye. We didn't even shake hands. We parted silently in the endless night. I seemed to see your tearful eyes, but I closed my eyes in pain, and when I opened them again, you were gone.

When will I return to your side? We have never lain together. You have a sacred career, and I have heavy duties. I am still trapped in two different worlds. I want a mother, but my mother is dead; I want a father, but my father doesn't treat me like his daughter; I want you, but where are you? ...

### Small Songs of Life

— Lan Yi

Dusk

The setting sun, with a reddened face, struggles with its last strength; peace, white clouds are stained with a faint red; it vaguely resembles—red, bloody clouds. × × × × it fades! Weakens! Defeated. The twilight quietly scatters the color of peace; - the shadow of the blue angel will be the final master.

Caged Bird

Another caged bird quietly rushes towards the free sky. It evokes even more - emotional waves; waves, waves, even more showing a lonely feeling during the war. × × ×

Shooting Star

Stars, the Milky Way, the shadow of the moon, shining on the blue curtain; like shattered jewels. Suddenly - a shooting star passes by; remorse, panic, with a trembling tail, alertly - a flash of inspiration; I realize that this is life. (Moved-Paid Assistant Loan)

### Faces

— Zheng Men

If we, from birth to death, do not go out into society to work, but live our whole lives in the home, then all you see every day are just a few familiar faces. The faces of parents are always kind and benevolent; the faces of daughters are always innocent and lovely; and the faces of those who depend on you are always subservient and flattering. But if we work in a shop as a clerk, that is not the case. Every day you can see many different faces, which is quite uncomfortable. The first face that you see and makes you feel different is the venerable visage of the boss's wife. When the shop assistant is taking a customer, the boss's wife is supervising from the side, and her visage is fickle. If the shop assistant cannot make the sale, the boss's wife's face will turn ashen.

Next, you have to see the various different faces of the customers. Some are very amiable or lovable, but some have a face full of aggression, with eyes wide open, and their faces look like they are looking for trouble.

Faces! Faces! Why are they so infinitely varied?

### Mr. Cheng's Anguish

— Ji Wei Yi

On a Sunday afternoon, the stove was blazing, and Mr. Cheng sat dejectedly in his small attic room, thinking and thinking... The front building was a children's paradise, full of joy and laughter, while the attic room, though stuffy and hot, was comparatively quiet. Therefore, it was regarded as a blessed sanctuary, Mr. Cheng Guang-sheng's only free space.

Half a year ago, Mr. Cheng, through the introduction of an important person, left that barely-surviving, never-satiated profession and stepped into the enviable real estate company, throwing a heavy stone in his heart far, far away... He was full of hope that he could barely manage to settle his life. But now, not only could he not afford the new clothes he had planned to gradually acquire, but even his existing old clothes were difficult to preserve. There was one matter he could not resolve.

"Tomorrow is Mrs. Cheng's birthday... Please... honor us with your presence... Ha... please come early... The sixteenth... to join in the fun..." Yesterday, the manager, with a forced smile, said these words with a face full of smiles, and they rang in his ears again. Needless to say, a contribution cannot be avoided, and moreover, those colleagues...

"Hey"! Mr. Liu, the manager's relative, was already thinking about flattering and currying favor. "Should we all send birthday peaches and cakes?"

"Yes! Count me in... about two hundred yuan each... not expensive, not expensive: and also send a separate gift each... Ha!" Mr. Wang, the manager's nephew, chimed in, even more aggressively.

"Oh, heavens!" Mr. Cheng thought to himself, "It looks like another 40% of this month's salary will be deducted, and my wife and children at home are waiting for food..."

"Old Wang, how much are you preparing for mahjong tomorrow: Ha... three thousand? Not enough, right! Ha..." Someone else was preparing for tomorrow's merriment, which deeply pained Mr. Cheng's heart. In his blurred vision, he vaguely saw Mr. Wang's fingers go from three to four to five... Without realizing it, Mr. Cheng shed a precious tear.

× × ×

Originally, such good weather today was rare. Usually, he would happily take the children to the park. But today was different, he really couldn't muster any enthusiasm.

Thinking of himself sitting quietly in the sweat-filled attic room, entirely to avoid those social obligations. Going to the banquet was unavoidable, but he thought he would not participate in the merriment. Perhaps even if he searched his whole family, he couldn't gather a thousand yuan. So, he was painfully trying to stay home until the banquet started.

The only long gown he planned to wear to the banquet today was being mended by his wife in the front building. Shoes... he only had one pair for rainy days... He would have to go bareheaded! Shoes... thinking of shoes, he remembered the incident at the shoe store that day, he seemed to hear:

"Get out! Go away! Asking the price when you can't afford shoes... Make a fortune and come back to buy! ... Ha..."

A wave of stinging coldness rushed through his mind, and his heart felt as if cold arrows were deeply shot into his defenseless and weak heart.

### Random Thoughts

— Xu Huiguang

Waste of Life

Regarding the waste of life, I have long had this thought. I remember discussing it with classmates not long ago. I said: "Life is like morning dew. Few people can enjoy a long life of eighty or ninety years, and one-third of that life is spent on the bed due to illness, one-third is spent on rest and eating, and a lot of time is wasted on worrying and anxiety. The time truly spent on serving society and serious work only accounts for a small part of an individual's life. As for those young masters and ladies who loaf around and spend their days in games and amusements, they simply throw their lives away! — So sometimes I feel that life is inherently wasteful!" Although I spoke with some coherence back then, now I feel even more intensely that although an individual's service to society and contributions to the community only account for a small part of their life, precisely because of this, this small part of life is even more precious to us! Only through the ordinary can we express greatness, and it is difficult to avoid the waste of life. That small part of life used to serve society and the community deserves our utmost care and cherish!

Self-reflection

"If one season is missed, one may suffer hunger; if one woman is idle, one may suffer cold." These two sentences precisely express that although an individual's strength is small, the atoms that make up society and the nation are individuals. Therefore, whether it is a farmer plowing or a weaver weaving, although they are engaged in ordinary work, their contribution to society is no less than what great men do. From this, we can see that diligent and practical work is truly better than lofty and empty words, which are of no practical use. This is a major weakness of people.

"Sitting and talking is not as good as getting up and acting!" I want to advocate.

### Shanghai YMCA's Efforts to Promote Sports: Using Sports to Replace Unwholesome Entertainment

The Shanghai Chinese Christian Association (YMCA) has been promoting sports for thirty to forty years. It can be said that the YMCA founded various sports in Shanghai. The goal of the YMCA's sports work is to emphasize adapting to the needs of the times, promoting healthy physical, mental, and psychological activities, correcting the current distorted development of the sports world, improving sports ethics, widely introducing various sports, and hoping to use sports-style entertainment to replace all abnormal entertainment in society. It holds various gymnastics classes, basketball, volleyball, and swimming classes; and trains junior sports technical personnel in large numbers to promote the popularization of sports. In order to increase public interest and popular awareness, it concentrates outstanding athletes to organize ball game competitions and sports performances. Over the decades, many athletes in Shanghai have been trained by the YMCA or are teammates of the YMCA's various sports teams. The following is a brief introduction to the YMCA's current sports activities:

Sports Facilities Regarding facilities, the Sichuan Road branch of the YMCA has a gymnasium that can be used for all kinds of gymnastics and basketball competitions. It has two handball courts, where famous players such as Zhu Kuan often practice or compete. It has a swimming pool, which, although small, has a long history. Countless people have learned to swim here. In addition, there are separate bathing rooms and dressing rooms for adults, teenagers, and women, a ping-pong game room, and a billiard room. The Eight Immortals Bridge branch of the YMCA has a larger gymnasium. Although the building is somewhat simple, it is currently the largest and most standard indoor sports hall in Shanghai, so various basketball and volleyball games in Shanghai are often held here. There is a sports area dedicated to various weightlifting equipment and individual exercises. There is a national martial arts hall located on the top floor of the YMCA, with excellent construction and equipment. In addition, there is a health treatment room and three bathing rooms, all fully equipped.

Organizational Structure The YMCA's sports staff organization has the Sports Committee as the highest organization. The chairman of the committee is Mr. Shen Dunliang, a director of the YMCA. The committee members are Zhou Jiaqi, Kang, Yu Xunzi, Wang Shoufang, Dao, and other members. Mr. Liang Zhaoan is in charge of the YMCA's sports department, responsible for all sports matters, and also teaches gymnastics and swimming. Mr. He Hesheng is responsible for YMCA member sports and organizing various ball game competitions. Mr. Chen Fuzhang is in charge of the YMCA's middle school sports work. There are also many coaches and instructors for each class, which cannot be introduced one by one.

Sports Trends The YMCA's recent sports trends are also noteworthy, namely that the YMCA's sports activities include the following three types of education: sports education, health education, and recreational education. Sports education includes various gymnastics, ball game training, ball game competitions, national martial arts, boxing, wrestling, swimming, etc., with the pure goal of training physique and skills. Health education includes health campaigns, health exhibitions, vaccinations, health competitions, physical examinations, physical fitness tests, health treatments, bathing, etc., all of which are carried out in this area. As for recreational education, such as hiking, cycling, billiards, ping-pong, group dancing, etc., these are all sports with recreational elements.

Various Classes and Groups Based on the above three principles, the YMCA currently has many classes, teams, and small organizations. Participants are assigned according to their level, and those receiving basic or ordinary training enter the "classes," such as equipment classes, after-work classes, guard classes, wrestling classes, bodybuilding classes, boxing classes, beginner swimming classes, etc., all of which receive short-term training to teach various basic skills. After completing the training, those who wish to receive long-term training and more advanced skills can participate in various "teams," such as morning exercise teams, bodybuilding teams, swimming teams, boxing clubs, etc., which are competitive in nature and represent the YMCA in various competitions, such as the Zhongqing basketball team, the Zhongqing swimming team, and the boxing team. Other special organizations include referee training classes, inviting various types of competitions, boxing competitions, indoor sports, sports lectures, health competitions, etc., which are too numerous to mention.

Ball Games Regarding ball games, as mentioned earlier, the Shanghai YMCA is the pioneer, so the YMCA's gymnasium has the most participants in ball games, especially basketball, which is most popular among the public. In addition to ordinary members who regularly practice, almost all the players of famous local teams, such as Yu Xunzi, Kong Guangyi, Zhuo Guorong, Chen Xue, Ma Canxi, and the Renyu Hualian team, the Chenyou team, etc., often run in the gymnasium. Every autumn, the YMCA holds the "YMCA Member Cup" ball game competition, which only YMCA members can participate in, but many famous Shanghai players are YMCA members, so it is always a grand event.

Water Sports The YMCA has made unremitting efforts to promote water sports. Every summer, it opens the swimming pool and charges a very low subsidized fee so that the public can participate. The swimming pool adopts a group swimming method, so it can provide technical training to participants. Last year and this year, about 3,500 people participated, of whom 1,500 were beginners. Famous Shanghai swimmers such as Wen Jingling, Xu Shouqiang, Lu Huijie, Chen Xiaozhong, and Wang Zhongcheng are all members of the Zhongqing swimming team and also serve as instructors, so learners are very enthusiastic. The organization and training are divided into four types of classes and groups: Beginner Swimming Class, where those who cannot swim are taught in six sessions. Intermediate Swimming Class, which teaches various swimming styles and diving. Intermediate Swimming Team, which trains various advanced swimming techniques. Self-Practice Swimming Class, which does not limit the level and allows free practice. Other events held in phases include swimming performances, swimming tests, and swimming competitions. This year's Shanghai Chinese Open Swimming Competition is an unprecedented event.

The Shanghai YMCA is a Christian organization. Sports work is one of the four aspects of education (moral, intellectual, physical, and social) of the YMCA, so its promotion of sports is also based on the YMCA's purpose of serving society and cultivating talents, and it has the spirit of Christ. This is what distinguishes it from other organizations. (Weinas)

### Major Events in the Shanghai Sports World: Western Football Club Dissolves, Sino-Foreign Football Matches Taken Over by the Municipal Sports Association

The Shanghai Football Club (formerly known as the Shanghai Western Football Association) announced its dissolution on September 10th. From now on, Sino-foreign football matches will be taken over by the Shanghai Municipal Sports Association. This is indeed a major event in the Shanghai sports world this past week, and also a major change in the Shanghai football world in more than forty years. It was initiated and organized, and registered in London, with the initiation taking place in 1902. At that time, the Ascot Cup was started, and the first championship was won by the Docker Engineering Association; Lacks, Western Merchants, and Shangtuan A teams were all major participants in the competition.

In 1907, the A-League began, and the International Cup was held the following year. Subsequently, the Zi Lin Cup, Gao Bei Cup, Junior Cup, Reserve Cup, A, B, C, and D League were held in turn. In short, twenty years ago, the Shanghai football world was dominated by teams such as Scotland, England, Ireland, Four Merchants, Lacks, and St. Francis.

Chinese teams joined the Shanghai Football Club in 1926, with Shen Siliang and others joining the association as officials. In 1927, Lehua won both the Senior Cup and the A-League championship. In 1933, Youyou won the Junior Cup, and the following year, Donghua won the Ascot Cup and the Junior Cup. After the Chinese team participated in the International Cup, it won the championship for two consecutive years in 1928 and 1929.

From last year to the present, the Shanghai Football Club has been chaired by Kang Bosun, and continues to hold the Ascot Cup, Zi Lin Cup, Junior Cup, and A, B, and C League, but the scope is smaller and the vitality is greatly reduced. Last Friday (September 10th) at 5 pm, the association held its annual meeting at the Huizhong Hotel. Attendees included Chairman Kang Bosun, vice-chairmen and executives, appeal committee members, and representatives of various teams, totaling more than thirty people. Chairman Kang Bosun reported on the past cup games, and continued to report on the income and expenditure of the accounts, with an income of more than 340,000 yuan. After paying the secretary Lei Yanshi's annual salary of 10,000 yuan and telephone and miscellaneous expenses of 9,000 yuan, the cash balance was only 118 yuan and change. Chairman Kang Bosun then proposed, and Executive Dello concurred, that in order to adapt to the environment, the Shanghai Football Club should announce its dissolution, and all association affairs and all proceedings, as well as assets and powers, should be transferred to the Shanghai Sports Association for acceptance and continued operation. The attending committee members unanimously passed the motion. From now on, the term "Western Football Club" has become a historical relic. It is reported that the Municipal Sports Association is already preparing to continue handling Shanghai football competitions.

### Simple Fitness Training Method (II)

— Written by Yide Translated

7. Automatic Chest

The automatic chest is necessary for correct breathing and perfect health. The so-called automatic chest refers to the upper part being raised and fixed, not rising or falling with breathing; when breathing involuntarily, it is as firm as iron, and even when breathing voluntarily, it remains fixed, even during strenuous exercise or loud shouting.

Place both hands on the chest, making the chest passive. The lower part of the chest sinks, as if there is nothing in the chest. Then, use the muscles to lift it, without using the force of inhaling.

By practicing this, you will soon know how little muscle movement and how much attention is needed to make the chest automatic, without the need for constant special force and special attention.

This should also become second nature. But do not overdo it, lest the chest become stiff and lose its balance, which would be unsightly.

8. Breathing

Do not breathe through the mouth. Dogs breathe through the mouth by nature, which is not suitable for humans to imitate.

Correct breathing requires correct posture. Stand upright, leaning the body forward, not backward. Do not bend the body, but lean forward from the ankle joint, without rigidity. Maintain the automatic (raised and fixed) chest, with the knees, hips, and abdomen backward; the body's center of gravity should be forward, entirely on the balls of the feet, so although the heels are still on the ground, the weight they bear is very light.

Even if you place your fingers under the heels, they will not be injured.

9. Diaphragmatic Breathing

This includes abdominal, rib, and costal breathing, i.e., front, back, and side, each of which must be discussed separately.

During the following breathing exercises, the body should not have any other movements except for the movement of the chest and waist. The upper part of the chest is raised and fixed. Use the force of muscle movement, not the force of inhalation; maintaining this position is very important, as if preparing to be punched in the chest, so you should always pay attention to it, so that it is firmly in your mind and cannot be forgotten.

10. Abdominal Breathing

The term abdominal breathing is easily misunderstood, so it must be explained. Practicing abdominal breathing often has significant effects, which is well known. In fact, the abdomen does not breathe, nor does the chest, but there are often terms such as abdominal breathing and chest breathing.

Correct abdominal breathing is a strong and beneficial exercise. When the diaphragm contracts, it presses on the stomach and liver below, which can promote digestion. The term abdominal breathing comes from the forward movement of the abdomen when inhaling.

Stand upright in the correct posture. (When practicing abdominal breathing, the correct posture has often become second nature.)

Place the fingertips in the center of the waistline. Slowly inhale a deep breath through the nostrils. Raise the chest. Keep it fixed. Below where the fingers are placed, there is almost no movement. The lower part of the abdominal wall also does not need to have any movement. When starting to inhale, you should feel a forward movement of the abdomen resisting the fingers. Slowly inhale, and when the lungs are full, keep the diaphragm still, pause for a moment, and then slowly exhale.

Abdominal breathing: Place hands on the abdomen; inhale, resist the diaphragm movement, and slowly exhale.

Note: When practicing in class, three breaths are sufficient; when practicing individually, you can use your own judgment.

11. Rib Breathing

Stand upright in the correct posture. Place the back of the fingers on the lower ribs. Slowly inhale a deep breath through the nostrils. The upper part of the chest is raised and fixed. When starting to inhale, you should feel a lateral movement resisting the fingers.

Rib breathing: Place hands on the lower ribs; inhale; resist the diaphragm movement; and slowly exhale.

Note: When practicing in class, three breaths are sufficient; when practicing individually, you can use your own judgment. (To be continued)
