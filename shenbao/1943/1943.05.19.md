### Further Appeal Regarding the Disaster in North China

The severity of the disaster in the provinces of North China this year is unprecedented in history. Not only are Henan and Shandong provinces filled with displaced people without clothing or food, but the authorities and local leaders in each province are desperately pleading for relief. Even Beijing and Tianjin, which have always been regarded as the political and cultural centers of North China, have recently fallen into extreme famine. According to a report in this newspaper's Beijing dispatch on May 3rd, "The largest cities in North China, Beijing and Tianjin, are experiencing unprecedented hunger and terror. Families with modest means and salaried workers of the middle and lower classes are living in panic. Many low-level staff in government agencies, elementary school teachers, and those working and teaching in bookstores are driving rickshaws at night to supplement their income. Rickshaw pullers, dragging passengers, are fainting on the streets at any time, never to wake up again, because they are empty-bellied and exhausted. According to a survey, in March, two or three hundred people died of starvation in each of the cities of Beijing and Tianjin every day." Such a serious famine phenomenon in such large cities cannot but arouse the attention of the Chinese people. As for the famine in the rural areas of North China, it is even more tragic. According to the same dispatch, "In the Tangshan area, thirty miles north of Beijing, residents are using grass roots, grass seeds, and tree bark as food. In some areas of Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei, even the grass roots and tree bark have been eaten." Sitting comfortably in Shanghai, reading these reports filled with blood and tears, and thinking about the responsibility of every citizen to their compatriots, we feel endless pain and sympathy.

Human beings all have feelings and a sense of justice. When such a disaster and suffering occur in another place, even if we have delicacies, we will probably see the shadows of thousands of northern compatriots dying of starvation between our cups and plates! Even if we have music and songs, we will probably hear the cries for help from thousands of northern compatriots in them! For this reason, we will not hesitate to repeatedly plead for the victims of the disaster in North China. On the one hand, we appeal to all charitable organizations and people from all walks of life to donate money, assist the authorities, raise donations, purchase and transport food and medicine to urgently relieve the victims in the north. On the other hand, we should also organize a disaster area inspection team, or a Shanghai charity relief team, to go to the disaster area in the north to conduct on-site inspections and distribute food, so as to more effectively assist the authorities in providing relief to the victims in various places.

This major disaster in the provinces of North China naturally originated from natural disasters, but if human efforts can be fully exerted, the natural disaster can be reduced and eliminated in a short period of time. Otherwise, the disaster will inevitably become more serious day by day, eventually reaching an irreversible stage. After this disaster in the north occurred, it is clear that it also contains unfortunate factors on the human side, such as what the Beijing dispatch of this newspaper on May 3rd said: "Since the end of January this year, the cost of living in North China has risen sharply, especially for food and essential goods, which have increased by one or two times." Here lies the root of man-made disasters, which makes the disaster even more serious. Although the so-called man-made causes are not limited to one aspect, one example cited in the same dispatch is: "The propertied class is desperately hoarding food. The price of food also increases day by day with the trend of bidding, and even the selling price in the morning and afternoon has a very high difference." After the authorities took drastic measures, we believe that the man-made factors in the famine in North China have gradually been eliminated. However, the fundamental solution to the problem ultimately depends on the abundance of material resources and the increase in the general purchasing power of the people. Otherwise, the trend of speculative hoarding cannot be completely eliminated, and on the other hand, the vast majority of people in the middle and lower classes will still inevitably face the danger of displacement and death. Therefore, in addition to calling on the authorities and compatriots from all over to cooperate in providing emergency relief, we also expect the central government and the North China local authorities to work together to improve farmland water conservancy, improve tenancy relations, provide loans for capital seeds, agricultural tools and fertilizers, and expand agricultural production. We believe that this is as important as emergency relief and is a fundamental solution.

Yesterday, we received many opinions from readers on disaster relief, all of which were suggestions based on compassion. In particular, one reader's two prerequisites were insightful (the original text was published in today's newspaper on page 4, National Forum). We also have the same feeling. First, we hope that the central competent authorities will negotiate with friendly countries and especially allow the circulation of relief goods. Second, select honest and impartial relief workers to cooperate with the local authorities and local gentry in the disaster area. In addition, "Relief is like fighting a fire." All handling procedures should be as simple and quick as possible. Do not be like the slow and tortuous steps of officialdom. Here, we assume that from the start of fundraising to the actual distribution, a period of one month is set. In other words, by mid-June, a large number of relief goods and funds should arrive in the disaster area, and then be distributed one after another. We believe that fundraising is based on the compassion and sympathy of people from all walks of life, and the results will certainly be good. How to effectively and quickly distribute the funds is indeed an important issue that follows. The central competent authorities should be responsible for this matter, and the authorities are requested to issue orders to the relevant ministries, committees, provincial and municipal governments to instruct the competent grain, transportation, transportation, economic, and social welfare agencies at all levels to mobilize all relevant personnel to fully assist in the rapid progress of disaster relief work. We can measure the public's support and administrative efficiency from the speed and effectiveness of handling this emergency relief work.

Speeches by Both Sides

At the signing of the Detailed Implementation Rules for the Return of the French Concessions, Counselor Ba Sisson of the Embassy in China, representative of the French delegation, delivered the following speech: Honorable Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, the agreement signed today is based on the statement of the French Government of February 23, 1943, to implement the return of the French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Shamian. Although France is in a difficult situation at present, less than three months after the statement, it has automatically confirmed the rapid resolution of all the difficult issues related to this important statement. The task of the French delegation was to complete its mission during the negotiation process, with the friendly understanding and desire for cooperation of the Chinese authorities, for which I express my deep gratitude. The French concessions in Tianjin and Shamian have been established for more than 80 years, and the French concession in Hankou is also nearly 50 years old. During this long period, the Chinese and French authorities have done their best to manage the above-mentioned places and promote them as the center of economic, commercial, and cultural contact between China and France. This system has now ceased to exist, and the French government is now automatically abandoning it. This administrative power constitutes an element of the concession. After the concession is taken over, the Chinese municipal authorities will obtain an organization and material equipment to promote the smooth implementation of the administration of the above-mentioned places, which is an element of the prosperity of each place. Once this friendly measure is completed, the French authorities are confident that the development of local relations between the Chinese and French people in China will be free of estrangement, suspicion, and bad impressions, and that cooperation will become closer day by day. I firmly believe that the impact of this agreement will greatly satisfy the Chinese people, and there is no doubt about it. I sincerely hope that the agreement signed today will not alienate the relations between the two countries, but will increase and strengthen them, and give a new impetus to the traditional deep feelings between China and France. At the signing of the Detailed Implementation Rules for the Return of the French Concessions, Foreign Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied: Counselor Ba and gentlemen, I am deeply honored and gratified to be able to preside over the ceremony for the signing of the agreement between China and France on the return of the three concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Shamian in China. Although the French government is in a difficult period, it is still able to resolutely eliminate all the relevant difficult issues and implement the statement of February 23 this year on the return of concessions in China. The government of our country expresses its deep gratitude to the French government for this friendly measure. Since our friendly country Japan first returned the exclusive concessions in China on May 30 this year, the French government has stepped forward without hesitation and sent a special delegation to Beijing to conduct negotiations with our National Government. When the representatives of the French side discussed with each other, the representatives of the French side made it possible for the representatives of our side to complete their mission smoothly with a friendly understanding and a desire for cooperation. I respectfully extend my gratitude on behalf of the government. The National Government is still willing to continue to maintain French or Sino-French cultural and purely charitable undertakings, which is sufficient to prove that our country attaches great importance to and sympathizes with the communication and development of Sino-French culture. I firmly believe that the signing of today's agreement will make the inherent friendship between the two sides closer day by day.

Remarks by Foreign Minister Chu

Foreign Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the signing of the agreement between France and China on the return of the three concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangdong: On January 9 this year, after our friendly country Japan signed an agreement with us on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the French government also followed Japan and voluntarily issued a statement on February 23 this year on the return of concessions in China and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. Since the issuance of the statement, the French government has ordered the French Embassy in China to exchange notes with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on March 29 this year on the abandonment of the administrative rights in the Beijing Legation area, and exchanged notes on April 8 this year on the abandonment of the administrative rights in the Gulangyu Public Concession. After that, both parties formally appointed members to discuss the implementation agreement on the return of the French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Shamian. Since the members of both parties began to negotiate in the middle of last month, they have traveled back and forth many times, and their opinions have been very close. By the middle of this month, they have reached complete agreement, and the entire agreement was formally signed on the 18th of this month. It has only been more than two months since the French government issued the statement on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the administrative rights of the Beijing Legation area, the Gulangyu Public Concession, and the French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Shamian, which were referred to in the statement, have been formally returned after the documents were signed one after another, which shows that the French government's sympathy for China has never lagged behind. According to the agreement signed today, all the French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Shamian will be fully returned on June 5. These concessions are scattered in the economic and commercial centers of our country, and their status is extremely important. Since their establishment, they have been more than 70 years old. After the hard work and careful planning of French officials and people, they have been transformed from barren areas into modern prosperous cities. All the facilities in the concessions are very complete. Now, the French government, when its own environment is extremely difficult, has resolutely abandoned its long-term rights and interests in the Far East, which shows that the French authorities have a far-sighted political vision. It has been a hundred years since foreigners set up concessions in our country. The initiator was actually the United Kingdom, and later countries followed suit to set up concessions, so that there are foreign-managed areas in important places in our country, which are not subject to our country's laws, and harm our country's sovereignty more than anything else. These rights and interests enjoyed by foreigners all come from unequal treaties, so the Father of the Nation's last words repeatedly advised us to abolish unequal treaties in the shortest possible time. Fortunately, our friendly country Japan first proposed the return of concessions, and France followed suit. Italy will also respond one after another. It is expected that this deformed system for a hundred years will be completely eliminated soon, which will help restore our country's sovereignty and is not a trivial matter. As for the aforementioned concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Shamian, once our country takes over, we will strive to improve the management and operation, and we will also strive to reconcile the feelings and increase the well-being of the Chinese and French people inside and outside the concessions, so that they can cooperate with each other, support each other, and share the happiness of living and working in peace.

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - The French representative for the return of the exclusive concessions in China is scheduled to host a banquet for the Chinese representatives at noon on the 19th. At 4:00 PM, Foreign Minister Chu will hold a tea party at the Franco-Belgian Alumni Association to entertain the French representatives.

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - After the conclusion of the French concessions return agreement in China, Foreign Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a telegram to Mr. Gossamer, the French Ambassador to China, expressing his gratitude. The record of the telegram is as follows: "The agreement on the transfer of concessions between China and France has been signed by the representatives of both parties. On behalf of the National Government of the Republic of China, I hereby send you my sincere gratitude by telegram. Foreign Minister Chu Minyi."

### Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying Issue Statements

Taiyuan, 18th (Central News Agency) - General Pang Bingxun, who joined the National Government camp, met with a group of reporters in a certain place at 4:00 PM on the 8th and made the following statement on the process and determination of joining the National Government camp this time: "I know that under the leadership of Chairman Wang, China has made rapid progress with the active cooperation of our friendly country Japan. The name of the Chongqing resistance has been lost. I really do not want to engage in blind resistance again and make the people suffer. After we joined the National Government camp, the blow to the Chongqing army was great. From then on, they will inevitably suffer greater injuries. I intend to give a sincere admonition to my former comrades in Chongqing, that is, in addition to resistance, we still have peace as a way to save the country."

Kaifeng, 18th (Central News Agency) - General Sun Dianying, commander of the newly compiled Fifth Army of Chongqing, has realized the sincerity of the Japanese army in assisting China's construction due to the spring Taihang operation launched by the Japanese army this time. He still resolutely gave up the past resistance and joined the camp of peace movement. One day, General Sun made a statement on the front line on the state of mind of joining the peace.

### Remarks by Director of Reporting Department, Tani Hagi

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Tani Hagi, Director of the Reporting Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, has had long interactions with Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying in North China and Mengjiang in the past. This time, Mr. Pang and others joined the peace camp. Mr. Tani Hagi issued a statement on the 17th, saying: "General Pang Bingxun's motivation for joining the peace camp is based on a certain belief. He knows that the policy advocated by Chairman Wang to promote peace, anti-communism, and national construction is the great way to revive China and defend East Asia. If we do not cooperate with Japan, there will be no peace and happiness in Greater East Asia. This point is especially worthy of our respect. I believe that after General Pang Bingxun joins the peace camp, there will be others who will follow."

### Central Government Sends Officials North to Conduct On-the-Spot Inspection of Disaster Conditions in North China

Beiping, 18th (Central News Agency) - As the spring and summer seasons intersect in North China, and food supplies dwindle, public anxieties about food have arisen. Chairman Wang of the National Government has received reports of the disasters from various sources and has ordered the Ministry of Social Welfare to send Councilor Kang Yuting north to inspect the disaster situation in order to coordinate relief efforts. Kang arrived in Beiping a few days ago and issued a statement, the gist of which was: North China provinces and cities have suffered successive years of droughts and floods, with frequent natural disasters and poor harvests. As the spring and summer seasons intersect, grain prices are soaring and there are many starving people. The North China native-place associations in the capital are deeply saddened and have successively appealed to the Central Government for relief. The Chairman, deeply concerned about the suffering of the people, has promptly ordered the Ministry of Social Welfare and related departments to urgently devise measures. Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare, considering relief his responsibility, has been working tirelessly and is deeply concerned. Therefore, he has ordered me to rush to North China to investigate the disaster situation and submit a detailed report to facilitate coordinated relief efforts. He has also mobilized native-place associations in Ningbo, Shanghai, and the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi to expand public fundraising efforts, with those who have money contributing money, and those who have strength contributing strength. He has also requested the government to spare no effort to allocate relief funds and purchase grain to be transported north to alleviate the people's suffering. Because the disaster situation in Taikang and Shangqiu counties in Henan is particularly severe, 50,000 yuan has already been allocated to the Joint Savings Society for emergency relief. I am now ordered to come north to investigate the disaster, and I plan to stay for two weeks, determined to visit disaster-stricken households and speak on behalf of the people. I sincerely hope that the relevant authorities and charitable organizations will provide assistance to enable me to accomplish my mission.

### The Muddy Season on the Eastern Front Has Passed; Germany Prepares for Summer Offensive; Three Soviet Divisions Annihilated Near Krimskaya; German Victory Also Secured Near Velikiye Luki

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to German front-line reports, except for some local offensives in the Rzhev area in the central part of the Eastern Front, there is almost no fighting at the bridgehead and along the entire Eastern Front. However, in the past two days, Soviet troops have been frequently concentrating forces towards Kuban, south of Moscow, and the Leningrad area, apparently preparing to launch a major offensive. Furthermore, the German Air Force's offensive is becoming increasingly fierce, leading many to believe that the German summer offensive is imminent.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - A military correspondent from the Havas News Agency announced last night that the German army's local attacks in the Kuban bridgehead area were successfully concluded over the weekend. The Soviet penetration in the Krimskaya southwest front area has been eliminated. This area had been cut off after the last large-scale Soviet attack, but it still caused the German army great inconvenience. The Soviet army had gained a firm foothold in the forest and deep gorges that ran through the area and was constantly being reinforced from the rear. However, after two days of fierce fighting, it was finally overcome with very heavy losses. The German High Command said in a communiqué issued on May 16 that three Soviet infantry divisions had been wiped out in this relatively small area alone. The German army also won a similar victory west of Velikiye Luki on Sunday, eliminating a Soviet salient that had existed since the winter campaign. Along the entire front line, both sides have greatly intensified reconnaissance and scouting activities, and the air forces of both sides are also very active. However, it would be premature to conclude from these two locations that the lull in fighting since the end of March is now coming to an end. What can be said with certainty at present is that both sides are striving to ascertain the other's intentions. Now that the muddy season has passed and the terrain is suitable for large-scale battles, this is a matter of course. Both sides have gained freedom of action, and both general staffs must take into account the possibility that the other side will strike first. Therefore, the intensified reconnaissance activities on both sides may be defensive in nature, and both sides may continue to maintain this attitude, waiting for the other side to strike first. If this is the case, the current state of high alert and intensified reconnaissance on both sides may continue for many weeks. This development is entirely possible, although the chance of an early end to the lull is relatively high. It is dangerous to speculate at this time, and it remains to be seen which side will launch a large-scale offensive first.

### Italian Government and Public Display Resolve to Cope with Future Events; Senator Salata Delivers Speech Asserting Growing Solidarity Among Axis Powers

Rome, 18th (Central News Agency) - A Havas correspondent reports that the Italian people have completely dispelled their grief over the Tunisia situation and are now facing the Allied military actions in the Mediterranean with determination and skepticism. Most of the people understand two things: first, the occupation of Tunisia does not decide the Mediterranean question; and second, the war has spread to the whole world, and the African theater is only an interlude. From government officials to ordinary vendors, everyone knows that the constant Allied propaganda about invading the Italian mainland and its islands is only intended to disrupt the morale of the Italian people. The prevailing view here is that the Anglo-Americans clearly imagine that the Italian spirit has been greatly weakened by the North African events, and the Italian people and authorities are making extensive preparations to prevent large-scale Allied air raids in order to counter this psychological pressure. In recent days, the public has been calmer and more disciplined when air raid alerts have been issued. The public does not show any panic over the expected enemy actions. The Italians declare frankly that the Anglo-American air force's current loss rate is very high, so how long they can continue to use the air force from Africa remains to be seen. As for the Allied landing on Italian soil, based on the experience of the North African campaign, the public is well aware that it will take a long time for the Allied forces to concentrate sufficient troops to fight in a certain location. Every Italian understands that Italy has various advantages and a perfect transportation system, so they are facing future events with the firm determination to defend the country.

Rome, 18th (Central News Agency) - Stefani News Agency reports: Italian Senator Salata delivered a speech yesterday during the Senate's discussion of the draft budget for the current fiscal year, stating that the solidarity between the German and Italian peoples has grown closer in the past year, and the increasing friendship and trust between the Italian Prime Minister and the German leader is not only a symbol but also a guarantee. He also encouraged the relationship between Italy and another great ally, Japan. The frequent diplomatic contacts and technical committees held among the foreign ministries of Rome, Berlin, and Tokyo have confirmed the function of the Tripartite Pact in wartime and peacetime, and between Europe and East Asia. He continued by stating the main points of the communiqué issued after the recent meeting between the German and Italian leaders. The new feeling caused by the current war has confirmed that the primary urgent task is the unification of Europe. All attempts to unite Europe in the past three centuries have been opposed by Britain, fearing that a united Europe would become its potential enemy. This conflict between Europe and Britain is the root of all crises and wars. He also reviewed Italian foreign policy and its relations with various European countries over the past year in his speech.

### Rumor Says British Navy Has Occupied Djembra Island

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Algiers, it is rumored that the British Navy occupied Djembra Island, about ten kilometers from Cape Bon, on the 17th.

### White House Denies Roosevelt-Churchill Meeting Halted

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - Yesterday, Washington and most parts of the United States were rife with rumors that President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill's discussions had been interrupted. The White House issued a denial statement last night, released to various American news agencies, stating that President Roosevelt continued to meet with the British Prime Minister and did not interrupt the meeting. He also held discussions with his special envoy to India, Phillips. The outside rumors are not credible. Phillips returned here before the British Prime Minister arrived in Washington and immediately reported to the President. India did not participate in the discussions between the British and American politicians.

### Davies' Visit to the Soviet Union Postponed

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to Washington sources, President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Soviet Union, Davies, has extended his stay in Tehran due to a special mission there. He will discuss the possibility of the United States establishing additional air bases in Iran. He may later visit India for the same purpose. Washington officials announced the postponement of Davies's trip to the Soviet Union, saying that Davies must hold important meetings with the Soviet ambassador and American officials in Tehran.

### Allied Forces in Tunisia Facing Difficulties in Food Supply

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Algiers, the Allied military authorities and the Giraud government in Tunisia suddenly felt difficulties in food and supply. Allied headquarters announced that large amounts of military supplies have been used to supply the public and the garrison, and food is now being rushed from Morocco and Algeria. However, the food markets in both places are also extremely short. Cooking oil is in short supply in Algeria, and cooking oil wholesalers want to import cooking oil from Tunisia, but they have been notified that the needs of the Allied forces must be met first, and a certain amount must be shipped to Britain and the United States. Therefore, the supply of civilians is feared to be extremely disappointing.

### Detailed Report on Japanese Occupation of Maungdaw; British Army Retreats Along Arakan Front in Burma; Increasing Numbers of Indian Troops Surrender Voluntarily

Rangoon, 18th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army in Burma launched a fierce attack on Maungdaw, the remaining British and Indian troops stationed near the area fled westward upon hearing the news. The vanguard of the Japanese army entered Maungdaw city on the 14th without firing a shot. Maungdaw is located on the Indo-Burmese border, bordering the Naf River to the south. It was the last stronghold for the enemy's attempt to invade Burma, and it was also the largest transportation hub on the southern Indo-Burmese transportation line. Now that the area has fallen, the enemy has no choice but to completely abandon its attempt to recapture Burma. At the same time, the shortest route to India along the coast, Maungdaw, has also been seized by the Japanese army.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 18th: (1) Japanese army units captured Maungdaw, an enemy stronghold on the banks of the Naf River on the Indo-Burmese border, at 2:00 PM on May 14 and are now preparing for future operations. (2) The comprehensive war results on the Arakan front from late December of last year to May 10 are as follows: (1) 6,414 enemy bodies were left behind (only those buried by the Japanese army). (2) 574 enemy troops were captured (including many British soldiers). (3) A total of 327 enemy aircraft were shot down (118 of which were shot down by ground fire), and 225 were set on fire. (4) The Japanese army seized 207 various cannons. (5) 459 heavy and light machine guns were seized. (6) 4,897 rifles and pistols were seized. (7) 83 tanks and armored vehicles were seized. (8) 255 trucks were seized. (9) 39 enemy ships were sunk or destroyed (including 16 ships of the 1,000-ton class), and countless other ammunition, food, and military supplies were seized. (2) In this campaign, the Japanese army had 714 killed, 1,364 wounded, and lost 48 aircraft.

### Japan Designates Medical Supplies as Basic Commodities

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government believes that supplying essential medical supplies and hygiene materials is crucial for directly ensuring combat power and public health. It has decided to make it a subordinate plan of the basic commodities mobilization in order to ensure supply. This plan is a product commodities mobilization plan based on the original materials already secured under the commodities mobilization plan. It includes all needs for military and civilian use, as well as exports. Since Japan's medical supplies have traditionally relied on supplies from third countries due to raw materials, and the demand is increasing under the Greater East Asia War, it is of great significance that a self-reliant commodities mobilization plan utilizing Greater East Asia raw materials has now been established, especially for medicines made from black oil, which has been successfully secured.

### Japan Decides on Self-Sufficiency Policy for Fibers in the South

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Under the guidance of the local Japanese military government, the cotton industry in various parts of the South has established a five-year plan for cotton cultivation. Due to the active efforts of the staff, the progress is extremely smooth. The Japanese government has now decided on a self-sufficiency policy for fiber manufacturing in the South. Cotton will be the raw material for fiber products in the South, and textile machines will be shipped from Japan to meet local needs.

### Wang Yitang Departs from Tokyo

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - National Government Commissioner Wang Yitang arrived here on the 11th. On the 14th, he paid respects to His Majesty the Emperor of Japan and received a medal. He held discussions with Prime Minister Tojo and other government officials and inspected various aspects of the situation.

### Director-General of the Japanese Planning Board Explains This Year's Trading Plan

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Director-General of the Japanese Planning Board discussed the gist of the Showa 18 Trading Plan, saying that the purpose of the Showa 18 Trading Plan is to adapt to the new stage of the Greater East Asia War in order to achieve a decisive victory. It can be summarized in the following two major policies: (1) To facilitate the exchange of important materials in Greater East Asia, with Japan as the center, in order to rapidly increase war power and stabilize the people's livelihood in Greater East Asia. (2) To make the plan the axis for communicating the planned transactions of the entire Greater East Asia sphere. To ensure that the intent is achieved through the implementation of this plan, the following guidelines will be adhered to for export and import plans: (1) Exports: The items and quantities of materials exported from Japan will focus on the development materials aimed at increasing war power and the production of urgent materials that Japan expects from various regions, or materials necessary for transportation. At the same time, the stability of the local people's livelihood will be considered in accordance with the environment of each region before making decisions. (2) Imports: The items and quantities of materials imported into Japan will ensure the stability of the people's livelihood in each region, taking into account their development capabilities and the increase in transportation, and will use a certain limit of maritime transport capacity to plan for the greatest enrichment of the work of enhancing material war power and to fill the essential materials for national life. According to the contents of this plan established based on the above two policies and guidelines, the amount of expected targets has generally been reached on the export side. Especially for the occupied areas in the South, its achievements have increased considerably compared to last year. On the import side, the total amount has also increased significantly compared to last year.

### A Great Tragedy in World History (6)

— Tokutomi Iichiro

(6) The Collapse and Disintegration of Colonies

Great Britain possesses centrifugal force without centripetal force. It is not that the latter is completely absent, but that centripetal force is overwhelmed by centrifugal force. Japan is an inward-enclosing nation, while Great Britain is an outward-extending one. Japan centers on the Imperial Household, with the Imperial Majesty like the sun in the solar system, around which everything revolves. Great Britain, on the other hand, lacks such a central unifying point. This is not to say that the British people are devoid of national character. As Motherning argues, Britain's island status allowed it to develop earlier than other European nations.

However, that national character transformed into a sense of Anglo-Saxon superiority, which was then disseminated throughout the world. The progeny of these so-called pirates, scattered across the globe, harbor but scant sentiment of loyalty towards their motherland, England. Indeed, twenty-five years prior to the American Revolution, Turgot of France presciently observed:

"Colonies are like fruits on a tree; when ripe, they detach themselves from the trunk and fall to the ground. No matter how things may develop in the future, America will ultimately become like Carthage."

Carthage had once been a Phoenician colony, only to eventually surpass Phoenicia itself. Looking at the situation today, it is impossible to deny the accuracy of Turgot's prediction regarding the future of America.

From the outset, the American colonists sought freedom from the political and religious constraints of their mother country, England. They were, from the beginning, not necessarily loyal subjects to their ancestral homeland.

England's predicament lay in its global expansion, which led to the gradual loosening of the bonds binding the colonies. In essence, its organizational web became too thin, leading to a situation of being too large to effectively manage. Sir Walter Raleigh, often hailed as the progenitor of the British Empire, once stated:

"The safety and perpetuity of the British Empire depend primarily on the uniformity of its people. Australia, New Zealand, and Canada exemplify this principle. However, in India, where race, religion, and language differ, the conquest was not achieved by British might, but by Indian soldiery. British forces constitute only one-fifth, while Indian forces comprise four-fifths. The Indians are well aware of this fact, which constitutes the inescapable bond that ties India to the motherland."

This is a nonsensical assertion. The Indians harbor deep resentment for the deceitful tactics employed by the British in conquering India, and there is no question of them feeling grateful or impressed by such methods.

During World War I, the aid proffered by Australia, South Africa, and India was taken as a sign of solid, unbreakable unity. However, this was merely a superficial assessment.

Their assistance to the mother country was driven by self-interest. India, it is true, contributed over 150 million pounds to war bonds, donated 100 million pounds, and deployed 800,000 troops. But what motivated India's enthusiasm? It was the belief that they would be granted the coveted freedoms and self-governance after the war. Yet, in the aftermath, the British seemingly forgot their promises, offering stones in place of bread. Thus, India's independence movement now rages before our very eyes.

Similarly, in the case of Canada, had it inclined toward Germany, the neighboring United States would have undoubtedly taken action. For its own security, the United States would have either conquered Canada militarily or, failing that, exerted economic pressure. Therefore, Canada opted to remain dependent on Britain, producing war materials and dispatching volunteers.

The same holds true for Australia. Its participation in the Allied Powers, and its alignment with Great Britain, was a matter of expediency. Moreover, the connection between Great Britain and Australia was sustained by the assistance of the Japanese Navy, a readily apparent fact. Had Australia sided with the Allied nations, the Japanese Navy would have promptly blockaded it!

In South Africa, the Smuts faction, then in power, aligned with the mother country in order to suppress their political rivals, the German party. Consequently, during the Versailles Conference, figures such as Borden of Canada, Smuts of South Africa, and especially Hughes of Australia, behaved as if the conference hall were their own, debating with disregard for the British representatives, Lloyd George and Balfour. Regardless of the British Empire's continued perception of the external colonies as British territory, they considered themselves independent nations, expressing a determination to remain independent. A significant gulf thus opened up between Great Britain and its colonies. During the celebration of Queen Victoria's fiftieth jubilee, a conference was convened with the prime ministers of various colonies. According to Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister at the time, any discussion of the constitution of the British Empire at the prime ministers' conference would plunge into a state of chaos: "Instead of discussing such issues, we should discuss the practical problems of common defense within the British Empire." While politicians in the mother country were enthusiastic, colonial politicians were indifferent to anything beyond their own lands. This discordant state of affairs existed between the British Prime Minister and the prime ministers of the various colonies even in the most prosperous era of Great Britain, during the fiftieth jubilee of Queen Victoria. What more could be said of later times?

Furthermore, despite having historically been an agricultural nation, Canada, as a result of manufacturing war materials for the mother country during World War I, transitioned into a semi-industrialized state. Australia also exhibited a similar trend, thus coming to compete with the mother country. Moreover, with the establishment of the League of Nations, each colony dispatched its representatives as members, each pursuing its own interests. The objective of the British Imperialist politicians to incorporate them within the sphere of the British Empire and to regulate their activities became nearly impossible. The British imperialist politicians were like a mother hen, while the prime ministers of the various colonies were the chicks hatched by that hen. Regardless of the mother hen's frantic clucking, the chicks each flew off to the water on their own. Thus, in 1926, the predictions of British politicians came to fruition, and the decision was made to remove the constitutive framework of the British Empire. The British Empire, as well as the territories of the British Empire, were transformed into autonomous entities within the British Empire, linked solely by the crown as a symbol of common loyalty. Beyond that, internal affairs, foreign policy, all were self-governing.

Prior to that, in 1923, when Canada and the United States concluded a fisheries treaty, the Canadian government openly stated its disapproval of the signing by the British ambassador to Washington. Thus, apart from loyalty to the crown, there was no relationship between the mother country and the dependencies, and they became completely unconnected.

In accordance with the decision of the 1931 Imperial Conference, the so-called Statute of Westminster was promulgated, and the British Empire, as mentioned above, placed Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, and Newfoundland on an equal footing with the mother country. By this point, the British Empire had, in effect, almost entirely collapsed and disintegrated.

Therefore, during the so-called Ottawa Conference of 1932, Great Britain abandoned its traditional free trade policy and implemented tariffs, applying free trade policies only within the British Empire. This measure was only beneficial to the colonies, and had no effect on Great Britain itself. Why is this the case? Even if the colonies eliminated tariff barriers against the mother country, they would benefit, while Great Britain would lose its position in the world as a result.

### Authorities Concerned about Disaster in North China: Discussing Relief Measures, Minister Ding Arrives in Shanghai to Meet Mayor Chen, Inviting Various Sectors to Discuss Jointly Today

This year's disaster in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces is quite serious, and relief is urgently needed. In Henan province alone, there are approximately ten million disaster victims. After representatives from the provinces petitioned in Beijing and the responsible North China authorities reported to the Central Government, Chairman Wang has ordered the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Ministry of Food to raise funds and grain separately to handle relief matters. The North China Associations in Beijing and Shanghai have also organized the North China Emergency Relief Association to raise relief funds. The Shanghai office of the association will also be established within days to plan relief measures. However, because the disaster area is vast and the number of victims is too large, effective relief will depend on the cooperation of powerful sectors of civil society. Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare, aware of this, made a special trip to Shanghai. After consulting with Mayor Chen, they decided to hold a tea party at 4 PM today in the Peacock Hall on the second floor of the International Hotel, jointly invited by Mayor Chen and Minister Ding, to gather leaders from all sectors of the city to discuss relief measures. Representatives from the North China Associations in Beijing and Shanghai will also be invited to participate to report on the disaster situation in North China. It is reported that the fundraising efforts have already decided to organize a grand gathering of famous Peking opera performers, charity football matches, and charity horse races to raise large sums of money for disaster relief in the affected areas. Shanghai, as the economic center of the country, always feels a sense of hunger and drowning with these disaster victims who are crying out for food and is eager to contribute.

### Second Phase of Epidemic Prevention Begins: Vaccination Centers Intensify Services

The second phase of the epidemic prevention campaign has begun in this city this week. All vaccination centers, including the free vaccination centers set up by the health authorities and the vaccination centers set up by various Bao-Jia organizations themselves, have increased staff to serve and intensify vaccinations starting yesterday. Residents of the Chengdu and Xinzha districts of the Public Concession have been assigned dates for vaccination by the Bao-Jia authorities. Those who have delayed or failed to comply have also been urged by the Bao-Jia leaders in charge. It is expected that all residents of the two districts will be vaccinated by the end of this month. In other districts, most residents have also automatically applied to the health sub-bureaus. As for a portion who have privately requested doctors to administer vaccinations, the doctor's certificate must be exchanged for an official epidemic prevention certificate at the Health Bureau on Hankou Road, otherwise it will still be invalid.

### Clearing Garbage in the Nanshi District: Allocation of 700,000 Yuan

The garbage throughout the entire Nanshi district, which has been suspended for nearly four months, is currently being thoroughly cleared by the Nanshi Office of the Health Bureau. In recent days, more than 3,000 truckloads of garbage have already been removed from the Zhonghua Road area alone. In order to ensure the public health of the citizens in the Nanshi district, the Municipal Government has specifically allocated a large sum of 700,000 yuan to expedite the clearing. The office has also ordered the garbage contractors to clear all the garbage in the entire Nanshi district within 35 days. A contract has been signed stipulating that a fine of 5,000 yuan will be imposed for each day of delay. As a result, the garbage on the streets and alleys of the Nanshi district has been gradually decreasing in recent days, and it is expected that it will be completely removed within the time limit.

### When Self-Defense Corps Members Change Posts, They Must Verify Citizen Certificates: If an Unfortunate Incident Occurs Due to Negligence, the Relief Member Shall Bear Full Responsibility

The Bao-Jia authorities of the two concessions have recently discovered that unscrupulous individuals have been impersonating self-defense corps members to take over posts and fraudulently obtain armbands, etc., with the intention of plotting wrongdoing. This situation has been seen repeatedly, greatly affecting social security. Therefore, the Bao-Jia authorities yesterday ordered on-duty corps members that during shift changes, they must request the other party's post-taking certificate to verify the date, time, and location of the post. At the same time, they must also request the person taking over the post to show their citizen certificate, and only after verifying that it matches the name on the certificate may they hand over the items, so as to avoid scams. If a self-defense corps member neglects to carefully inspect the credentials of the person taking over the post, resulting in being deceived, in addition to being punished according to the regulations for losing armbands, the corps member must bear full responsibility if an unfortunate incident occurs in the future. Also, summer has arrived, and self-defense corps members are not allowed to wear wooden clogs or untidy clothing while on duty, otherwise it will be regarded as a violation of the duty rules. Therefore, it is hoped that the self-defense corps members of the two concessions will pay close attention.

### Flat-Priced Cigarettes: Limited to One Pack per Person

The fourth phase of goods distribution by the China Central Tobacco Allocation Cooperative has been completed. The wholesale and retail merchants who sell cigarettes will distribute the goods they receive evenly over ten days. As for the fifth phase of goods distribution, it has already begun. Wholesale and retail merchants have paid for the goods based on the notification slips and will pick up the goods for sale. Regarding the purchase of cigarettes, it is limited to one pack per person. This regulation applies not only to smokers in all sectors of the city but also to employees of all levels of the cooperative. If anyone forcibly buys more than one pack of any kind of cigarette, wholesale and retail merchants are allowed to report it secretly at any time for strict punishment. As for any distribution firms that hoard and refuse to sell, buyers are also allowed to report it at any time.

### Robbery Case in the Nanshi District: Self-Defense Corps Catches a Thief

At 9:20 PM last night, four robbers suddenly broke into the Zhonghua Store at 875 Zhonghua Road in the Nanshi district. Posing as customers, two robbers immediately produced pistols and threatened the owner and others, robbing 200 storage coupons, two pairs of small yellow leather shoes, and one pair of women's black leather shoes. They also stripped off the gold ring worn by the store owner, Xu Wenqi, and fled with the loot. After the Taimen police station in charge learned of the incident, they immediately dispatched patrol officers to search for the robbers everywhere. As a result, one robber, named Zhang Jingen, 26 years old, from Pudong, residing in Dashimingzhong in the Public Concession, was captured by the self-defense corps at the intersection of North Jiangyin Street. He confessed to colluding with others to rob with weapons. He was sent to the main bureau for handling.

### Commemoration of Zhang Liying's Painting Exhibition

Yesterday was the second day of Madame Chen Youren's Zhang Liying's solo oil painting exhibition. People from all walks of life went to the Capital Hotel to visit enthusiastically. In one day, there were no less than a thousand people. Visitors have praised Zhang Nvshi's exquisite art, such as the incisiveness of the painting titles, and the wonderful coloring, as well as being an outstanding oil painter in our country. More than fifty pieces of artwork were displayed, all carefully constructed by Zhang Nvshi over the years, unwilling to part with them, so they are all non-saleable items. It was heard yesterday that a visitor planned to purchase an oil painting for the price of 100,000 yuan, but it was not fulfilled. The preciousness of Zhang Nvshi's works can be seen from this. The exhibition will continue to be open to the public for four days, until the 22nd, from 10 AM to 6 PM daily, without admission fee. All art lovers are welcome to come and enjoy.

### Brief News

### Letter

After the publication of Mr. Wang Zhenxiang's article "Abolish Miscellaneous Taxes" in the National Forum of this newspaper on the 17th, this newspaper received a letter from the Municipal Government Feast Tax Collection Office stating: "The Feast Tax is established by the Municipal Government to subsidize education funds. The question of whether to keep or abolish it is a small matter for discussion. As for Mr. Wang's statement that the monthly submission is only 30,000 yuan, while the actual collection exceeds 500,000 yuan, I do not know which district in this city he is referring to. The feast tax in this city is divided into several districts, such as West Shanghai, Xu Cao, Nanshi, and Pudong, which are organized separately. I do not know the situation in other districts. If it is in our West Shanghai district, it is only enough to maintain the salaries of employees in addition to the submission. As for Mr. Wang's statement that the actual collection "exceeds" 500,000 yuan, please specify which district he is referring to, so as to clarify the facts."

Furthermore, on the 21st and 31st of this month, rice shops and the Rice Sales Office of the Bureau will be closed for sales for two days.

### Two Pre-requisite Problems for Relieving North China Disaster Victims

-- A Reader

After reading the article "Speaking for the Disaster Victims in North China", I was deeply moved. The waterways in the North are poorly managed, and disasters occur with every drought. This is a fundamental problem, and I will not discuss it for the time being. The disaster area is vast this year, and the disaster situation is serious. The urgency of relief is self-evident. Relief requires money. Your newspaper has repeatedly urged contributions, which is extremely important. However, as far as I can see, there are two points in the outline of the prerequisites for disaster relief that must be planned and resolved first. If these two points cannot be resolved, even if millions of funds are collected, it will still be useless for disaster relief. I dare to present them below:

Now is the height of summer. The clothing and housing of the disaster victims are not the most urgent. The most urgent thing is still food. The staple food of the people in that area has always been coarse grains. Now that the harvest has failed, the only things to rely on for transportation are the Manchurian State and the areas north of Shanxi. However, at this time of military tension, everything (especially food) is subject to unified management for production, sales, and transportation. Moreover, Manchuria, Mongolia, and North China are divided into three regions. And the production of grain in the Manchurian State and the areas north of Shanxi has its designated purposes. Now, if we want to change the transportation to Shandong and Henan for disaster relief, we must thoroughly negotiate and comprehensively plan with friendly countries, otherwise the results will be empty talk. During this period of negotiation and planning, the disaster victims cannot wait with empty stomachs, and a huge number will inevitably die again. The tragedy is unspeakable. How can we exert all our strength to quickly negotiate a solution with friendly countries? This is the sole responsibility of the central and local authorities. This is the first point. Now, the troops and bandits in various places are mixed, and transportation is also limited. The long-distance and short-distance transportation of food is not smooth, and even the actions of the disaster relief and distribution personnel are a problem. Even the selection of such personnel is difficult. The corresponding moral skills for disaster relief and distribution are basic requirements, but today they feel like something rarely seen. How can we respond to emergencies and be practical? This is the most important and must be resolved first. It is also something that the central and local authorities must discuss and decide immediately. This is the second point. If the above two points cannot be resolved, then the so-called fundraising and disaster relief are all empty talk. No matter how much money society raises and how much money the government allocates, it is all just official formalities and will not help. The millions of compatriots in the two places will only have to wait for death. I clearly know that it is not easy to resolve the above situation, but there is no other way to set up a fundamental method except for this, and there is no power to do it except for the government. Therefore, based on my conscience, I dare to present it as above. I think friendly people, at a time of cooperation and mutual support in East Asia, will have infinite sympathy for such a serious situation, and the frequent hunger and wandering are closely related to the security development of various places and the situation of the overall East. It is expected that they will not turn a blind eye. As for the central and local authorities, they have the responsibility of relief, so there is no need for us to say more.

Economic Circle: Commentary

### Supporting Legitimate Enterprise Organizations

Our country's industry is backward, and various production enterprises are very immature. After the war, although the increase in the value of materials temporarily presents a distorted prosperity, many of them are strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and the content of their business still needs to be enriched. In the past year or two, there have been many emerging enterprise companies, among which there are many who invest in industry and support production as their mission. Moreover, the factories they have established are all necessary for people's daily life and have been recognized by the society. The government should pay attention to correcting enterprise companies that operate improperly and should reward and encourage various enterprise organizations that support production for the sake of developing China's industry and national industry. As the "Continental News" said on April 29: "During the period of promoting the new economic policy, we should encourage the establishment of financial, commercial, and industrial institutions that can promote the revival of industrial production. However, commercial institutions that are not related to industrial production, as well as those that are only superficially related, and even companies with no reserves... are issues worthy of attention."

Therefore, we believe that the authorities must actively guide this faction of enterprises - those that are not related to industrial production and even have no reserves. The government should provide guidance on the direction of business, the procedures for operation, the steps to accelerate production, and the methods to promote material exchange at any time, correct their shortcomings, and improve their functions, so that all enterprise organizations can only follow the government's lead and work together on unified economic management, so as to complete the task of national economic mobilization, so that the government and private enterprise organizations can become one, and China's immature industrial state can develop and grow, and jointly pursue the advanced countries. Wouldn't it be wonderful and grand?

### Japanese Chamber of Commerce Actively Improves Organizational Structure, Establishes Control Section to Adjust Japanese-Chinese Economy

Since the establishment of the central organization of the China Economic Commerce Control Association, the control mechanism of the Central China economy has gradually been put in place. The Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce, which is in a position to guide the Japanese economic community in Shanghai, previously established the Shanghai Economic Construction Committee, the Japanese Business Countermeasures Committee, and the Japanese-Chinese Problem Committee, enlisting the cooperation of major figures from all walks of life to promote the new policy toward China while seeking the welfare of Japanese businesses. Furthermore, in order to adapt to the new era, it was decided to expand and strengthen the organization of the Chamber of Commerce itself. Managing Director Takeuchi was appointed to draft a plan, which has been approved and implemented since the 15th after being passed at the general meeting on the 14th.

Organizational Points

The original Intelligence Section will be renamed the Planning Section. In addition to collecting intelligence and reporting on matters, all economic matters and matters related to liaison and negotiation with official and economic organizations will be handled by the Planning Section. Therefore, the center of the Chamber of Commerce will be placed in the planning aspect. The scope of the Investigation Section will be expanded to include the data room, investigation space, and statistics, responding to the Planning Section's investigation of economic trends, being responsible for researching and investigating the static state of the economy, and adding a Control Section. Adapting to the economic circles of Central China in which the transfer of the control economic mechanism takes place, it will guide the Japanese economic circles and bear a very important mission, specializing in the control of guilds and other economic organizations, and in charge of the consolidation and merger of industry and commerce, investigation of business conditions, and matters of Chinese economic control organizations. Regarding the unemployment or impact on Japanese businesses after the promotion of the new economic policy, this section will take close contact with the Japanese Business Countermeasures Committee, etc., and be responsible for control and guidance.

Economic Consultation

The Commercial Consultation Office will be renamed the Economic Consultation Office. At this important military stage, the association also attaches great importance to the personnel issues of the consultation office. In order to facilitate work, the current Director's Office Secretariat will be expanded into the Executive Director's Office. The General Affairs Section and Accounting Section will be renamed the General Affairs Department and Finance Department in order to unify the names. The names of the Publication Section will remain unchanged, but the publication policy, which has always been targeted at the local area, will be adjusted. Under the policy of integrating the entire Chinese economy with the entire Japanese domestic economy, publication matters will be improved. In terms of organization, there will be a Director-General of the Secretariat and a Deputy Director-General of the Secretariat. The Director-General will be the ex officio Managing Director, and the Deputy Director-General will be the ex officio Deputy Director of the Chamber of Commerce. As for other personnel changes, they are still under careful consideration. In addition, regarding the revitalization of Chinese rural areas, experienced people in rural affairs have been gathered to prepare for the establishment of a Rural Countermeasures Committee. Regarding this reform of the organization, Managing Director Takeuchi specially issued a statement saying that due to the promotion of the policy toward China, the economic circles of Japanese residents will inevitably be affected to a considerable extent. Therefore, rather than striving to reduce the impact, it is better to aim at enriching the Japanese economic situation, so that those affected will not feel uncomfortable, and work will be promoted from the perspective of unifying ideas, and he is willing to assist the implementation of the new policy from the sidelines.

### Commerce Control Association: Flour and Wheat Special Committee Established

The Flour and Wheat Special Committee, under the supervision of the Ministry of Food and the General Association of Commercial Control, has been organized and established. The address is located on the third floor of the Silk Building at No. 2 Beijing Road. It has begun operations and will hold a tea party at 4:30 PM tomorrow (20th) on the first floor of the Cathay Hotel to entertain guests from all walks of life.

Establishment of Sino-Japanese Flour and Wheat Organization

Also, the reporter has learned that the lower-level organization of the Flour and Wheat Special Fighting Committee has been closely reviewed by the relevant authorities as soon as possible. It has been determined that the organization of the committee will include both Chinese and Japanese flour food organizations. The Chinese side is the Flour and Wheat Industry Federation, and the Japanese side is the reorganized and downsized China Branch Flour Milling Industry Federation. At the general meeting held in the middle of this month, the association decided to divide its internal organization into three departments: collection, processing, and distribution.

Chinese Distribution Organization Established Separately

The organization under the Federation is the Flour and Wheat Industry Association, which includes both Chinese and Japanese flour and wheat industries. The Japanese members of the association include the collection, processing, and distribution departments, while the Chinese members of the association include the collection and processing departments. The distribution department is set up separately. According to the reporter, this separate organization is temporary in nature and will be reorganized when necessary.

### Silver and Money Association Lending Methods Limited to Industrial and Commercial Firms

The two joint reserve treasuries of the silver and money industry, in order to prevent the use of goods as collateral to apply for lending funds, have been extremely careful in handling interbank lending. It is specifically stipulated that those who provide property to apply for loans must be legitimate factories or businesses, and the purpose must not be to hoard for profit. The total evaluation should not exceed 25% of the total amount of lending approved for each bank. The total amount of lending shall not exceed the sum of the paid-up capital and public reserve of each bank. After the price is assessed, the discount is: (1) For those with a limited price, 60% of the limited price. (2) For those without a limited price, 30% of the assessed price. The lending period is set at ten days, but it may be returned in advance and no extension may be applied for. At the same time, it is hoped that the industry will maintain its strength to ensure safety. If it is not necessary, it is best not to lend. The purpose of lending is purely for the necessity of the industry. When its payment ability is not sufficient, it should be given some chips as assistance. It is not to provide low-interest funds to the industry on a regular basis for usual operations.

### Chinese Stocks Resume Trading Today

Since applying to the Municipal Economic Bureau for registration and obtaining business licenses, fifteen Chinese stock firms in this city, including Xinfeng, Baofeng, and Wufu stock companies, have already obtained licenses and are scheduled to officially resume trading on the 19th of this month. It is learned that after the resumption of trading by the fifteen stock companies, the business hours are set from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM daily, with Sundays and holidays off. The commission is still charged at 0.5% of the transaction amount, and the Shanghai Special Municipal Supplementary Levy on Chinese Stock Trading Provisional Measures will be followed, and the selling client will pay a certification fee of 5 jiao of national currency for every 1,000 yuan of the actual transaction amount (calculated as 1,000 yuan even if the amount is less than 1,000 yuan). It is heard that the Economic Bureau will also issue the licenses for the third batch of stock traders soon.

### Ministry of Industry and Commerce Assesses Standard Price of Spring Cocoons

In view of the fact that the spring cocoon industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has already been launched, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially invited representatives from the Construction Departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to hold a spring cocoon valuation meeting on the 15th of this month in order to unify the purchase price. A public decision was immediately made on the standard price of spring cocoons, and all silk manufacturers and remaining cocoon merchants were ordered to comply. The reporter of this newspaper inquired from the Acting Bureau yesterday and obtained detailed information: (A) Improved Variety Fresh Cocoon Price (1) 380 jin reeling per dan (Sima weight) 2816 yuan, market weight 2286 yuan. (2) 400 jin reeling per dan (Sima weight) 2675 yuan, market weight 2172 yuan. (3) 420 jin reeling per dan (Sima weight) 2548 yuan, market weight 2069 yuan. (B) The price of native fresh cocoons is calculated at 70% of the reeling price of improved varieties, and it is stipulated that 300 jin of fresh cocoons dried into 100 jin of dry cocoons is the reeling standard. It is also heard that spring cocoons in Haining and Jiaxing, Zhejiang have been launched, and silk manufacturers and remaining cocoon merchants in Shanghai are allowed to freely purchase them according to the standard price set by the Ministry. However, the counties in Jiangsu Province limit the cocoon-receiving manufacturers to those who have silk reeling factories in the province. The Shanghai concession area is not in the province of Jiangsu. Therefore, silk manufacturers in Shanghai have requested the Jiangsu Construction Department to allow them to freely purchase in various parts of Jiangsu Province.

### Liang Shao Soil Yellow Wine Limited Price Approved

The Municipal Food and Economic Bureaus of this city, having previously received orders from the Ministry to strengthen the wartime economic mechanism, reorganize the industrial and commercial guilds of major commodities in the urban area, and establish joint associations of industrial and commercial guilds, have commissioned widely respected preparatory members to establish the preparatory offices of the joint associations, which have been disclosed in newspapers. All original industrial and commercial guilds and similar organizations that are not in line with the wartime economic mechanism have now received orders from the Ministry of Food and Industry to immediately cease activities and to submit the seals and stamps issued by the former competent authorities within a time limit to avoid division and ensure uniformity.

### My Views on the Resumption of Trading of Chinese Stocks

— Donglin

Chinese stock trading has been suspended for three months since mid-February, when the relevant department of the Engineering Bureau considered it to be speculative and ordered stock traders to stop trading. Initially, although news about the resumption of trading could be seen intermittently in the newspapers, it was sometimes tight and sometimes loose, and it did not materialize. Recently, it was only seen that the relevant authorities officially permitted the resumption of trading and the records of the joint announcement of stock traders. Then, in the future, Chinese stock trading will reappear in the economic circles of Shanghai in a new posture.

I consider myself to be someone who is slightly concerned about the stock business, so I naturally pay attention to the dynamics of the stock business and its future development. However, I am neither the issuer of stocks, nor the holder, nor the employee of a stock trader; in my personal capacity, the rise and fall of the stock business does not directly affect my interests. The reason for my concern and attention to the stock business is entirely based on "the relationship between the stock business and the Chinese economic circles"; it can also be said that how to revitalize China's economic business, especially the industrial and commercial economy, is the main object of my concern and attention. Because the stock business has a close relationship with the industrial and commercial economy, it has also become a subsidiary object of my concern and attention. Although these few sentences are superfluous, in order to explain that I have an objective view of the stock business, I have to say them.

Chinese stocks are a kind of securities representing the assets of Chinese industrial and commercial businesses. Therefore, its circulation is the circulation of funds in industrial and commercial businesses, which is enough to revitalize the use of industrial and commercial funds and promote the prosperity of business. There is probably no doubt about this. At the same time, new industrial and commercial businesses, or industrial and commercial businesses with plans and prospects, lack the use of funds, then issuing stocks to absorb funds and seek legitimate outlets for those who own funds is probably also not a small doubt, but a certainty. The emergence of stock trading markets under such circumstances is, I dare say, not only an absolute need, but a necessity. At present, theories and articles that regard Chinese stocks as legitimate investments, promote increased production, and prosper the economy are heard and seen a lot, and I do not want to repeat them. I believe that the essence of Chinese stock trading is indeed the medium needed for the current prosperity of industrial and commercial businesses. The competent authorities should give active promotion in the supervision and guidance, and on the one hand, establish a formal market as soon as possible, and on the other hand, lead stock traders to organize guilds to guide Chinese stock traders into a legitimate track. It is necessary to recognize that the so-called drawbacks of speculation are caused by the failure to go through proper supervision methods and letting them evolve naturally. Even if there is the reality of its drawbacks, one cannot only blame the operators and forget the competent authorities' abandonment of responsibility. This is especially to be reflected on. "It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost." It is very gratifying that Chinese stock trading has been restored. In the future, I hope that the competent economic authorities must recognize their own responsibilities and the relationship between the Chinese stock business and the entire economic circle, and quickly plan the two things mentioned above. Then, the past mistakes will not be repeated, and the prosperity of industrial and commercial businesses and the outlets for idle funds will all have a bright future. I would like to offer this to the relevant authorities and economic figures on the occasion of celebrating the resumption of Chinese stock trading.

### "Speech" and "Action"

— Fangcao

"Speech" and "action" are two methods of expressing a person's thoughts and personality. "Speech" not only comes out of the mouth and takes the form of sound, but also uses words to express it. Ancient emperors often used "abdominal defamation" against others, creating many "possibly existing" crimes. This was a product of despotic tyranny and belonged to an exception. "Action" includes two aspects: actively doing and passively not doing. The former is an obvious action, and the latter is a tacit inaction. In fact, both are "action," but the two are just different in form!

The sage said: "Observe his speech and examine his actions." When a person's "speech" and "action" cannot be consistent, it is often due to the instability and elusiveness of his thoughts. For example, when "speaking," his thoughts are immersed in a certain state. When he goes to "act," his thoughts change, deviating to another state. As a result, "speech" and "action" do not match, and they are completely irrelevant.

Some people overemphasize the "speech" side and forget the "action" completely. Their discussions are truly eloquent. There is also a kind of heroic spirit that swallows mountains and rivers, which is a bit awe-inspiring. But when we examine their "actions," we will be surprised and astonished at those actions, and even dare not believe that they would do those behaviors. There are many similar examples, and we can easily find them around us.

We must be careful to guard against other people's "speech" and "action," but the most important thing is whether our own "speech" and "action" can achieve the point where "speech" is followed by "action." If we only care about saying beautiful and pleasing words on the surface, but in reality "speech" does not take "action" into account, and we are unwilling to earnestly fulfill our promises, to be honest, this kind of armchair strategy is of no practical effect.

Broadly speaking, those in power must handle political affairs efficiently and effectively. Even when it comes to personal private affairs, it seems that the key to achieving an invincible position is whether they can personally implement them. As for the amount of "speech," whether it is pleasant to listen to, are all unimportant matters that can be ignored and valued.

### Perseverance

— Zhenquan

Napoleon once said: "Victory belongs to those who have strong perseverance." After a thorough investigation, we know that perseverance relies on three things: purpose, will, and enthusiasm. Purpose can concentrate our strength, will can strengthen our beliefs, and enthusiasm maintains our interest and eliminates all obstacles.

In a sense, life is a battle. A person who relies solely on cleverness and luck will always fail. Perseverance is the driving force of the solid soul, holding the key to the knowledge storehouse. From there, the world will prosper and civilization will advance.

Great people never wait for opportunities. They create opportunities. They seize reality and solve it immediately, and eventually overcome everything. The greatest thing that mankind can do in the present world is to utilize the materials given to him by the environment. This is the only way to succeed.

The most important lesson in life is to study how to gain victory from failure. It takes great perseverance to humbly find out the reasons for the setbacks after suffering unfortunate setbacks. At the same time, this can also be said to be the difference between success and failure. To know that one who cannot struggle to improve and cannot endure the pain of failure will not know the true meaning of success.

### Courage

— Zonglu

Mencius said: "Brandishing a sword and glaring, saying, 'How dare he resist me!' This is the courage of a common man, who can defeat one person."

Su Shi of Dongpo said: "A common man, when insulted, draws his sword and rises up, fighting with his life. This is not enough to be courage. The world has great courage. He is slightly surprised when he suddenly encounters it, and slightly angry when it is added to him for no reason. This is because what he holds is very great, and his ambition is very far."

Zhang Zai of Hengqu said: "To establish a heart for heaven and earth, to establish a destiny for the people, to continue the unique learning for the past sages, and to create peace for all generations. Only then can it be said to be great courage."

### The Purpose and Method of Learning Japanese

— Long Zhending

Mr. Uchiyama Kanzo wrote an article six or seven years ago entitled "A Person's Habits." At the beginning, he pointed out that many unfortunate events often occur between Chinese and Japanese people. After thinking and researching, most of them are due to differences in mutual habits and language barriers. ... At the end of the article, he concluded, "In short, the people of both China and Japan should understand each other's habits and language in all aspects, so that they can prevent misunderstandings on a personal level! They can solve international disputes on a large scale..." This is a fair comment, and it is indeed prescient.

Since the Incident, there have been many Japanese people studying our country's language, and there are even more Chinese people studying Japanese. As Mr. Hashimoto Kansetsu said: "... The popularity of Japanese... especially in China, one of the reasons for the convenience is the similarity of the characters; (the author's note: probably refers to the convenience of learning) another reason can be said to be due to utilitarian thinking, such as knowing Japanese, one can quickly get a job..." (see the Free Talk in this newspaper on May 7) However, according to the author's observation: most of the current learners are still like Uchiyama Kanzo said, in order to understand a little Japanese, they can avoid misunderstandings on both sides. Because it is very painful, many Chinese people, especially travelers, have suffered a lot from not knowing Japanese in the past, so many people think that "it is more convenient to understand Japanese" before learning Japanese.

In fact, the purpose of learning Japanese should not be too proud, nor should it be too timid. That's right, learning Japanese, like learning English, can facilitate conversation and business, and can read newspapers and do translations. It can be said that these are all legitimate purposes, but if one is determined to use Japanese as a tool to study Japanese literature, study social sciences, or take "communication between the two countries' cultures" as a mission and purpose, then that is naturally a step further!

Most people who learn Japanese hope to "complete it quickly." Although Chinese and Japanese characters have many similarities, making it easier for Chinese people to learn Japanese than any other country (conversely, it is also easier for Japanese people to learn Chinese;) however, every language has its own life and characteristics. If you have the close idea that "this matter is very easy" at the beginning and do not pay close attention to it and study it carefully, then not only will you not be able to "complete it quickly," but you will also create the joke of "drawing a tiger and failing to become like a dog."

Japanese text is mixed with many Chinese characters. On the one hand, this makes Chinese people feel very interested in learning the language. On the other hand, it prevents Chinese people from deeply understanding Japanese, because many Chinese characters can be understood literally, and are very similar to Chinese characters, but there are also many Chinese characters whose readers are not different and whose meaning is simply irrelevant to Chinese. For example, the meaning of "油斷大敵" is: "Carelessness is harmful, and you must not be lazy," the meaning of "馬鹿" is: "Bastard"; and the meaning of "大丈夫" is "firm," and the meaning of "勉强" is "study hard"... It is really countless!

In short, "haste makes waste" in everything. Learning Japanese and only understanding a little pidgin conversation or memorizing dozens or hundreds of grammar rules will not help. Only by not being impatient or taking shortcuts! Learn step by step, start with spoken language, then study "written language," and at the same time, on the one hand, try to practice "conversation," and on the other hand, you must pay attention to "syntax," advancing with each other! Only then can you feel a strong interest and gain a deep understanding; this is the only way to truly achieve the so-called purpose of fast success. Otherwise, like ordinary people blindly seeking fast success, it is simply fishing in a tree, and if you are lucky, you can only taste a little bit of fur.

### Genius and Environment

— Tong Qian

What is "genius"? "Genius" is a special ability that a person possesses from birth. Through the guidance of parents and teachers, this inherent genius is elicited, and thus a talented person with specialized skills can be produced. Although each person has their own unique genius, there are also those whose genius is buried due to a lack of opportunity. This is the inevitable relationship between "genius" and "environment." This relationship is not that "genius" can transform the "environment," nor that the "environment" can generate "genius"; rather, it is the close relationship between the adaptation of the "environment" and the realization of "genius." To have genius but lack the environment is the same as not having genius at all; if the environment requires a certain genius, but that talent is lacking, the result is also the same as zero – both are lost. For example, Zhan Tianyou, a famous figure in the Qing Dynasty, had the genius to develop China's navy, but the reality was the opposite; the government appointed him to oversee the construction of railways. Although the results were not bad, how much greater would the impact have been if he had followed his natural path! Another example is Yan Fu, a scholar of the Qing Dynasty, who possessed profound knowledge and insightful ideas. According to his genius, he could have reformed China's politics and industry, etc.; however, the reality was the opposite, and he was buried in a literary translation career, only translating many famous European and American works. Although this also brought considerable benefits to China, the effect was worlds apart from directly transforming China. At the same time, Ito Hirobumi of Japan was trusted by the government and transformed the entire Japan, so now it is so strong. This is because it had both "genius" and "environment," both of which were complete, and thus produced a great talent. The country also received great help. From this, we young people should, on the one hand, cultivate our genius based on our own abilities and the paths we are inclined to take; on the other hand, we should also try to expand our genius and become a multi-faceted, specialized technical talent. In school, we should regard all subjects as equally important, and when studying at a high level, choose several of them and devote considerable effort and time to studying and researching them to the best of our ability. In this way, I can boldly say that everyone's genius can adapt to the environment and be very suitable for future needs. Therefore, every young person in school should regard their genius as one of the most precious things in life, and make every effort to develop it in line with the urgent needs of the environment; in this way, we will neither bury our genius nor go against the environment, and thus we can be called promising young people of the future.

### Small Hope

— Ming

In society, nothing succeeds smoothly without setbacks. Success can only be achieved through arduous struggles and constant磨折(challenges), and the success achieved at that time is the most beautiful and precious. Great people tell us this, which makes us know the difficulty of career success, and also gives us courage to overcome difficulties.

However, in today's society, most people with a little more experience are always sighing. They not only feel bad about the failure of their careers, but also give some "cold air" to those vigorous new young people, pouring cold water on the young people's hot hearts. They will admonish young people like this..."When we were young, we were just like you, even stronger than you, but what about now! Isn't it still a failure? I advise you, just be content!" This is like a 山海經 (classic of mountains and seas), but it is actually a 殺人經(murdering sutra). It is right to tell young people that career success is difficult, but it is wrong and sinful to sigh and make young people shrink back in the face of difficulties. I hope that this kind of youth leader will stop killing young people with sighs!

### On a Lonely Boat - Dedicated to Friends Who are Hesitating and Wandering

— Hu Ruoliu

In the calm sea,

The wind rises again,

The sea is stirred up with huge waves;

In the wind and storm,

Storms and waves;

Like the collapse of the sky,

Like the crack of the earth;

Like thousands of troops and horses on the battlefield——

Galloping and roaring.

Friends! Look!

The big ship in front is overturned!

The ship behind is blown over!

How dangerous!

We are in a flat boat.

Hesitating,

Wandering,

Groaning,

Sighing,

It is always disappointment.

Pull yourself together to struggle,

Determine your will to do it to the end;

Not afraid of the wind blowing,

Not afraid of the rain beating.

Friends!

Remember!

"Struggle to survive! Creation brings new life!"

### Eye Expert Dr. Liu Yongjun Benefits the Poor and Sick

Yesterday, we received a letter from Dr. Liu Yongjun, an ophthalmologist, which said: "Eyes are important organs for people to see the world and have a great impact on daily life. According to general statistics, 90 percent of people in society suffer from trachoma. If it is not treated quickly, it will spread and cause harm. This doctor, in view of this, feels compassion. I have made a special medicine for trachoma to meet the needs of the society; and I have prepared long-term preferential cards to give to the poor and sick, so that compatriots can get rid of eye diseases and enter the realm of light as soon as possible." Dr. Liu was once an ophthalmologist of the Chinese Medical Association and has set up his own clinic on the second floor of Zhengwei Pharmacy on Carter Road. He has cured many difficult eye diseases and restored sight to the blind. The doctor has rich experience and safe surgery. Many of our colleagues have been treated by him. Preferential cards can be obtained from our newspaper.

### Building Public Bathhouses for the Common People

— Ye Bochu

Not only in summer, but even at ordinary times, if you can take a bath once a day, it will not only make you feel cool and comfortable, and remove dirt, but also be very beneficial to your health. This is exactly a healthy health care work. Therefore, in this hot and epidemic summer, bathing is almost a daily work for everyone. Speaking of bathing, it requires three conditions: place, equipment, and water. This is very convenient for wealthy families, and they may take a bath several times a day; even middle-class families do not feel it is difficult; however, the most difficult is the class of the lower class and laborers, who work under the scorching sun all day long, sweating profusely, and their bodies are already unbearable. However, a dozen people live in a pigeon-like attic or stove shed, which is already very cramped. Where can there be various bathing facilities and places! And the street beggars are covered with oil and dirt, and lice and fleas are flying around. Some of them even have poisonous sores, pus and blood dripping, and insects and flies gathering. It is really unbearable, and the situation is indescribable!

Therefore, I sincerely ask the wise authorities to set up public bathhouses for the common people so that the common people can have the opportunity to bathe. This may as well rely on the Baojia (neighborhood watch) organization to select a suitable location and set up several bathhouses in each district, equipped with cold water shower heads. A fee can be charged for each bath (the method can imitate public toilets). As for the funding, it can be raised from the public or allocated by the authorities. Fortunately, the time is short, the cost is not much, and the benefits are great, and the merits are immeasurable! At the same time, it is also beneficial in preventing the spread of epidemics.
