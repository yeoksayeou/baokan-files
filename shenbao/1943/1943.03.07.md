### Achieving Streamlined Administration Through Organizational Adjustment

Since the National Government entered the war, in order to meet the practical needs after participation, political institutions have been gradually undergoing reasonable adjustments. Therefore, the people of the country place great expectations on the political future. However, we further hope that the government will implement the requirement of "streamlined administration." To this end, we offer the following suggestions based on our observations:

Firstly, the relationship between central and local institutions should be more closely linked. Local governments and the central government are inherently one. Except for financial and tax revenues, which must be handled uniformly, local affairs can be handled by local governments without direct involvement from central ministries. Also, apart from the accounting system, which should be transcendent, there is no need for extra organizations that are also transcendent. For example, farms, forestry centers, agricultural experiment stations, and social service organizations should be managed by local governments or private organizations, with the government in a supporting and guiding role. This will be more effective than having the central government directly manage them, and all malpractices will be easier to prevent. Similarly, for cooperative administration, there is no need for quasi-transcendent organizations. We hope to restrict the direct handling of business by central government agencies in the provinces. If research results suggest that certain businesses should be operated by the state, local governments can still assume responsibility, rather than having central ministries directly manage them.

Secondly, in order to implement streamlined administration, the number of central and local institutions must be reviewed and adjusted. In the past, there was a common phenomenon in our country's politics: the number of central and local institutions were completely consistent. If there was a certain institution in the central government, there would be the same institution in the local government, in a top-down manner. For example, if the central government had a certain ministry, the province would have a certain department or division, and the county would have a certain section. This was not only unnecessary but also led to overworked officials and suffering people, which often arose from this. This political custom is no longer widespread, but it cannot be said that it no longer exists at all, so it should be noted. In principle, the central government and local governments can be separated, and separation is necessary for design, guidance, and implementation of national policies. However, at the local level, the situation is simpler, so integration is more appropriate.

Thirdly, some institutions were originally established as temporary measures, and there is no need to continue them now that the circumstances have changed. There are also some institutions that have virtually nothing to do but were established simply to avoid a perceived deficiency. These should be abolished. As for institutions with similar functions and light workloads, they should be merged. All of this is to save public funds and simplify administration. If the talent is usable, they can be transferred to suitable institutions. We hope that this streamlined administration will be implemented in the central government and extended to local governments.

Furthermore, the scope of state-operated businesses should be quickly defined. In recent years, state-operated businesses have been increasing. In the future, as a result of the implementation of the Sino-Japanese Agreement and the transfer of enemy property and concessions, the scope of state-operated businesses will inevitably expand. For large-scale operations such as foreign trade and transportation, and small-scale operations such as charitable relief, the question will arise as to what should be state-operated and what should be privately operated. We believe that the state's human and financial resources are limited, and these small state-operated businesses are directly under the central government, or thousands of miles away, making supervision and command impossible. Malpractices will inevitably arise, and the local people will be adversely affected. Therefore, the scope of state-operated businesses should be thoroughly considered. For businesses that are insignificant or can be handled by people's organizations, such as social services and social welfare, the state can play a guiding role. Even for some industrial, commercial, agricultural, and auxiliary transportation businesses, it is not necessary for the state to directly operate everything. This will not only avoid the suspicion of "competing with the people for profit" but also achieve the effect of "streamlined administration," and the utilization of civilian power can also be realized here.

Editorial Commentary

### Scientific Research Under the Decisive Battle

As the war intensifies, it is becoming a war of attrition. Our material war power is inferior to the enemy's in quantity. We must surpass the enemy in quality. Major inventions in war science are no less advantageous than winning a battle. Therefore, from the point of view of their effect, the responsibility of scientific researchers is indeed very heavy.

Recently, the extraordinary efforts of Japanese scientists have achieved noteworthy results in many fields, which is gratifying. However, in terms of the demands of the current situation, has the total efficiency of the scientific researchers been fully exploited? In our view, in the current decisive battle period, the highly efficient exploitation of scientific research has not yet reached its maximum utilization.

Everyone admits that science is important in enhancing war power, which is an abstract principle. Therefore, in reality, all factors that hinder the increase in efficiency must be fully resolved. Both the government and the scientists have matters to reflect on in order to promote this.

First, for the government, one of the most important things is the human resource problem of scientific researchers. All undertakings are done by people, but the proportion of people has rarely had such a significant impact as in scientific research. If a capable and talented leader wants to realize his special creativity, he must have co-researchers and assistants who are willing to engage in research and experimentation; furthermore, he must have new and energetic people, like supporting hands and feet, as loyal research assistants. Scientific research, like war, cannot succeed with only a commander, no matter how capable he is.

Secondly, scientific researchers should be allowed to immerse themselves in research. Originally, there were many talented scientific researchers among university professors in Japan. However, since the establishment of new departments and divisions, due to the lack of talent, combined with the busyness of part-time teaching and strengthening academic affairs, and the increasing amount of school chores, as well as being busy with frequent meetings of various committees, a lot of time is indeed wasted. It must be understood that truly effective scientific achievements are mostly produced in research laboratories. Therefore, the non-research trivia that capable researchers are responsible for should be adjusted. We earnestly hope that the Ministry of Education authorities will carefully consider this in the implementation of the academic system.

Third, there is the issue of material assistance for scientific research, namely, the problem of materials and money. Currently, the provision of essential items for scientific research should be assisted to the extent possible. In addition, universities have recognized in recent years that money is essential for research. Now is an era when money is indispensable.

The above is to remind the government to recognize the essence of scientific research. On the other hand, there are also many points on which scientists are expected to frankly reflect. Scientists should earnestly recognize what scientific problems are currently urgently needed by the country and should engage in research. Moreover, the specialized fields and the degree of ability of each researcher are clearest among the scientists. Therefore, the scope of research assignments should be carefully determined by the scientists themselves, and they should be strictly cautioned against extending to unnecessary parts in many fields. At the same time, specialization is of course very narrow. If it is interpreted as trivial, and therefore the fundamental theoretical technology is neglected, making it impossible to exert capable talent, it can be said that this is the country's uneconomicality. When organizing specialized committees on particularly important issues, this point must be fully considered.

Moreover, during the decisive battle period, in order to promote the success of scientific research and avoid unnecessary duplication, scientists researching the same problem should contact each other, constantly inform each other of the degree of progress, and cooperate wholeheartedly in research.

These are all platitudes and easy to implement, but if the old ways are not changed, implementation will definitely not be smooth. The relevant parties should recognize the importance of the current situation, sacrifice personal interests for the public good, take the front-line soldiers' hearts as their own, and fight hard to implement the country's goals. Only in this way can the highest efficiency be achieved. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, February 27th)

### The House of Representatives Plenary Session Passes Bill to Strengthen War Power, Prime Minister Tojo Attends and Delivers Speech, Reaffirming Determination to Defeat Britain and the United States

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese House of Representatives held the last plenary session of this session today to discuss the war power enhancement bill, the main issue of this session. The president of the Diet, Matajiro Koizumi, explained the reasons for the proposal, which was unanimously passed by the entire house. Subsequently, Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech, clarifying to China and foreign countries the determination to enhance war power and strive for final victory, stating briefly that "the 81st Diet has passed many bills, including the budget bill and other bills. The government has decided to implement them separately to enhance war power in the second year of the decisive battle and defeat Britain and the United States." The resolution to enhance war power is recorded as follows: "Promoting righteousness to the eight corners of the world and defeating Britain and the United States to build a new world order is the historical mission of the Empire. Therefore, the entire nation should be united, officials and civilians should be one, and the total power of the country should be devoted to concentrating on enhancing war power to establish a system of certain victory and invincibility. The government should, under the great ideals of the founding of the nation, strive to promote the heroic spirit of the people and the heroic morale of defeating Britain and the United States, and should also set an example, broaden the principles, eliminate the abuses of bureaucratic self-righteousness, reuse talents, and increase the creative enthusiasm of the people, so that the reasons that become obstacles to expanding production can be completely eliminated, thereby enhancing war power. This is resolved as follows."

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - At today's House of Representatives session, Prime Minister Tojo expressed the government's belief regarding the resolution on enhancing war power, saying that the government fully understands the purpose of the current bill. The Greater East Asia War has reached a state of decisive battle. This year is extremely important in the world war situation. At this extraordinary time, the government fully appreciates the abundance of the resolution's purpose, always expects the vigorous power of the people, and at the same time seeks various means to use the wartime administrative special law to mobilize the important military resources of the entire Greater East Asia area. The entire country is dedicated to enhancing war power. Japanese soldiers and civilians should aim to stand out and crush their old enemies, Britain and the United States, lead the one billion people of Greater East Asia, and work together to build East Asia, in order to contribute to the establishment of a just new world order.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Diet did not hold a plenary session of the House of Peers today, but only convened a metropolitan system committee at 10:00. After all questions were completed, the meeting was adjourned. As for the House of Representatives, in order to continue deliberating on all bills, a plenary session was held at 2:00, and a resolution on enhancing will power was proposed, which was unanimously passed before the meeting was adjourned. Also, the various committees started meetings separately at 10:00 to deliberate on the settlement of accounts, wartime amusement, and youth prohibition bills. After questioning, the meetings were adjourned.

### Japanese Army on the Border of Yunnan and Burma Defeats the Chongqing and British Armies, the Chongqing Army in the Nujiang Area is Completely Annihilated, and the Japanese Army Occupies Dege in the Myitkyina Area

Yangon, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army, in various places on the northern border of Myanmar and Yunnan, has defeated the US and Chongqing armies that stubbornly resisted, and has thoroughly attacked the British Indian army and Chongqing army that attempted to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Highway. The Japanese army has broken through the Gaoligong Mountains and annihilated about two divisions of the Chongqing army near Mamian Pass, and continued to mop up the remnants of the Chongqing army in that area and advanced forward. Another unit of the Japanese army attacked and occupied Bimo. Xie Jinsheng's unit of the Chongqing army seems to have withdrawn from the area earlier for fear of the Japanese army's attack. There is still an unfinished barracks remaining there, and many tools left behind by the Chongqing army, which is enough to prove its embarrassment when retreating. The mountainous area between Bimo and Dege has accumulated about three feet of thunder, the road is rugged, and it is difficult for people and horses to travel. The Japanese army is currently rushing to repair the road and continue to advance. On March 1, the Japanese army attacked the main force of the Fourth Division of the Chongqing army in the Mingzhi River Zaxi Valley. The Japanese army also swept the Chongqing army near Weipan Street with a part of its troops, and another team of the Japanese army also swept the Chongqing army near Taiping Street, Shunjiang Street, and Maoding Street. Now, the "Chongqing army" in the Nujiang area of Yunnan has been completely annihilated. In the North Myanmar area, the Japanese army encountered the British Indian army northeast of Myitkyina. After a fierce attack by the Japanese army, it has occupied Dege. The Japanese army that advanced towards Bimo has joined forces with the troops that occupied Bimo. The Japanese army north of Myitkyina has defeated the Chongqing army north of Gongsupaizhipu, and has confirmed the bridges at the crossing of the river near the area, and has defeated the British and Chongqing armies in the Baoga area northwest of Myitkyina, and has occupied the area. Also, the Japanese army that advanced from the upper reaches of the Gengdewan River has also defeated the British and Chongqing armies in the mountains east of the area, and then encountered more than 500 British and Chongqing armies at a certain pass. After an hour of fighting, the enemy was completely defeated.

### Military Commission Revises Method of Allocating Military Rice, Outstanding Police Rice is Changed to Subsidy

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - In order to stabilize the lives of soldiers, the Military Commission has experimented with the division of rations and pay. The first step was to establish a temporary method for allocating military rice, allocating military rice according to the actual number of soldiers, which was claimed and distributed by the various troops. Now that the National Government has participated in the Greater East Asia War, and the originally planned method has also been tested, the temporary method for allocating military rice has been revised according to the current actual situation, focusing on adapting to the wartime food system and stabilizing the lives of soldiers. It is stipulated that the military rice issued shall not be deducted in price, and the procedures and deadlines for military rice claims and reports shall be strictly stipulated and strictly implemented. In addition, the food management committee's outstanding police rice for police agencies in various provinces and cities from December of the 30th year to March of the 31st year has also been processed by the General Supervisory Office of the Military Commission and the Ministry of Finance will allocate and reissue the police rice subsidy fee under the remaining amount of the police rice subsidy fee for those four months, according to the actual number of police officers in each province and city in each month. The subsidy fee for December of the 30th year is 6 yuan and 8 jiao per person per month, 3 yuan and 5 jiao for January of the 31st year, 7 yuan and 5 jiao for February, and 8 yuan for March. The police agencies in the jurisdiction of the North Jiangsu Headquarters only issued the subsidy fee for December of the 30th year due to incomplete rosters. The Ministry of Finance was notified to issue the subsidy fee on March 1 of this year, and the Executive Yuan and the provincial and municipal governments were notified to instruct the police agencies to send personnel to claim and distribute the subsidy fee, in order to show consideration.

### Ministry of Justice Establishes Office in Shanghai

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Judicial Administration considers Shanghai to be a major commercial port with a large number of lawsuits. In order to strengthen the efficiency of the court's work and facilitate supervision, it plans to establish an office in Shanghai. The organizational rules have been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is now learned that it has been approved. The important officials of the office have been appointed by Minister Luo, with consultant Qiao Wanxuan concurrently serving as the director, Deputy Director Cai Meishun concurrently serving as the deputy director, and Counselor Peng Wangshi concurrently serving as the secretary. It is said that it will be established within the month.

### Guangdong Construction Department Rewards Land Reclamation

Guangzhou, 6th (Central News Agency) - In order to reward land reclamation and planting in various counties, the Guangdong Construction Department first implemented reward measures in Nanhai, Zhongshan, Shunde, and Dongguan. The government subsidized each county with 5,000 military tickets for planting expenses. The arable land is planned for 5,000 mu in the first year, 5,000 mu in the second year, and 10,000 mu in the third year, increasing annually.

### He Yingqin Returns to Chongqing from India

Nanjing, 6th (Allied News Agency) - It is reported that He Yingqin, the Chief of the Land Army in Chongqing, has returned to Chongqing from India with General Stilwell, the Commander-in-Chief of the US Army stationed in India and Chongqing. It has been found that Mr. He tried to obtain greater assistance in India, but achieved nothing, because India also felt a lack of military equipment and munitions. Even if there were supplies, they could not be transported from India to Chongqing. It is reported that Mr. He also discussed with British General Wavell and Stilwell stationed in India the plan to jointly recover Myanmar from the Axis powers. However, the British and American military leaders also disregarded Mr. He's views on this matter, and failed to agree on the details and timing of the implementation of this plan. On the way back to Chongqing, Mr. He stopped in Guilin and Shaoguan to meet with generals such as Li Jishen and Yu Yingqian to discuss the military situation in Guangdong and Guangxi after the peaceful entry of the Japanese army into the French Guangzhou Bay Concession.

### Central Grain Storage Bureau to be Established Next Month

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - Since the National Government officially participated in the Greater East Asia War, in view of the importance of wartime food administration, a Ministry of Food was specially established during the reform of administrative institutions to take charge of this matter. Since its establishment, the ministry has made many plans for grain regulation, management, and increased production. In order to avoid confusion between food administration and food business, a unified management office for rice and grain procurement and sales was established, directly under the ministry, specializing in rice and grain procurement and sales. It is learned that the ministry will establish a Central Grain Storage Bureau to continue handling the above-mentioned rice and grain procurement and sales business, which has been approved by the Central Political Committee and is currently being actively prepared. It is expected to be formally established at the beginning of next month. All organizational systems and business scope of the bureau are also being meticulously determined by relevant agencies. After the establishment of the bureau, the original unified management office for rice and grain procurement and sales will be officially abolished.

### North China Iron Manufacturing Society Returns to Japan After Investigation

On the way back to Tokyo, he visited the Yawata Iron Works and held consultations with the director, hoping to cooperate with the operation of the North China Iron Manufacturing Company. Speaking of the recent situation of the North China Iron Manufacturing Company, he said that the Jingshan Iron Works, which was officially taken over by the company on the 1st, will transfer domestic equipment to the area and strive to expand it. In the future, it will also decide to revitalize the iron manufacturing industry based on this grand idea, and Yawata Iron Works is expected to cooperate.

### The Entirety of Soviet Fighting Power

— Written by Katsuji Fuse

Propaganda Minister of Germany, Joseph Goebbels, said to the world from Berlin on February 18th:

"The Soviet government's clever concealment led the German army to misjudge the Bolsheviks' fighting power. Now we finally understand the full extent of Soviet fighting power and the reasons for its vastness."

The Soviet Union is the most skilled at concealment and the most adept at counterintelligence. First, the Soviet Union implements a domestic passport system; second, the Soviet Union has a secret police organization; third, the Soviet Union is a so-called "closed country."

The domestic passport system had been implemented since the Tsarist era, and it was further strengthened during the Soviet era. People cannot live even for a day without a passport. The reason why the enemy's fifth column cannot enter the Soviet Union is primarily due to the existence of the domestic passport system.

The secret police are the vanguard of espionage abroad and an iron wall of espionage at home. Because the Soviet Union is "surrounded by capitalist countries," the secret police are tasked with closely guarding against all countries, peering at enemies both internal and external with sharp eyes.

Similarly, because the Soviet Union is "the only red country in a white world," it strictly adheres to an extreme policy of national isolation. Foreigners' entry into the country is severely restricted, and the secret police constantly follow the very few foreigners who are allowed to enter, preventing them from understanding the situation within the country. In this way, the Soviet Union has become a "closed country," which is extremely advantageous for counterintelligence. At the same time, we must remember that the Soviet Union is also the most skillful country in espionage.

Taking advantage of its convenient position for counterintelligence, the Soviet Union often conceals its true strength, causing enemy countries to overlook it. On the twenty-fourth anniversary of the revolution on November 7th of the year before last, a wartime military parade was held in the auxiliary capital of Kuibyshev. Marshal Voroshilov, the former People's Commissar of Defense and one of the Soviet leaders, inspected the parade. Diplomats and military attachés from various countries were very interested in this parade, but the troops inspected consisted of only three divisions, and most of them were foot soldiers. The types of weapons were very basic, and the ethnicity of the soldiers was mixed. After that, mechanized units came out, but all that was seen were mortars and machine guns towed by wire on supply wagons, small tanks used in the civil war, and old-fashioned field guns pulled by agricultural tractors. This was considered the mechanized unit, and it was actually displayed to the diplomatic corps in Lenin Square.

The Soviet Union has always held military parades twice a year (May 1st, Labor Day, and November 7th, the anniversary of the revolution), using this as an opportunity to boast about its military equipment to other countries. During the first few years of implementing the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union always presented all of its new weapons. Large formations of heavy bombers flew in the sky, and countless light and heavy tank units roared on the ground, flaunting their power in Red Square.

Why did the Soviet Union do this? In short, the Soviet Union could not avoid war in any way before the completion of the Five-Year Plan, so it deliberately exaggerated the Red Army's perfect equipment to prevent the great powers from daring to attack the Soviet Union rashly. However, the Kuibyshev military parade in November of the year before last was completely the opposite, deliberately displaying untrained reserves and old-fashioned artillery, so that people would think that the Soviet Union's reserves were trained in this unskilled way, and that the Soviet army's equipment was so crude. Therefore, the great winter counteroffensive was not worth mentioning... The Soviet Union used this clever method of concealment to intimidate Britain and the United States, implying that if they did not step up the supply of weapons and open a second front, the Red Army would be defeated by the German army. What a clever method of concealment!

In the second winter counteroffensive this time, the Soviet Union sent a huge reserve force to the front line, its strength far exceeding that of the Axis forces. Even the German authorities acknowledged this. Since the start of the war, the Red Army's losses have been extremely heavy, with deaths, injuries, and prisoners totaling millions. Therefore, the Red Army that appeared on the front line during the second winter counteroffensive was mostly a newly formed reserve force. But where was this vast new Soviet reserve army formed, and where did it come from?

When the Red Army's defeat in the first summer campaign of the year before last came to an end, Marshal Voroshilov, the commander of the Red Army's Northern Front, and Marshal Budyonny, the commander of the Southern Front, were suddenly transferred from the front line to the rear. At the time, many people thought that the two marshals had been relegated to the reserves because they were responsible for the defeat. However, the truth was that they were entrusted by Stalin with the important mission of "organizing and training a large-scale reserve force for the future winter counteroffensive" and retreated to the Ural Mountains.

Why did Stalin choose these two marshals to entrust with the preparation for the Red Army's comeback? There is a very interesting historical reason for this. In the early years of the October Revolution, the counter-revolutionary armies led by the three generals Kaledin in the east, Denikin in the south, and Yudenich in the west rose up all at once. In particular, Denikin's army advanced north with the force of a bamboo splitting, and its vanguard, the Mamontov cavalry corps, had already reached Kursk south of Moscow. In the autumn of 1919, in the midst of the Soviet government's decline, in order to reverse the situation, it attempted to organize a Red cavalry corps to counter Mamontov's cavalry corps. It specially promoted Voroshilov and Budyonny to take on this critical situation. The newly formed First Red Cavalry Army, with Voroshilov as the political commissar and Budyonny as the commander, launched a brave counteroffensive, routing all before it, and the Soviet government's crisis was resolved. From that time on, Voroshilov and Budyonny were known as "specialists in organizing reserve forces in defeat."

During the first summer offensive, the German army's fierce attacks were extremely rapid. In particular, the vanguard of the Central Army led by Marshal Bock had already approached the southwestern suburbs of Moscow. At this critical moment of survival, Stalin suddenly recalled the crisis of 1919, and at the same time thought of using Voroshilov and Budyonny to organize reserve forces in defeat.

Since the autumn of the year before last, in the Ural Mountains and the upper reaches of the Volga River, the Soviet Union has gathered nearly ten million strong men from all over the country. Under the guidance of Marshals Voroshilov and Budyonny, they have organized a reserve force and begun training, attempting to launch a major counteroffensive in the second winter war. Sure enough, when the second winter counteroffensive began on November 19th last year, Marshal Voroshilov reappeared on the front line. The first winter counteroffensive was a collaboration between Marshal Timoshenko and General Zhukov. This time, in the second winter counteroffensive, Timoshenko left the front line (reportedly dispatched to the United States), and the counteroffensive was commanded by Marshals Voroshilov and Zhukov. Zhukov exhausted his experience from the first winter counteroffensive, while Voroshilov used the reserve force he had organized and trained to launch the second great winter counteroffensive.

There is no confirmed report of Marshal Budyonny's comeback, but the cavalry corps he trained is now fighting in southern Soviet Union. The organization of the reserve force was unknown to the German side, as it was secretly trained and formed in the Ural Mountains over the past year.

The Ural Mountains and the upper reaches of the Volga River serve as the base for organizing the reserve force, as mentioned above. At the same time, this area is also the Red Army's arsenal, undertaking important tasks, so it is worth mentioning. The German-Soviet battlefield this winter is different from last winter. Both armies have deployed a considerable number of tanks, so the battle situation is extremely fierce. The climate this winter is higher than last winter, and considerable effort is being put into researching cold-resistant aircraft and cold-resistant tanks. However, the Soviet Union's aircraft and tanks have recovered their decline due to the replenishment from Britain and the United States. A large number of British- and American-made tanks appeared on the southern Soviet battlefield this winter, and it is also a fact that the Red Army's equipment is still mainly self-made.

In the first year of the German-Soviet war, the western half of Ukraine was captured by the Soviet Union, and the eastern half was lost in the second year. The entirety of Ukraine, the Soviet Union's largest industrial base, fell into German hands. This led to a sharp decline in its industrial productivity, so the replenishment of tanks and aircraft had to rely on aid from Britain and the United States. However, in this winter's counteroffensive, the Soviet Union gathered a surprising number of troops on the front line, and at the same time, self-made tanks and the latest weapons were continuously transported to the front line. This is because the industry of the already fallen Ukraine has been replaced by the leap in production in the Ural industry.

In the Ural industrial zone, at the beginning of last year, Stalin claimed that the manufacturing of weapons would "increase to two or even three times the previous year." At the beginning of this year, he firmly stated that it must "increase to twice the previous year." The Ural industry was already in a state of wartime mobilization, so its production efficiency naturally developed to the maximum extent. Sure enough, in the second and third years, there was a surprising increase in production as expected. So how could the Ural industry have such a surprising increase in production? Of course, such a large increase in production could not have been achieved solely by improving the original industrial capacity of the Ural. The production of the Ural industry was nothing more than the result of skillfully relocating the Ukrainian industry.

The Soviet government had long foreseen that once the German-Soviet war broke out, Ukraine would be a battlefield, and the industry in this area could not be relied upon. Therefore, when implementing the Five-Year Plan, it prepared to build a second industrial base in the Ural, which is the famous Ural-Kuznetsk Combine, formed by the combination of the rich iron ore resources in the Ural and the coal in Kuznetsk in central Siberia.

The central cities of the Ural industry are Sverdlovsk, Chelyabinsk, and Magnitogorsk. The factories built in these cities are large in scale. After the German-Soviet war broke out, when the German army approached Ukraine, the machinery from factories in Kharkiv, Stalingrad, and Voroshilovgrad had already been taken out and assembled in factories in various parts of the Ural. The Kremlin displayed an astonishing skill in the transfer of Ukrainian industry to the Ural. After the Ural received a lot of mechanical support from Ukraine, its productivity was bound to increase sharply. The "pledge of doubling production" for the Ural industry for the first time this year cannot be regarded as mere propaganda from the Soviet side.

### German Forces South of Kharkov Complete Encirclement of Soviet Forces; Soviet Offensive Shifts to Lake Ilmen; Soviet Landing Attempt at Taganrog Fails

Berlin, 6th (Daimai News Agency) - According to news received here last night, German forces launched a fierce counteroffensive on the southern Soviet front, defeating the elite of the Soviet forces and forcing the remnants and mobilized reserves to retreat across the Donets River. German bridgeheads have been established on the east bank of the river. Lisichansk, 50 kilometers northeast of Slavyansk, has fallen into German hands, and the 250-kilometer-long German lines along the river have been solidified in preparation for the next stage of the battle. However, a large Soviet force has gathered in the Kupyansk district and may launch a counteroffensive. At the same time, German forces south of Kharkov have completed their encirclement of the Soviet 3rd Tank Army. This Soviet unit attempted to break out on Thursday but was repulsed, and the encirclement has been tightened further. On the central front, the Soviet commander has shifted his offensive from the Kom Veliki Luki area to the Stellaye Rusa south of Lake Ilmen. Soviet forces in this area attacked between Veliki Luki and Kom on Wednesday without progress, and ceased operations in the area on Thursday, instead intensifying their pressure in the Stellaye Rusa area, attacking on both sides of the city, but were repulsed by German forces. The Soviets lost 24 tanks. Southwest of Rzhev and east of Gzhatsk, Soviet forces launched further attacks, but the fighting there was only of a local nature. Regarding the fighting there, German sources denied the Soviet claim that the railway between Vyazma and Smolensk had been cut. Southwest and northwest of Orel, and west and northwest of Kursk, Soviet forces continued to pressure German lines, attempting to break through the German defenses around Orel, but this offensive has collapsed and the Soviets have suffered heavy losses. Further south, German forces, after occupying Akhtyrka, 125 kilometers from Kharkov, are gradually advancing northwest of Kharkov. There has been only slight activity on the Mius River front north of Taganrog. In the Novorossiysk area of northwestern Caucasus, Soviet forces attempted to reinforce last night, with reinforcements approaching the coast by boat. German coastal artillery bombarded them, breaking up the Soviet reinforcement landing attempt. Downstream of the Kuban River, melting snow and ice is hindering Soviet operations. The Soviets in this area were only able to engage in small-scale operations on Thursday, which were unsuccessful.

### Soviet Reconnaissance toward Smolensk Thwarted by German Forces

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front news, due to the impassable mud of the southern front, there has been little fighting. The Soviets are instead taking advantage of the severe cold to launch offensives on the central and northern fronts. The fighting has been most intense in the Stellaye Rusa area south of Lake Ilmen, where the Soviets attempted to attack from the north and south, but after a German counterattack, the front has not changed. The German High Command announced on the 5th that German forces had shot down 25 Soviet aircraft in this area. It is reported that in the past 14 months, the Soviets have suffered 71,000 dead, 30,000 captured, and have lost 1,300 armored vehicles, 600 heavy artillery pieces, and 5,000 mortars. Judging from the current situation, the Soviet offensive in the Gzhatsk area is to reconnoiter Smolensk, but German forces have deployed reserves to stop the Soviet advance.

Soviet Border Region, (Havas) - Yesterday's Eastern Front situation was characterized by the continued advance of German counteroffensives in the Donets River basin and the frustration of fierce Soviet attacks north and northwest of Kursk. On the Donets River front, Moscow reports that although the Red Army's defenses were breached, they repulsed the Germans at night. Thawing and rain in the Kuban-Azov region continue to impede operations. On the central front, Soviet forces continue to attack, attempting to approach the outer defenses of the important German stronghold of Smolensk. Another Soviet force is attacking south of Rzhev, its destination appearing to be Vyazma, also an important German stronghold. German forces are strongly resisting on the Zhitrina River, but the Soviets claim to have crossed the river.

### German Preparations Have Been Strengthened; Offensive to Be Launched with Arrival of Summer

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities, regarding the Eastern Front situation, announced on the 5th that German counteroffensive preparations are currently being strengthened, and the situation will become stable. The German army will use this line as a base for a summer offensive on the Eastern Front. Heavy rain has been falling for days on the southern front, and the movement of Soviet mechanized units on the central front has been hindered by mud, giving the German army an opportunity to counterattack. The German army now has a considerable advantage on the southern front. Also, on the northern front, the temperature is -7 to -11 degrees Celsius, but the fighting on this front has come to an end. Therefore, from its current position, it is awaiting a spring offensive. At present, from northwest of Leningrad to Stellaye Rusa, west of Upper Rzhev, via Vyazma to west of Orel-Kursk, along west of Kharkov to Taganrog, the Soviet winter counteroffensive has come to an end. Future developments will depend on the German summer offensive.

### Soviets Appear to Be Shifting from Kursk toward Kiev

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front news, the German army has achieved great victories for days. The approximately 250-kilometer front from Izyum to Voroshilovgrad and the left bank of the Donets River is now entirely in German hands. Also, the Soviet 3rd Tank Army has recently been encircled by German forces in the Krasnograd region south of Kharkov. Therefore, the Soviet attempt to recapture Ukraine has completely failed. Also, according to German frontline news, German forces secured several river crossings on the Donets River on the 5th, and vanguard units have advanced to the right bank of the river, engaging in fierce fighting with Soviet forces. Currently, the Soviets are only counterattacking on the Mius River front and have abandoned their attempt to advance from the Donets Basin toward Ukraine, and appear to be advancing from Kharkov along Kursk toward Kiev. Also, German news agency frontline reports that Soviet forces are currently massing troops in the Kupyansk area, attempting to attack Rykov west of Kursk, and that large-scale mechanized battles are now underway in the area.

### New Finnish Cabinet Meets to Discuss Policy Guidelines; Prime Minister Authorizes Foreign Minister and Minister of Agriculture to Draft Solutions to Timber and Food Supply Problems

Helsinki, 6th (Haiphong News Agency) - The new Finnish Cabinet is scheduled to hold its first meeting today to discuss policy guidelines.

Helsinki, 6th (Haiphong News Agency) - Finnish Prime Minister Linkomies, immediately after the formation of the new Cabinet yesterday, instructed Foreign Minister Ramsay to study the timber supply problem and Minister of Agriculture Osara to study the food supply problem, ordering them to present solutions immediately.

Helsinki, 6th (Haiphong News Agency) - The Finnish Cabinet organized by Professor Linkomies was inaugurated yesterday. During the inauguration ceremony, the President's address was read, the previous Cabinet was dismissed, and the new Cabinet members took office simultaneously. The Cabinet members met President Ryti yesterday afternoon, and the President also gave a brief farewell address.

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from Helsinki, all members of the new Finnish Cabinet, led by Prime Minister Linkomies, held an inauguration ceremony at noon on the 5th, with President Ryti in attendance. The first Cabinet meeting will be held on the 6th to decide on the new Cabinet's program. At the same time, Parliament will be convened to clarify policy guidelines, refute past pro-Allied propaganda about a separate Finnish-Soviet peace, and false propaganda about German-Finnish relations, and clarify that there will be no change in foreign policy after the establishment of the new Cabinet. Also, according to dispatches from London, the Times published on the 5th, "After the establishment of the new Finnish Cabinet, the possibility of its separate peace has completely vanished."

### International Commentary on Establishment of Finnish Cabinet

Stockholm, 6th (Haiphong News Agency) - The "Svenska Dagbladet" stated that the newly established Finnish Cabinet can truly be described as a major compromise among the country's various political parties. The Swedish People's Party of Finland occupies two key positions, namely Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Interior. Of the 16 members of the new Finnish Cabinet, the Social Democratic Party accounts for five, the Agrarian Party for four, the Conservative Party for two, the Swedish People's Party for two, and the Liberal Party for one. There are also two seats occupied by non-partisans. Although the new Finnish Prime Minister Linkomies is young, he has long been one of Finland's important politicians, efficient and widely regarded by the people. The new Foreign Minister Ramsay is also deeply trusted by the Scandinavian countries, as is the new Minister of the Interior Elenius. Given the composition of the new Finnish Cabinet as described above, it is widely believed that Finnish policy will not change.

Budapest, 6th (Haiphong News Agency) - The "Pester Lloyd" stated that when Hungary and Finland jointly fought against the Soviet Union, both felt that they had fulfilled their responsibility to European civilization. Finnish policy will not change due to the change of Cabinet. The newspapers mentioned that the new Finnish Prime Minister recently visited Hungary.

### German Commissioner in the Netherlands Issues Statement; Expresses Optimism About the Future of the Netherlands

Berlin, 6th (Haiphong News Agency) - The German Administrative Commissioner for the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, issued a statement to the Haiphong News Agency, expressing his deep satisfaction with the loyal attitude of the Dutch people and his optimism about the future of the Netherlands. He stated that since the summer of 1940, the Dutch economy has undergone decisive changes, especially in agriculture. The number of pigs raised in the Netherlands has been greatly reduced due to the interruption of foreign feed sources, and grasslands have been converted into fields to plant feed. After the Dutch industry accepted large German orders, the phenomenon of unemployment has been eliminated. In order for the Netherlands to participate in the European total war, non-essential factories have been shut down. Regarding the political situation in the Netherlands, Seyss-Inquart continued, the number of opposition members in the Dutch people is not large, and the measures taken by the German occupation authorities have been greatly assisted by the people, such as the reorganization of the Dutch People's Service Corps and the expansion of the Dutch Labor Front, which are progressing smoothly. Seyss-Inquart then announced that the Mussert Party will participate in government affairs, stating that highly respected party members of the Netherlands and Germany will assume important positions in the administrative organs, and future Dutch new policies will be consulted with them first. Regarding the Dutch churches, Germany adheres to the principle of non-interference in religious affairs. As for the Jewish question, Jews in official organs have been gradually dismissed, and Jews in the economic and cultural circles have also begun to be excluded. Half of the Dutch Jews have been confined to labor camps. After the Netherlands lost the East Indies, some Dutch people have shifted their investment and work targets to the German-occupied areas of Eastern Europe. 600 Dutch volunteers fighting on the Eastern Front have died gloriously. Finally, he refuted rumors that the enemy propaganda organs claimed that Germany intends to relocate one-third of the Dutch people to the eastern provinces, stating that it is purely fabricated.

### Britain and the United States' Intense Open and Covert Struggle to Control Iran: American Advisors Spread Throughout Iranian Agencies, Iranian Financial Delegation Goes to the United States for Assistance

Vichy, 5th (Havas News Agency) - The clash of interests between Britain and the Soviet Union in Iran is a well-known fact. However, the conflict of interests between Britain and the United States has not yet received much attention. Britain's interests in Persia (present-day Iran) have a long history. As early as 1889, a Mr. Reuters of the United States obtained the right to establish the Bank of Persia. In 1901, a Mr. D'Arcy of Britain acquired the rights to exploit oil fields covering 500,000 square miles for only 5,000 pounds. This is the so-called Anglo-Persian Oil Company, with most of its shares owned by the British government. Since the end of the last World War, Britain has attempted to consolidate its position in Persia. However, the nationalist movement in the country, under the leadership of King Pahlavi, gradually expanded. Subsequently, in 1919, Persia announced the cancellation of unequal treaties, while also liaising with the Soviet Union for support and using the League of Nations as a shield. Recently, it has leaned towards the United States, seeking its assistance. In 1933, D'Arcy's oil concession was eventually ordered to be canceled by the Iranian government. Britain and Iran then concluded a new treaty stipulating that the British oil company could continue to exploit oil for 60 years. Since then, American capital has gradually penetrated the Persian Gulf. The American Gulf Company has obtained vast oil fields in the Kuwait region, and the California Arabian Oil Company has also obtained oil exploitation rights for 249,000 square miles in the Al-Hasa region of Arabia. Later, the United States also obtained oil rights in Bahrain, although managed by the Canadian Bahrain Oil Company, the capital is entirely owned by Americans. Subsequently, American influence extended into the British sphere of influence. In 1937, American oil merchants also concluded an oil exploitation agreement for eastern Iran with Iran. Looking at the recent actions of the American military in Iran, one can get a glimpse of the friction between British and American interests. For example, key strategic points such as Bandar Abbas and Bandar Shahpur are garrisoned by American troops, and American advisors are spread throughout Iranian agencies. The American government is now trying to control Iran's finances. It has already dispatched four advisors to supervise financial affairs and is further expanding the personnel of its consulates in Iran and Arabia. Recently, President Roosevelt presented a wireless radio and a magnificent car to King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, which, although not a major event, is quite thought-provoking.

Istanbul, 6th (Central News Agency) - Iranian domestic affairs have fallen into an extremely chaotic state due to the competition among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to expand their influence within the country, as well as the increasingly serious food panic. The Soheili cabinet, which was established less than a month ago, is also facing the crisis of dissolution. Britain is deeply embarrassed by the United States' active expansion of influence in Iran. Britain had used the pro-British faction in Iran to overthrow the previous Qavam cabinet and have Soheili succeed as prime minister. However, it is not something that can be achieved overnight to eliminate the American forces that have deeply penetrated Iranian domestic affairs. Therefore, Soheili cannot but follow the opinions of the American side. The United States is even pushing the Iranian parliament to criticize the harsh demands of the British and Soviet troops stationed in Iran. The British and Soviet ambassadors to Iran have lodged protests with the Iranian government, similar to threats, saying that if the Iranian parliament does not change this unstable attitude, they will resolutely deal with it with appropriate measures. Furthermore, the seriousness of the Iranian food panic has reached its peak. It is impossible to buy better food even on the black market. Residents have been forced to the brink of starvation. It is reported that in recent days, there have been incidents of rice looting in Iran.

Ankara, 6th (Haitong News Agency) - According to sources in Tehran, an Iranian financial delegation will go to the United States to request American financial assistance and preferential treatment.

Ankara, 6th (Haitong News Agency) - Tehran Radio announced that due to the opening of new oil wells, the output of oil mines in southern Iran in 1942 increased by 10% compared to 1941.

### Mayor of Rangoon Delivers Speech: City Gradually Reviving One Year After Capture

Rangoon, 6th (Central News Agency) - Today marks the one-year anniversary of the Japanese army's capture of Rangoon. Mayor U Laway made a speech stating: "When the Japanese army entered the city, the population of Rangoon was extremely small, probably less than 20,000. Although not many houses were burned down, most of the buildings in the commercial center were lost. At that time, Rangoon was in a state of desolation. Later, residents gradually returned. By mid-April, the city had 100,000 people. After that, the Japanese army cooperated in forming the Rangoon Public Security Maintenance Association. The Japanese authorities also provided a large amount of funding to restore essential urban services such as city markets, water supply, and automobile transportation. In June, an administrative committee was organized. The committee established civil and criminal trials and adopted a universal civil administration policy throughout Burma. In September, the Rangoon City System was announced, and the municipal government fully inherited the affairs of the Public Security Maintenance Association. In this way, Rangoon gradually revived. By the end of October, the population had increased to 400,000, and the lives of the citizens were almost back to normal. The organizations necessary for municipal administration and the general public have also been established. Since last December, the British and American air forces in India have repeatedly carried out inhumane blind bombings to hinder the revival of Rangoon. However, the Rangoon municipal administration and the administrative organization of the entire Burmese territory continue to operate. Because the Japanese government has declared the construction of the Burmese nation, there is no doubt that these activities will have an effect."

### The British Empire in Wartime Economic Distress (Part 1)

— Long Fei

(1) The Slow Pace of Military Production Increase

Britain's wartime economy has been implementing the Military Industry Control Law since 1936. However, it was only recently that the British government truly implemented a total mobilization posture. For example, in the initial stages of the war, the transformation of peaceful industries to military production was only subject to restrictions on the allocation of raw materials. The main focus was to encourage them to automatically shift from peaceful industries to military industries. Of course, this lenient measure was not in line with the needs of the war. Therefore, in 1941, it had to adopt an organizational policy, launching the coercive power of the state to transform non-essential and peacetime industries into military industries and implement a total mobilization of labor.

British Prime Minister Churchill once described the three stages of British wartime production, saying that the second year of the war was the stage of "very little," the third year was the stage of "a lot," and the fourth year was the stage of "doing whatever one wants."

However, since the start of the European war, Britain has already passed the fourth year of the war, and Britain has been reorganizing its military for five years. However, its production status has not yet reached the stage of "doing whatever one wants." It is still questionable whether the stage of "a lot" has been reached.

German Aviation Minister Göring's cry, "Guns are more important than butter," was in 1936. At that time, Britain had an absolute sense of superiority over Germany's "poverty."

It was precisely because Britain had this sense of superiority that the establishment of its wartime production mechanism was delayed in invisible ways. No matter how hard Britain tried later, the British wartime production system ultimately had an irremediable backwardness. Even with the combined efforts of Britain and its autonomous territories, it could not catch up with and surpass Germany's military production capacity.

Looking at aircraft, due to the backwardness of maintenance, the current first-line aircraft number only about 10,000. According to a recent American magazine, Germany's monthly production is 3,000 aircraft, while Britain's is only 2,400, which is only four-fifths of Germany's production. Of course, if the production of both Britain and the United States is combined, it may exceed the production of the Axis powers. However, as far as Britain alone is concerned, even American magazines say that it cannot catch up with Germany. Therefore, Britain's aircraft production is only about 80% of Germany's production.

As for shipbuilding, the British naval authorities have recently been lamenting the poor results of shipbuilding plans. Since the start of the war, British shipyards have been busy with the conversion of merchant ships, warships, and repairs, which has consumed half of the shipbuilding capacity, significantly hindering the planning of new ships. Britain recently adopted the American Liberty-type cargo ship and confirmed a construction plan for standard ships of 11,700 tons. From the laying of the keel to completion, the project is scheduled to take six months, which is much longer than the average of two months or so for the American Liberty ship construction process. The losses since the start of the war have been significant.

(Appendix 1) Number of Ships Lost by Britain Since the Start of the War

—Based on the British Admiralty's Announcement—, Britain mobilized all the shipbuilding workers and British Minister of Labor Bevin once said that in the past fifteen years, all the staff engaged in shipbuilding have been working hard to expand shipbuilding capacity. Therefore, it is not easy to demand a rapid increase in production under the bombing of the German air force. Before the war, Britain's shipbuilding capacity was about 300,000 to 400,000 tons per month, and recently it has been roughly 500,000 to 600,000 tons, which cannot fully meet the increasing needs.

(2) The Deepening of Labor Shortage

Generally speaking, Britain's fate is closely linked to ships. Britain's wartime economy is indeed in a very difficult state due to the increase in ship losses. However, what has a greater impact than the shortage of ships and what will become a dangerous signal for Britain's war of resistance economy is the serious problem of the deepening labor shortage.

Britain's labor shortage is not a recent problem. However, it has only recently developed to a deeply disturbing stage. This can be proven by looking at the speech made by British Minister of Labor Bevin in Liverpool on June 28, 1942. He said: "Britain has withdrawn a large amount of labor from industrial sectors other than military industries, and now it has to recruit young people and teenagers from military industries to be transferred to the battlefield. All industrial sectors must have the awareness of large-scale recruitment. In military industries, female employees will have to be used to make up for the shortage."

Since the outbreak of the Second European War, Britain has been doing its best to replenish and strengthen its military strength due to its defeats. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the battlefield has expanded to the East Asia region. For this new situation, Britain has to mobilize a large number of troops in West Asia and Egypt. It is naturally easy to imagine that Britain's source of labor is suffering from rapid pressure. However, the number of soldiers has been reduced due to defeats, resulting in a gradual increase in the threat from the Axis powers. Therefore, more troops have to be mobilized to make up for the losses. However, Britain's population is only 40 million, and the poor source of labor is naturally close to exhaustion. However, as Minister of Labor Bevin said, what is most noteworthy is the large-scale mobilization of laborers in military factories.

Shortly after his speech in Liverpool, Minister of Labor Bevin announced on July 8, 1942, that in order to make up for the domestic labor shortage, the age of recruiting women would be raised to 45 years old, and women born in 1900 would be conscripted starting on July 11. Bevin's declaration in the House of Commons on May 21 last year that Britain's labor shortage had reached a universal and profound stage further clarifies the extent of the labor shortage. He said that out of 33 million British nationals aged 14 to 55, more than 22 million had been mobilized in the military, civil defense, and military-related production sectors. The population engaged in military-related activities accounted for two-thirds of the total population, which can be said to be breaking the world record. Furthermore, according to the announcement made by Finance Minister Wood last May, the government has established a special committee to recruit employees from banks, exchanges, and insurance companies to seek the maximum degree of recruitment, which can also be seen from the side that Britain's labor shortage is deepening.

In order to concentrate labor in essential industries, there is a severe shortage of coal miners and workers in the cotton and wool industries. As a result, coal production has plummeted, and the cotton products necessary for military supplies are extremely insufficient. It is necessary to withdraw a considerable amount of labor from military industries to the coal and cotton industries. In this way, not only is the non-military industry severely oppressed, but also the boundaries that should adapt to military needs are broken, creating a great panic in labor and causing political and economic crises. The unreasonable use of women and child labor, as well as the extension of working hours, is unavoidable.

The mobilization of female labor is being implemented universally based on the decree of December 19, 1942. Currently, two-fifths of the employees in British aircraft factories are women, and 90% of the 30,000 employees in ammunition factories are also women. However, the age for conscripting women was under 25 years old in April 1941, expanded to 30 years old in March 1942, and further raised to 45 years old in July. Furthermore, according to the emergency decree of December 23, 1941, the government decided to permit the use of juvenile workers under the age of 15 and permitted the extension of weekly working hours to 52 hours. Needless to say, this shortage of labor will inevitably promote Britain's crisis.

The control of British industry and labor is carried out by the Ministry of War Production and the Ministry of Labor. Due to the mutual competition for priority among the departments related to military supplies, due to the solid political position of capitalists on the one hand, and the fact that trade unions still have the right to collective bargaining and hold the right to strike and also have a force that cannot be ignored, the contradiction of the old system of liberalism has not been cleared. As a result, Britain's industrial mobilization cannot be perfectly achieved. (To be continued)

### Most Fierce Battle Occurs in Eastern Cape Serrat: Part of British Troops Surrounded by Germans: Street Fighting in Mateur in Progress

Lisbon, 6th (Domei News Agency) According to a report from Berlin, the troops under German General Arnim attacked in northern Tunisia on Thursday and drove back the troops under General Anderson. They are currently fighting in Cape Serrat (about 70 kilometers west of Bizerte). A Reuters correspondent telegraphed from General Eisenhower's headquarters last night that the most fierce fighting took place along a line starting from the coast six miles east of Cape Serrat and heading south through Sedjenane. Sedjenane is about 20 kilometers south of the coast and 40 kilometers west of Mateur. After a part of the German army surrounded the British troops in the area, street fighting is now in progress. As for the situation to the south, the British claimed to have controlled about 15 kilometers of a highway northeast of Béja (about 100 kilometers west of Tunis). British artillery in the area bombarded the German army on the high ground northeast of Medjez el Bab (50 kilometers southwest of Tunis) yesterday. The German army attacked the city on Thursday, and an infantry ambush battle broke out in the suburbs. The Reuters dispatch also stated that the German army took the lead in the entire northern offensive with infantry, and used fewer tanks. As for central and southern Tunisia, no important battles were reported last night. At the same time, the German and Italian air forces continued to attack British troops and British ships.

Street fighting is currently underway. The German army's three consecutive assaults were repelled, and many German tanks were lost. In central Tunisia, the Anglo-American Allied Forces made no progress, only consolidating the recently captured positions. In the Gafsa area, the Anglo-American Allied Forces withdrew their right wing from Gafsa, which was occupied by the Axis forces, and entrusted the guarding to the French breakaway troops. It is reported that the breakaway troops are commanded by General Juin. The general headquarters' battle report today stated that two strongholds in the Kasserine area were captured. Nefta, on the western border of Chott el Jerid, is also in the hands of General Juin's troops. The air forces of both sides were extremely active in the skies over Tunisia today. German Stuka dive bombers bombed and strafed enemy stations, while British and American aircraft bombed Axis land convoys and Axis merchant ships between Sicily and Tunisia.

### Overview of Japanese Economic Advancement in Various Southern Regions: Aiding Local Financial Institutions for Independent and Healthy Development

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Southern regions were once the site of fierce battles, but they were quickly pacified by the Japanese army. In the year since, there has been rapid progress in the restoration of peace and order, and the revival of the economy, which is worthy of close attention. Speaking of the advancement of economic policies in the South, particularly in the areas of finance, there has been exceptionally smooth progress. To complete the Greater East Asia War, the financial policies of the South naturally aim to strengthen war capabilities and establish an independent financial system on the ground. Financial funds are raised locally, and their expenditure prioritizes the development of key enterprises to advance strategic points. In terms of finance, the organizational structure is independent from that of Japan, so each region, along with the military, actively works to establish financial organizations. As for the currency currently circulating in the South, a dual system is adopted, with military scrip and existing currencies circulating simultaneously and maintaining parity. This measure is being implemented very smoothly throughout the South. To prevent the original currency from being devalued against the military scrip, the current situation will continue to be maintained. This is crucial for stabilizing the currency. The current amount of currency in circulation is roughly the same as before the war, so there is no possibility of inflation. It is particularly noteworthy that there is no established exchange rate between the local currencies and the Japanese domestic currency or foreign currencies, nor is there any exchange between the local currencies. Therefore, trade between the South and Japan is carried out using funds from Japan's temporary military expenditures, and the Southern Development Bank implements this according to its financial system. This is the current situation of currency and trade in the South. Concrete studies are underway regarding future countermeasures. The major financial institutions in the Southern region are now managed by Japanese financial institutions. Enemy banks, which controlled all financial guidance in the South before the war, have now been completely replaced by Japanese financial institutions. As a result, these institutions are actively establishing branches and offices in various locations to meet current needs. The main financial institutions, such as the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Bank of Taiwan, and the Southern Development Bank, have established over eighty branches and offices in the South, three times the number before the war. In addition, non-enemy banks that were temporarily suspended during the war have now been restored. Larger ones include seven Chinese commercial banks and three Indian commercial banks in Malaya, one national bank in the Philippines, and the People's Bank and government pawnshops in Java. To meet the necessary needs, the complete restoration of Japanese finance is being pursued, while also aiming for its development. The People's Bank plays a particularly important role in the financial policies of the region. To stabilize people's livelihoods, promote agriculture, and eliminate high-interest finance of the past, these People's Banks are adopting measures such as implementing interest rate limits to benefit the general public, while also reducing interest rates on government pawnshops. All of these measures aim for the smooth operation of civilian finance in the military and administrative areas of the South. Therefore, military and administrative funds are invested in People's Banks, and these banks are actively established and strengthened, which is also a testament to the implementation of this policy. As for the Southern regions outside the military and administrative scope, such as Vietnam and Thailand, efforts are also being made to complete the cooperation system with Japan. Material exchange between Japan and Thailand is proceeding smoothly. Thailand declared war on England and America, causing its funds in England to be illegally frozen by the English. Japan loaned a large sum of money to increase its financial foundation. Since the establishment of the Central Bank of Thailand, it has been actively expanding its scope of activities in areas such as increased production and finance, thus enhancing its cooperation with Japan in food supply. Clearance between the two countries is done in yen, and Thailand is a part of the Greater East Asia financial sphere. Its future development is highly anticipated. The situation is similar in Vietnam. This year, due to the floods in Thailand last year, it is hoped that Vietnam can enhance its cooperation. Based on the Japan-Vietnam Economic Agreement, agreements have been quickly established between Japan and Vietnam, not only in terms of materials but also, to adapt to the situation after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the yen is used as the unit for bilateral settlement, to unify various payment systems. Thus, the Southern regions implementing military administration, as well as Thailand and Vietnam, can each stand in their position as part of the Greater East Asia material mobilization sphere and the Greater East Asia financial sphere, and devote their full efforts to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War.

### Admiral Nomura Visits the Philippines for Inspection

Manila, 6th (Domei News Agency) – It was disclosed today that Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Admiral Nomura, arrived here on March 2nd to observe the progress of the Philippine reconstruction efforts. Admiral Nomura has already inspected Corregidor Fortress and Cavite Port, which were the scenes of battles last year. This afternoon, he addressed Japanese military and administrative officials, and then met with reporters, explaining that the Japanese people have always supported the independence of the Philippines, even when the islands were under American rule. He went on to state that he went to the United States for negotiations to seek a peaceful solution to the Pacific problem, but it was unsuccessful due to the stubborn attitude of the United States. Ambassador Nomura concluded by saying that what impressed him most about the Philippines was the close and sincere cooperation that exists between the Japanese and the Filipinos, even though the Philippines had been involved in the war.

Fukuoka, 6th (Domei News Agency) – Former Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Nomura, recently returned here after a two-week inspection of Taiwan and the Philippines. He said that Philippine leaders are working hard to quickly restore their country, and the Philippines has now returned to the embrace of East Asia. The speed of its reconstruction is amazing. The current situation in Manila can accurately estimate the reconstruction of the Philippines. When he visited Corregidor, he saw that the island's defenses were convenient enough to hold 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers, which made him even more grateful to the Japanese army for capturing the island.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Solomon Islands

Riki Pen, 6th (Domei News Agency) – According to Washington, the US Navy Department announced yesterday that Japanese aircraft continued to bomb US military positions on Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands on the nights of March 3rd and 4th.

### Japan Approves Exchange Notices in Various Parts of Malaya

Zhaonan, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Zhaonan Military Administration Department announced today that in order to promote small-scale trade among residents of various parts of the South, it has now approved exchange transactions between Malaya, Sumatra, Burma, Java, and North Borneo, and has stipulated regulations for managing exchange transactions by military administration order on the 2nd of this month, which will be implemented from the 15th of this month. It is said that the regulations for managing exchange transactions were revised to prevent speculation, and all exchange transactions are subject to the permission of the military administration director. At the same time, these exchange transactions are concentrated in banks, and the surplus generated by these exchange transactions is centrally managed by the Malaya branch of the Southern Development Bank, that is, the Southern Development Bank acts as the central bank for exchange transactions, and is also a central agency for exchange transactions in the South, so that exchange and trade can be operated in a planned manner. In the past, various regions in the South could only conduct large-scale transactions based on temporary military expenditures, but now that exchange has been permitted, even civilians can carry out small-scale material exchanges, which is very convenient for local residents. It is expected that the exchange of materials between various parts of the South will become smoother in the future.

### Difficulties in Raising War Bonds in Chongqing

— Jin Yan

Excessive issuance cannot be absorbed, leading to a vicious cycle of inflation.

The amount of war bonds issued by the Chongqing regime in recent years is quite astonishing. As of July of the 31st year of the Republic, there were as many as twelve types of bonds issued, totaling over 1 million million yuan. At the beginning of the 31st year, the War Bonds Solicitation Committee was still soliciting for the 29th year's Construction Gold Bonds and Military Supplies Bonds. According to the committee's announcement of the amount raised in the 30th year, the total amount subscribed by provinces and cities domestically was 438,670,000+ yuan, and the amount reported received was 157,160,000+ yuan. Considering that the total amount of bonds issued in the 29th year reached 1.974 billion yuan, the amount subscribed by various regions accounts for only a little over one-fifth of the total issuance. If we further consider the amount reported received, it is less than one-tenth of the total issuance. The war bonds issued in previous years that were actually printed into bond certificates, sold to the public, and circulated in the market were only three types: National Salvation Bonds, National Defense Bonds, and Gold Bonds. Even for these three types of bonds, they either failed to circulate widely or were limited to only a few coastal areas. As a result, bond sales were limited, but the need for funds was urgent, and printing was difficult. Therefore, most of the bonds were given to the "Four Banks" in the form of "General Subscription Certificates" as collateral; then, the "Four Banks" lent money to the government and charged 7% interest. However, the financial resources of the banks were limited, and the large portion that they could not absorb (about 70% or more) was covered by issuing new banknotes to provide loans to the government. Therefore, after the issuance of bonds, due to the free purchase system, it was neither possible to truly achieve the "those with money contribute money" stage, nor was it possible to promote large-scale sales to absorb floating capital.

The wartime expenses were huge, and the issuance of more banknotes was an unavoidable way to raise funds. However, with the increased issuance of banknotes and the government's massive wartime spending, the purchasing power in society should also expand accordingly. Therefore, an important measure of wartime finance is how to curb this unavoidable expansion of purchasing power. This was the case in England and America after the war. However, the most effective strategy for curbing social purchasing power is the issuance of war bonds. But the issuance of war bonds under the above circumstances, due to the impact of the failure to absorb the bonds, not only does not help the overall premise of curbing purchasing power, but also, under the smoke screen of war bonds, it embarks on a vicious cycle of inflation. Chongqing's past bond policy fell into this misguided path. As a result, the burden was unfair, it was not sustainable in the long term, the method cannot be described as stable, and ultimately led to the excessive issuance of currency, the abundance of floating capital, high prices, the decline of productive enterprises, and drastic changes in the distribution of social income. This will be described in detail in the following sections:

(1) Excessive currency issuance: Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, silver is no longer in circulation, and all transactions are based on legal tender. At the time of the "July 7th" Incident, the amount of legal tender issued was only 1.44 billion+ yuan, which was perhaps insufficient for the vast territory and large population of China, and there had never been an excessive need for currency. After the outbreak of the war, wartime expenses were huge, and the financial needs of the government increased sharply. Moreover, the peacetime tax system was not sound, and the effect of increasing taxes to raise funds was not significant. Therefore, the convenient method was to resort to issuing bonds and banknotes. The issuance of banknotes exceeded the limit, which directly contributed to inflation, and the bond policy, due to the inability of society to absorb the bonds, failed to recover the newly issued banknotes, and instead became a disguised form of issuing new banknotes, further pushing the currency into inflation. As a result, exchange rates soared, prices soared, and all the signs of excessive currency issuance appeared in economic phenomena. However, the exact figures for the current amount of currency in circulation are unknown because the government has not announced them. Only Mr. Li Deyin's article "Currency, Materials, and Prices," published in the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao on May 7, made a rough estimate based on the records of 32 banks, and found that the currency circulation index in the 30th year of the Republic was about 12 times higher than before the war, that is, the currency circulation in the 30th year of the Republic was about 17.2 billion+ yuan.

(2) Abundance of floating capital: Since the currency has been massively increased, the purchasing power of society has expanded. Moreover, because war bonds have not been raised properly in the past five years, the increased banknotes have not been recovered, and social purchasing power has not been curbed. Therefore, the abundance of floating capital is an inevitable result. According to private estimates, this floating capital is estimated at over 50 billion yuan in national currency, which is truly alarming. However, the abundance of floating capital leads to rampant speculation, soaring prices, and also shakes foreign exchange, disrupts finance, and hinders production, which is extremely harmful.

(3) Soaring prices: As the currency is excessively issued, the value of the currency declines daily, and prices rise in inverse proportion. Although price increases are not entirely the result of currency depreciation, factors such as wartime transportation difficulties, material shortages, and rampant speculation also have a direct and indirect impact. However, the depreciation of the currency is the main factor. Except for the price of food in Sichuan and other places in the 27th year of the Republic, which once fell below the pre-war level, the prices of various goods in various parts of the country have risen, and the increase has been unprecedented. Kunming has the highest price increase, and Xining has the lowest price increase, but it is also several times higher than before the war. The average price of goods in other cities is about 30 to 40 times higher than before the war. The high increase in wartime prices cannot be ignored.

(4) Decline of productive enterprises: Due to the abundance of floating capital, the national financial system is in an unstable state. To preserve its vitality, floating capital is mostly kept in banks in a semi-fluid state, in the form of current or short-term deposits. Therefore, when floating capital gathers, it causes the financial market to have too much money, resulting in financial congestion; and when floating capital flees, it causes the financial market to suddenly decrease, resulting in anemia, illiquidity, and panic. Therefore, current banks do not dare to make relatively long-term productive investments. Moreover, due to the impact of the war, the "fear and panic" mentality of bankers is particularly strong, and it is not easy to find sufficiently satisfactory and reliable productive investment targets. Moreover, because commercial profits are particularly high, they all invest in commercial operations. Even if a small amount of industrial capital flows in, it is mostly used to hoard raw materials to engage in temporary commercial activities. Therefore, those who are truly engaged in the development of productive enterprises, except for a few state-owned institutions, are rare.

(5) Drastic changes in the distribution of social income: The value of the currency is falling day by day, prices have been rising for a long time, and the trend of hoarding and speculation is in full swing. As a result, the distribution of income among social classes before and after the war is vastly different. Even those who were rich before the war may have become poor, and those who were poor before the war may have become rich. It is a great pity that things have changed so much. Mr. Gu Chunfan's article "Estimates of Wartime Burden and Income Distribution," published in the Guilin Ta Kung Pao on November 2, describes this point in detail, roughly saying:

Because of the increase in prices, the income of a small part of the society (about 14%, referring to merchants, industrialists hoarding raw materials, and landlords) has greatly increased. Before the war, their income was 14% of the total social income, while now it is 40%.

The income of other people (about 86%, referring to the rich, middle peasants, poor peasants, tenant farmers, salaried workers, and others with fixed incomes), which was originally 86% of the total social income, has now been reduced to 60%.

This conclusion is based on conjecture and is bound to be criticized for being crude, but judging from the reality of today, it is roughly correct. As a result of rising prices, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened, the poor become poorer and the rich become richer. On the asphalt roads of the metropolis, it is common to see handsome young men with a girl in one arm and a gold dragon in the other, while those who are unclothed and unfed in the small streets and alleys are also numerous. This is a deformed and pathological phenomenon in the wartime economy, and if it continues, it will inevitably cause endless harm. (Sent January 10, 32nd year of the Republic)

### The Bureau of Public Works Decides to Adopt a Policy of Heavy Fines for Illegal Shops: The Heaviest Fine Has Been 150,000 Yuan; Stricter Penalties Will Be Implemented in the Future

The Information Office of the Bureau of Public Works announced that the Bureau, in accordance with the statement of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. Okazaki Katsuo (see the newspapers of February 19 for details), will continue to implement a policy of heavy fines for shops that violate the price control regulations. The table below shows the situation of heavier penalties recently imposed by the Bureau on shops that violate the regulations.

Penalty Rules for Violations

According to the Bureau's implementation of the price control regulations, any shop found to have violated, assisted in violating, or attempted to violate these regulations will be subject to one or more of the following penalties: (1) withholding or revoking the license; (2) ordering the shop to suspend business for a period of time; (3) refusing to grant various conveniences from the Bureau's controlled goods office; (4) confiscating goods equivalent in value to the stipulated amount of the fine.

No More Tolerance

The Bureau may, at its discretion, order the violating shop to pay a fine in lieu of the above penalties. Up to now, the Bureau has been very lenient in imposing penalties on shops that violate the regulations, but stricter penalties will be imposed in the future. It is hoped that merchants and residents will cooperate with the Bureau, abide by the regulations, and not test the law with their own bodies, which is of the utmost importance.

Residence Permit for the City Area

Application Deadline

Since the City Police Bureau was ordered to issue residence permits within the boundary on August 15 of last year, most of them have been issued. There are still some people who are in the process of applying. It has been ordered that all police stations must complete the application procedures by the end of this month. The police sub-bureaus, because of the larger scope, must collect the applications from each police station and submit them to the household registration section of the main bureau for review. Therefore, the deadline is the end of June of this year. It has been notified to all police sub-bureaus to instruct each police station to follow the instructions. Residents of the city area must also go to their respective police sub-bureaus or police stations to complete the application procedures within the above-mentioned deadline. Applications will not be accepted after the deadline.

The Opinion of the Authorities

Mr. Okazaki Katsuo, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bureau of Public Works, regarding the issue of suppressing the rising prices, said that in order to suppress the soaring prices, it is necessary to explore the reasons and consider the aspects of goods and currency. However, the self-restraint of merchants and the cooperation of the people with the authorities are crucial to solving this problem. For the above reasons, the authorities are still cautious about implementing repressive control measures, hoping that merchants can self-regulate and self-examine themselves. Unexpectedly, the authorities' tolerant attitude has given unscrupulous merchants and those who dare to violate the regulations an opportunity to illegally profit, which is regrettable. The number of such unscrupulous merchants is increasing, so the authorities have no choice but to implement strict penalties for those who violate the regulations.

### Establishment of the Industrial and Commercial Investigation Institute: Initiated by the United Association of Chinese Factories; Various Investigation Works Will Be Carried Out Soon

The Shanghai United Association of Chinese Factories has been established for more than ten years since its establishment in the 16th year of the Republic. In peacetime, it has paid great attention to the investigation and statistics of industrial and commercial enterprises. Recently, in view of the fact that the industrial and commercial industries have undergone many changes since the war in the 26th year of the Republic,

A Non-Negligible Number of Emerging Enterprises

In recent years, the image of revival has gradually appeared in various places, and new industrial and commercial enterprises have also emerged. Therefore, it was discussed with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to jointly form the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Investigation Institute. The proposal was approved by the Standing Council of the City Chamber of Commerce and ordered to be implemented. Standing Director Jiang Shangda was appointed as the secretary, Wu Huanru as the chief secretary, and Huang Baokang as a committee member. The United Association nominated Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, and Li Zufan as committee members. The six committee members then jointly elected Tian Heqing as a committee member and director of the institute. The institute has four groups: general affairs, compilation, investigation, and statistics. The investigators are concurrently served by the directors of the investigation department of the City Chamber of Commerce. The institute is located within the City Chamber of Commerce.

Hoping That All Circles Will Provide Convenience

On the morning of the 5th, a meeting of all staff members was convened in the auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce to discuss the implementation methods. Committee Member Wu chaired the meeting and first reported on the history of the organization and establishment of the institute, and explained the importance of investigation and statistical work. Finally, he encouraged all committee members to work hard and persevere to achieve success. Director Tian also delivered a speech, detailing the history of the United Association of Chinese Factories in conducting investigation and statistics. He encouraged all members to have the ambition to succeed, not to be afraid of hard work or difficulties, and to be humble and treat others with respect, so that the predetermined purpose can be achieved. Finally, Committee Member Huang Baokang delivered a speech, reporting on the difficulties encountered in handling the investigation work of the City Chamber of Commerce in the past year, hoping that all members will overcome difficulties and work hard under the guidance of Director Tian. Afterwards, the members expressed their opinions separately and decided to set off separately for investigation starting from the 8th, hoping that all circles will provide assistance and convenience.

### Preliminary Meeting for the Return of Concessions: Minister Tajiri Attended; The Meeting Has Ended and He Has Returned to Shanghai

According to a report in the Japanese-language Continental News in this city by Domei News Agency, Minister Tajiri of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office attended the preliminary meeting for the return of Japanese concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, which began in Nanjing on March 1 and lasted for three days. The meeting ended on Thursday, and he has returned to Shanghai to resume his duties.

### Students in the Chengdu Area Assist in Maintaining Traffic Again: It Will Be Stopped When the Exercise Is Satisfactory

The Baojia Department of the Chengdu Area Police Department, in order to promote students' traffic morals and ideological hygiene, began to select students from various schools to perform social services last week, and the results were excellent. However, there are a total of 80 primary and secondary schools in the Chengdu area. Each school sends one senior student and five intermediate students, for a total of six students, totaling more than 400 students. Because it was the beginning of the trial last time, only more than 150 students were sent to the department and assigned to various roads to serve. Therefore, the department has notified the school authorities that when it is held again tomorrow (7th), the number of students must be sent in full in accordance with the regulations, and it is scheduled to arrive at the police department at 8:45 am for assembly, and then be assigned to various roads to perform services until the task is completed at 10:45 am and the team is disbanded. This exercise is scheduled to be held once every Sunday. The exercise will be stopped when the results are satisfactory. This kind of movement is extremely necessary to correct the bad habits of passers-by.

### The Fourteenth Class Graduation Ceremony at the Police Instruction Center: Director Lu Yingxun's Speech - Pay Attention to the Suffering of the People

Over 150 student police officers of the 14th class of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department and Police Instruction Center held a grand graduation ceremony at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 6th) in the auditorium of the center in Yangjiazhai, Pudong. Mayor Chen and Minister of Interior Chen Qun, as well as military advisor Kubawa of a friendly nation, sent representatives to attend. Police Director Lu Ying, Secretary Su Qiutan, Detective Captain Guo Shaoyi, and Pudong Police Chief Gao Yazhai arrived on time. The head of the friendly nation's agency in Pudong, Hattori, and police officials Nishimura and Otake, as well as instructor Sato, also attended. The director of the center, Tao Zhihong, personally greeted them. After a short rest, an inspection ceremony was held at the center's large parade ground, featuring drills in formations, combat drills, Chinese martial arts, bayonet drills, kendo, group drills, and unarmed exercises. The police officers were spirited and moved in orderly steps. After the inspection, the heads of various agencies, guests, and graduating student police officers gathered in the auditorium for the graduation ceremony. The ceremony was conducted with due solemnity. The center's director Tao Zhihong reported on the training process. The representative of the Ministry of Interior presented awards to the top three graduating student police officers. Director Lu presented graduation certificates and awards. Subsequently, representatives from the Ministry of Interior, the Municipal Government, and military advisors from friendly nations, as well as Director Lu and Director Tao, delivered speeches, offering much encouragement. Finally, the student police representative gave a speech, followed by singing the Chinese Police Song. After the ceremony, Director Lu's speech stated, "Today is the graduation ceremony of the 14th class of student police officers at our police instruction center. I am honored to have you all, distinguished officials, here to give us your instructions, and guests from all walks of life to participate. After you graduate, you will be assigned to serve in various places. Now that various places are undergoing reconstruction, there is a great need for the cooperation of the police. We, as police officers, are responsible for maintaining local order and protecting the people. However, we should not just offer empty words, but we need to put that into practice. Today, taking the opportunity of meeting you all, I will briefly say a few words. Now, prices of everything are high, and the cost of living is increasing daily, and the suffering of the people has deepened. Since we bear the responsibility of protecting the people, even if we cannot alleviate the suffering of the people, we must not increase the suffering of the people. This is what I have been constantly mindful of and used to encourage myself for the past five years. You are graduating today and will soon leave this place. I want to bring this up as parting words, hoping you will keep them in mind."

The Jiaxing Branch of the Bank of China: Relocating to Resume Operations Mid-Month

The Jiaxing branch of the Bank of China, which had temporarily moved to Shanghai to conduct business since the incident, has now moved back to Jiaxing from Shanghai and is scheduled to resume operations on March 15 at No. 92 Tangwan Street outside the North Gate. The branch completed the procedures for closing collections and payments in Shanghai yesterday (the 6th).

### The Future "Shanghai Construction Plan" Needs a Fundamental Change: Interview with Director of the Construction Department, Mai Jingming

Mr. Mai Jingming, the Director of the Urban Construction Department of the Ministry of Construction, has been in Shanghai for several days to inspect the post-war reconstruction. Now that his official duties are completed, he is scheduled to leave Shanghai today and go to Hangzhou to continue his investigation. Our reporter visited Director Mai at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Construction and was honored to hear his impressions of this trip as follows:

Since the National Government joined the war, it has been striving to promote the increase of production related to war effort and the development of production industries. However, it also attaches equal importance to urban construction. Construction is a vast and complex undertaking. To achieve the economic development of the country, the improvement of people's thinking, the raising of cultural standards, the realization of mass welfare, the cultivation of national strength, and the accomplishment of the war effort, we must strive for urban construction. Therefore, after the government joined the war, it established the Ministry of Construction under the Executive Yuan, and a department was specially set up to manage urban construction. I am responsible for this department, and I am aware of my limited ability and fear that I am not up to the task. I hope that all sectors will provide more guidance to correct my shortcomings.

Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou have been carefully managed by the previous authorities over the years, achieving remarkable results. However, after the incident, many major cities were destroyed by the war. Since the return of the National Government, efforts have been made to restore and rebuild these cities, but due to limitations of time, manpower, and resources, the construction work has not yet reached the expected goals. This time, I was ordered to inspect the major cities and arrived in Shanghai on the first day of this month. In addition to visiting Mayor Chen and relevant authorities, I also inspected various public works. The results were very satisfactory. Although I dare not say that there are any great revival plans, at the very least, (1) it can be used to understand the extent of destruction in various cities after the incident and the degree of restoration that has been done, laying the groundwork for further improvements in the future; (2) it can be used to inquire about the difficulties encountered in the construction of various cities in the past, so that the central and provincial governments can work together to eliminate these obstacles to complete the mission of urban construction.

I have been in Shanghai for several days, and various public works have been inspected in detail. In this special wartime environment, it is still possible to continuously improve and develop, surpassing even the pre-incident times. I deeply admire the efforts of the various authorities. As for the so-called "Greater Shanghai Construction Plan" that existed in Shanghai before the incident, it was planned to develop the current Xanshi Street area, to rival the concessions and gradually shift the prosperity of the Shanghai concessions to that area. Later, due to the Sino-Japanese incident, this plan was interrupted. After the incident, Hengchan Company had a revival plan, with a six-year period and an investment of 100 to 200 million yuan, to transform Shanghai into an ideal great city for China and Japan. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this plan changed with the needs of the times. Now, the concession area will be returned due to various countries' respect for our country's sovereignty. Therefore, the future direction and plan for Shanghai's construction must be fundamentally changed. I will formulate my own opinions based on my inspection and report them to the authorities for reference.

### The Jianghai Customs Sets Up a Post in Wuhu and Establishes a Transshipment Tax Collection Office

Tanigawa Katsuo, the Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, has now set up a transshipment tax collection office in Wuhu and established five branch posts at the Wuhu Railway Station, Jiang'an, Dajiangkou, Changhe, and the Parcel Post Office. The collection is officially in operation. All merchants should be aware of this.

### Jing'an Temple Promotes Buddhist Culture: Lecture on "Master Xuanzang" Today

The ancient Jing'an Temple in our city was built in the Three Kingdoms period of the Eastern Wu Dynasty, with a history of 1500 to 1600 years. Since the abbot, Dharma Master Mijia, took charge last year, he has been determined to rectify the temple affairs and further promote social and cultural education. To understand the Buddhist dynamics and future direction in our city, our reporter visited Dharma Master Mijia at the temple. The Dharma Master expressed his views as follows: Buddhism has been introduced to our country from Tibet since the Eastern Han Dynasty, with a history of two thousand years. Throughout the dynasties, there have been eminent monks who have taught or translated scriptures. Therefore, Buddhism has greatly helped and promoted our country's culture and art. At a time when culture is declining, it is necessary to promote Buddhist culture. Since July last year, our temple has established Buddhist Sunday lectures, inviting eminent monks to serve as lecturers every week. In addition to expounding the essence of Buddhism, the lectures also cover philosophy of life, hygiene, and art. Occasionally, social experts are invited to serve as lecturers. Therefore, although the name is Buddhist lectures, they are actually academic lectures. Since the establishment until today, there have been thirty sessions, and each lecturer is a well-learned scholar. The purpose of establishing the lectures is to integrate Buddhism with society. Recently, our temple asked the Shen Bao Scholarship Committee to select four university students majoring in philosophy, and our temple is responsible for their tuition and miscellaneous fees, which is nothing more than a small contribution to society. The establishment of Jing'an Elementary School and the Japanese Language Institute by our temple is also a contribution to education.

It is also reported that today is the thirtieth session of the Buddhist Sunday lectures, and the abbot of the Jade Buddha Temple, Dharma Master Zhenye, will be the lecturer. The topic is "Master Xuanzang." He will give a detailed exposition on the contributions and influence of Master Xuanzang on Buddhism. All sectors are welcome to attend. The time is from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM.

### Police Authorities Coordinate to Expel Unemployed Hooligans; Those Confirmed to Be Extorting Will Absolutely Not Be Allowed to Stay Within the Boundary

The police authorities of the two concessions, the Municipal Police Department, and the Huxi Police Bureau, in addition to making every effort to assist in cracking down on hoarders and profiteers and eliminating unscrupulous merchants in the black market, in order to protect the business of legitimate factories and shops, the lives and property of good people, and to strictly coordinate to prevent unscrupulous elements, dispatched a large number of detectives to the main streets and thoroughfares within their jurisdiction day and night, to search pedestrians and organize patrol teams (including plainclothes detectives) to go to hotels and other public places in the morning and evening to conduct inspections. Anyone who is suspicious will be arrested and interrogated. If it is confirmed that they are unemployed hooligans who live by extortion (based on household registration investigations), they will be immediately deported and absolutely not allowed to stay within the boundary, in order to eliminate unscrupulous elements and maintain the peaceful and prosperous lives of legitimate merchants. At the same time, gatherings and parades are prohibited, unless permitted by the authorities.

### March 8th Women's Day: Women's Organizations Hold Commemorations

Tomorrow is March 8th, Women's Day. The Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association and the Women's Welfare Association will hold gatherings to commemorate the day. The Women's Association will hold a conference at 10:00 AM on that day at the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce near the Tianhou Temple Bridge, and will also hold a paper flower charity sale. The proceeds will be used for the benefit of orphans and children in distress. The Women's Welfare Association will hold a Sino-Japanese Women's Symposium at Dake Building at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to discuss the responsibilities that women should bear in the Greater East Asia Holy War.

### Various Shipping Companies Plan to Adjust Transportation Fees

The Shanghai China Shipping Company and other shipping companies plan to readjust the transportation fees for passengers and goods. However, the new adjusted transportation fees must be submitted to the authorities for approval before they can be implemented. It is heard that the impact of the adjusted transportation fees on passengers and merchants is insignificant.

### French Concession February Criminal Case Report: Russian Police Shoot and Kill a Murderer; Bicycle Kills One Person

In February, there were no cases of murder, kidnapping, or robbery. On April 12, 1939, a Chinese policeman on duty on Avenue Foch was shot in the right thigh while resisting a gun robbery and died of his injuries. The police department has not given up the investigation. On February 19 of this year, one of the murderers in the case was apprehended.

On February 2, on the border of the Nanshi area, a Chinese man was cutting Nanshi police officers with a knife. A nearby Russian officer ordered him to stop. The Chinese man ran away. The Russian police officer, seeing the situation, shot him in the heart and died of his injuries.

In February, there were a total of 79 special theft cases, including 24 cases of burglary over walls, 40 cases of break-ins, and 15 cases of snatch theft. 21 cases were solved, and 14 thieves were arrested, recovering stolen goods worth 3,827 yuan. As for simple theft cases, there were 312 cases (413 in the previous month), of which 105 cases were solved, and 134 thieves were arrested, recovering stolen goods worth 11,3110 yuan.

There were 56 bicycle theft cases (71 in January), and 13 criminals were arrested, recovering 13 bicycles.

There was only one case of a vehicle causing serious injury and death this month. The deceased was a Chinese passerby who was hit by a bicycle and died of his injuries. As for public and entertainment venues, the police department continues to search, question, and verify ID cards as usual. In February, the household registration office attached to each police department issued 18,179 ID cards, registered 13,167 departures, 10,879 arrivals, 1,506 births, and 601 deaths.

Mr. Matsumura, an investigator at the Embassy Office, has been transferred to Nanjing.

### The Central District Joint Security Cancels the Self-Defense Night Patrol

### The Sino-Japanese Calligraphy Exhibition Will End Today

The Sino-Japanese Calligraphy Exhibition organized by the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association opened on the fourth floor gallery of the Great World Department Store on the 5th of this month for a period of three days and will end today. Among the exhibits are the formal script edict by Japanese Sugihara Yuzaburo and the cursive script by Zuiun Seisen, as well as the seal script by Chinese Ma Gongyu and Weng Lian, all of which are excellent works. All sectors are welcome to visit for free.

### The Exchange of Materials Between Shanghai and the Mainland Can Proceed Unhindered After the Establishment of the New Unified Control Agency

During the meeting of the Supreme National Defense Conference on the 5th, Minister of Industry Mei submitted an important proposal regarding the unified control of major materials and the stabilization of prices. The proposal was unanimously approved. The purpose of the proposal is to reorganize the purchase and distribution agencies that have lacked control in the past, establish a unified agency, and organize a central business and industry control group to implement autonomous control. At the same time, various restrictions that have hindered smooth distribution will be eased or abolished. Therefore, it can be said to be a landmark measure. The National Government's new economic policy is not to restore a free economy from a controlled economy, but to supplement the deficiencies of the various control agencies in the past and establish a reasonable and unified agency to promote smooth material procurement and distribution and price stability. Since the exchange of materials between Shanghai and the mainland or peaceful areas has been subject to various restrictions, prices in various places have been quite uneven. If various restrictions hindering reasonable distribution are abolished in accordance with this proposal, prices in various places will be able to maintain equilibrium. It is expected that after the establishment of the procurement and distribution agency, various controls implemented by various government offices will be transferred to the new agency to implement autonomous control. From this, we can see the importance of the new control agency's task. The new control agency must be participated by Chinese and Japanese merchants on an equal footing, supporting each other to facilitate the progress of procurement and distribution.

### Cracking Down on Superstitious Businesses: The Municipal Area Actively Unfolds Investigative Work; The Second Special District Simultaneously Starts Reporting

Since the Preparatory Office for Donations on Superstitious Business Items of the Shanghai Special Municipal Finance Bureau adopted the passive total donation crackdown method for various superstitious businesses in the city, it has actively unfolded the investigation of the categories and amounts of superstitious businesses and items in various districts of the city. Previously, the Nanshi area was divided into ten districts according to the jurisdiction of the Municipal Police Bureau's various branches, and the investigation began on the 2nd of this month. One person was dispatched to each district to conduct investigations on the categories and amounts of various superstitious businesses in the designated areas. Yesterday (the 6th), the investigation was completed. It is estimated that there are more than 600 superstitious businesses and retailers of superstitious items in the entire district, most of which are incense paper shops that incidentally sell superstitious items. The office is now urging them to go through registration procedures. It is also reported that the office re-divided the Huxi area into four sections yesterday (the 6th): (1) Xujiahui to Hongqiao Road as the boundary; (2) Hongqiao Road to Daxilu; (3) Daxilu to Suzhou River; (4) Westward to the railway as the boundary, and started the investigation. The Second Special District was divided into eight sections and started the investigation work simultaneously. It is understood that the office will issue a public notice within days, limiting the time for superstitious business groups or stores selling superstitious business items in each district to go through registration procedures, otherwise they will be subject to a ban on operations.

### Difficulties for Technical Personnel

— Chen Xingguo

Finding a job is a difficult task nowadays, but it is even more difficult to integrate labor and capital, especially in this year. Even if one has a skill, it is difficult to find a position. However, because the salary is too low, the income is not enough to cover the expenses, resulting in a tight budget and an unstable life.

According to the employment record of the industrial and social affairs department of the municipal authority in February of this year, factories requested a total of one hundred technical personnel from the department. Among the registered unemployed technical personnel, after careful consideration by the department, only ninety people were deemed eligible for introduction. This situation of demand exceeding supply is sufficient to prove that finding a job is not an extremely difficult thing: among the ninety people introduced, only ten were hired by the factories after the interview. From this, it can be seen that the so-called difficulty in finding a job for ordinary people is because they do not have valuable skills.

Among the unemployed technical personnel registered with the municipal authority, there is a mechanical technician named Zhang who was called five times by the bureau to introduce him to a job, but each time he refused to take the job. He said that rather than working for others for three or four hundred yuan a month (without room and board), he would rather sell fresh fish himself, which would earn him twenty or thirty yuan a day. According to the statistics of the employment department, there are as many as four out of ten people who are unwilling to take a job like Zhang. This phenomenon, rather than pitying them for not using what they have learned, is detrimental to social production, and the loss is not difficult to imagine.

The poor skills of the labor force and the meager treatment of the capital side have caused great damage to industry. Both sides are difficult to shirk their responsibilities and need to be improved urgently. The former needs to strive for perfection, and the latter should try to cultivate talents as much as possible. According to the current situation, the latter needs to reconsider, and should investigate the living conditions of workers at any time and improve the treatment, so that the labor force can work with peace of mind, and its products can naturally tend to be excellent, and the production efficiency can also be increased accordingly. If life can be stabilized, then the prosperity of society is in sight.

### Collection Office Collection and Deposit of Tax Revenue: All Amounts Should Be Transferred to the Treasury.

The Municipal Finance Bureau, in order to effectively rectify tax revenue in the urban area, noted that while the collection offices in each district have been consistently diligent in collecting taxes and enriching the public treasury, they have not been equally prompt in transferring collected tax revenues to the treasury. This is highly inappropriate. Yesterday, special orders were issued to each collection office, stating that henceforth, all tax revenues collected and deposited must be transferred to the treasury immediately and within a limited time, without any delay. Since the source of gasoline for this city was cut off, most automobiles have ceased operation. Although some use charcoal as a substitute, it is very inconvenient. It is now learned that the relevant authorities are manufacturing compressed gas to supply to thirty automobiles of the Public Works Bureau for trial use. According to the installation of this alternative fuel, it is simpler than charcoal and also cheaper. It is expected that demand will increase sharply.

Public Works Bureau Employment Agency: Seeking Technical Personnel on Behalf of Others

The Public Works Bureau's Industrial and Social Affairs Department Employment Agency is now commissioned by external parties to recruit the following technical personnel: (1) Japanese typists; (2) Typesetters and proofreaders (must be able to typeset in Japanese); (3) Lathe operators, fitters, and other mechanical technicians; (4) Sewing workers; (5) Mechanical draftsmen; (6) Electric motor manufacturers and repairers; (7) Electric meter repairers. Unemployed technical personnel seeking employment, as well as factories seeking talent, are requested to register at Room 362, 4th Floor, Public Works Bureau Building, 180 Fuzhou Road. Job seekers must also submit two 2.5-inch headshots. Registration hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM daily, except Saturday afternoons and Sundays when the office is closed. All registrations are free of charge.

The Qing Fen Hui Cadre Training Institute: Results of the Blockade Class Announced

While the Zuo Zhi (support governance), Zheng Gong (political work), and Bao Jia (neighborhood security) classes have already begun training, the Blockade Class was delayed due to the large number of applicants and the need for thorough screening. It is now learned that the association has announced the list of successful candidates for the class, which is scheduled to officially begin training in mid-month.

Yesterday, this newspaper's broadcasting time was 7:45 PM.

### Special Edition on the Nanyang Region, Part 5: A Record of Changes in the East Indies (7) By Qiao Song

After appointing governors and establishing local administrative structures, the Japanese military administration also appointed mayors for all eighteen cities in Java. During the Dutch era, sixteen of the eighteen mayors were Dutch, with only two being native. Under the Japanese, apart from the mayors of Batavia, Surabaya, and Semarang being Japanese, the remaining fifteen mayors were appointed from among the native population.

A central administrative structure has also been established, divided into seven departments and five external bureaus, with the primary emphasis on promoting construction. Special efforts are being made to strengthen the police force. A police academy was opened in June last year to train police officers.

Sumatra has been assigned to the Malayan side, and Celebes has been placed under a separate system. These details will not be repeated here.

In terms of finance, offices have been established for managing national treasury funds, tax-related matters, and monopoly enterprises, to ensure fiscal revenue and strive for balanced income and expenditure. Due to the extensive war damage to industry, the military administration is also preparing to provide loans to facilitate recovery. Regarding currency, both the guilder and military scrip remain in circulation. Since June last year, the Bank of Japan, Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Mitsui Bank, and China South Sea Bank have commenced operations. The Southern Development Gold Mine also began operations in Java on July 1st, expanding the financial network. The Yokohama Specie Bank further established twenty "branch offices" in Java starting from October 20th. The liquidation of enemy banks began in the latter half of October last year. In terms of commodity prices, the policy of reducing prices is being maintained, and orders have been issued to maintain the prices as of January 1, 1942. Despite this, prices still tended to rise, and the military administration promulgated the Price Control Law on October 1st, imposing severe penalties on those who violated the law. Some Arabs and overseas Chinese were subjected to business suspension and property management penalties.

In terms of justice, the military administration promulgated the Military Administration Trial Regulations on April 29th, restoring local courts and other judicial organs. To respect religion, the Islamic High Court and the Monks' Court were also restored. Initially, the inherent status of native judicial officials was recognized. Later, Japanese judicial officials came to Java one after another, establishing a policy of Japanese guidance, reorganizing military administration courts, and establishing a new supreme court. At the same time, military administration courts were given strong jurisdiction over economic crimes, strengthening the economic control of the new Java.

In terms of industry, the Japanese military administration first established a policy of food self-sufficiency, focusing on ensuring supplies to various parts of the south. They worked hard to increase food production in the agriculture of the native population and strived to purchase and stockpile, so that the needs of the local Japanese army could be met locally, and Java would become a food storage for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. They also prevented the unemployment of agricultural laborers in various farms and maintained the prices of surplus products. The Military Administration's Industry Department specifically established the "Important Food Management Office" for food crops and the "Agricultural Enterprise Cultivation Management Corporation" for collective agriculture, implementing control. As early as the Japanese occupation, minimum prices were set for rice, and purchases were made. However, due to economic chaos and inconvenient transportation at the beginning, the situation was not good. The authorities mobilized financial institutions such as the Bank of Taiwan to provide loans to rice mills to promote purchases. In early August, the "Important Food Management Office" was established to maintain prices and ensure food self-sufficiency, engaging in the purchase and storage of rice, soybeans, cassava roots, and so on. For large-scale industries such as rubber, quinine, tea, and coffee, the military administration issued control orders, guided production, and maintained prices, handled by the "Agricultural Enterprise Cultivation Management Corporation." The corporation also established branches in Surabaya, Semarang, and other places, gradually expanding its scope of activities. Regarding sugar, for example, it used to be the highest-value agricultural export, but domestic demand was not high. However, the military administration did not restrict its production, and most of the eighty-plus sugar factories have already opened for business.

In terms of transportation, it was quite chaotic at the beginning due to the planned destruction by the Dutch East Indies army, but it has gradually recovered. For example, the entire 4,800 kilometers of railways were completely restored within seven months of the occupation. In addition to the express trains between Batavia and Surabaya, coastal line connections have also been completed by the "Land Transportation Bureau." Roads are also gradually being repaired, and bus routes have increased. At the same time, the use of trucks and handcarts has also promoted the exchange of goods between local areas. On the other hand, the military administration has focused on restoring coastal shipping routes, building and operating small ships, and registering and using civilian ships, which has made it possible to solve the transportation problems more smoothly. Transportation between Sumatra and various parts of the South is gradually recovering. As for communication networks, efforts were made to restore them early on, and postal, telegraph, and telephone services have gradually opened up.

In terms of education, the Japanese side, in view of the fact that Java has a population of 50 million, believed that this abundant human resource and the agricultural resources of Java were of great significance in the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In the past, these indigenous peoples were the targets of Dutch exploitation, and in terms of education, only one-third of the children graduated from elementary schools. Japan adopted a different policy and strived to educate and train this human resource, to improve the quality of labor of these 50 million people. Less than two months after the occupation, on April 29th, Tencho-setsu (the Emperor's Birthday), it announced the restoration of state and public elementary schools that taught in the indigenous languages—Malay, Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese. In June, the "Japanese Language Promotion School" in Batavia opened. Soon, Japanese language schools sprang up everywhere. All the male teachers from the island were summoned to Batavia to hold a lecture meeting, and soon female teachers' lecture meetings were also held to prepare to reach the level of one school per village. Secondary schools also opened in September, with the goal of cultivating talented people to build the new Java. To promote technical education, a training center for technicians was opened in August to enable them to learn excellent Japanese technology and create industrial warriors. The most noteworthy points of Java's education in the future are the popularization of Japanese and the respect for Malay. In secondary schools, Japanese is a required subject, and Malay is the main language. However, due to the lack of "academic terms" in Malay, the authorities specially organized a "Malay Language Maintenance Committee" to enrich the Malay vocabulary. The greatest efforts are being made to encourage Japanese, and in addition to opening Japanese language schools, various methods are used to encourage the study of Japanese, resulting in the slogan "Learn Japanese, inherit Japanese culture, and enhance Indonesian culture." The Military Administration Supervisory Department also stipulated promotion regulations, rewarding indigenous officials in the military and military administration-related agencies who had excellent Japanese language skills, and giving language salary increases. As for the education of overseas Chinese, whose population is second only to that of indigenous peoples, the Japanese side also paid attention to it. Elementary schools were first restored in Batavia starting in July last year, and many overseas Chinese schools in various places have also been restored.

In terms of culture, Java had a high level of culture among the countries of Southeast Asia before the Dutch invasion, having been influenced by Chinese and Indian cultures. During the three hundred years of Dutch rule, there were indeed many museums, libraries, botanical gardens, and other sanitary facilities, so it was worthy of the title of cultural center of Southeast Asia. After the Japanese army arrived, they focused on restoring cultural and sanitary facilities to improve people's happiness, especially in the area of health and medical care, and worked hard to expand all facilities.

Regarding newspapers and magazines, Malay has replaced the original Dutch and has risen alongside it. Under the guidance of the Japanese army, six newspapers have been published successively: "The Awakener" in Batavia, "One Light" in Bandung, "Voice of Asia" in Surabaya, "New Light" in Semarang, and "Sunshine" in Cihideung. In the area of overseas Chinese, there is a "Co-prosperity Newspaper" (Batavia) and the Surabaya Overseas Chinese Malay newspaper "Commercial News." (The End)

### Chinese Deaths in This City in January: Pulmonary Tuberculosis Remains the Main Cause; Typhoid Slightly Increased, Malaria Relatively Decreased; Regulations Prohibiting Spitting Have Been Effectively Implemented

The Public Works Bureau's Health Department recently released its work report for January, stating that the incidence of various infectious diseases in January was roughly the same as in December of the previous year. Typhoid fever showed a slight increase, while malaria decreased relatively due to seasonal factors. Diphtheria and meningitis did not increase. The number of patients admitted to Chinese isolation hospitals remained small. There were 2,189 registered Chinese deaths, including 1,189 exposed corpses. The main causes of death were pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, and so on. There were 51 cases of people seeking treatment for rabies at the Health Department. Medical and pharmaceutical affairs at the Bureau's schools continued as usual. Among students in Chinese schools, 1,845 had trachoma. Members were sent to inspect 67 Chinese private schools receiving subsidies. Business at various vegetable markets continued as usual, unaffected by the sharp rise in vegetable prices. Four licensed shops and three vegetable market stalls were prosecuted in court for violating regulations prohibiting spitting, and each was fined 25 yuan. 1,447 pounds of food that did not meet hygiene standards were confiscated and destroyed, and the relevant persons were prosecuted in court and punished separately. Milk production averaged 30.72 pounds per day. The Health Department regularly takes samples of milk produced by various dairies for testing. 20,829 citizens were vaccinated free of charge, a decrease of more than 23,000 compared to December of the previous year and a decrease of more than 37,000 compared to January of the previous year. The reasons for the decrease were: (1) smallpox had almost disappeared; (2) unvaccinated citizens could travel freely within Shanghai without restrictions; (3) mobile vaccination teams from the Health Department did not go to various factories and schools to administer vaccinations. The ban on spitting is being actively promoted. Nearly all charcoal kilns in the district have registered with the Bureau, obtained licenses, and improved their equipment to prevent smoke leakage. However, all charcoal kilns ceased operations after an order was issued by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters on January 10th. In view of repeated incidents of citizens being poisoned by eating pufferfish, the Bureau issued a notice reiterating the previous order prohibiting the sale of pufferfish (except in the Hongkou vegetable market). At the same time, it contacted the Shanghai Fish Market to send pufferfish to the Health Department's oil extraction room for destruction. 1,026 corpses were cremated, and 512 were buried.

### Economic Section: Economic Review on the Policy Transition and Controlled Economy

Japan's announced return of concessions and abolition of extraterritoriality have gradually taken concrete form, and it is expected to be fully realized in the near future. This policy transition can be described as an epoch-making event in Sino-Japanese relations, and the people of both countries sincerely hope it will proceed smoothly.

Japan's new policy is clearly demonstrated in the actions of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality. This new policy is not limited to these two items. All political, economic, and cultural departments have epoch-making transformations. However, there are still many people who cannot fundamentally understand the meaning of this transformation, which is truly regrettable. There will also be thorough and decisive reforms in the content of Japan's economic policy towards China, but it would be a great misunderstanding if anyone were to regard this change as a transition from a controlled economy to a free economy. The direction and intention of the original policy remain the same and have not changed. However, the National Government will now implement all economic policies, demonstrating the National Government's creativity and strength. Judging from the current internal and external situation, the essence of economic control is also uniform and unchanging, and there will never be any ambiguous matters.

In fact, the word "transition" is not suitable for observing Japan's policy. Japan's policy should be interpreted as having the two major meanings of growth and development. All current transformations are theoretical developments of Japan's policy since the Konoe Declaration and are the conclusion of strengthening the National Government's policy. Therefore, people in general must recognize that it is not a transition but a fact of growth. As for the controlled economy, it is merely a matter of transferring the control that was originally implemented by the Japanese side to meet wartime needs to the National Government. Therefore, it is completely wrong to see it as a change in wartime control policy. The National Government has its own wartime control policies. Even if there are some differences in the timing of the original control policies, the National Government will certainly follow and apply them, which is beyond doubt.

At present, people engaged in economic activities in Shanghai and other places do not understand this situation, make reckless guesses, and think that there will be changes in the economy. Everyone is engaged in speculation and engaging in unethical economic activities. This kind of activity is truly a disaster for the country and the people, and it can be said to be digging one's own grave. Economists who want to leave a way out in the future must abide by today's control, recognize its direction, and seek the well-being of the country, society, and individuals. Creating something out of nothing and misleading the country and oneself is the most hateful and should be discarded. The issue of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality is progressing extremely smoothly. The transfer of management of economic controls is also smooth. Japan's policy transition will be completed soon, and economists should clearly understand this trend and engage in legitimate activities. This is what we hope for from Chinese and Japanese economic circles. (Translated by Yun Peng from the March 6th Mainland New Daily)

### Economic Commentary: Future Private Economic Institutions

The Supreme National Defense Council resolved the other day to make industrial and commercial organizations purely economic institutions, so that they can concentrate on assisting the government in implementing economic policies under the wartime system, especially focusing on stabilizing people's livelihoods and strengthening economic power.

From this point of view, the responsibility of private economic institutions is twofold: First, to stabilize people's livelihoods. Therefore, private industrial and commercial organizations should take absolute responsibility and strive to suppress commodity prices and implement management systems to prevent the continued existence of speculation and hoarding. Second, to enhance economic power. Therefore, private industrial and commercial organizations should also take active responsibility and devote themselves to adjusting the supply and demand of goods, and assisting in obtaining production raw materials, especially exchanging them with production raw materials in the interior, to promote the corresponding supply and demand of goods.

This dual responsibility has already fallen on the heads of our private economic circles with the consent of the authorities and the urging of public opinion. Then, industrial and commercial organizations established in the private economic circles should feel that they have an unshirkable responsibility in the future, because the term private economic institutions will no longer be an empty slogan.

### Household Surveys and Controlled Economy

Wartime economy must focus on control. And the simplest and most direct method of control is to use shopping vouchers to regulate goods and finance. After the First European War, Germany needed more than 100 million marks per day for war expenses. If this 100 million marks of war expenses were taken from the normal national budget income and expenditure, it would certainly be insufficient to balance it. If it were taken from the issuance of public bonds, not only would the amount of debt increase day by day, but the procedures would also be extremely difficult. It would still be better to increase the issuance of paper money. The increase in the issuance of paper money would inevitably lead to more floating capital and create a phenomenon of currency inflation. Prices would rise day by day, and people would not be able to make a living. So what can be done? The clever German economists came up with a simple solution, which is the method of shopping without tickets. What is seen in Shanghai is only rice purchase certificates. In Germany, both millionaires and poor workers are given the same shopping vouchers. Whether it is clothing, food, daily necessities, or everything else needed, there are shopping vouchers. Without shopping vouchers, you cannot buy anything. Therefore, what millionaires can buy is also what the poor can buy. Therefore, in Germany, although the government spends tens of thousands of marks every day, it circulates directly and indirectly throughout the country. And those who get this money have nothing to use it for. Except for paying for the amount within the scope of their shopping, the remaining amount has no other use except to deposit it in the bank. It will inevitably flow back to the national bank. Therefore, the government and the national bank spend tens of thousands every day, and at the same time have tens of thousands in income. Prices also stagnate at official prices and cannot rise. This method is indeed the most ingenious way to manage wartime. But how to adjust production and consumption, and how to reconcile shopping vouchers with population, then one book leads to ten thousand variations, and it is not easy. Our country has never had an accurate household survey, and civil servants lack experience in implementing private economic affairs. If we want to learn from Germany's methods, it will not be easy to see its implementation without actively working hard.

### The Authorities Are Investigating the Prices of Goods in Various Industries to Welcome Stable Prices

Personnel Are Sent to Check Account Books to Execute Price Limits Seriously
Severe Investigation of Transactions Exceeding Limit Prices

In order to thoroughly suppress prices and crack down on speculation and hoarding, the authorities have distributed food, oil, sugar, and other nine necessities per capita. All markets that contain speculation are ordered to suspend business and wait for improvement. Price limits are also strictly enforced, and the account books of purchases and sales in various industries are checked. Merchants who exceed the price limits are investigated, sealed, and punished according to law. The inspection is very strict. For example, although the prices of goods sold to a store listed in the store's account books do not exceed the price limits, to be cautious, it is also investigated whether the prices match at the store that received the goods. All the employees of the Price Control Office have been mobilized to seriously implement the price limits. Some stores have been investigated, sealed, and suspended from business.

### Sino-Japanese Economic Discussion Meeting Held at the Jinmen Hotel the Other Day

The East Asia Economic Discussion Meeting's Central China Headquarters, taking the opportunity of the former Xingzhong Company President Togo Shinji's visit to Shanghai, held a Sino-Japanese economic discussion meeting at the Jinmen Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road at noon on the 5th. Those who attended included Japan's Yuki Chemical Company Mr. Tamaki Toyosuke and Mr. Sekiguchi Takeo, and China's Chen Binhuo, Yin Zibai, Shen Liangchang, Yuan Lvdeng, Wen Lan, and Ting Mokanghou, among other Sino-Japanese celebrities, totaling more than 50 people. The atmosphere during the meeting was exceptionally harmonious, and the meeting adjourned at around 2:00 PM. (March 6th Mainland New Daily)

### Cigarette Rationing Association Prepares to Distribute Goods

Regarding the Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association's rationing of cigarettes in Shanghai and nearby areas to eliminate the cigarette black market, the association has been actively preparing and is now largely ready. The pledges of all registered cigarette stores in the city were filled out yesterday by Dada Tung, and the rationing can begin. It is learned that the association will first start rationing cigarettes in the urban area of Shanghai in the shortest possible time, and then carry out rationing in the eight suburban districts of Shanghai. Finally, it will expand to various parts of Huazhong. The rationing prices will of course be calculated according to the cost of various cigarettes.

### Alcohol Factories in This City Encounter Raw Material Difficulties

Various chemical industries all use alcohol as the only manufacturing raw material, and alcohol itself is extracted from molasses. Shanghai's alcohol factories used to use Javanese molasses as raw material. Currently, due to wartime shipping difficulties, they have switched to using dried sweet potatoes. Although the procedure is slightly more complicated, it is easy to obtain. However, recently, villagers are using dried sweet potatoes as a secondary food source due to food shortages, so they are not transported to Shanghai in large quantities, and prices have also risen sharply. Therefore, it is currently very difficult for alcohol factories in this city to find raw materials.

### Procurement of Large Quantities of Oilseed Raw Materials; Half Have Arrived in Shanghai

Edible oil is one of the main items of food for the people. Recently, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the authorities are implementing a rationing system and also seeking to increase supplies. They have collected a large amount of soybean raw materials, totaling 50,000 tons, from various areas and transported them to Shanghai for the use of various oil pressing factories. Half of them have already arrived at the port, and the rest are being transported continuously. Several tens of thousands of tons of rapeseed and cottonseed are also being purchased, so the supply of oil is expected to increase considerably in the future. As for the selling date of the per capita oil, the authorities need to carefully consider the quantity, so the rationing tickets have not yet been issued.

### Foreign Economic News

Germany has Sufficient Glass Inventory

It is claimed here that the inventory made by German glass factories is very rich and sufficient to cope with all the urgent needs after the air raids. It can produce 50 million square meters of glass every year. A large machine can produce 6,000 square meters a day. The broken glass after the air raid is taken back and remade, so there is no need to worry about the shortage of glass supply.

France's Remedy for the Oil Shortage

Since France's source of fuel oil from abroad has been cut off, fuel has become a problem. The government is trying to find a solution to the oil shortage. Oil production within France is very small. Although Banchelbrom has oil mines, its output is too small to be worth mentioning. The oil produced in the Hérault province in the south is also very small and does not help. In this situation, the authorities have to use local coal and wood as fuel. The production of local coal in western France is very abundant. The authorities have opened several factories specifically for refining local coal. In addition, charcoal-making equipment has been installed in the forests of the southwest. There are 50 new factories in the country for manufacturing this fuel, and it is expected that its output can replace the fuel oil that used to come from the United States and Iraq.

Finnish Athletes' Voluntary Work

Finnish athletes responded to the government's call and helped with logging in the forests, working for 25,000,000 hours. They also helped neighbors work for 5,000,000 hours. The value of these hours reached 175,000,000 marks. And all the athletes are working voluntarily.

Manchukuo Electric Power Company Plans

The Manchukuo Electric Power Company plans to add high-voltage power lines and a large number of transformer stations along the way this year to connect all light and heavy industry centers with power plants in various places. This plan requires an estimated expenditure of 150,000,000 yen, which can be obtained from three sources, namely (1) borrowing 100,000,000 yen, (2) soliciting new shares of 40,000,000 yen, and (3) using the company's surplus reserve funds of 10,000,000 yen.

### Social Security of the Economic Circle: China Health Company and China Health Association

The greatest resource in life is one's own health, and all economic development is based on health as the greatest driving force. The China Health Company, which was recently launched by leaders of the Maritime Economic Circle and other circles, has all the latest modern medical equipment and can be called the first of its kind in this city's health industry. The various health work it promotes, such as general health checkups for citizens and anti-tuberculosis X-ray examinations, are not only important work for the development of preventive medicine, but also important factors for strengthening the economic power of citizens. Since its opening last month, it has attracted widespread attention. In order to promote various inspection work, the company issues health certificates in accordance with the health systems of various countries, with the aim of uncovering diseases before they manifest and treating diseases in the early stages, thereby saving the social burden of medical expenses. The inspection fee is divided into two types, 100 yuan and 50 yuan per person, and preferential treatment is given to various industrial and commercial organizations, with a discount of 25 yuan per person. In addition, industrial and commercial leaders are currently organizing the China Health Association, and it is expected that the city's society will be able to increase in health in the future, which will definitely contribute to economic development. The company is located at No. 96 Jing'an Temple Road, Meiqi Building.

### Reader's Opinion: A Humble Opinion on "Increasing Industrial Loans" By Wang Wei

"Increasing industrial loans"—from a practical point of view, it means strengthening the connection between finance and industry, and it is an important step under the current economic policy; this step can be actively promoted. In terms of industry, it can improve productivity and develop production relations; in the financial industry itself, it can put business on the right track and stabilize finance; therefore, we must not regard "increasing industrial loans" as a simple technical issue, but should recognize its importance from its impact on the overall economic situation.

Based on the decisions of the relevant parties regarding the implementation of "increasing industrial loans" that have been published in the newspaper over the past month, we can summarize the main five points as follows:

1.  Absorb floating capital, increase deposit interest rates, and recover investments in non-productive areas.
2.  Investigate whether the funds loaned by banks and money shops are used for production or hoarding.
3.  Use movable and immovable property as collateral for loans and various commodities as mortgages, but with proof from the relevant industry association.
4.  Overdrafts and credit loans must have solvent guarantors who guarantee that they will be fully cleared before the end of the year, and interest rates will be calculated according to the market prices announced monthly.
5.  Promote acceptance bills to help industries and businesses facilitate funding.

These methods are obviously still principled, and many concrete steps need to be considered during implementation. At the same time, we should see clearly the reality that the financial industry and the organizations of various industries in Shanghai are not sound. That is to say, the connection between various associations and their members is very loose. Most of them only do some communication work. As for business supervision, research, investigation, and assistance, they have just been mentioned; therefore, when encountering this policy of "increasing industrial loans," it is to be expected that many difficulties will arise and be encountered in the process of implementation.

Here, I will briefly express some of my opinions within my limited knowledge for everyone's reference.

First of all, I feel that raising deposit interest rates, absorbing floating capital, and recovering investments in non-productive areas to increase loans to industry is a good method, but how can we truly channel funds into the industrial sector? This is not a simple question. Because even if the loan accounts of banks and money shops are replaced by factories instead of commercial firms, it cannot be said that the goal of "increasing industrial loans" has been achieved, because the ultimate goal of "increasing industrial loans" is to increase production; therefore, there are three issues to be noted: First, at present, many factories are unwilling and unable to carry out production due to sluggish sales and huge manufacturing costs. They rely entirely on the buying and selling of raw materials and product inventory to maintain survival; for such factories, regardless of the degree of accumulation of their assets, in principle, they cannot obtain loans unless they start production. Second, even for factories that are currently engaged in production, loans must be determined according to their needs. I remember that in 1940, when foreign exchange was fluctuating violently, many factories borrowed money from banks, purchased huge quantities of raw materials, and put them in warehouses. They used the warehouse warrants to make mortgages to the bank and then purchased the second batch of raw materials to make mortgages again... This situation cannot be said to be completely absent now; therefore, when making loans—especially mortgage loans—it is necessary to strictly investigate whether it is needed for a certain period of production. Third, as I mentioned in my article "The Production Problem of Small Factories," the lending policy of banks and money shops is mostly "providing to those who lack and rejecting those who seek," so will some small factories that are actually engaged in production but are short of funds still be excluded?

In order to overcome these three possible problems, we must start from management. The Banking Association and the various industry associations should have a horizontal connection, plan the loan work according to the production situation of each industry, and discuss and study the problems that arise in both aspects during the implementation process; and each association should add a specialized department to strictly supervise and review the loan targets and production status; there is no doubt that without a sound management mechanism, the effectiveness of "increasing industrial loans" cannot be brought into play, and the role of "increasing production" cannot be achieved.

Secondly, regarding the interest rate issue, from the perspective of banks and money shops, interest is a kind of income, which is a gross profit; from the perspective of factories, it is an expense, which is a production cost; the current interest rate is 30 yuan, which is one and a half times higher than the 12 yuan in January of last year, which is of course caused by the instability of currency and the turbulence of prices, and cannot be the responsibility of banks and money shops; my opinion is that under the situation that the currency is relatively stable and floating capital is heading towards the right track (deposits in various banks increased to 130 million yuan last month),

### Long-Term Research by Pharmaceutical Experts: Able to Produce Vitamin C Independently

The discovery of vitamins is a major advancement in the history of modern medicine, greatly benefiting human health. Scientific and medical circles in various countries have attached great importance to it and have conducted extensive research. To date, more than twenty types have been discovered, forming a veritable specialized field of study. In recent years, many pharmaceutical factories have been established in our country, but those engaged in fundamental research work are still rare, mainly due to the backwardness of our country's science, inadequate equipment, and lack of talent. Recently, the research institute of one pharmaceutical factory, due to the cut-off of sources of foreign chemicals and pharmaceutical raw materials, has begun to conduct independent research, which is an excellent phenomenon.

**Successful Research After Two Years**

A Shanghai news agency reporter recently learned that the research institutes of some pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai have been working hard on research recently, and one of them has already achieved success. In the recent research work of Chinese scientists, the research of Dr. Sa Bentie and Master Shi Jiazhong on the production of vitamin C is worthy of attention. It is said that the two gentlemen were engaged in the research and analysis of vitamin C before the outbreak of the Pacific War, hoping to produce it independently. After six months of effort, they did not succeed. After the outbreak of the war, the two gentlemen continued their efforts due to the cut-off of raw material sources for vitamin C. With the help of various assistants, they proceeded separately. After twenty-two months of research, they finally discovered two bacteria that cause chemical changes in vitamin C, and Chinese people successfully produced vitamin C independently.

**Satisfactory Inspection and Start of Production**

Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is an indispensable element for the human body. Common fruits such as oranges and lemons contain natural vitamin C, but it is not sufficient for therapeutic use. Artificially produced vitamin C was discovered by Swiss scientists ten years ago. The vitamin C used by various pharmaceutical factories in our country has always been purchased directly from foreign countries as raw materials. Now that Chinese scientists Dr. Sa Bentie and Master Shi Jiazhong have successfully researched it, the China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory has conducted chemical, biological, and clinical tests, all of which have been deemed satisfactory. It is now being produced in large quantities, which is truly a glorious page in the history of our country's science.

### Cartoon Association Hosts Reception for All Sectors Yesterday, Reporting on the Progress of the Exhibition

The China Cartoon Association of this city, in order to instill war participation awareness, held a cartoon exhibition to support the participation in the Greater East Asia Construction on the 9th of last month at the Daxin Painting Hall, which closed on the 15th. Because the association received a lot of support from all sectors during the exhibition, it specially held a tea party at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 6th) on the 14th floor of the International Hotel to thank all relevant parties and report on the progress of the cartoon exhibition.

### Municipal Police Bureau Notice: Cracking Down on Bad Habits of Citizens

The Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the fact that residents within the boundary have not been able to implement common sense of hygiene, not only dump garbage in corners of walls and roadsides, but also spit at will on busy roads, which not only damages the city's appearance and exposes unsanitary bad habits, but also easily spreads prevalent rashes such as pulmonary tuberculosis, colds, and leprosy, which greatly affects public health. In order to protect the public health of the people, it has decided to crack down on the above-mentioned bad habits. Therefore, it issued a notice to remind residents throughout the city to pay attention, and ordered all police stations under its jurisdiction to severely punish residents who commit the above-mentioned acts in order to improve the city's appearance and protect public health.

### The Vocational Problems of Young People

— Ye Minhe

All ambitious young people are determined not to rely on the wealth of their families to lead a boring life, but would rather endure all kinds of difficulties and setbacks, struggling in society for their own future. However, the leaders of society are indifferent to the future and development of young people. A middle school graduate is often given an apprentice job like a beast of burden. An ordinary store, when it needs personnel, immediately asks for a high school degree. No matter what agency or store, as long as it wants to recruit one or two people in the newspaper, thousands of young people immediately apply, competing like squeezing oil, rice, and sugar, vying for this position that they know has very little hope. Even college students are willing to condescend to apply.

Especially in today's society, whether it is a factory or a company, employing people only considers relationships, not ability. Job security is even less to speak of. The treatment is harsh, and the income is often not enough for one's own use, let alone supporting a family. The length of working hours, eleven hours, makes it unnecessary to think about the issue of young people's learning and self-study. Outside of working hours, they must also bear responsibility tirelessly. Occasionally, a small mistake will ruin all previous efforts and lead to immediate elimination, with no room for forgiveness.

It is really as difficult as ascending to the sky for a young person to leave school or a store and seek an opportunity to enter the commercial field. Those without commercial experience are not hired, and those with experience are asked for a certificate. If you have one, there will be unexpected problems to embarrass you, asking why you left your previous place of service. When you describe your past history, they immediately hold the prejudice that young people who have served elsewhere are unreliable. I ask, where are there so many young people who have not entered society and are rich in commercial experience waiting? How can you not chill the hearts of vocational youth and young people who have not left school? The concept of "graduation is unemployment" can be said to have originated from this.

Therefore, I would like to ask the leaders of society to abandon their prejudices and discuss and solve all events with lower-level personnel in a practical manner, so as to make the relationship between superiors and subordinates harmonious, eliminate all feelings of estrangement, cultivate young people more, and assume true leadership responsibility, then young people will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate!
