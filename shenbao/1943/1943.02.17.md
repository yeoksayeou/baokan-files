### Receiving Concessions and Managing Enemy Assets

The State Council of the National Government passed a resolution on the 9th of this month's meeting to establish a Committee for Receiving Concessions under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, abolishing the Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritorial Rights and the Committee for the Management of Enemy Assets. Furthermore, Japanese Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry also clearly announced the following in response to questions in the Diet on the 10th of this month regarding the Liu Hua issue: (1) Regarding the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China, specialized committees from both countries will discuss and decide on the implementation methods: firstly, starting with extraterritorial rights related to taxation. The implementation period cannot yet be definitively stated, and the specialized committee will solicit opinions from the public. (2) Regarding the transfer of enemy assets in China, from the perspective of completing the Greater East Asia War, it is more appropriate for the National Government to handle them than for our side to do so, and it is appropriate to transfer them to the National Government for management. From the above news, it can be seen that the Sino-Japanese Agreement of January 9th is about to enter the stage of practical implementation. As this epoch-making event is about to unfold, the people of both countries are watching and anticipating it, especially the Chinese people who have even more fervent hopes. Therefore, we respectfully offer a word of earnest advice to the authorities on both sides, especially to the gentlemen of the specialized committees of both countries who are responsible for executing this significant event.

Regarding the historical event of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, the most important meaning is the sincerity practically demonstrated by Japan. At the same time, it is also the beginning of future cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese peoples in building a new order in East Asia. Therefore, in the execution of this historical event, in addition to the specialized committee formed by special representatives from both governments, it seems that the opinions of the people of both countries should also be widely solicited. Furthermore, before the execution, specialized talents should be recruited as soon as possible to establish civilian advisory bodies, or various specialized civilian committees, to provide various concrete opinions and methods for the reference of the authorities on both sides.

As for the transfer of enemy assets, the Japanese side also attaches particular importance to this matter. We believe that the responsible authorities will definitely handle it properly. What we want to suggest here is: first, this matter has the same important and international significance as the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions, and it is watched by the world. Especially on the side of the British and American enemies, they are constantly doing everything possible to slander the transfer of British and American industries in China under Japanese military management to the National Government. Therefore, in our country's reception and management, we must especially demonstrate our country's tradition of morality, outstanding character, and shatter all slanderous conspiracies of the enemy, so as to enhance our country's position in the international arena. Second, the takeover of enemy assets should adapt to wartime needs. For productive enemy assets, special attention should be paid to their planned increase in production to meet the needs of wartime military supplies and the daily lives of the people, and expansions should be made where they are suitable. For those suitable for management by the Chinese people, experts should be carefully selected to manage them; for those particularly suitable for management by the Japanese side, Japanese experts should be hired to continue management; or for those particularly suitable for Sino-Japanese cooperation, they should be managed in a cooperative manner. Third, the disposal of enemy assets during wartime naturally has international law to follow, and there is no need to elaborate. However, what we particularly want to point out is that, in the past year of Japanese management of enemy assets, as long as there were no hostile actions on the part of the original personnel, they were never lightly transferred, and were still allowed to continue in their positions, with guarantees for their livelihood. In terms of materials and industries, international law was absolutely observed. For example, after surveying and registering immovable properties, houses, and their internal equipment, it was strictly forbidden for anyone to move them without authorization. Even the enemy had to repeatedly praise this virtue. We should also demonstrate the demeanor of a great nation and fully inherit this virtue of the Japanese side over the past year in the enemy assets received and managed. In particular, the personnel responsible for the execution must be upright and honest, so as to bring honor to the country and not betray the trust of friendly nations in us.

Finally, we reiterate without reservation: this implementation of the Sino-Japanese Agreement is the beginning of sincere cooperation between China and Japan. Everyone who implements the work of the agreement will be a figure in this glorious history, and for the glory of the country, we wish the committee members success.

### Advisor Ishiwatari Arrives in Tokyo Returns to Nanjing Early Next Month After Attending Parliament

Tokyo, 16th (Domei News Agency telegram) Mr. Ishiwatari Shotaro, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, arrived here from Shanghai this afternoon. He is scheduled to attend Parliament and will return to Nanjing around the beginning of next month.

Shanghai News from Central News Agency In a draft of yesterday's (15th) interview with the press by Advisor Ishiwatari, the content of the section on monetary finance did not match the original intention and the entire section was withdrawn. The corrected draft of the section is recorded below.

Regarding the issue of monetary finance, the ratio of Reserve Certificates to military scrip is 100 yuan to 18 yen and will not be changed. Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry has already explained this point in Parliament. The ratio of Reserve Certificates to Japanese yen after the integration of military scrip and Reserve Certificates will also be no different. This matter is quite important for Sino-Japanese relations. The relationship between Joint Reserve Bank notes, Reserve Certificates, and Manchurian currency will also not be changed. In general, it is better not to change the monetary issue under the current state of the wartime economy. Regarding the special yen issue, it is currently being studied in comparison with the relationship of the Trading Corporation submitted to Parliament. The four pillars of increasing the value of Reserve Certificates, increasing productivity, countering commodity prices, and stabilizing people's livelihood are the foundations for cultivating war power. The countermeasures include the following methods: On the one hand, issuing food coupons for the purpose of purchasing food in rural areas to suppress the release of Reserve Certificates, and on the other hand, encouraging savings. Rewards are given to those who save a certain amount of money. Although Japan does not have such a system, China has implemented it and the results have been quite good and will be actively implemented by the Central Reserve Bank. Although the issuance of lotteries has not yet been decided, it has already been implemented in Manchuria and North China, so this method can be promoted.

Today happens to be the anniversary of China's participation in the war. I am willing to devote greater efforts to overcome difficulties and transform the environment. You are all my comrades in adversity. I sincerely hope that you will understand the spirit in which I stand, strengthen unity, and cooperate with our friendly nation, Japan. At this extraordinary time, we should do more and talk less. Under the awareness of China's self-reliant participation in the war, we should use the strength of both China and Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the most urgent task at present is to plan for increased production under the principle of security first, especially to stabilize prices, in order to stabilize people's livelihood. Secondly, we should thoroughly develop war resources, such as coal, salt, cotton and other North China specialties, and actively increase their production. Regarding personnel issues, we should not rashly make changes. The selection of personnel must be prudent, and rewards and punishments must be carried out. You should be more cautious and self-disciplined? Work hard in your positions? Good governance does not lie in many words. Implementation is paramount. Under the principle of collective wisdom, I deeply hope that you will assist me." (翔 translation, February 11th, Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)

Bern, Switzerland, 15th (Havas Agency dispatch) - According to both Axis and British/American sources, American forces in southern Tunisia have encountered a major setback. A communiqué released by the Axis side stated that German forces broke through the American lines by 20 miles, but did not mention the place name, only stating that fierce fighting is now underway and that the Gafsa position is in danger of being cut off, so the American forces may withdraw from the city. Gafsa is the railway center of southern Tunisia, and its situation is important as a crucial base for attacking the Gabès Gulf and attacking the rear of the Mareth Line. The Allied Headquarters in North Africa also admitted to withdrawing from Bou Chebka, between Gafsa and Kairouan, and announced that the American Air Force had bombed the northwest area of Sened and Maknassy, tacitly acknowledging that the British/American forces had abandoned the position between Gafsa and Bou Chebka. According to British sources, General Rommel is now consolidating his position in central Tunisia, but Britain has high hopes for the air force, which has been reorganized under the command of General Tedder. Another report from the German High Command stated that Axis forces broke through the American lines by 20 miles near the Faïd Pass and destroyed 14 American tanks. A communiqué issued by the Italian High Command stated that reconnaissance activities were frequent on the Libyan and Tunisian borders, and the resistance of the Allied forces in the Ben Gardane area was gradually weakening. The Italian side has dispatched a large army from within the country, heading to the port of Gabès from both the sea and air, and then to the Mareth Line for reinforcement. In addition, the Roman Post published news stating that guerrilla activity was active in the American rear, because Muslims harbor hatred for the American forces' meager rations and disrespect for their customs.

Vichy, 15th (Havas Agency dispatch) - London reports that Rosyth, the son of Lord Gowrie, the British Governor-General of Australia, has died on the Libyan front. The authorities have notified Lord Gowrie.

### Japanese House of Peers Completes Deliberation of All Bills - Decisive Battle Posture Established - Production of Materials to Be Increased

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The 81st session of the Japanese Diet, which reopened on the 28th of last month, is about to end. The House of Peers and the House of Representatives, under the great war that determines the fate of the nation, have set the goal of establishing and strengthening combat power and other decisive battle policies, and have conducted sincere and detailed deliberations on the budget proposal for the 18th year of Showa and 88 government proposals. Of the 39 bills in the House of Peers, only the "Wartime Criminal Special Law Amendment" remained. After the explanation by Minister of Justice Iwamura, it was passed by the committee on the bill and formally passed in the plenary session on the 15th, and then transferred to the House of Representatives. Thus, the review of all bills has been completed. Starting from the first budget general meeting on the 15th, the House of Peers will actively begin deliberating on the budget proposal and the Petroleum Monopoly Law, the tax increase bill, and other 31 items delivered by the House of Representatives. Therefore, the focus of the second half of the Diet has been concentrated in the House of Peers. It is expected that the House of Peers will actively deliberate on war measures with the enthusiasm of supporting politics in order to enhance combat power. Tracing the greatest mission of this Diet session, it is to enhance the production of war materials. Among them, the Wartime Administrative Special Law Bill is the best representative. To date, all agenda items have been focused on establishing a policy of enhancing the production of aircraft, ships, steel, coal, light metals, etc. Prime Minister Tojo said on the 5th in the Special Committee on Wartime Administrative Special Laws of the House of Representatives that peaceful industries have ended, and everything is about expanding armaments. Therefore, at this time, the ideal of restoring peaceful industries should be decisively abandoned. This clearly indicates that the time has come for the whole country to resolutely rise up, especially the entire economic sector, which is directly related to enhancing production. This can also hint at the trend of this Diet session. The Japanese government's international guiding policy is also to expand and strengthen national control, but at the same time, it still avoids forcibly coercing the people and trusts in the patriotic enthusiasm of the people and makes full use of it. This is enough to show the character of Japan's decisive battle politics. However, since the entire national power is focused on enhancing the five industries, it will inevitably have a significant impact on general industries, so its adjustment policy will also become one of the important measures in the future. However, in order to implement the super-focused industry policy, the government will decisively eliminate all obstacles and actively expand armaments. This is the characteristic of this Diet session. This time, because the government and the Diet, in a consistent constructive discussion, have clarified that the combat power of the second year of the war will be enhanced, the Wartime Administrative Special Law is the center of super-focused operation. It is urgent to ask the whole country to invigorate the spirit. Therefore, the Diet has passed the supplementary budget proposal of 27 billion yuan for temporary military expenditures, the budget proposal of 10 billion yuan for the 18th year, and the tax increase bill of more than 1 billion yuan in the House of Representatives. This shows that the Japanese people have the greatest determination to do their best no matter what difficulties they encounter. As Finance Minister Kaya said, the foundation of the financial and economic posture for certain victory is built on the national income of 50 billion yuan, so it is absolutely solid. The Diet in the second half will take the House of Peers as the center and actively deliberate on the above-mentioned decisive battle measures. Also, when promoting and implementing this decisive battle plan, the Prime Minister concurrently serves as the Minister of the Army, forming a personnel-specific political and military unity system, so that national politics can be operated in accordance with the nuances of the operation. Prime Minister Tojo, at the Budget General Meeting of the House of Representatives on the 2nd, revealed his major determination as the Prime Minister of the wartime cabinet. Therefore, Japan's decisive battle posture will be completely established due to the opening of this Diet session.

Absolutely Exclude Communism

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki replied to Member Akio's question on countermeasures against communism at the plenary session of the House of Representatives today, saying in essence: "Based on the ideal of building Greater East Asia, communism within the Greater East Asia region must be absolutely excluded. Japan also has some viewpoints and is taking various measures. The joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo was also based on anti-communism as the fundamental spirit. The government of the Republic of China is guiding its political policy by anti-communism. However, in order to defeat the communist movement in China, it is most important for the Chinese government to strengthen its political power."

### German Troops on the Eastern Front Outnumbered, Fierce Fighting Around Kharkov, Soviet Advance in the North Repulsed

German Leader's Headquarters, 16th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) - Today's German military report stated that the Soviet troops advancing southeast of Lake Ilmen and between Volkhov and Lake Ladoga were repulsed yesterday. Ninety-three Soviet tanks were destroyed. A total of 157 tanks were destroyed on all Eastern European lines yesterday. There were fierce battles on all Eastern European lines as enemy tanks and infantry attacked. Soviet troops launched a large-scale attack on our positions around Kharkov. Outnumbered, our troops fought bravely and did not retreat. Twenty Soviet tanks that rushed to the outskirts of Kharkov were destroyed. The enemy's advance north of Kursk was repulsed.

Berlin, 16th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) - A German communique announced yesterday that German troops had withdrawn from Rostov. This planned withdrawal is related to the fighting west and southwest of the Donets Basin. Now that German troops have abandoned positions in the eastern salient within the Donets River, the front line is shortened by about two-thirds compared to before. The German troops encountered almost no enemy resistance during the withdrawal, indicating that enemy claims of capturing large amounts of German war materiel and capturing large numbers of German soldiers are completely fabricated. The German troops withdrawn from the Donets area can now be moved to areas further north to confront Soviet troops advancing southwest to encircle the German left flank. Between the middle reaches of the Donets and Livny, Soviet troops continue to attack relentlessly, their main target being Kharkov. West and north of Kursk, German troops are putting up strong resistance, preventing any Soviet advances. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, Soviet troops are concentrating their forces in a small area, appearing to be preparing to attack there. There are no major changes in the northern sector.

The Rzhev Salient is an Important Factor in the Current Situation

Soviet Border, 15th (Havas News Agency Telegram) - Although the fighting on the Eastern Front has slowed slightly in the past 24 hours due to the cold weather, its intensity has increased unabated. The situation in each area is described below: (1) The battle for Rostov is ongoing. A large fire is still burning throughout the city. The Red Army is encountering fierce resistance in the city. German troops are still fighting and retreating. (2) In the Donets Basin, German troops are reorganizing their forces despite Red Army resistance and continuing to move troops. Although the Red Army has made slight gains near Voroshilovgrad and Shakhty, no military equipment has fallen into Red Army hands. (3) Fighting is fierce near Kharkov, especially on the front line southeast of the Ukrainian capital Chuguev. German reinforcements have arrived in the area, but the Red Army has infiltrated German positions between Belgorod and Kharkov. Fighting is also taking place near the town of Zoločiv on the Kharkov-Bryansk railway. The Germans admit that a gap has been opened in their defense line there, but the gap has been filled after the Germans moved heavy artillery units to the front line. The situation there seems extremely chaotic, but it is not impossible for the Red Army to be surrounded by the Germans after penetrating deep into German lines. (4) General Golikov's troops attempted to attack northwest and north of Kursk, apparently aiming for the Bryansk-Kharkov railway, but were unsuccessful. (5) There were no major battles on other fronts, but observers believe that the Rzhev line salient is an important factor in the current situation. It is expected that the Red Army will either attack the area or the Germans will decide to shorten their lines. (6) The Red Army has repeatedly attacked southeast and south of Leningrad, but has been repulsed by German artillery. German troops there continue to defend major railway hubs, especially the Slutsk station southeast of Leningrad, so the Red Army remains in a disadvantageous position.

### Indian Briefs – Received from Macau on February 10th –

Rising Prices

The Indian government and major Indian businesses, in view of the daily rise in prices of daily necessities, are now providing their employees with "cost-of-living allowances" to compensate them. The prices of some daily necessities have risen to five or six times their pre-war levels. Apart from occasional air raids, India has not yet experienced war, but its people are already suffering from shortages of consumer goods and rising prices. Some areas of India are currently experiencing a shortage of this staple food due to the ban on rice exports from Burma. The Bombay government is promoting the consumption of brown rice, and the government of Kashmir Province is taking active steps to ban the hoarding of grain by grain merchants and the sale of grain on the black market at prices higher than those set by the government. Due to the rationing of gasoline, many car owners in India are abandoning their cars or using horse-drawn carriages or bicycles instead, or converting their vehicles to charcoal-burning vehicles.

Increasing Enlistments

The Department of India and Burma Affairs announced on December 5th of last year that the average number of Indians joining the Indian Army in the four months from June to September of this year was more than 68,000 per month, compared to an average of 47,000 per month during the same period last year.

### North China in the First Month of the Declaration of War

— Special Correspondent Xin Yin

The Spring Festival had just passed when we encountered the first anniversary of the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States. The declaration of war caused a watershed change in North China, which had been in a state of emergency for five years. Since January 9th, everything, even the air, has felt different!

North China has always been designated as the "front line of anti-communism" and the "rear base of the Greater East Asia War," and has considered itself a "specialized" area. However, since the Greater East Asia War entered its decisive second year and the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, North China's special mission has been shouldered by all of China, so North China's "special character" no longer exists. Having shed its special colors and donned the wartime cloak, North China has shown many new signs in general psychology and various factual manifestations over the past month:

First: Manifestations in Political Institutions

Simplifying wartime political institutions is what Japan has recently been doing. North China after the declaration of war has also entered the wartime system, and political institutions naturally need to be adjusted. On the other hand, how the North China Political Affairs Commission, the entire political institution, will evolve in this new era of the New China participating in the Greater East Asia War is also generally expected.

The death of Yin Tong, a standing committee member of the North China Political Affairs Commission who concurrently held 18 important positions, including the Construction Department Commissioner and the New People's Association Vice President, caused a great shock to the North China Political Affairs Commission. Yin's vacancy and the demands of the entire structure of the Political Affairs Commission led to the recent major personnel changes. These changes occurred in three stages: Announced on January 20th, Yu Jinhe, the mayor of Beiping, was transferred to succeed as Construction Department Commissioner. Announced on January 28th: Su Tiren, the governor of Shanxi Province, was transferred to succeed as the mayor of Beiping, with Feng Sizhi, the president of the Shanxi New People's Daily, as the governor of Shanxi Province. Announced on February 9th: Shi Yitang, the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission and Commissioner of the Internal Affairs Department, and Zhou Zuoren, the Commissioner of the Education Department, resigned, with Zhu Shen succeeding as chairman, Qi Xieyuan concurrently serving as Commissioner of the Internal Affairs Department, and Su Tiren, who had just taken office as the mayor of Beiping for eight days, was transferred to be the Commissioner of the Education Department. Then came a large number of appointments and transfers of middle and lower-level officials who followed their superiors. At the same time as the replacement of the old and new chairmen, the list of all members of the Political Affairs Commission (including incumbents and new members) was re-determined by the National Government, and the organizational regulations of the various departments under the Political Affairs Commission were also officially announced. The Political Affairs Commission, which was brewing to strengthen the institution and simplify personnel, thus achieved temporary stability.

However, the hearts of the people of North China under wartime are tense and full of hope. Although the Political Affairs Commission has a new face in terms of personnel, the atmosphere of thoroughly renewing its image still permeates all levels of society. It is generally believed that the time for the New China and the New Central Government to unify and strengthen wartime political institutions is not far off.

Second: The National Flag is No Longer Substituted with the Five-Color Flag

Following the National Government's official order to abolish the national flag with emblems, the North China Political Affairs Commission also issued a notice on the 9th of this month prohibiting the use of the Five-Color Flag as a substitute for the national flag. Note: Since the National Government returned to its capital, the national flag has been seen again in North China, but only government agencies and schools can hang it. Merchants and civilians still unanimously use the Five-Color Flag. On the 9th of this month, the first anniversary of the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, merchants and civilians throughout Beiping automatically hung out national flags without emblems. The restoration of the national flag in North China gave people a great excitement.

Third, the New Trends of the New People's Association

The New People's Association is also one of the special institutions in North China after the incident. However, today, its character is very different from the past. At the end of October last year, when the third New People's Association National Federation was held, it was honored by the presence of Chairman Wang, who gave two speeches to the conference. The hearts of the entire conference were greatly inspired, and unanimously ignited the enthusiasm to support the chairman. It was at that conference that the major event of changing the program of the New People's Association was decided. The New People's Association began to be spiritually led by Chairman Wang. After the National Government declared war, the New People's Association held a "Participation in the War National Federation" on January 20th, and unanimously passed a resolution to elect Chairman Wang as the honorary chairman of the association. On the same day, they received a reply from the chairman, agreeing to accept. All the members of the association were overjoyed. Since then, the New People's Association has been led by the chairman in name and in fact!

The center of what the New People's Association now calls "association movement" (association work) is focused on the New National Movement, and spiritually, it is one with the East Asia League. Its new evolution, like that of the Commission, is being generally expected.

Fourth, the Reflection of Finance and Prices

North China is the area of the United Reserve Bank, and the official exchange rate of the United Reserve Bank for the reserve currency is ten to three. In fact, at the end of November last year, the black market exchange rate was still ten to two point one two. Only after the declaration of war did it rise to ten to two point seven. Now it is continuing to rise, with a tendency to break the official exchange rate. The financial community unanimously believes that the reserve currency will soon become two to one against the United Reserve Bank. This shows the tendency of the people of North China towards the central government.

However, under wartime, the general psychology has always tended to value the possession of materials. Therefore, it has caused the rise in prices. Therefore, since January of this year, various prices have risen uniformly. Food is the most prominent. For example, the price of each dan of rice was 300 yuan in early January, and it has risen to 440 yuan in early February. Each bag of flour was 50 yuan in early January, and recently it has risen to 75 yuan. Each jin of millet and corn flour (the staple food of the common people) was only 7 jiao in early January, and it has risen to 1 yuan 7 or 8 jiao in early February. After the Spring Festival, the first news of the market opening was two shocking price increases, namely a 36-yuan increase in the price of every hundred jin of millet and corn, and a 470-yuan surge in the price of every tael of pure gold (from 450 yuan per tael to 920 yuan per tael), which is a rare and crazy rise in recent years.

The Chinese and Japanese authorities in Beiping have also tried to find ways to save the food shortage, but the food shortage in Beiping is not only due to hoarding by unscrupulous merchants, but also due to the blockage of sources. Therefore, they are planning in many ways. The authorities had already prepared a rationing method (i.e., distributing grain according to the number of people), but it was suspended because the food reserves in Beiping were too low and the sources were not sustained. If food prices continue to rise wildly, a city-wide food rationing must be held. In addition, not only is there a panic about food, but also edible oil, soy sauce, and white sugar, which are known to have abundant stocks, are also feeling the shortage. In general, it is deeply felt that Beiping will soon be like the citizens of Shanghai, who will have to be familiar with the flavor of squeezing rice, oil, and sugar.

Fifth, the Education Sector's Increase Production Movement

The education sector in North China, especially in Beiping, has been busy strengthening public security in the past two or three years. Since the declaration of war, it has focused its goal on "increasing production education." The Education Department recently issued a notice to all schools in North China to uniformly add agricultural courses, open agricultural training centers and agricultural fields, and students at all levels must participate in agricultural labor. This is the Education Department's plan to mobilize millions of students in North China to engage in agricultural production.

The first month of the declaration of war in North China is roughly as described above. Let's see what happens in the second month!

### Authorities Strictly Prohibit Exceeding Price Limits, Four Major Silver Shops Sealed Up, Because of Raising the Listed Price of Jewelry, The Investigation and Sealing Up of Illegal Silver Shops will Continue from Today

Since the authorities issued a formal announcement on the 24th of last month, limiting the selling price of all goods to the price set on January 23rd, the reporter has learned that the authorities have implemented emergency measures and are strictly investigating businesses that violate the rules. It has been found that gold bars, which are also subject to price limits by the authorities at 3,000 yuan per tael, are still being traded among unscrupulous merchants in defiance of the law and in blatant violation of the price limits. Starting from Lunar New Year's Eve, the price was repeatedly increased on the black market to as much as 3,900 yuan per tael, and they were still unwilling to sell. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, the four shops on Nanjing Road - Datong, Tianbao, Fang Jiuxia, Laofengxiang, and Xinfengxiang - were sealed up. The seals were inscribed with the words: "This shop has violated the Bureau's emergency regulations and is hereby ordered to cease business immediately. If any citizens discover hoarding, illegal profiteering, or other violations of the Bureau's regulations, they should report them to the Bureau for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law. By order, Shanghai Municipal Council." Upon hearing this news, other silver shops in the two concessions closed their doors and suspended business one after another.

Request to Lift the Sealing

After the four major silver shops were sealed up, the Silver Shop Guild held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to send representatives to petition the authorities, stating the circumstances of jewelry sales and requesting that the sealing be lifted to maintain business, and that they would absolutely comply with the authorities' price limits for buying and selling. As for gold bar transactions, they had already been ordered to stop, and the black market for gold had also ceased operations. It is said that the authorities have accepted the request, so the sealed silver shops are expected to reopen for business from today. As for the price of jewelry, it is currently under review, and before a new price limit is set, the original price limit of 3,000 yuan per tael must be strictly observed, and violators will be severely investigated to maintain the authority of the authorities' laws and regulations.

Mr. Sheng's Remarks

In order to understand the truth, the reporter specially visited Mr. Sheng Yudu, Assistant to the Director-General of the Municipal Council. According to him, in order to stabilize people's livelihood, the authorities have imposed price limits on various industries and goods, especially gold bars, because the rise and fall of gold prices affect all industries. The price limit for gold bars has been assessed by the Materials Control Department at 3,000 yuan per tael. Initially, all silver shops were able to comply with the price limit for transactions, but in recent weeks, the situation has suddenly changed, with each other raising market prices and engaging in black market sales, reaching as much as 3,900 yuan per tael. The authorities have repeatedly warned against this, but these people have turned a deaf ear, which is very regrettable. Although the silver shop industry has sent representatives to the Bureau to express their grievances and request a change in the price limit, and the authorities are considering it, the industry rashly and automatically raised black market prices, so the authorities had no choice but to take severe measures, seal them up, and impose fines as a warning. Even if they are reopened in the future, they must still maintain the price limit of 3,000 yuan per tael. As for the other silver shops in the two concessions, some of them have violated the price limit and will continue to be sealed up and punished from today, he said.

### Adding Place Names to Stamps Not Yet Confirmed

In addition to North China and Guangdong, where place names have already been added to domestic stamps, it has been said that postal authorities will also add place names to stamps sold in the postal districts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei to distinguish them. This principle has been confirmed, but the implementation date has been repeatedly postponed. Recently, it has been learned that the postal authorities are reconsidering the above measures, so whether or not they will be implemented is uncertain.

### Nine New Member Banks Join the Banking Association

In order to stabilize finance, the Ministry of Finance, after promulgating the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions and the Implementing Rules, first handled the registration of financial institutions (banks and money shops), established an office to inspect financial affairs to inspect the business of financial institutions, and stipulated that all banks and money shops opening for business must join group organizations. As a result, the number of banks and money shops joining the banking and money shop guilds as members has increased in recent years. It has been learned that since this year, the members who joined the Banking Association in January include Dahua, Yongming, and China Agricultural Development, and the banks that joined the Association in February include Huatai, Huizhong, Zhenye, Xinhua, Taihexing, and Donghua. Currently, the number of members of the Banking Association has increased to 107.

### Mr. Kodama Kenji Went to Beijing Yesterday to Discuss Economic Policies with Military and Political Figures

Mr. Kodama Kenji, president of the Central China Revitalization Company, who came to Shanghai from Tokyo on the 16th of last month to handle the merger and reorganization of Japanese national policy companies in Central China, left Shanghai for Nanjing yesterday to consult with senior figures in the financial community. It has been learned that Mr. Kodama has had repeated discussions with Chinese and Japanese military, political, and diplomatic figures in Shanghai since his arrival. This trip to Beijing is to finalize the final decision with the highest authorities, with particular attention to economic issues such as the merger and allocation of Chinese and Japanese capital.

### The 27th Ration of Household Rice Decided to Increase by Half a Sheng, A Total of One and a Half Sheng of White Rice or Brown Rice and One Sheng of Broken Rice

After the authorities implemented the rationing of food to Shanghai citizens, the Japanese authorities are responsible for finding ways to dredge the source of food, which is distributed by the concession authorities to the contracted rice shops, and sold with rice purchase certificates and flour purchase certificates.

The First Batch of Foreign Rice Has Arrived in Shanghai

Foreign rice has now been ordered from Bangkok, Vietnam, and other places. The first batch of foreign rice from Bangkok has arrived in Shanghai, and a huge amount of rice will continue to be shipped in to help. As for the purchase of domestic rice from various production areas, it has been shipped to Shanghai in an endless stream, so the rice reserves in Shanghai are indeed more abundant than before. At the same time, the flour produced by various factories in Central China will be supplied as much as possible for the rationing of people's livelihood. Therefore, in the future, sufficient rations will be given according to the legitimate needs of the food households. Regarding the 27th ration of household food, the amount of whole rice, broken rice, and flour on the purchase orders received by the contracted rice shops is the same as in this period. Recently, the authorities said that the contracted rice shops had surplus rice and flour, which should be used as the shop's reserves in accordance with the contract, and the authorities would often send people to investigate. In case of shortages, a fine of ten times the value of the shortage would be imposed. Recently, the Municipal Council thought that the amount of broken rice stored by the rice shops was relatively large.

### Broken Rice Supplemented for Distribution in Each Shop

Therefore, in addition to distributing the same amount of rice and grain as in this period, the broken rice stored in each shop will be supplemented for distribution, with a total amount of one and a half sheng of white rice or brown rice and one sheng of broken rice, totaling two and a half sheng, and the amount of flour distributed will remain unchanged.

The Last Day for This Period's Household Rice

Here is the notice issued by the Municipal Council: Rice purchase certificate and flour purchase certificate No. 26 are allowed to be used until the 17th of this month. They will be invalid after the expiration date. From the 19th to the 27th of this month, the rice shops and the rice sales offices of the Bureau will only sell rice and flour based on the No. 27 certificate. At that time, the rice shops with the registered number on the certificate will distribute one and a half sheng of white rice or brown rice and one sheng of broken rice for each rice purchase certificate, with a total selling price of six yuan and three jiao. Each flour purchase certificate will be used to distribute one jin and twelve liang of flour, with a selling price of three yuan and eight jiao and five fen. Also, the rice shops and the rice sales offices of the Bureau will stop selling for one day on the 28th of this month.

The Rationing of Grain in the Southern City in the First Ten Days of This Month Started Universally Yesterday

The Municipal Bureau has completed the distribution of grain and rice for the first ten days of this month in the urban area, and the bureaus have ordered the public offices to pay and release the rice one after another. Each person is allocated two sheng of japonica rice per ten days, with a selling price of five yuan and one jiao.

The rationing of grain in the southern city area started universally yesterday, and the districts of Pudong, Huxi, and Zhabei will also start rationing within days. According to a spokesman for the Grain Management Bureau, the rationing of grain this month was delayed due to personnel changes in the Grain Bureau. Director Zhang is issuing instructions to all departments under his jurisdiction to do everything possible to ensure that the rationing of grain in each district can start on schedule, and that it should not be delayed unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, the relevant departments of the Grain Bureau are actively preparing for the rationing of grain in the middle ten days of this month.

### Police Trained in the Cleared Areas Returned to Their Original Posts Yesterday

In order to promote the strength of the police in the cleared areas to maintain local public security, the Municipal Police Bureau specially transferred more than 70 outstanding police officers from the area to hold a special training class at the Pudong Police Training Institute, to provide them with special training and enhance their police knowledge. As the training period has expired, a graduation ceremony was held a few days ago. The police officers who received special training returned to their original posts yesterday morning to use what they have learned to exert their police responsibilities and effectiveness, and to consolidate the public security in the cleared areas.

### Japanese Embassy Spokesman Hirota's Talk

Domei News Agency Shanghai - At a regular press conference on Tuesday, Hirota, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, criticized President Roosevelt's speech, saying that the Axis powers are determined to build a new type of country, so that the next century will not only have a new domestic relationship, but also a readjusted international relationship. Hirota strongly refuted Roosevelt's claim that the Allied powers are the protectors of modern culture and that the Axis powers are barbaric countries, saying that the Axis powers will never tolerate the Allied powers' war aims and solemnly declared, "We must fight to the end to smash this organization."

### Photography for Citizen Certificates Not Allowed to Increase Prices

The City Government has not approved the request of the Shanghai Photography Industry Association to change the selling price to three yuan for six photos from New Year's Day of the 32nd year, which was submitted by the police bureau for record, because the majority of the people in the urban area are poor, and how can the prices be allowed to rise in the midst of suppressing prices? The police bureau has been ordered to inform them.

### Mr. Chen Jicheng, Ambassador to Manchukuo, Hosted a Tea Party Yesterday for All Circles, with Over Three Hundred Chinese and Foreign Guests Attending, an Unprecedented Occasion

Mr. Chen Jicheng, State Councilor of the National Government and concurrently the Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Manchukuo, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. He has been extremely busy handling various official matters. Chinese and foreign newspapers have praised him as a prominent figure in finance and education. It is expected that Sino-Manchukuo relations will have further contact and the Japan-Manchukuo-China axis will be further cemented. Amidst the calls for the revival of China and the defense of East Asia, Mr. Chen's ambassadorship to Manchukuo is seen as being entrusted with a particularly great mission. Many people have initiated celebrations and farewells. However, Mr. Chen, in line with the Central Government's promotion of the New Life Movement and advocacy of frugality, has politely declined these offers. However, to express his farewell to various circles in Shanghai and to exchange views, he held a grand tea party yesterday afternoon from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM on the 14th floor of the International Hotel at the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse, inviting people from all walks of life. The scene was bustling with activity, an unprecedented event. Details are recorded as follows:

Attendees

The tea party began promptly at 4:00 PM. Ambassador Chen, dressed in formal attire, personally hosted the reception, assisted by Sun Yucai, Xie Zhongfu, Hu Shouqi, Sun Lifu, Chen Zhonghang, and Chen Yiyi, among others. Chinese government officials in attendance included Minister Chu Minyi, State Councilor Zhao Zhengping, Economic Affairs Committee member Huang Xianggu, various bureau chiefs of the municipal government, and directors of various National Government offices in Shanghai. Leaders from various sectors included Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Pei Yunqing, Wang Boyun, Shen Siliang, Xu Jianping, Yang Xinghua, Xu Guanqun, Zhou Bangjun, Xie Xiaochu, Chen Bin, Xu Liqiu, Pan Da, Chen Riping, and others. Foreign officials included Minister Tientsin Yano, the British Consul-General, Nagai, Iwai, Tasei, Chiyo, Colonel Takase, as well as ministers and consuls from various countries' embassies and legations, Inspector General of the Public Works Department Du Zheng, French Police Chief Sarri, and French Consul-General Magre, among others, totaling over three hundred people. Champagne and refreshments were served, and attendees exchanged greetings of health and well-being in an atmosphere of harmony and friendship. The scene was rare, symbolizing that Mr. Chen's mission will be completed successfully and swiftly.

Mr. Chen's Remarks

A reporter from the Central News Agency, recognizing the great significance of Ambassador Chen's mission, paid a special visit to the International Hotel to interview him and request a statement. Mr. Chen, despite his busy schedule, granted the interview, stating that after being appointed by the National Government as the Ambassador of the Republic of China to Manchukuo, he immediately issued a brief statement. In the future, he will uphold national policies and, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, strive for closer cooperation between China and Manchukuo and the completion of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, having lived in Shanghai for thirty years, he feels deeply sentimental about his departure. Shanghai has been invaded by British and American imperialism, suffering humiliation for a century, which everyone deeply resents. Having worked in the economic and educational sectors, he has personally experienced the economic and cultural aggression of Britain and America. Now, thanks to our friendly nation Japan's dedication to the Greater East Asia War, the aggressive forces of Britain and America are being destroyed, and the concessions will also be recovered. From now on, Shanghai will regain its freedom, and all undertakings of revival and construction are flourishing. Whenever he thinks of this, he feels infinitely attached to Shanghai, his second home. He sincerely hopes that friends from all walks of life will stay in touch so that he can get their guidance and suggestions. Since returning to the capital, he has been constantly busy, and he is going on this mission with the determination to work hard and complete it successfully. Ambassador Chen left for Nanjing by night train that evening due to important official duties.

### Restaurants and Tofu Shops in the French Concession Allowed to Maintain Regular Business Hours, Exempted from "Early Closing" Restrictions

The French Concession authorities previously ordered all businesses within the concession to close at 8:00 PM every evening to conserve electricity. It has been learned that the French authorities, in consideration of practical needs, have specially allowed restaurants and tofu shops to extend their business hours as usual.

### Mortgage Deeds Previously Pledged to Banks and Firms to be Released from Enemy Asset Status, with Transferred and Replaced Japanese Deeds Permitted as Continued Collateral

Banks and firms in the silver and money industries are permitted to accept mortgage deeds that have been released from enemy asset status. The United Banking Association and Money Trade Reserve are allowing member banks and firms to use these deeds as collateral for borrowing. Real estate transactions have resumed, which helps the overall financial situation, increases market activity, and facilitates the flow of capital. A reporter learned from the silver and money industries yesterday that for pledge items previously handled by various banks and firms, except for foreign firms in neutral countries registered with neutral consulates, all deeds registered as enemy assets of the British and American systems have been applied for and released from enemy asset status by the banks and firms and replaced with Japanese registry deeds. Therefore, all pledged deeds have been completely transferred. Furthermore, deeds that have been transferred and replaced with Japanese registry deeds are permitted to continue as collateral. However, for deeds that have not been transferred, each household will apply for release through the relevant bank or firm. Deeds that have not been approved for release will require debtors to expedite the process or replace them with other collateral.

### Jianghai Customs Cracks Down on Smuggling, Over One Hundred Cases Solved, Smuggled Goods Confiscated or Fines Imposed

To promptly eradicate the evil practice of smuggling, the Jianghai Customs previously ordered all customs police to strictly enforce anti-smuggling measures. Any goods without proper documentation attempting to be transported out of the country would be treated as smuggled goods. The customs police or related personnel would detain the goods and hand them over to customs for investigation and punishment according to law. Since the customs initiated these rigorous measures a month ago, over one hundred cases of smuggled goods have been seized. Depending on the severity of the offense, fines are imposed, or the entire consignment is confiscated. It was learned from the Anti-Smuggling Section of the General Affairs Department of the Customs that generally, merchants were now wary of the strict anti-smuggling measures, so the number of cases had decreased. However, the Customs authorities are determined to uphold their original intention and make unremitting efforts to eliminate smuggling completely. It was also learned that a large batch of smuggled goods previously detained by the Customs has been released after the owners paid the fines.

### The Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Exceeds 400,000 Yuan, University and Industrial Scholarships to be Paid Out Today, Students Receiving Aid Expected to Submit Monthly Academic Reports

The approved lists of the fourth session of the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, both university and industrial groups, have been published in the newspaper. It is now scheduled for the scholarships to be distributed today. Students are requested to bring their registration certificates and seals to the office to receive their funds. Over 8,000 yuan in scholarships was received yesterday, which is deeply appreciated. The total amount of scholarships currently available exceeds 400,000 yuan. The number of scholarships to be distributed in this session will be announced as soon as the procedures are completed. However, scholarship work still needs to progress. After the scholarships for this session have been paid out, the staff will send personnel to visit the various schools at any time to find out about the academic situation of the students, obtain reports, and carefully evaluate them, in order to help the students. Students are expected to submit a monthly report of their homework so that the best can be selected for publication, to help encourage and inspire them, and to live up to the expectations of the enthusiastic donors.

Letters from Mr. Zhou and Mr. Bao

We received a letter from Mr. Zhou, whose name is withheld, which reads: "This year marks the 25th anniversary of my stay in Shanghai. My friends in the industry have offered lavish celebrations, which I have resolutely declined repeatedly. I am ashamed of my inadequacy and lack of achievements. At a time when the nation is facing difficulties and the people are suffering, how can I bear to indulge in extravagance and increase my guilt? I respectfully offer a modest amount as a scholarship fund and small loan fund, hoping to benefit others and make amends for my past. I hope you will publish the receipts for distribution. Sincerely, Zhou (anonymous), dated February 15th, 32nd year of the Republic, enclosing 2,940 yuan, which I have supplemented with 1,500 yuan, totaling 4,440 yuan."

Also, a letter came from Mr. Bao Xinchu, which we quote in part below: "Respectfully, the 9th of this month (i.e., the 5th day of the first lunar month) marks the anniversary of the passing of my late wife, Ms. Ma Banghua. I originally intended to hold Buddhist ceremonies at a temple to pray for her soul. However, in view of the enthusiasm and determination of your newspaper's scholarship fund, I am deeply impressed and admire it. Therefore, I have decided to donate the 1,000 yuan that would have been spent on the ceremonies to your newspaper's scholarship fund, which I believe will be supported by all those who are wise. Sincerely, Bao Xinchu."

### Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office Establishes People's Patriotic Association, Absorbing Patriotic Organizations of Japanese Residents in Central China, Minister Tientsin Appointed as Chairman

The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy has now decided to establish a special committee to coordinate the patriotic service activities of Japanese residents in the Central China region under the jurisdiction of the Minister in Shanghai. The committee is tentatively named the "People's Patriotic Association," with Minister Tientsin appointed as chairman and the commander of the Shanghai Naval Landing Forces as advisor. The executive committee will be headed by Shanghai Japanese Consul-General Yano, and the president of the Central China Development Company, Mr. Kodama, will also be included. The committee will absorb existing patriotic organizations of Japanese residents in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, such as the Shanghai All-Out Patriotic Association, the Asia Development Association, and the newly established Central China Industrial Co-prosperity Association.

### English Classes Canceled in Public Elementary Schools, Tuition Increased by 20%

The second semester of the 31st year of the Republic for the Chinese public schools established by the Shanghai Municipal Council began simultaneously on the 12th of this month. Tuition fees for the public schools have increased slightly this semester, with an average increase of 20%. However, the tuition fees vary from school to school. Generally, the tuition fee for a middle school semester is about 150 yuan, while for elementary schools it is around 72 yuan, which is much lower than ordinary private primary and secondary schools. According to reliable sources, starting this semester, English classes in all Chinese elementary schools of the Shanghai Municipal Council, whether advanced or elementary, have been ordered to be canceled. The hours previously used to teach English will be used to teach Japanese. The amount of English taught in the middle schools will also be reduced, while the time allocated to Japanese will be increased. The Kezhi Middle School, established by the Shanghai Municipal Council, was originally located on Great Western Road. This semester, it has been moved into the Yucai Public School on Shanhai Pass Road, where classes will continue as usual.

### Universally Open the Iron Gates in Nanshi

— Zhu Chaoran

The Nanshi area of Shanghai has been desolate since the "August 13th" Incident, with nine out of ten houses empty. Although it has gradually recovered its prosperity, it is limited to the Laoximen and Nine Acres areas. Other areas remain like small towns in the countryside.

Any resident of Nanshi knows that the reason for this is the failure to universally open the iron gates built in the Hua-French boundary area (Minguo Road). As a result, storefronts on Minguo Road remain closed, and there are few pedestrians. Its desolate state is rare in Shanghai.

However, Dongmen Road near the Sixteen Pu, the Lao Beimenkou, the Xinjiao Street intersection, the Laoximen of Nanyang Bridge, and Xujiahui are all bustling with activity and commercial prosperity like the concessions because the iron gates at the boundaries there have been opened.

It is thought that the French Concession authorities' closure of the iron gates at the boundaries has been in place for nearly six years since the incident. The public has repeatedly requested their universal opening, but it has not yet been approved. Recently, the situation has worsened. The section of Minguo Road along the French Concession from Lao Beimenkou to Xin Beimenkou is piled with dirty soil, reaching seven or eight feet high, stretching like an earthen mountain. The intention is incomprehensible.

The authorities built these boundaries at the time of the "August 13th" Incident because of the war, in order to ensure the security of the concession. After the war moved west, it was because the status of the concession and the Chinese area were completely different, so there was still a reason not to open them at this time; but since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the formal participation of the National Government in the war today, the concessions and the Chinese area have long been integrated. Although the French Concession is an exception, it has long been tacitly understood in spirit. Therefore, there should no longer be this unreasonable blockade policy to prevent the prosperity of Nanshi, which also hinders the restoration of the entire Shanghai urban area. The 300,000 residents of Nanshi hope for a clear explanation.

### Improving Traffic on Macheng Road

— Yu Wen

Last September, the Shanghai Municipal Council commissioned a foreign firm (Belgian?) to repair the ditches on Macheng Road. The project was originally scheduled to be completed in three weeks, but it has been over four months and it is still not finished. The project is indeed large, but it is undeniable that the workers are not working hard to complete it.

Macheng Road is a major transportation route, the only way from the central concession to the northwest area. Tram lines 16, 19, and 21 run through it, and these three tram lines are extremely crowded, mostly with workers. Since the traffic was cut off, the trams stop abruptly at Sanbanqiao Xinqiao, and passengers must walk over a bumpy and uneven road for more than half a mile before they can wait for the tram again on the northern section of Macheng Road to go north, which is extremely inconvenient, especially on rainy days when it is difficult to walk because the unpaved road is muddy. At night, people often fall and get injured, and not only is there the trouble of walking and changing trams halfway, but passengers also have to pay more for the trip. Once any unfortunate event occurs, ambulances cannot enter, let alone fire trucks. There is a great wish for public order and safety. For this reason, the Municipal Council should urge the workers to complete the work on time and not deliberately delay it.

Along the river on Macheng Road, there is a lot of garbage piled up like mountains, stretching for dozens of feet, creating a spectacle. A strange stench wafts in the air. A similar situation exists in the Tokyo Road area. Although the transition from spring to winter will not cause an epidemic, it is still detrimental to hygiene, and the higher it is piled, the more difficult it is to clear. There are also places where it falls and obstructs traffic. It is unknown why the contractor responsible for transporting the garbage does not use boats to transport it to the countryside to be used as fertilizer but instead dumps it on Macheng Road. It is hoped that the authorities will thoroughly investigate this matter to emphasize hygiene.

### Cotton Cloth, Leather Shoes, and Leather to Implement Rationing System

Managed by a Special Department of the Trade Association, Aiming to Control the Source of Goods to Ensure Constant Supply. According to well-informed sources in the industrial and commercial sectors, items such as cloth from wooden weaving factories, cotton cloth, leather shoes, and leather in this city have been planned by trade associations related to these goods to adopt a rationing system. This measure was not initiated by any high-level authorities, but rather by a group of shop owners for the convenience of promoting their own business, mutually agreed upon and unanimously advocated. It is learned that the implementation steps are to first urge stores wishing to participate in the rationing to register with the association, and then the registered stores will raise funds to establish a rationing department within the relevant association to specialize in this matter.

Five Tasks of the Rationing Department

The rationing department is similar to a company organization, and participating stores must be able to bear unlimited liability. Once formally established, it will generally carry out the following tasks: (1) Negotiate with the relevant goods control authorities to control the source of goods, so that the raw materials or finished products of these items can maintain a constant supply without fear of interruption. (2) Register all the inventory of these items in Shanghai to prevent merchants from hoarding and selling at high prices. (3) Regularly and periodically allocate appropriate amounts of raw materials or finished products fairly to the relevant stores. (4) Negotiate with the authorities to facilitate the legal transportation of goods, and jointly expand business to other cities. (5) Establish a separate evaluation committee to evaluate prices in accordance with the established policies of the authorities, and order the affiliated industries to comply. Violators will be subject to suspension of rationing.

Leather Shoe Prices to be Classified and Approved

It is also learned that leather shoe prices have been soaring in the past. For example, the black market price of first-class textured leather, such as the leather used to make leather shoe soles, has reached about 110 yuan per pound. In order to lower retail prices and reduce manufacturing costs, the concession authorities ordered all wholesalers and manufacturers in Shanghai not to exceed the selling prices of January 23 this year, and ordered them to submit their cost and selling price lists for review. Therefore, the leather shoe industry has agreed on the prices of various styles of men's and women's shoes, with 33 types of men's shoes and 30 types of women's shoes, each type divided into special, first, second, third, fourth, and fifth grades, totaling more than 300 types. The cost and selling price lists were submitted to the Goods Control Department of the Public and Common Concession Bureau on the 12th of this month for review and approval, and the prices will be fixed and announced soon.

### Factory Cylinder Explodes, Six Injured

A factory room at No. 68 Tokyo Road in Shanghai West, the Hezhong Electric Welding Factory, had a cylinder containing ammonia. Yesterday afternoon at about 5 o'clock, the cylinder exploded suddenly due to overheating, with a thunderous sound. Six workers were injured and fell to the ground. Wang Xiaohua, 25 years old, from Dinghai, suffered severe burns to the face and feet; Jiang Bingsheng, 17 years old, from Haimen, injured his face; Pan Zhengrong, 27 years old, from Nanjing, injured his face; Zhou Guoliang, 17 years old, from Wuxi; Li Mingen, 19 years old, from Ningbo; and Yu Huaiyu, 31 years old, from Ningbo, all suffered burns to their arms and faces. After the incident, the factory urgently called an ambulance to the scene and sent the injured to Baolong Hospital for treatment.

### Municipal Council Forbids Sale of Pufferfish

The Shanghai Municipal Council has recently issued Notification No. 6263, stating that the sale of pufferfish within the Public Concession is prohibited unless approved. Those approved to sell and their customers must burn the discarded parts of the pufferfish or send them to the nearest sanitary branch for disposal, and must not throw them into the garbage dump or other places at will, so as to prevent beggars from picking them up and using them as food, which would lead to danger. Violators will be severely punished.

### Edible Oil Office Actively Seeks Ways to Procure Goods, Oil Shortage Will Soon Be Eliminated

Retail oil stores in the two concessions have not sold oil since the Lunar New Year. However, according to reporters, the edible oil wholesalers have already submitted a plan for rationing oil based on population size to the authorities for approval last month. However, it is learned that the amount of edible oil stored in this city is not sufficient to fully meet the demand. Therefore, oil companies are actively seeking ways to procure goods. It is said that the twelve oil factories affiliated with the China Central Oil Company have been processing soybeans day and night since a large shipment of soybeans arrived from Dalian. It is expected that after this batch of edible oil is produced, the oil shortage in this city will be eliminated.

### A Tragic Incident of a Shell Explosion Occurred at the Xiaomubiao in Longhua, Three Boys Were Injured While Playing with Shells, Two More Shells Were Found and Transported to the Bureau for Storage

Yesterday afternoon at around 4 p.m., a tragic incident of a shell explosion occurred near the Xiaomubiao on Longhua Road, and three boys were seriously injured on the spot. The details were learned by this newspaper's reporter and are recorded below:

After School, Playing in a Wasteland

Zhang Baihua (14 years old), son of Zhang Lucai, a local resident of No. 25 Zhangjiazhai, Longhua, as well as Hu Anqing (15 years old), son of Hu Zhangshi, and Zhang Weiren (15 years old), son of Zhang Yingfeng, went to play in the wasteland near Xiaomubiao on Longhua Road after school as usual at around 4 p.m. yesterday.

Shell Explodes, Suffering Serious Injuries

Unexpectedly, the three boys picked up a long shell. Not knowing the danger, they were overjoyed and played with it. It accidentally slipped from their hands and fell to the ground, suddenly exploding with a deafening sound. Shrapnel flew everywhere, causing Zhang Baihua, Hu Anqing, and Zhang Weiren to be wounded all over their bodies.

The Three Injured Children Were Taken to the Hospital

After the incident, Yang Genhai, the son of the seventh Bao head of the area, happened to see it, so he urgently reported the situation to the parents of the three boys. The parents were shocked to hear the news and immediately rushed to the scene, seeing the three children lying in pools of blood, barely breathing and unable to speak. They then tried their best to send the three injured boys to Zhongshan Hospital on Xietu Road for treatment. It is said that the injuries were quite serious, and their lives were in danger.

Two Shells Were Also Recovered

At the same time, the police authorities in charge of the area, upon hearing the report, also sent personnel to investigate. As a result, in addition to recovering a shell near the bamboo fence of the vegetable garden in the courtyard of a resident named Yin Zhaodi near the scene, they also found a shell in a pile of rubble, both of which were long and cylindrical. Upon careful inspection, it was found that they had rusted heavily due to the passage of time. They were transported to the headquarters for storage. It is believed that these shells fell into the brick and tile piles during the previous Shanghai war.

### The School Building Maintenance Association Hosts the Press, Appealing for Social Sympathy to Maintain Students' Studies

The Shanghai Middle and Elementary School Building Maintenance Movement Committee hosted the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department and members of the press at the Jinmen Hotel yesterday afternoon. Over fifty people attended, including Director Feng of the Propaganda Department Office and reporters from newspapers and news agencies.

Chairman Reports

First, Wang Yunyou, the representative of the chairman of the committee, reported on the purpose of the meeting and the progress of the school building maintenance movement, saying that the inability of middle and elementary schools in the city to start classes due to being forced to move by school building owners is becoming increasingly serious. Most owners are appealing to the law in such cases, so that the schools lose their cases. Recently, Shicheng Middle School has encountered a bad fate, and the number of schools involved in school building disputes is increasing. Because 98% of the city's more than 700 middle and elementary schools rent their buildings from owners. The situation is serious, and it will affect education in the city, with more than 200,000 students at risk of dropping out of school, and more than 10,000 teachers and staff at risk of unemployment. Although we have repeatedly sought assistance from all relevant parties, there have been no practical measures taken. Therefore, we urgently need to appeal for social sympathy, mobilize public opinion, and awaken the conscience of the owners to reduce the pressure on the schools and enable hundreds of schools in the city to continue to maintain students' studies.

Director Feng Speaks

After the chairman's report, Director Feng of the Propaganda Department spoke, saying that he deeply sympathizes with colleagues in the education sector who have been struggling in difficult situations to cultivate knowledgeable young people for several years. Education is a major element of national strength, and the government should maintain it. In the future, the press and the Propaganda Department will do their best to promote public awareness. Finally, representatives of the press spoke one after another, expressing their sympathy for the matter.

### Security Command Headquarters Detention Center Establishes Inmate Work Unit, Preparations Begin

The detention center of the Military Law Department of this city's Security Command Headquarters houses over 360 inmates. Following the implementation of the first phase of the "Purification Campaign" in Shanghai, more than 140 cases handled by the Fourth Division of the Purification Committee have also been transferred to the detention center. Recently, Mr. Li Shiyu, the Director of the Military Law Department, recognizing that inmates have few opportunities for activity while detained, which is detrimental to their health, has specially established an inmate work unit. Work will be assigned to each inmate, allowing them to engage in production and regulate their mental state. We have learned that since preparations began, everything is in order. Sixty machines have been purchased to produce knitted goods such as towels. Once the results are satisfactory, the operation will be expanded. However, raw materials such as cotton yarn are controlled items, and most merchants are hoarding and unwilling to sell. After dispatching personnel to exhaust all means, only a small amount for initial use was purchased. In the future, the department will strive to obtain raw materials to ensure that the operation is not affected.

### Local Transportation Trade Associations Should Establish Joint Business Offices to Coordinate with Japanese Transportation Organizations to Promote Water and Land Transportation Services in Various Regions

Since the outbreak of the incident, transportation services in and around Beijing, Shanghai, and other regions have gradually recovered, but the organizational structure is still quite chaotic. At the same time, various Japanese transportation organizations, such as Central China Railway, Central China Shipping, Central China Transportation, and Inland River Shipping companies, have emerged and are expanding their businesses alongside local Chinese transportation companies. Each operates independently, with no coordination. Therefore, the promotion of transportation services has not been rationalized. Our reporter has learned that the relevant authorities, to improve local transportation services and rationalize the flow of goods, have issued a "Outline for the Establishment of Joint Business Offices by Local Transportation Industries," instructing local transportation trade associations to follow it and establish joint business offices. Using the collective strength of the transportation industry to coordinate with Japanese transportation companies, they will jointly operate transportation services. The outline is as follows:

Purpose

(1) To promote water and land transport business in Central China with companies such as China Merchant Steam Navigation, Central China Railway, Central China Transportation, and Inland River Shipping; (2) To improve inter-regional transportation services and enable rational development; (3) To reduce competition and friction among businesses and promote harmony and coordination; (4) To reduce unnecessary expenses among businesses and increase profits; (5) To coordinate with local Chinese transportation companies and firms to fairly and appropriately allocate business; (6) To represent local Chinese transportation companies and firms in external liaison.

### Controlled Transport and Controlled Oils - Annual Report of the Transportation Committee (Continued from the 14th)

On December 18th and 19th of the same year, this bureau also issued notices to purchase gasoline, fuel oil, diesel, and kerosene. Gasoline was priced at $5.20 per gallon, and the other three items were purchased at the original price paid to the oil companies by the respective owners. The transfer of kerosene was also restricted. On December 26th, a notice was published, ordering those who had oil in storage to report the reasons why their stored oil should not be purchased for critical use.

At the beginning of last year, this bureau conducted an investigation into the inventory of alcohol and the needs of normal users. On January 6th, a notice was issued to restrict the transfer of alcohol, etc. Subsequently, an investigation was conducted into the needs for fuel oil and diesel.

In March of last year, this bureau investigated the inventory and needs of mineral oil in the industrial sector, and the Controlled Transportation Committee, together with the Industrial and Social Affairs Bureau, organized the registration of industrial oil and crude oil. Fifteen registration forms were received. On March 30th, this bureau issued another notice, stating that from April 1st, the transfer of various mineral oils would not be permitted without a formal permit issued by the Japanese authorities.

All unnecessary motorcycles and vehicles have been reduced. At the same time, a rationing system was implemented for the gasoline, kerosene, alcohol, crude oil, etc., needed by various bureaus within this bureau. This rationing method was implemented for public utility companies for several months. Alcohol was also supplied to the Health Department and major hospitals according to the rationed quantity. As for the gasoline needed by the post office and the courts, it was also rationed appropriately.

Controlled Transport

In December of the previous year, this bureau, recognizing that gasoline reserves were limited, immediately strictly restricted the use of motorcycles and vehicles to save gasoline. The use of motorcycles was limited to transporting a small number of citizens and transporting essential goods. Therefore, on December 9th of the same year, the transport of goods by motorcycle truck was prohibited, except for those who had obtained a transfer permit from the Price Control Committee. At the same time, the owners of motorcycle trucks were ordered to register their vehicles and gasoline supply with this bureau. On December 13th, the issuance of food transport permits was implemented, stipulating that motorcycle trucks were only allowed to transport rice, flour, and other grains. As for motorcycles, they were required to display a triangular permit to be allowed to operate; otherwise, their use was prohibited.

On December 18th of the same year, this bureau stipulated the maximum freight rate for transporting rice and flour, namely, $2 per bag of rice and 50 cents per bag of flour. On December 22nd, a notice was issued to organize a truck joint business office to transport essential goods at the prescribed freight rate. Later, recognizing that handcarts could replace trucks, the truck joint business office was deemed unnecessary.

On December 31st of the same year, this bureau issued a notice, ordering car owners with triangular permits not to use their vehicles for entertainment or private convenience. On January 5th of last year, a notice was issued to all car owners, stating that if vehicles were driven without a triangular permit, they would be confiscated upon discovery.

On October 8th of last year, this bureau published a notice, permitting taxis burning gasoline substitutes to operate within the boundary for essential uses. Regarding the number of licenses for such cars, the municipal authorities of the three districts consulted and agreed that this bureau would issue 200 licenses, and the French Concession Public Works Department and the municipal government would each issue 100 licenses.

The car triangular permits issued by this bureau were signed by the police department. The validity period was usually at most two months per term. Before each renewal, a joint committee organized by the municipal authorities of the three districts discussed and revised the methods to prevent malpractices and reduce all unnecessary military vehicles.

Fuel Supply

Given the shortage of gasoline supply, the search for substitutes was necessary. This was a technical problem that was extremely difficult to solve. The Controlled Transportation Committee established a subcommittee on December 17th of the previous year, named the Fuel Substitute Subcommittee. The members of the committee were all technical experts. Their task was to study substitutes for gasoline, diesel, etc., and to cooperate with similar committees of the French Concession Public Works Department to exchange ideas.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Regular Budget Increases by Over 80 Million Yuan, Most Revenue Items are Underestimated to Prevent Potential Shortfalls in Taxes

(12) Sales Tax on Goods: The sales tax rate remains at 2% this year. The total annual revenue is estimated at 42,000,000 yuan. This figure is underestimated.

(13) Hotel and Restaurant Bill Tax: This item is estimated at 36,000,000 yuan for the current year, which is also underestimated. The tax rate remains at 10%, the same as last year.

(14) Telephone Tax: This item is listed as 4,428,000 yuan. There is no change in the tax rate.

(15) Stock Exchange Business Tax: This business tax is tentatively listed at 1,000 yuan this year, which is a nominal amount, as the scope of permitted stock exchange operations has not yet been determined.

(16) Miscellaneous Income: The source of this revenue is the sale of used goods and scrap metal. 1,435,000 yuan is tentatively listed for this year.

### Summary of Various Regular Expenditures

(1) Fire Department: The Fire Department's expenses for this year are listed as 7,457,230 yuan, of which approximately 883,000 yuan is allocated for the replacement of old hoses.

(2) Police Department: The estimated expenses for all parts of the Police Department this year are estimated to total 100,481,750 yuan, an increase of 44,627,470 yuan over the previous year's budget. The increase in various office expenses is the main reason for the increase in this year's budget. The budget for all material needs has not been extravagant, especially for uniforms. The Council's policy of purchasing in advance has been beneficial to the budget. Although this year's uniform expenditure is estimated to be much higher than last year's budget, this is due to the sharp increase in expenses caused by staff changes and clothing replacements.

Due to the soaring prices of food, the expenses for food for prisoners in the Council's prisons and members of the Russian Auxiliary Team have increased significantly. The budget for prison food expenses was 4,729,620 yuan last year, but has increased to 6,715,050 yuan this year. As for the number of prisoners, it was listed as 7,680 last year, but is only calculated at 5,500 this year. Otherwise, the budget for food expenses would be even higher.

Since its establishment last year, the baojia organization has made significant contributions to assisting the police department in maintaining law and order. Its effects have been fully demonstrated. The draft budget for this organization has been revised. The revised amount includes the gradual advancement of the baojia system in the area north of Suzhou Creek and its expansion. However, future donations from citizens will not be included.

(3) Health Department: The estimated expenses for the Health Department this year are approximately 8,741,100 yuan, of which 4,179,020 yuan is for the non-hospital portion and 4,562,080 yuan is for the hospital portion. All expenditure budgets are for normal needs. However, under the hospital portion, a nominal expenditure of 500,000 yuan has been added to cope with outbreaks of epidemics and emergency measures.

(4) Allocations for Hospital Subsidies, etc.: This type of expenditure is listed as 1,994,000 yuan this year. The estimated deficits for the Hong'en and Gongji hospitals this year are 605,000 yuan, compared to 904,620 yuan last year. The reduction in the estimated deficit is partly due to the economic measures implemented by the two hospitals. The expenses for accommodating poor patients and people with mental illnesses and other diseases are estimated to be approximately 149,300 yuan higher this year than last year. The appropriation to non-Council hospitals is of a trial nature and is 420,510 yuan higher than last year. (To be continued)

### Inaugural Preparatory Meeting of the Greater East Asia Buddhist Association Aims at Charity, Appeals for Assistance

Organizational Declaration

The full text of the organizational declaration of the General Assembly is as follows: "Thinking of the disasters and links, the flames of war everywhere, the people are ruined, and the sores are full of eyes. People are not made of wood or stone. Who can be ruthless? My colleagues have something to do with this. Therefore, based on the great compassion of Buddhism to relieve suffering and rescue the suffering, and the aim of Christianity to love others as oneself, we specially unite our comrades and initiate the organization of the Greater East Asia Buddhist Association, to unite Buddhists, start relief work, and help relieve the suffering of the people, and seek the happiness of the world's people. After this, all relief to refugees and various charitable works, as far as my colleagues can do, will do their best to achieve, in order to save lives from the sea of suffering and ascend to the realm of peace and happiness together. However, due to the beginning of the organization and the vastness of the work, my colleagues are short-sighted and dangerous. I deeply hope that the wise men at home and abroad, and the advanced people from all walks of life, will give help. Moreover, this association aims at universal love, regardless of nationality or religion, and treats everyone equally. I hope that the enthusiastic people from all walks of life will participate and work together to ensure that this association realizes the long-cherished wish of saving the world and saving the people. It is what my colleagues have been looking forward to."

### Fruitful Results Achieved at the First Meeting of the National Economic Committee - Impressions Shared by Advisor Kimura

On the 26th, the mainland _ paper reported that Dr. Kimura Zenta, advisor to the National Economic Committee and advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, had attended the first plenary meeting of the National Economic Committee in Beijing. Having completed his official duties and returned to Shanghai, he met with reporters at the _ Bank on the Bund at 3:00 PM on the 15th. He stated that the attending members from North and Central China were enthusiastic and reinforced the determination of the participating National Government to establish a wartime economic system and enhance production. This sincere attitude was admirable, and the meeting yielded many achievements. The following is a Q&A between the reporter and Mr. Kimura:

Q: What about the proposals to promote the supply of materials?

A: There were many views put forward by the private sector regarding the purchase of rice, cotton, miscellaneous grains, etc. However, under the current conditions, the purchase of _ quantities of materials is quite difficult. Therefore, some people advocate not _ expecting the recovery of industry and the increase of production. The only way is to flow the materials from Shanghai to the mainland. If the _ operation is properly managed, I believe that the results will be good. In this case, the purchasing and allocation organizations must be systematically combined.

Q: What are the countermeasures to promote the purchase and increase production of materials?

A: Increasing agricultural products is the most urgent and necessary task. Various discussions have been put forward regarding this issue. The first condition is to improve the economic strength of rural areas. Otherwise, even if there are preparations for adjusting the purchasing mechanism, it will be futile if farmers have no funds to purchase agricultural tools and fertilizers. Therefore, when carrying out irrigation projects, consider rural lending at the same time. I heard that Huaxing Bank has _ carried out small-amount loans on a cooperative scale, and the results have been exceptionally good. The Central Reserve Bank, as the leader of the banking industry, also plans to mobilize Chinese, transportation, and other banks to actively prosper rural finance. However, financial institutions in the inland are not yet complete. Therefore, the Central Reserve Bank, commercial banks, money houses, silver firms, purchasing merchants, landlords, and farmer organizations are closely linked to the lending agency, which will have good results for the purchase of goods. However, this matter cannot be accomplished at once. Start with the _ range and consider establishing a specialized rural financial bank, but it has not yet materialized. Secondly, if we can start to eliminate water damage and improve irrigation, we can hope for a large increase in income.

Q: What is the content of the North China proposal?

A: There were no proposals in North China, only reports on finance, purchasing, and other issues. The price countermeasures in North China seem quite satisfactory.

Q: I heard that there was a discussion at this meeting on breaking the regional economy and unifying the national economy. How can the financial and exchange rate problems be solved?

A: There were no proposals on this issue. Breaking the regional economy requires a lot of preparation. If the small points of economic units are mixed together, it will be difficult to achieve good results. First, we must determine the source of the currency flow. Otherwise, it will be difficult to adjust trade issues.

Q: What is the purpose of Mr. Zai Shijing, the president of the China United Reserve Bank, coming to Shanghai?

A: According to what Mr. Zai said, he came only to inspect Shanghai. I conclude that after the above-mentioned problems are solved, the price of the Central Reserve Bank bonds can be maintained. Not only can it curb prices, but it can also increase production. Regarding the stability of currency, curbing prices, and increasing production, the preparations can be completed around March and April. In the future, the nature of the National Economic Committee will become more and more important, and the National Government and the Shanghai financial community are working together to solve various problems.

Economic Commentary

### The Future of China's Economic Realm

In the past, every major change in Shanghai's finances would inevitably affect the entire country and the global market, demonstrating the immense power of Shanghai's economy. For decades, Shanghai's economic activities have been closely connected with the world, interacting with markets in Europe, America, and Japan. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai's economic landscape has undergone a sudden shift, with all forces breaking away from the old norms and embarking on new paths. Old institutions are being destroyed to create new ones, old currencies are being replaced with new ones, old centers are being demolished to build new centers, and old exchange rates are being abolished to establish new ones. Therefore, the Shanghai economy after 1942 is completely different from the Shanghai economy before 1942, and the Shanghai economy of 1942 has become a special page in China's economic history.

Today's economic situation in Shanghai involves foreign exchange transitioning from British pounds and US dollars to military scrip, currency shifting from old legal tender to Central Reserve Bank notes, and the stock market moving from foreign stocks to Chinese stocks. Various banking and financial industries have also largely changed their content. In general, the wonderful history that has unfolded over the past decades is now being condensed into a single year, showcasing the full extent of volatility and unpredictability. In particular, the emerging industries are like bamboo shoots after a rain, dazzling and alarming, and the development of the times and the partial prosperity often leave people at a loss for words. Whether the future of Shanghai's economy brings disaster or fortune, good luck or bad luck, prosperity or decline, will be determined in this year. According to the reporter's view, fortune, good luck, and prosperity are all created by Shanghai's financiers and entrepreneurs themselves. And the responsibility for nurturing, protecting, developing, and growing lies with the government.

Now, the wartime economic policy guidelines have been formulated and announced by the National Government through the National Economic Commission. Our financiers and entrepreneurs should work together to increase industrial production in order to realize the planned production of the entire country. Not only should industries cooperate closely with each other, but industries and non-industries should also support each other. Furthermore, the sound development of trade associations and the promotion of the rationalization of production organizations are urgently needed. All disconnections between parties and organizational defects that have affected production efficiency in the past should be avoided. In particular, there should be no spirit of each acting independently, jealous of each other, and engaging in infighting. Everyone should eliminate personal interests, broaden their horizons, and truly recognize the important economic mission they should shoulder at present. Under the same goal of the entire country, everyone should contribute all their thoughts and strengths to the critical economic situation in China, making efforts to inherit the past and usher in the future. Perhaps there is hope for the Chinese economy to recover after reaching its lowest point?

### The Re-emerging National Government Economy (Middle)

2.  Breaking Down the Closed-Off Inland Economy

Currently, the most important issues in the Central China economy are, first and foremost, the price and currency unification issue (i.e., the full use of Central Reserve Bank notes). Indeed, thoroughly stabilizing prices and strengthening currency unification are the most important factors in the revival of the Central China economy. However, the root problems of the current Central China economy, or it can be said that the factors that must be solved, are the severance of trade with the three countries, the reduction in production, and the shortage of materials due to the poor circulation of goods in the inland areas. Stabilizing prices and consolidating the currency are also closely related to this. In the final analysis, without addressing the root causes, there is no way to treat the symptoms. Therefore, this article decides to focus on how to solve this problem in Central China now.

At present, Central China's industry, especially Shanghai's industry, which accounts for a large proportion of it, has seen a large decrease in production mainly due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the severance of foreign raw material sources, and the decrease in the import of inland materials. In order to overcome this difficulty, when foreign raw materials are hopeless, the prerequisite is only to break the closed-off phenomenon of the inland economy, so that inland raw materials such as cotton and wheat can be continuously transported to Shanghai and other industrial centers.

Generally speaking, the closed-off nature of the inland economy, from the opposite point of view, the main reasons for the "isolation" of Shanghai are roughly as follows:

1.  Economic blockade against the enemy due to the necessity of war.
2.  A sharp reduction in the exchange ratio of materials due to the huge difference between the prices of industrial products and agricultural products: In other words, due to the soaring prices of urban industrial products, the purchasing power of rural areas has been reduced, so the supply of agricultural products has stagnated.
3.  The imperfection of the inland native product material purchasing institutions.

The first point regarding the economic blockade against the enemy, with Shanghai and Hong Kong already occupied by the Japanese army, has lost its necessity, so it is gradually being cancelled. However, the second type of price difference between the two, which has become the biggest reason today, has become very difficult to narrow. Last July, the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Stabilizing Prices and the Regulations on Combating Illegal Price Increases, and then carried out the so-called implementation methods for the main commodities, banned the pledge loans of commodities by silver and money industries, etc., so it spared no effort in racking their brains to stabilize prices. These relief programs have generally become a very effective restraint on soaring prices, which is also a fact. However, lowering the current soaring prices of industrial products is certainly not an easy task, and at the same time, raising the prices of agricultural products is not the best policy that is desired. If this is the case, to solve the problem, perhaps we can only expect the current third type of complete purchasing organization, and then slowly move towards overcoming the price disparity between the second type.

Originally, the purchasing institutions for native products such as rice, wheat, and cotton were produced by the local grain collection of the combat troops, and then developed into the purchasing institutions for the supply of materials to the Japanese army. This kind of purchasing institution is only an institution for maintaining the local life of the army, which obviously has non-economic characteristics, and is also a natural phenomenon. Later, the National Government was established, and the purchasing institution was handed over to the people, so this institution naturally changed. However, according to the Nanjing special telegram (January 4th Asahi Shimbun), it is said that its main purpose has the following defects:

1.  From the perspective of the transitional institution, it has developed into a monopolistic institution for Japanese merchants, centered on rapidly collecting materials to maintain the electric team.
2.  Moreover, Japanese trading companies, which were established to counter Chongqing's economic blockade and enemy trading companies, have a tendency to despise the Chinese side's traditional commercial institutions, resulting in a reduction in purchasing efficiency.
3.  The monopolistic institution is used as a liberal-minded organ, and its activity base becomes profitable and exclusive, and it even abuses the privileges granted by the authorities and strives for profit.
4.  As a result, the purchasing price of the above-mentioned purchasing institution is very low, resulting in the recent poor purchasing results, because farmers are willing to sell to local factories at high prices, and are also gradually inclined to homemade handicrafts such as cotton cloth, cigarettes, and candles.
5.  In addition, due to the imperfection of the distribution institution, there are also considerable defects in the distribution of indispensable daily necessities and production tools to the rural areas where native products are purchased, and the purchasing institution lacks organic ties.

If this is really the case, we must first (A) suppress the improper profits of the Japanese merchant monopolistic institution and rationalize the purchase price. (B) Cancel the exclusive sectarianism and cooperate with Chinese commercial institutions to the greatest extent. If the current two can be done, it can also be predicted that inland materials can provide a considerable amount. With this, the productivity of Shanghai's industry will also increase. In this way, it may be possible to supply inland rural areas with low-priced necessities, thereby exchanging for inland materials. This is the case in theory, of course, in practice, it cannot be so simple to take effect. In short, if you want to break the closed-off phenomenon of the inland areas to increase the productivity of Central China, you must take urgent measures to transform the character of the national monopolistic institution and strengthen joint ventures.

### Merchants Attempt to Exploit Loopholes and Exceed Price Limits: Chongqing Authorities Restrict the Area and Weight of Flatbread

February 14th, Lisbon Allied Press Telegram: The Chongqing Municipal Government, in view of the fact that flatbread merchants have recently reduced the area and weight of flatbread in order to take advantage of the food price limits and then sell it at the price limited by the authorities to seek profits, is now planning to first stipulate the area and weight of flatbread, and then limit the price.

### An Analysis of Shanghai Money Shops

Recently, the establishment of Shanghai money shops has increased like bamboo shoots after a rain. Their capital ranges from millions to only tens of thousands. Due to the size of their capital, the scope of their business operations also varies, and there are several different names. In general, they can be divided into five types, which are described below:

(1) Remittance Shops - Remittance shops are money shops that have joined the Money Industry Association, so they are also called "Yuan" money shops. Their capital is the largest among money shops, and their strength is strong. They have the right to directly participate in the remittance of bills. The ordinary so-called money shops generally refer to this type.

(2) Yuan Character Shops - Yuan Character Shops are money shops that are second to remittance shops. Their capital and business scope are smaller than remittance shops. In the past, in the era of paper money, silver and money were collected and transported by the stackers, so they were called "carrying" money shops. Because they cannot participate in the remittance of bills by the Money Industry Association, they entrust remittance shops to act as agents for the collection and remittance of bills.

(3) Heng Character Shops - The capital and business scope of Heng Character Shops are worse than Yuan Character Shops. After business hours, the silver and money that should be collected and transported are completed during the day, so there is nothing to do at night and they rest. People call them "closed-door carrying" shops.

(4) Li Character Shops - The business of Li Character Shops is different from the above three types of money shops. They do not engage in deposit pawns and loans, nor do they engage in bank subsidiary business. Their transactions are only the exchange of foreign currencies, etc., and the conversion of auxiliary coins. Recently, because the prices of foreign currencies such as Japanese military scrip have been fixed, this type of money shop has closed down and decreased.

(5) Zhen Character Shops - Zhen Character Shops have various names such as "cigarette paper money shops" and "small change shops." Their main business is the exchange of auxiliary coins and the operation of cigarette and grocery sales. This type of money shop is lined up in the streets, and we can see them everywhere.

From the above, it can be seen that remittance shops are the main body of money shops, and Yuan and Heng money shops assist them. Their business is roughly the same as that of banks, because their operators are: (A) various deposits (B) various loans (C) pawns (D) discounting of promissory notes (E) warehousing (F) remittances, etc.

Since their business is similar to that of banks, why not directly change their name to bank? The answer to this question can be divided into the following points.

(1) Long history; before there were banks, they held the economic reins of major commercial ports. Because of their outstanding credit, there is no need to change their name.

(2) Although the money shop industry has recently been ordered by the Ministry to reorganize into limited companies, in the past, most of the money shops in our country were organized as partnerships, so the partners have joint and unlimited liability, which is the reason for their outstanding credit, and there is no need to change their name to bank.

(3) The industrial and commercial circles in our country have always been conservative, and the old-fashioned or semi-new-fashioned industrial and commercial enterprises that occupy the majority in various parts of our country are happy to deal with money shops. Moreover, the "Yuan" qualifications and procedures of remittance shops are quite strict, so their financial resources and reputation are extremely strong. They can gain the support of the industrial and commercial circles, and avoid losing the heroic posture of "Yuan." Why change?

(4) The loss and procedures for the money shop's tickets are quite strict, and there are very few forged signatures of money shop tickets in the past, so the recipients can avoid being deceived by the original person who requested the money shop to issue the ticket. Even if the issuing money shop unfortunately closes down, it must give priority to the holders of the money shop tickets. Therefore, the business of the money shop is busy, and it relies heavily on the money shop tickets. Since the money shop tickets are not easy to change their name, the money shop does not need to change its name to a bank.

In summary, it can be seen that money shops have an irreplaceable superior position in today's financial circles. However, there are many newly established money shops recently. It is hoped that they will adhere to the original purpose of the money shops, adjust the financial situation for the society, and strive to serve, then their original heroic posture will not be slightly reduced, and they will still make a great contribution to the society.

### Fresh Oranges are Expensive, Canned Mandarin Oranges Sales are Increasing

Canned mandarin oranges, the price was originally very low, but due to the scarcity of inventory and no domestic products, the market has been strong for a long time. Recently, because fresh oranges are expensive, many people have changed to eating canned ones, resulting in strong sales and rising prices. Recently, a box of two dozen 30-ounce cans is sold for 370 yuan. A box of four dozen 11-ounce cans is 335 yuan. The former has risen by 10 yuan compared with the beginning of the month, while the latter has risen by 15 yuan. A large number of boxes are still not easy to collect. The popularity of the market is rare. According to the two dozen cans, each can of oranges weighs 20 ounces net; the allocation price of the fourth phase of the association is 239 yuan and 30 cents. Each of the four dozen cans weighs 7 ounces net, and the allocation price of the first phase of the association is 196 yuan. The difference in selling price is as high as more than 60% to more than 70%. (Hua An) (Donation for Poverty Relief)

### China Central Tobacco Rationing Association: Expected to Distribute Goods Next Month; Discreet Investigation of Sales in Each Store is Underway

### Stock Market Gossip

Since the Chinese stock market opened red after the Lunar New Year, most retailers sold, resulting in a slight weakening of market prices. However, in the past week, many new large investors have emerged, and the prices of various stocks have risen in unison. The intraday jumps of public utility stock Zhabei Hydropower are the most noteworthy. Other stocks such as Mei Ah, Nanyang, Commercial Press, China Electric, Amoy, Guanshengyuan, etc. have also risen nearly one time compared to their lowest prices a month ago.

It is rumored that the unexpected surge of public utility stocks this time is due to several large investors pouring their efforts into buying in, including certain industry association organizations.

There are probably more than one or two stocks that are speculative and blindly rising. Investors should be wary and beware of setbacks.

The two tobacco industry stocks and the two food industry stocks, although they have risen sharply, still seem to have potential. Hanyeping Coal and Iron Mining stocks have recently attracted the attention of buyers.

The leaps of public utilities, cultural industries, food industries, department store stocks, etc. are reflecting the tranquility of the new pharmaceutical industry. At present, only Zhongfa has risen slightly among the new pharmaceutical industry stocks, while New Asia and other stocks seem to be more stable, but the foundation is very solid.

### Sowing and Harvesting

— Shu Yang

If you want to harvest, you have to sow. Once you sow, you will harvest. This simple and obvious cause-and-effect relationship is clear to everyone.

"If you want to harvest, you have to sow." This can be said to be an unbreakable law that no one can deny. Only with "spring plowing" and "summer weeding" can there be "autumn harvest" and "winter storage." To say that golden, fat grains emerge out of thin air from the cracks in the soil, watching the wheat and barley ripen while lying on the field ridges, is truly the height of absurdity!

"Once you sow, you will harvest." It cannot be stubbornly said that there are no exceptions, because once the seeds are sown in the soil, it depends on whether the temperature, moisture, and nutrients are suitable for them to grow. Sometimes you may encounter sowing without harvesting, but from the general situation, at least ten seeds should germinate out of a hundred seeds sown, and it will not be a complete waste, right?

Although the relationship between sowing and harvesting is very simple, it is still wrongly estimated and vaguely understood by many people. Why? I think it is because there is a necessary journey from sowing to harvesting, and many people have become lost sheep on this journey. What is this journey? - It is cultivation.

Some people say "just ask about cultivation," which is too blindly following. They cultivate green grass while sweating profusely. People say they are "putting in effort without getting any benefit," and they may even praise themselves for their "just ask about it" spirit. There are also people who "pull up the seedlings to help them grow," thinking that they are taking a shortcut, but they never expected that the seedlings after being pulled up would soon wither.

Therefore, I believe that you should choose the seeds before sowing, and control the harvest before receiving it. And what connects sowing and harvesting is a period of perseverance, patience, and correct cultivation.

### The Disciplining of Life

— Heart One

Life needs discipline, because a disciplined life can keep your spirit from being listless, and can eliminate the bad habit of "changing one's mind frequently," so indirectly and directly it can also improve work efficiency. Because work efficiency increases, your spirit will certainly feel happy, so you can also have a greater sense of "self-confidence." Moreover, it can also train your ability to control things, properly vent your surplus energy, and enable life to develop in a healthy way.

A disciplined life is serious, creative, and enterprising. "Youth" is an enterprising period, and it is also a creative period, so a disciplined life is in greater and more urgent need for young people.

The disciplining of life, at first glance, seems "unnatural" and "stereotyped." But you should cultivate it with the word "perseverance," because although at first, you will feel a lot of inconvenience and pain, but after you get used to it, you will definitely find that it is vibrant and free.

People who waste away in listless extravagance, if they can make their lives serious, I can guarantee that they will definitely find meaningful and valuable life interests.

### ### Second Place in the January Essay Competition

— Liu Feiqiong

My Life

Past:

The past life, like a comedy, has finished playing on the stage. I remember that from childhood to adolescence, my family was very wealthy, and I was willing to study hard, so I felt very proud and arrogant, because many people, although they worked hard, were not wealthy, and those who were wealthy were unwilling to work hard, but I had both: I had a suitable environment, and I also had the ambition to improve myself: whenever there was a major exam in school, my grades were always among the best, and never fell below 85 points. At that time, not only did parents praise me, but all relatives and friends knew about it. As for daily life, we lived in a tall Western-style house on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai, with a private car, motorcycle, electric stove, electric fan, and radio. In Suzhou, we had a self-built three-story building, with vermilion doors, a spacious living room, and redwood furniture inlaid with marble all around. The living room led to a study on both sides, which contained famous Chinese and Western paintings and books from ancient and modern times. It was truly dazzling, with no less than tens of thousands of volumes. Along the east wall of the study was a garden with peach and plum blossoms in full bloom, with pavilions, terraces, buildings, towers, fish ponds, flower beds, cedars, and rockeries, which were indeed breathtaking. As for food, not only was there fish and meat on the table every day, but also chickens and ducks were constantly available. Since the outbreak of the war, the family fled to the countryside. Unfortunately, in the countryside, my grandmother, uncle, and uncle all died one after another due to acclimatization and shock. At the same time, everything in the family was either destroyed in the war zone or stolen by thieves. In great difficulties, we came to Shanghai. Besides my father, who was the greatest pillar of our lives, the rest were a group of ten children who were still wet behind the ears.

Present Situation:

When we returned to Shanghai, this home was gradually established by my father again single-handedly. Under the circumstances of this rapidly advancing standard of living, we were able to save and economize and maintain the opportunity to study. Speaking of clothing, food, housing, and transportation: although it is not extremely difficult, it is not abundant either. In the past four or five years, I have not added a single expensive or gorgeous piece of clothing, or silk or satin. The clothes I wear with me or when I go out are not only made of coarse cloth, but are also old-fashioned ones that I have altered myself. Speaking of decoration: I have not visited a barbershop in three or four years. When my hair gets long, I ask my mother or myself to trim it in front of the mirror. As for perms, I have never tried them in my life. Although the desire to be beautiful is common to everyone, and I am not a person with a pockmarked face or disabilities, why is my temperament so strange that I am unwilling to follow the crowd? Of course, young people should always advance with the times, but some trends are not beneficial to us or worthy of imitation, especially since I live in such an era. I feel that decoration is a waste of time and money, and it is not allowed or possible for us to throw away my father's hard-earned money for vanity. Secondly, regarding food: in the morning, I only have a thin slice of two-ounce bread to fill my stomach, no sweet potatoes, let alone thin porridge. Especially in the past two months, I have been using brown rice or broken rice and flour as my lunch and dinner every day, and I have not had the chance to eat white rice. We often eat steamed fish, steamed vegetables, and fried leftover rice because of the lack of oil. I don't feel any pain about these things. I just feel strange that things I had never experienced before are now passing by peacefully. Although these real situations and scenes fill my heart and will be remembered forever, I still try my best to tolerate and accept them. Next, talking about transportation: every time I go to school or return home, whether it is heavy rain, heavy snow, or a storm, I walk instead of taking a car, unless it is a very urgent matter, but it is limited to streetcars.

Adaptation:

An ancient saying goes: "The times create heroes," but heroes must also transform the times. Although I don't have such great ability and ambition, I should at least have the ability to deal with the environment. In this turbulent and precarious world, survival is indeed very difficult. If you are not careful, you may be squeezed out or rolled out of this world, so you must have a kind of life skill to cope with the environment. When I was three years old, my mother passed away. Since then, no one has ever told me about the infinite changes in worldly affairs and human relationships, and the proper attitude to deal with people and things. Although I have seen some of these things in books, they are not practical experiences, but merely theoretical and empty words. As a result, all household affairs are now managed by me, because my brothers have gone out to take care of their own futures, and my mother has taken three younger siblings back to her hometown. There are only six people left in the family. Except for my father, who leaves early and returns late, the rest are me and my cousin, brother, and sister. Speaking of their temperaments, they are very different. Moreover, we have been used to teasing each other since childhood. Now that I am suddenly in charge of the household, I feel very difficult. If I am too strict, I will definitely cause resentment. If I am too lenient, not only will household affairs not be taken care of, but there will be quarrels and fights all day long, which is simply unbearable. Therefore, on the one hand, I take care of washing, cleaning, and sewing my own clothes, rooms, and shoes and socks. If I have extra time, I help my cousin and cousin organize other tasks. If it happens to be a holiday, I go to buy groceries, wash rice, or cook. In short, I want to set an example so that they know how to understand. My management of everything is not based on a commanding position, but on the responsibility of guiding. No matter what happens, we must work together so that they know that they have self-esteem and a sense of responsibility. Even if they have made mistakes, I also give them the opportunity to correct them, implying that I know about their mistakes, but it is out of forgiveness. At the same time, regarding the daily meals, of course, it is best to live within our means, but many things happen that cannot be predicted. Therefore, on the one hand, I prevent them from being affected by the poor ingredients of the meals and affecting their nutrition. On the other hand, I also limit the amount of food and drink to avoid unnecessary waste. Next, speaking of myself, in addition to going to school for classes and returning home to take care of household affairs, I also need to do further studies and reading. Books are very expensive now, but how can I continue my studies without books? As the saying goes, "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." Especially when studying at university, you must spend most of your time on self-study and reading widely. Therefore, no matter what the situation, I go to two large libraries every week to browse various reference books, and then borrow a few useful books home and take notes on them in my spare time. Again, talking about the preparation of tuition fees, when we finish a major exam, we often see our father frowning, because under this high standard of living, it is not easy to support a family of twelve without borrowing money, let alone at this time, when a huge amount of tuition fees needs to be paid! Therefore, I feel that studying is not a happy thing, especially as the years go by, using the tuition fees paid by my father's hard work, I feel that my responsibility is even greater, and my inner joy is even more diminished. How can I not want to exchange work for some remuneration, but in this world where there are more people than jobs, where is your foothold? My only remedy from now on is to continue to maintain my previous frugality, save all the wasted money for the purchase of books and stationery, etc., so that I can slightly reduce my father's burden on tuition fees, and at the same time manage the household affairs in an orderly manner, so that my father will not feel unhappy when he sees the chaotic situation after returning late.

Hope:

Let the past be the past. I know that the future days may not be better than the present, unless it is a sudden change. My life does not hope to have any luxurious or extravagant enjoyment or decoration. I only hope to cultivate my body and mind and educate myself in a difficult life. How many great figures in history, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, did not grow up and succeed in hardship? Only when they can use old experiences to gain new experiences can they create a good new environment. Therefore, I need and can use the experiences in pain to temper my body and mind, and not let the pain of the environment dominate my body and mind.

### ### Youth Dropping Out of School is a Loss to the Country and Society

— Tianming Shu

### ### Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

"Some of you who were here before the war will surely remember that German teacher, Max Steffel. When the war broke out, he was visiting his family in Germany. He was very popular here, and had many friends. Last week, he died on the Western Front. Those who knew him must feel very sorry."

After he sat down, his face was a little pale. He knew he had done something unusual. But he had not discussed the matter with anyone beforehand: no one could be blamed. After a while, outside the chapel, he heard a debate:

"Gipps said, on the Western Front. Does that mean he was fighting for the Germans?"

"I think that's right."

"Then it seems a bit odd to read his name out along with the others. After all, he was an 'enemy'."

"Oh, I think that's just one of Gipps' ideas. The old boy has a lot of ideas."

Gipps, back in his own room, was not troubled by this criticism. Yes, he had a lot of ideas - dignified and generous ideas that were gradually dwindling in this crazy world. And he thought: Brookfield will get them from me: but they won't get them from anyone else.

Once, someone asked him for his opinion on bayonet practice, which was taking place near the squash court. He replied in that languid, slightly wheezing tone, which was often excessively imitated, he said: "The thing seems to me - er - a very vulgar method of homicide."

This was passed around and welcomed - how Gipps had told the big-hatted officer from the War Office that bayonet fighting was vulgar. Just like Gipps. They had found him an adjective - an adjective just coming into use: he was Pre-War (38). Community Service
