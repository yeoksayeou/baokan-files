### Payment of Yarn and Cloth Prices as Scheduled

Following the promulgation of the order to purchase cotton yarn and cloth, merchants holding yarn and cloth immediately complied with the order and applied for sale. The National General Association of Commercial Control also established an office for purchasing yarn and cloth to handle the matter specifically. The office was established on August 23rd and reorganized into the Cotton Industry Management Office on November 26th. During the three months, the work of registration, review, and pricing has been completed step by step. However, the inspection and acceptance part has not been completed due to the large quantity. Although the payment of the price after the purchase has been stipulated as a special fixed-term deposit certificate, and the Executive Yuan has approved October 1st as the starting date, it has not been paid on time due to the failure to inspect and accept the goods in time.

Recently, the General Association of Commercial Control, in order to take care of the merchants' difficulties and enable them to receive the first deposit certificate price on time, has specially stipulated a flexible method: all yarn and cloth sold but not yet inspected will be stored by the original owner on behalf of the buyer, and the application for receiving the price will be made. The application and reporting period is from yesterday to the 30th.

First of all, we believe that this flexible method of the General Association of Commercial Control is an appropriate measure from the perspective of taking care of the merchants' difficulties. Not only the merchants who sell yarn and cloth can get real benefits, but the entire financial system can also be opened up as a result. Moreover, the end of the year is approaching in an instant, and commercial settlement depends on this to regulate the funding. Therefore, this method is eagerly awaited by the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors.

Secondly, from the standpoint of the seller of yarn and cloth, this flexible method is not so much a compromise by the government as it is a right that the merchant should have. Because from the principle of buying and selling, after the seller sells the property, the seller has the right to ask the buyer for the price; conversely, the buyer who purchases the goods from the other party has the obligation to pay the price to the seller. Although the government's intention to purchase is different, the principle of buying and selling cannot be ignored. The deadline for applying to sell yarn and cloth this time was September 6th. In theory, that day should be the date of the transaction, and the price should be paid. It is already a stretch to stipulate that October 1st is the starting date. As for the variety and quantity of yarn and cloth sold being huge, the sorting, investigation, and inspection procedures are quite complicated, and it takes time to process. Therefore, the payment should be delayed. Although all of this is true, the responsibility lies with the government, and the seller should not be made to suffer losses.

From a theoretical and factual point of view, the flexible method decided by the General Association of Commercial Control is its own responsibility. In the notice of the General Association of Commercial Control, the application procedures for yarn and cloth sellers are very detailed, and guarantees must be obtained to prevent fraud. From the standpoint of the General Association of Commercial Control, this is the necessary procedure. It is hoped that the applicants will fully understand it and handle it according to the date and method. They should faithfully fill in the quantity, type, quality, and price to avoid future trouble. At the same time, we hope that after the General Association of Commercial Control stipulates this flexible method, it should still expedite the inspection and acceptance work in order to thoroughly settle the matter.

Before the order to purchase yarn and cloth was promulgated, we advocated thoroughly investigating hoarding for the sake of the people's livelihood and price issues, sparing no effort, with the aim of cracking down on speculation, suppressing prices, and stabilizing the people's livelihood. After the order to purchase yarn and cloth was promulgated, we would not regret punishing speculators and hoarders. Among them, there are also law-abiding merchants who are inevitably hit. We also advocate paying the price as soon as possible and implementing the distribution as soon as possible, also with the aim of stabilizing the people's livelihood and taking care of the merchants' difficulties. Our argument is completely aimed at stabilizing the people's livelihood. If the responsibility lies with the merchants, we will of course try our best to correct them; if the responsibility lies with the government, we will not hesitate to blame them. Based on this position, we extremely agree with the flexible method of the General Association of Commercial Control this time for the payment of yarn and cloth prices, and hope that it will proceed smoothly and be completed as scheduled.

### Japanese Army Air Force Controls India-Chongqing Air Transport Line in Burma, Shooting Down More Than 60 Enemy Planes in Two Months

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 11:00 AM on the 6th: The Imperial Army's advanced air units in the direction of Burma have been taking the opportunity to attack the transport lines between Chongqing and India since mid-October, and have bombed the enemy air force base in Tinsukia, posing a great threat to the air transport route. Since the beginning of the attack, the comprehensive results of the battle confirmed so far are as follows: 41 enemy aircraft shot down (7 of which are unconfirmed), including 14 large transport aircraft; 28 enemy aircraft destroyed and set on fire, including 21 large transport aircraft; and 9 of our aircraft bombed enemy bases.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese army base in Burma reports that the Japanese army air force in Burma has repeatedly attacked the Chongqing air transport route since October 13th, achieving great results, causing the enemy to be extremely embarrassed. According to reports, after Chongqing lost the Yunnan-Burma Highway, the only routes left were the so-called China-India air transport route from Tinsukia in Assam, northern Burma, to Kunming, and the Tibet route. However, the Tibet route was blocked by bombing and could not be used much, so only the China-India air transport route was used. The Axis forces suffered heavy losses in the Great East Asia War, and the Japanese army finally gained complete air superiority. As a result, its transport capacity has greatly declined. However, since the anti-Axis forces attempted to use Chongqing as a base to launch air raids on the Japanese mainland and increased the US air force stationed in Chongqing, this China-India air route has changed its meaning and has become a blood transfusion route for the US air force stationed in Chongqing. Therefore, the Chongqing newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction. However, this China-India air route has become more and more difficult to transport due to the increased activity of the Japanese air force after the rainy season. Since October 13th, the Japanese air force has repeatedly shot down its transport aircraft and bombed Chittagong and Tamu, etc., where transport materials are piled up. In addition to being embarrassed, the enemy changed bomber transport aircraft and used a large number of fighter aircraft as escorts, changed from daytime to nighttime, or changed routes to avoid Japanese aircraft surveillance. However, after entering December, Calcutta, the base of its accumulated materials, was also severely bombed by Japanese aircraft. Following this, Tinsukia Airport, the stronghold of its blood transfusion route to Chongqing, was also severely damaged.

Japanese Aircraft Bombed Tinsukia Airport in Large Formation

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a Japanese army unit in Burma, the Japanese army air force in Burma launched a large-scale bombing of Tinsukia Airport on the afternoon of the 13th, destroying 9 enemy large aircraft and 6 small aircraft, and shooting down 16 enemy aircraft in air combat, totaling 31 enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed, causing extreme shock to the enemy air formation. In this battle, two Japanese aircraft also self-destructed. Several Japanese fighter-bombers formed a large formation and flew over the Arakan Mountains to the skies above Tinsukia. Because it was unexpected, it was a complete surprise attack, so the enemy formation was in a terrible state. Japanese aircraft dropped bombs like rain, destroying many enemy aircraft before returning to base. The enemy fighters attempted to pursue the Japanese aircraft, but were almost completely shot down. The most noteworthy thing about this battle was that the enemy aircraft were caught in chaos due to the surprise attack by Japanese aircraft, and collided with each other on the runway, and were shattered by bullets shortly thereafter. On the contrary, some Japanese aircraft were able to fly several kilometers safely back to base even after one enemy bullet stopped the left engine and the right engine spewed black smoke.

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army on the India-Burma border has recently started to move again, but failed due to the fierce counterattack of the Japanese army. The Chongqing authorities disregard the lives of the people and drive the people of Yunnan, Gansu, and other provinces to go to India to be commanded and sacrificed by the British and American armies. Most of Chongqing's dispatch of expeditions is also forced. Although a part of the troops in that area are British and American troops, the front lines are all Indian and Chongqing troops. Because the fighting is forced, the morale is low. The British-Indian military headquarters has admitted that the counterattack is difficult. The Chongqing side has long unanimously condemned the British and American conspiracy to sacrifice the Chongqing side. Therefore, in the war on the India-Burma border, the Chongqing side may be deeply aware.

### Resolve to Overcome All Difficulties and Move Towards Strengthening Combat Power - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Delivered a Speech Yesterday

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech at the general meeting of the Japan Economic League on the 16th, emphasizing the following: Now, the United Kingdom and the United States are using all their strength to carry out a counterattack. In order to defeat the enemy and make the enemy surrender, we will make greater efforts in the future and fight until we achieve final victory. The coming year may be a year to determine the general trend. The United Kingdom and the United States have no clear war aims in this operation, but the interests between the United Kingdom and the United States are also inconsistent. Combining various news, the only thing that the United Kingdom and the United States rely on today is their carrying capacity, which has gradually been exhausted. Rubber, tin, gold, quinacrine, shipbuilding timber, etc., are already in extremely short supply, and even the inexhaustible war materials, oil, etc., are also in great shortage. And the human combat power and other consumption are not difficult to imagine. However, the Empire, under clear war aims, has established a sure-win situation strategically, using the resources of Greater East Asia to gradually strengthen its combat power. The cooperation with the countries and nations of Greater East Asia is also becoming closer. Some of them directly cooperate with the Empire's combat power to complete the war. Due to the mutual determination and the firm determination of the people, we are now working hard every day to strengthen our combat power. The leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States know very well that if they do not defeat Japan, they cannot stop the astonishing increase in Japan's combat power. The United Kingdom and the United States will inevitably fall into collapse, so they are making efforts to carry out counterattacks regardless of major sacrifices. We must know that in order to win the final victory, the future war situation will become more and more fierce. The government is determined to lead the people to overcome all difficulties and move forward. The third year of the war will be the year of the decisive battle. In order to make the soldiers at the front line fight smoothly, we must rapidly work hard to strengthen our combat power, increase the number of aircraft as much as possible, and develop coal mines. Today, the comprehensive utilization of Japan's production facilities can enhance the necessary combat power. What should be paid attention to is research and implementation. Among the driving forces of the decisive battle, the most important are the spirit of courage and the demeanor of the leaders. Now the reason why the enemy is anxious is nothing more than the fact that their future is full of ominous omens. The more anxious the enemy is, the calmer we should be, work hard in a down-to-earth manner, take the hearts of the soldiers on the front line as our own, and move towards strengthening our combat power all the way.

Lieutenant General Endo's Broadcast

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Saburo Endo, Director-General of the Aviation Weapons Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions, broadcast a speech here at 7:20 PM on the 16th, "Increasing the Production of Aircraft", the main points are as follows: Although the material production capacity of the enemy countries is very large, the production of aircraft requires manpower. Although there are hundreds of millions of people in the United States, their races are complex and they adhere to egoism. On the contrary, the Japanese nation is of one mind and unites with the nations of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Japan has already gained an advantage in terms of manpower. Looking at the material resources, although Japan is small, it is by no means weaker than the United States when developing the resources of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Moreover, our sacrificial spirit is far superior to theirs. Therefore, although the development of aircraft was pioneered by the United States and the United Kingdom, Japan's current scientific and technological level is not inferior to that of the United Kingdom and the United States, and the quality of Japanese aircraft has surpassed the world.

### Japanese Aircraft Bombed and Sunk Enemy Torpedo Boat Near Finschhafen Port, Land Forces Also Had Battles for Days

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain forward position of the Southern Pacific Army: The Japanese army air force bombed and destroyed a ship near Finschhafen at about 4:30 PM on the 15th, sinking a barge and a large ship. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their original defenses.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain base in the South Pacific, near Finschhafen on New Guinea Island, Japanese land forces, with a small number of troops, fought fiercely against a superior number of troops for days. The army water transport unit, which is responsible for supplying the troops, is bravely carrying out its mission on the sea where enemy torpedo boats are active, facing all kinds of dangers. For example, on the way back from completing a transport mission on the 9th, it encountered two enemy torpedo boats and fought with them, immediately sinking one and severely damaging the other, forcing it to retreat. One Japanese boat was damaged. On the 12th, the unit encountered three enemy large torpedo boats on the way back. After a fierce battle, one enemy torpedo boat was burned and destroyed, and one was severely damaged. The other was forced to flee in embarrassment. The Japanese side suffered no losses in this battle and completed its mission.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a certain base of the Japanese army in the South Pacific, the Japanese navy torpedo boat discovered an enemy torpedo boat in the sea south of Bougainville Island on the 12th. After several battles, the enemy was unable to resist and attempted to escape. The Japanese navy continued to pursue and finally sank it.

### Vietnam Federal Conference Inaugurated in Saigon

### 1944 Will Be the Year of Decisive Battle, Germany's National Unity to Fight for Victory

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels told economic leaders yesterday that after reviewing the military and political situation of the past few months, he predicted that the war next year will have decisive developments.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels declared at a meeting of German propaganda agencies on Tuesday: "Although the German people have suffered injuries in the past few months, they are therefore more determined to carry out this war to achieve a victorious outcome." Mr. Goebbels reviewed the political and military affairs of the past year and discussed the points that the various propaganda agencies should adhere to in their future work. He admitted that the German front line and rear had shouldered some major burdens in the past year, but he solemnly declared: The heroic German soldiers have frustrated the enemy's plans, and the domestic atmosphere has also maintained a strong national spirit. The enemy's terror air raids are enough to show that their savage combat methods are ultimately ineffective. Goebbels then discussed the enemy's illusions, believing that the retreat of the German army at certain points would lead to a political and military collapse, as in November 1918. Regarding this point, Goebbels solemnly declared that the enemy had to admit in the meetings in Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran that their hopes had been shattered by Germany's firm military and economic position.

### US National Railway Workers Vote to Implement General Strike, to be Gradually Implemented Starting on the 30th of This Month

Buenos Aires, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch: The five brotherhoods of the US railway workers' organization recently voted to decide on a general strike due to the issue of raising wages. The headquarters of the brotherhoods also issued a statement, saying, "The result of the vote by all employees of the association shows that 97.8% are dissatisfied with the current situation and agree to a general strike. The strike will be gradually implemented starting on the 30th of this month, and all railway workers in the United States will strike together four days later." At the same time, the presidents of the five brotherhoods also issued a joint statement, explaining the position of the association, saying, "We have decided to support the general strike. We deeply know what impact the general strike will have, but we still do this because this move will contribute to the success of the war and the welfare of the American public." Although the US government has indicated that the president will order the takeover of the railways when the strike begins, Roosevelt will still take a wait-and-see attitude when he returns to Washington. However, the mediation committee responsible for mediating the railway dispute is working hard to mediate the dispute. After the strike statement was issued, it invited representatives from the five brotherhoods and railway companies to hold a railway wage conference in Chicago on the 20th. In addition to the five brotherhoods of drivers, stokers, and other train crew members, totaling 350,000 employees, there are also more than one million members of 15 non-crew member groups who are currently voting on the general strike, but have not yet expressed their final attitude as of the 15th.

Buenos Aires, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch: After the US railway workers decided to implement a general strike, the US government indicated that it would launch wartime emergency powers to take over the national railways when the general strike begins.

### Contradictory Opinions of the Anti-Axis Powers, Treachery of the British and American Allies - Information Minister Kishi Delivers a Speech

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Anti-Axis powers, fearing internal divisions due to the recent series of defeats, specially held three consecutive conferences in Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran. Among them, the Cairo Conference was attended by the United Kingdom, the United States, and Chongqing, and the Tehran Conference was attended by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Although the Chongqing name was attached to the declaration at the Moscow Conference, Chongqing was not actually invited to participate. Looking at the contents of the three conferences, there are contradictions, and the Atlantic Charter was ignored at the Moscow Conference. The Atlantic Charter stipulated that the emerging countries in Europe after the war, the three small Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, should restore their independence and autonomy. This time, at the Moscow Conference, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from feeling resentment, they tried their best to avoid mentioning it. From this, it can be seen that the British and American intentions are treacherous and their intentions are hypocritical and mutually wary. In order to understand the content and inside story of the three consecutive conferences of the Anti-Axis countries, a Central News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Kishi, the Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy, yesterday. I was honored to receive the following remarks: "The Anti-Axis forces held a meeting in Moscow at the end of October, a British-American-Chongqing meeting in Cairo in November, and a meeting in Tehran thereafter. Looking at the contents of their military statements, compared with the moral spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration, it is actually dwarfed. Their utilitarian thoughts, conflict of interests, and opposition of opinions make it easy to see the whole picture. If we examine the contents of their three meetings, we will be able to find out the British and American conspiracy to sacrifice others for their own use. The motive of the meetings seems to be to negotiate, but in fact it symbolizes their impatience caused by the recent series of defeats. The recent unparalleled victories won by the Japanese side in the South Pacific, and the closer unity of the countries of Greater East Asia after the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, have given the Anti-Axis powers a great shock. In order to resist the final doom, they do not hesitate to use despicable means and resort to this last resort. The main issues of the Cairo and Moscow-Tehran conferences were the interests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Forcing the Chongqing side to participate was actually fearing its awakening. This is a conspiracy of the Anti-Axis powers, and it is not difficult to imagine that there are different opinions within. Recently, Smuts gave a speech in London, expressing the opinion of the British, American, and Soviet 'Trinity', saying that the result of this Second World War must be that the three great powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will dominate the world. According to Smuts, a powerful figure in the Anti-Axis front, his public speech actually despised Chongqing. From this, we can see the true intentions of the United States and the United Kingdom towards Chongqing. The Tehran Conference was a conspiracy of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, so they tried their best to avoid Chongqing's participation. Among them, the opening of the first battlefield, etc., had no practical results, and were equal to the empty content of the Moscow Conference. We can really laugh at the treacherous tricks of the Anti-Axis powers who are suspicious of each other and conspire against each other."

### Cooperation Committee Convened, Liaison Officer Conference, Chairman Chen Reported on the Key Points of Work

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - In order to establish close contact with the branches in various regions and promote the cause, the Cooperation Committee of the Executive Yuan held a symposium of liaison officers from various regions at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in Xiangpu on the afternoon of the 16th, presided over by Chairman Chen Junsui in person. A total of about 30 people attended, including the Secretary-General, the residents, and various committee members and liaison officers. At the beginning of the discussion, Chairman Chen Junhui delivered an opening speech, describing the key points of work in various regions in the future: 1. Sound organization can generate great strength, 2. Personnel adjustments can make great progress in work, 3. Internal affairs and affairs must be enriched and serve the people, and consolidate the wartime economic system. Then, Secretary-General Zhong reported on the significance of convening the symposium, and then the discussion began. The liaison officers from various regions successively reported on the progress of business in their respective regions, and hoped for assistance and guidance from the central authorities to make it more perfect in the future. Chairman Chen also reported on the key points of work for next year, striving to increase production in order to meet the corresponding supply and demand and self-sufficiency, and to rationalize the exchange of materials. At that time, the directors of various regions conducted detailed research on the principles, and the meeting was satisfactorily adjourned until about 6 o'clock.

### Minister of Finance Kaya Said That Japan's Financial Strength Is Stable

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister of Finance Kaya inspected the Osaka Mint on the morning of the 16th, and hosted a banquet in the bureau at noon. During the banquet, he explained that the amount of public debt issued from the beginning of this year to the end of November, a total of one hundred and eight hundred million yuan in eight months, and the absorption amount was ninety-eight hundred million yuan, accounting for 95% of the total issue amount. In addition, the amount of stock paid during the period was 3 billion yuan, and the new issue amount of corporate bonds was 1.8 billion yuan. In short, Japan's financial strength has been able to meet the needs of financial industry, and the situation is very stable.

### Fierce Fighting Between the Two Armies on the Kiev Highway Until Dawn, German Army Launched Counterattack on the Southern Route

Moscow, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Battle of Kiev has now entered its fifth week, with a sense of resurrection. This battle can still represent the large-scale offensive of the German army in the eastern front, in order to counter the advance of the Soviet army towards Baghdad and Odessa. According to Soviet intelligence, there was fierce fighting on the Kiev Highway southwest of Malin (46 kilometers from Kiev) until dawn. Further south, after the Soviet army withdrew from the town of Radomyshl, it gathered its defense forces on the east bank of the Teterev River. Both sides are replenishing their forces and waiting in battle formation.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Havas News Agency: Since yesterday, the Dnieper River has become the focus of the German counterattack. The German army launched an attack from the west and advanced towards Kirovograd, meeting the flanks of General Konev's troops attacking south, so General Konev's plan to advance towards Krivoy Rog has been temporarily frustrated. Moreover, this counterattack by the German army has also temporarily reduced the pressure on the German positions in Kirovograd. After the enemy in the central route had been advancing for many days between the Pripyat River and the Berezina River, it suddenly shifted its troops to the west and attempted to break into the confluence of the Sluch River and the Werschniza River, launching an attack on the German army. The German defenders were vigilant and immediately frustrated the attack. The enemy in the Navel direction continued to increase its reinforcements for the battle, and is still fighting fiercely, but there is no major change in the positions.

### German Troops in Italy Conduct Elastic Defense Warfare - US Army Drives French Mercenaries as Cannon Fodder

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency: After several days of calm, intense warfare resumed on Tuesday in the area held by General Clark's US Fifth Army on the southern Italian front. The US troops on the western front have been reinforced by troops from Trgorsk in recent days. General Clark seems to be planning to transport French reserves from North Africa to southern Italy in addition to the Moroccan Second Infantry Division, as he clearly wants to conserve the US divisions, which have suffered heavy casualties. The US command seems to be imitating Montgomery's precedent, as General Montgomery ordered all purely British troops to withdraw from the front line, while Canadian, New Zealand, and Indian troops fought in the area held by the British Eighth Army. On Tuesday, the US Army probed the German lines with strong shock troops and reconnaissance detachments. At the same time, the British Eighth Army and its overseas troops expanded their bridgehead to the area outside the Moro River at a high price. After six hours of heavy artillery preparation, the British assault teams launched a fierce attack on the German lines on the eastern flank. A fierce battle immediately unfolded throughout the area, but in general, the enemy's fierce attacks were blocked by the tenacious elastic defense of the German army.

### US Military Mission Active in the Middle East

Among them, proposals to strengthen winter defense along the lines and to establish suggestion boxes at various stations contributed the most.

### The Collapse of the Enemy's General Counteroffensive - A Dialogue Between Colonel Kurihara, Head of the Naval Reporting Section of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, and Colonel Matsumura, Head of the Army Reporting Section

Making the Possible Possible

Colonel Matsumura: I agree, I agree. What the United States excels at is material, and what Japan excels at is people. Human intelligence, human power, is where the Japanese are most adept. We should develop it to the maximum to compensate for our weakest points. Regarding the human element, which is where Japan excels, we should further develop our strong spiritual power and further stimulate morale. As for the production front, although material is needed, things like breaking through bottlenecks can also be achieved through the power of the human spirit.

Some people tend to think that Japan cannot compare with the United States in terms of material resources. In fact, one of the characteristics of this war is the air war. Therefore, in order to intercept the counterattacks of the United States and Britain, we must also focus on aircraft. If we also focus on the ships that transport war materials from the south, then although the United States considers itself the arsenal of the world, it must also attend to Europe, the Soviet Union, and the Mediterranean. Therefore, even though its productive capacity is strong, as long as Japan's industrial warriors do their best, it is not impossible to compete with them in East Asia. Losing in terms of material resources is due to a lack of effort, and what is deplorable is the lack of effort. Despair is unnecessary.

Colonel Kurihara: I think so too. Japan has already established a self-sufficient economic sphere. If we examine this self-sufficient economy, there will be no difficulties in terms of material even if we fight a war two or three times greater than today. As for manpower, with our single Yamato race at the center, the peoples of Greater East Asia are gladly cooperating and moving forward. In this light, there is no shortage of either manpower or material resources. So, what about production equipment? Frankly speaking, until the start of the war, this was Japan's major weakness, and it is difficult to deny it.

At that time, although various products were made, if you looked closely, all the manufacturing machines were bought from the United States, Britain, and Germany. No matter how difficult a part was to make, we would go to the United States and Britain to buy it. Although we could make it ourselves, it was cheaper to buy it than to make it ourselves. Of course, this is open to criticism, but we bought it simply because buying was cheaper than making it ourselves.

However, once the United States implemented an economic blockade, we could no longer buy anything. So the Japanese unleashed their latent power and started manufacturing themselves, and that is the situation today. As a result, everything is complete in all aspects. So, we have materials, we have people, and we have equipment. What is lacking is effort. Recently, regarding the so-called "bottleneck," some people have said, "The bottleneck is effort." In the past, when we could not buy imported goods, some people said, "The bottleneck is using our ingenuity." I think this is absolutely true. Considering today's Japanese system, there is nothing that makes the impossible possible; it is only making the possible possible. Isn't this the state of affairs in Japan today? From this point of view, as long as we make an effort in this war, the future is truly bright.

In short, whether in terms of war resources or manpower, as long as we make an effort, it is possible to surpass the enemy's production expansion. Therefore, not only we Japanese, but also all the peoples of Greater East Asia, must become one for this purpose. Since the Greater East Asia Conference, this atmosphere seems to have become very strong. Colonel Matsumura is an expert in this area, so let's hear a grand theory...

The Loftiness of the Greater East Asia Declaration

Colonel Matsumura: The five principles announced at the Greater East Asia Conference are: coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promotion of culture, economic prosperity, and contribution to world evolution. These principles were unanimously approved by all the representatives and announced as the guiding principles for the construction of Greater East Asia. This can be said to be a new Magna Carta in international relations, and I think it can regulate future international relations.

These five principles are completely different from the Anglo-American idea of maintaining the status quo based on their own interests. They are truly about coexistence and co-prosperity, and they are about opening up resources, exchanging cultures, and contributing to the evolution of the world. So, it can be said that there has never been such a magnificent declaration. Regarding the practical expression of these principles, there are facts such as the new Sino-Japanese Treaty, the independence of the Philippines, and the independence of Burma. From this, we can see that they are by no means a mere scrap of paper, as the Americans and British say, but have real power. They are not only being implemented now, but can also be implemented in the future.

After the Greater East Asia Conference, a Greater East Asia Ethnic Solidarity Conference was held in Hibiya. The magnificent spirit of the representatives and their will to build Greater East Asia were truly inspiring. In particular, what Ba Maw and Chandra Bose said, even if people who heard it did not agree, could promote the solidarity of Greater East Asia. In this way, Greater East Asia, which had been abused until now, has returned to its original state, and the unification of one billion people is about to be completed. In short, construction has been established. Just as the United States and Britain need time, Japan is also growing stronger day by day. The southern resources you mentioned earlier are truly enormous military resources, and as long as we give it time, they can all be transformed into combat power. It is also a fact that the United States and Britain have long feared the underlying strength of Japan in building Greater East Asia. Therefore, on the other hand, they are racking their brains, wanting to launch counterattacks and decisive battles before these resources are transformed into Japanese combat power. This is the current situation.

Colonel Kurihara: The Greater East Asia Declaration is indeed a magnificent idea. Compared with the ideas of the United States and Britain, there is a world of difference. I am afraid that the Americans and British will not understand such a lofty spirit. Therefore, they are in a hurry to launch a counterattack against Japan. What they are doing is nothing more than fearing that great idea. Only those with a relatively developed culture can understand such a sublime idea. The United States and Britain are utilitarian and materialistic, so even though they sometimes say nice things, there is not a single thing they do that matches their words. But Japan always does what it says. I think that the greatness of Japan lies in this, and the people of the world will surely understand this greatness. Isn't this the time when Japan's spirit of "Hakkō ichiu" is truly communicated?

Japan's Strengths

Colonel Kurihara: If you look at the thoughts of other countries, although they talk a good game, in reality they have no substance. They often talk about equal opportunity and open doors, but this is actually a form of American aggression. Even the Monroe Doctrine they talk about is just a form of aggression. The United States uses the banner of the Monroe Doctrine to carry out the reality of aggression in South America and prevent anyone else from interfering. This is an extremely clever calculation. As for their advocacy of equal opportunity and open doors in the Orient, its meaning is nothing more than "we are going to invade the Orient in the future."

Colonel Matsumura: Looking at the history of the American invasion of Manila, it is truly tragic. In order to start the Spanish-American War, the United States did not hesitate to sink a cruiser itself. In order to gain a foothold in the Orient, the United States designed to start the Spanish-American War in this way. Afterwards, they used the good bait of allowing the Philippines to become independent to lure the Philippine army into resisting the Spanish army. When the US Army arrived from the mainland one after another, and there was no need for the Philippine army, they refused to allow them to enter Manila, which eventually provoked the Philippine-American War. At that time, as many as 600,000 civilians were massacred by the US Army, which is probably unprecedented in human history. This history of atrocities is truly the world's number one. From this, you can see how cruel they are.

Colonel Kurihara: When I was a student at the Military Academy, I heard Admiral Suzuki Kantarō say this: Admiral Perry came to Japan with the purpose of invading Japan. But why didn't he invade Japan and return home empty-handed? It turned out that when Perry landed in Japan, the wife of a Japanese fisherman was leading a toddler to watch their parade. Unexpectedly, her child tripped over a stone, and she kicked the stone away. Then the child laughed and followed along. When Perry saw this scene, he realized that the Japanese were scary. That is to say, he saw the scene of the mother kicking the stone away and the child laughing, and he knew that if he provoked a people with a strong spirit of resistance, the consequences would be very serious. So he dispelled the idea of invasion and obediently returned home. Since Perry, the path they have taken has been the path of aggressors. At the same time, we Japanese have an inherent hatred and aversion to those who are unethical, even three- or four-year-old children have it. And today, it is time for the blood of hatred to boil for the long-term aggression and immorality of the United States. Recently, the enemy's propaganda methods have also revealed their true colors.

### Authorities Actively Dredging Material Sources in Various Regions - Inventory Quantities Must Be Reported by a Deadline

According to sources revealed yesterday, in order to enrich the city's material reserves, the relevant authorities are actively dredging the sources of supplies to be transported to Shanghai for adjustment. At that time, they will be distributed to various companies and businesses for sale to legitimate users to meet market demand and stabilize prices. In order to understand the city's material reserves and facilitate unified allocation, the Municipal Bureau of Economy and other departments previously instructed the various trade associations to inform their member merchants to submit by a deadline the existing materials, items, quantities, storage locations, etc., categorized for verification. Yesterday it was learned that the various industries had already issued orders to handle this matter, but those who have not yet filled out the forms must complete these procedures within the recent period and must not deliberately delay. It is also learned that the city's material reserves are still abundant, and the future supply can be said to be secure. However, items such as rice are related to the source, so the reserves are slightly scarce.

### Second Phase of Soap Available for General Sale Starting Tomorrow - One Bar of Soap Can Be Purchased for Each Coupon

The First District Office issued a notice yesterday that during the period from December 18 to 31 of this year, soap retail stores in the district should sell soap with the No. 2 soap purchase coupons.

### Italian Diplomatic Personnel Stationed in Shanghai Will Be Appointed Soon

Central News Agency: Regarding the issue of Italy's resumption of diplomatic relations among the Axis powers, Hirota, director of the Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy, ​​answered questions from the Chinese press corps at a regular meeting yesterday. Director Hirota said: "The Mussolini Fascist Republican government has been recognized, and Italy's policy and status have also been confirmed. The three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy have concluded an alliance, and the new Mussolini government has appointed an ambassador to begin diplomatic duties. Although Shanghai has not yet recovered, it is believed that Mussolini will appoint someone soon.”

### Feng You Succeeds as Director of the Economic Department of the First District

Central News Agency: Chen Riping, director of the Economic Department of the First District Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality, has been approved to resign due to his mother's death. The vacancy has been filled by Feng You, appointed by the mayor, who took office yesterday. Feng has successively served as Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after returning to the capital, Consul General in Yokohama, and Director of the Tokyo Office of the Central Reserve Bank.

### Japanese Military Police Team in Nanshi Moves to a New Location

Central News Agency: The original site of the former District Court on Penglai Road in Nanshi has been completely completed since the Nanshi Allied Military Police team hired workers to repair it. The Nanshi Allied Military Police team moved to its new location to work yesterday. The building formerly occupied by the team at the Municipal Public Security Bureau has been vacated and will be used by the Second Municipal Police Headquarters. According to a Central News Agency reporter, the bureau is currently preparing for the move, which is expected to be implemented by the end of the year.

### Seeking Remedial Measures for Fuel for Boiled Water Shops

More than 1,000 boiled water shops throughout the city have been forced to suspend business due to their inability to obtain sufficient fuel. The Shanghai Special Municipality Boiled Water Trade Association, in view of the fact that boiled water is an essential beverage for citizens, convened a second board meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss how to remedy the situation. It was decided that since there is no definite date for the allocation of coal, representatives should be sent to Lianmei Coal Company to discuss an early allocation to meet urgent needs. It was also resolved that two directors, Jianming and Zhang Delong, should be responsible for contacting the coal ash supplier, since it is difficult for members to purchase coal ash.

### New Type of Trolleybus to Be Added to Service - Reconstructed from Former Public Buses

According to the "Times" newspaper, a new type of trolleybus will be added to the streets of Shanghai in the spring of March or April, which will greatly improve the overcrowding situation. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a large number of vehicles from the former Shanghai Public Concession China General Omnibus Company have been discontinued. These useless vehicles are now being completely refitted to become electrically powered trolleybuses. They will reappear on the streets of the city in late spring next year. As for the fact that bus motors and trolleybus parts are completely different, it is learned that this refitting work is extremely difficult, but after continuous efforts, one vehicle has been successfully refitted and has undergone numerous rigorous tests and is considered satisfactory. We hope that after these vehicles appear next year, the overcrowding situation on the city's trolleybuses will be greatly improved. The pain felt by office workers and small citizens who are unable to use high-priced vehicles is also the most profound, and we pray for its early realization.

### Contributing Salary to Help Students

Our newspaper received letters yesterday from Mr. Xu Wenzhao and Mr. Jiang Zhonghe: "Wenzhao and Zhonghe were recommended by the Cotton Textile Manufacturers Association to serve on the investigation committee for processors at the purchasing office of the National Commercial Control Association for cotton yarn and cloth. Now that the work of the committee has come to an end, the Commercial Control Association presented each committee member with a gift certificate worth 1,000 yuan. How dare we accept remuneration for serving the public? To refuse would be disrespectful. Therefore, we exchanged the gift certificates for 2,000 yuan in cash and attach it to this letter to help with the newspaper's student aid program." Also yesterday, Mr. Chen Jinji donated 5,000 yuan to the newspaper's student aid fund, demonstrating his enthusiasm for helping students and benefiting the poor. We deeply admire him. The following is a list of student aid funds received yesterday: Chen Jinji, 5,000 yuan; Xu Wenzhao and Jiang Zhonghe (contribution from the Commercial Control Association's remuneration), 1,000 yuan each; Yuan Hui, younger brother of Xiao Yi, and Mr. Zhou, 200 yuan each; Wang Zhen, 150 yuan; Zheng Qiang and Chen Xin Button Factory, 100 yuan each; Ms. Wang De (delivered by Mr. Sun Choucheng), 50 yuan; Liu Anbang and Chen Ziqiao (delivered by Mr. Sun Choucheng), 45 yuan each; Guo Arong, 25 yuan; Zhang Ziqing, 20 yuan; Yan Yunxi and Zhou Yingqing, 5 yuan each.

The former French police arrested Wang and the other three perpetrators. The Special Second Court concluded the trial and sentenced Jin Fugen to death for robbery and murder, and one year of imprisonment for attempted murder.

### Guangtian Information Minister Discusses the World Situation: Firmly Believes Anglo-American Plans Will Be Difficult to Realize

Central News Agency Dispatch: The regular press conference hosted by the Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy was held at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 16th) on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. Information Minister Guangtian and Deputy Consul Fu were present. Minister Guangtian then delivered the following speech on the current world situation:

The Tripartite Alliance Becomes Stronger

Minister Guangtian began by saying: The current world situation is undergoing countless changes in military, political, economic, and diplomatic aspects. I will specifically analyze and clarify this. Generally speaking, the counteroffensive by the anti-axis powers, which began this spring, has now come to an end. Therefore, various parties are harboring doubts about the development of the counteroffensive in East Asia and Europe. However, from the perspective of the Axis powers, Japan and Germany, in addition to defending against the counteroffensive of the anti-axis powers, are strengthening their combat power and planning to launch the next offensive. In other words, our Axis powers are waiting for a good opportunity to attack and have already prepared everything. Furthermore, regarding the general state of the current war, the cooperation between Japan and Germany in political and diplomatic affairs is even closer and more solid. At the same time, Mr. Mussolini's new Fascist Italian Republican government has adopted its consistent policy and is determined to complete the war together with Japan and Germany. From this, it can be seen that the relationship between the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy is becoming increasingly strengthened. As for the war aims of the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy, you are all well aware that they are to build a new world order, which is now gradually being realized. Therefore, this point is a prominent feature in the Axis powers' political and diplomatic affairs.

Establishing the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere

He next stated the aims of the Axis war, saying that everyone knows that the content of Japan's construction of a new order in East Asia is to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In addition, various aspects such as politics, economy, and culture are all sought. The most fundamental issue concerns political demands. The Greater East Asia Conference, a grand meeting unprecedented in world history, was held in Tokyo, and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued, which detailed the situation quite thoroughly. In short, it has broken away from the colonial state of Britain and the United States and ensured the realization of independence and autonomy. Therefore, the construction of a new order in East Asia is not only applicable to the countries of East Asia, but also extends to Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and the countries of West Asia. Regarding the economy, East Asia should break free from the exploitation of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. The economic power of East Asia itself should be fully applied to the construction of East Asia, so that the lives of the people of East Asia are stable. This is the goal of building a new economic order in East Asia. In order to achieve this goal, we must strive for victory. Therefore, we should make every effort to establish an economic organization. Regarding culture, I have a clear ideal for building a new cultural order in East Asia. At present, during the intense war, ordinary people may mistakenly think that cultural work is unimportant. However, cultural work and combat are parallel policies. Therefore, building a new cultural order in East Asia depends on strengthening the spirit. Therefore, we should establish a new order of East Asian spiritual culture.

Restoring East Asian Thought

Regarding the establishment of the East Asian spirit, some people think that learning from British and American culture, following behind them, and developing their own culture is a mistake that should be eliminated. Instead, we should restore East Asian thought and establish it. This is a necessary thing, not only in peacetime but especially in wartime. Therefore, the construction of a new order in East Asia can also be applied to Germany's construction of a new order in Europe. Although the content is slightly different, the spiritual goals of both sides are the same. In particular, the construction of a new order in Europe is to protect the development of European politics, economy, and culture. Its concept should also be in line with the content of the new order in East Asia. Therefore, the principles of both sides are applicable to the construction of a new world order. Therefore, the goal of the Axis powers is to establish peaceful lives for all nations in the world. Looking at the goals and actions of the anti-axis powers, their plans are to exploit all nations, protect their own rights and interests, and oppress small and weak nations. At the recent conferences held by the anti-axis powers in Cairo and Tehran, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union conspired to compress Japan's territory in East Asia and force it to become a third-rate country. In addition, they also restrained China, making China and Japan equal forces and continuing to confront each other permanently. If this attempt were to be realized, all the people of East Asia would be arbitrarily oppressed and exploited by Britain and the United States.

Anglo-American Conspiracy Exposed

At the Cairo Conference, the result of their discussion on economic matters was the proposal to develop China's resources. Therefore, China is completely subjected to the economic oppression and exploitation policies of Britain and the United States. With Song Ziwen as the center, Song is a pro-American faction. This move not only opposes the construction of East Asia, but also uses funds to control China, making China a dependency of Britain and the United States. The oppression of China by Britain and the United States is actively proceeding. We can also feel the suffering of the Philippines, Burma, India, and the South Seas, which have suffered from the harm of Britain and the United States in the past. Looking at the situation in Europe, the British and American sides, under the guise of restoring democracy, are actually engaging in conspiracies and deception. Even the Bartoreo regime in Italy and the de Gaulle and Giraud factions in France have failed to achieve complete unity and are becoming increasingly severe. Moreover, they are tacitly approving the communization of Europe. In short, the anti-axis powers are destroying all nations in the world, using all kinds of despicable methods, especially in politics, economy, and culture, destroying the organization and unity of all nations. This matter was revealed in a speech by former South African Prime Minister Smuts on November 26 of this year, saying that other countries besides Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will be destroyed. Their conspiracy has been exposed. We firmly believe that the plans of Britain and the United States will be difficult to realize. Even looking at the current war, it is enough to prove that the war between Germany and the Soviet Union, especially the Eastern Front, is still in a stalemate. Regarding the Italian front, there is no progress. In addition, the entry of Turkey into the war and the landing in the Balkans have achieved nothing. In the Pacific, the Anglo-American counteroffensive and the Burmese front have suffered heavy blows.

Economic Circles

### Commentary: The People's Livelihood Problem

The theme for the essay contest organized by this newspaper for the New Year's Day of the 33rd year of the Republic of China is specifically focused on the people's livelihood problem, because nothing is more closely related to the people and the public than this problem. What is the people's livelihood problem? People's livelihood is the people's life, the survival of society, the nation's livelihood, and the lives of the masses. It is also the center of politics and economics.

The focus of solving the people's livelihood problem lies in how to solve the four basic needs of life: clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Therefore, in the announcement of this newspaper's essay contest, we specifically cited examples such as the distribution of cotton cloth, increased grain production, improvement of housing rentals, and transportation. Because all such problems are the crux of the wartime people's livelihood problem today. For example, when it comes to the distribution of cotton cloth, how should the distribution plan be written to be ideal? How should cotton cloth production be promoted to strengthen the future of distribution? When it comes to increased grain production, what kinds of regulations should be enacted in politics and law to protect farmers, so as to encourage their production and increase the agricultural products they produce? When it comes to housing rentals, how should the government authorities enforce the "Wartime Rental Law" to reduce the oppression and burden suffered by the common people from the landlord class? When it comes to improving transportation, are there the best methods for grain transportation that can clear its sources? How should public travel be improved to reduce its suffering? The above-mentioned points are only illustrative examples. The solutions to all other problems related to the four needs of clothing, food, housing, and transportation rely on the collective wisdom of the public, so as to provide a reference for the authorities.

### Stock Exchange Strictly Prohibits Stock Brokers from Deliberately Raising Market Prices; Does Not Restrict Legitimate Stock Price Increases

Since the opening of the Chinese stock market in this city's Chinese Stock Exchange, trading has increased substantially. Because the exchange has received inquiries from various parties saying that the exchange's brokers are being contacted by people who are deliberately suppressing the market price of their stocks and transferring them to the brokers, and giving them special benefits, thereby making their stocks rise higher and higher in order to profit from it. This kind of activity may have other purposes and is similar to covert speculation and manipulation. The exchange yesterday earnestly advised all brokers not to be greedy for small profits, to take care of their own credit and stabilize the market price, and to refuse to cooperate with those who deliberately raise stock prices. Otherwise, they will be severely punished in accordance with the provisions of Articles 32 and 71, Item 1 of the business rules. It is also clarified that legitimate stock price increases are not restricted.

### Bank of Communications Plans to Establish Agricultural Economic Offices in Various Places

Grades D and E bonds each fell slightly.

Silver Interbank Lending: The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association last night suddenly increased by one minute, to 17%. The silver market seemed to be more active.

Grain: The market conditions yesterday unanimously rose sharply. The rice market rose sharply due to the lack of incoming goods and the enthusiastic purchases by citizens. The quoted price rose sharply, significantly higher than before. Oil merchants also continued to raise prices, showing an upward trend.

Daily Necessities: Candle prices hit new highs again, with few sales. There were prices but no market. The prices of matches and soap remained the same as the previous day.

### Brief News

Mr. Jin Zongcheng, Mr. Zhang Wenkui, Mr. Chen Kechang, and other figures in the financial community of this city have initiated the organization of the Greater China Automobile Co., Ltd., which has already begun to raise capital. There has been a very enthusiastic response from subscribers. This is because the purpose of the company is different from that of ordinary automobile companies in the market, which specialize in business trips. Its main business is to operate various automobiles and all their accessories, and to manufacture coal-fired oil-substituting furnaces and alcohol gasifiers, in order to become a large-scale automobile company independently operated by the Chinese.

Opening of the Huatong Commercial Bank: The Huatong Commercial Bank of this city, having selected 341 Shandong Road as its location, officially opened yesterday morning.

### Should Night Schools Restrict Electricity Use?

— Cold Eyes

Shanghai is a decadent society. In this extraordinary period, everyone is still indulging in red wine and silk, singing and dancing, living a decadent life, which is really wrong. Now the authorities are strictly restricting electricity use, which is truly a good medicine to cure the decadent life of Shanghai people.

However, regarding the restriction of electricity use, I also have some small opinions, that is, we cannot generalize the restrictions. For example, users who are really making efforts to save electricity and have already saved as much as they can, and further restricting them is simply equivalent to asking them not to use electricity; a user who does not usually save electricity, and now wants him to save electricity, then he is only suffering a little, and electricity can still be used. Isn't this very unfair? Shanghai society has many night schools because of its special circumstances. There is a close relationship between night schools and electric lights. Many night schools, in the past two years, due to the high prices and the authorities' repeated announcements restricting electricity use, have already been very frugal in their electricity use before this announcement. As far as I know, some tutoring schools used to use 70-watt light bulbs a year or two ago, but have now changed to 40-watt light bulbs in order to save electricity. If they are now asked to reduce further, it will have a great impact on the students' eyesight; reducing classrooms is simply impossible. So how can they save more? Even in terms of home use, I used to have three lights, which were 40 watts, 15 watts, and 5 watts, for a total of 60 watts. Now, because of financial difficulties, a year and a half ago, I had already reduced the 60 watts to one 5-watt light.

Restricting electricity use is of course possible, but I think the restrictions should depend on the place. For example, dance halls and such places are only for people who are full and not hungry. If we want to save electricity, these places should be paid attention to. Various clan halls, calling for guides and playing mahjong all night, are also places that make people's lives decadent. I think they should also be large mansions, with many rooms and few residents. Even if you ask them to save 90% of their electricity, they will not be without light.

In short, the authorities should have a strict plan when restricting electricity use. Otherwise, those who waste electricity will still have electricity to use, while those who have already been frugal will be living in a dark world. Furthermore, the authorities have already made regulations for the disputes between second landlords and third tenants, but the authorities must also make regulations for the method of water and electricity charges, so as to avoid endless disputes. This is related to local security!

— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Nine

In Zhenren's twelfth spring, the Gu family was all stable. They were all used to life without a father. And they were not the same as when their father was alive.

Such changes also occurred in Zhenren's young heart. The habit of smiling and showing his front teeth was still the same, but in that smile, there was a very strong and amazing resilience.

"Brother, why did you leave before me?"

One morning, his brother Taro went to school a step earlier than him, so he chased after him and protested like this. Because his tone was quite possessive, Taro couldn't answer him for a while.

Also, when he got to school, he would climb on the iron bars whenever he had free time. His apple-like face became even redder, and he勉强 rotated on the iron bars.

"Shrimp jumps into the cauldron, very fierce!"

No matter how much the children teased him, he did not stop calisthenics. It was not that he already liked calisthenics, but because he didn't like himself having unsatisfactory subjects.

Zhenren was unwilling to let others get ahead, from the bottom of his heart.

Don't succumb to others - since his father was gone, he didn't know when he had this idea. Although he was still a child, he also saw his mother's appearance of being busy all day long. He was also deeply moved by the actions of his older brother, 四吉, who did not say a word of complaint after dropping out of school and working in the store. Everyone seemed to be competing against something, all seemed to be resisting the bullying of outsiders.

"I can't succumb to others either."

He made up his mind in his small chest. The local custom was that no child was willing to let others get ahead, but few people had as strong a will as Zhenren. Although that was the case, he was not often seen quarreling with other children. Because there was no opportunity to quarrel. His unwillingness to let others get ahead was hidden in his gentle smile, so even those who were rough-tempered unconsciously passed by. The two famous children's games in Satsuma - "Seizing the General" and "No Begging for Mercy" - in this kind of pretend-quarreling situation, Zhenren's unwillingness to let others get ahead attracted the attention of the children.

"Seizing the General" was two classes of children, bare-chested, with headbands tied on their heads, fighting each other to protect their own general from being knocked down, mutually fighting and mutually defending. In other metropolitan elementary schools, this was a prohibited game. "No Begging for Mercy" was a struggle in which individuals were the unit, but it could also be a group. The two sides hit each other, and the side that said "beg for mercy" within a certain period of time lost. This was a traditional game for athletes, and it was still being carried on in elementary schools.

The thin and weak Zhenren was immediately knocked to the ground. After falling, he still had to resist for a long time.

"Beg for mercy?"

"No."

Even though his red face was pressed into the sand and his breath was almost suffocated, Zhenren did not beg for mercy. He could not be bullied.

### Family Fuel Saving Methods

Recently, coal has been scarce and expensive, and users should urgently seek ways to save fuel. A few methods are listed below: Whether the type of stove is appropriate, whether the type of fuel is suitable, the size of the ventilation holes, the spacing of the furnace grate bars, whether adding coal is even and appropriate, and whether removing ashes is complete - all the advantages and disadvantages of the equipment and the skill of management are greatly related to fuel saving. All those in charge of such matters should pay attention at all times and closely monitor based on experience, so as to achieve the goal of frugality. Everyday washing can be changed to using cold water, which not only saves fuel, but also promotes the cold resistance of the skin and is beneficial to hygiene. If it is not possible to change immediately, you can first use warm water, then lukewarm water, and then change to cold water. Foods that do not need to be eaten hot can generally be eaten cold. All vegetables, meat, fish, and other items only need to be cooked thoroughly and cleanly to be hygienic, regardless of whether they are eaten hot or cold. Those who use bread instead of rice will find cold food more comfortable. If you find it too cold, you only need to use hot tea or hot soup to accompany it, and you will find it not difficult at all. All items that must be eaten hot should be eaten while they are still hot, and do not reheat them after they have cooled, which would waste fuel. All items that can be combined and cooked in one pot (such as steaming and stewing methods) should be combined and cooked in the same pot as much as possible to save fuel. Families with a small population can eat at the homes of nearby relatives and friends. As long as you are calm and peaceful, nothing is impossible to cooperate with, and you can achieve the effect of saving money. Those who live in the same house but get along well can jointly set up a cooking stove or jointly build a stove and share the costs equally. Try to save the time it takes to start a fire in the stove, and strive to complete tasks such as cooking rice, vegetables, and water continuously in the shortest possible time, and extinguish the fire as soon as the work is completed. If cooked food or hot water needs to be kept hot, you may want to prepare more insulated bottles or heat preservers (such as heat preservers made of straw nests, cotton wool, or asbestos) to store them.

### Impressions of the Eryou Exhibition

— Manwen

The calligraphy, painting, and epigraphy exhibition hosted by the Hongying Library, gathering the finest works of over two hundred famous artists from across the country and exhibiting them at the China Art Gallery, deeply impressed this writer upon visiting yesterday. The walls were adorned with a dazzling array of beautiful works, incomparable to ordinary calligraphy and painting exhibitions.

Among the exhibitors were calligraphers such as Wang Fuchang, Ye Yuhu, Chen Taoyi, Shen Xinqing, Bai Jiao, Ma Gongyu, Fen Weng, and Feng Wenfeng; painters such as Xia Jiancheng, Tang Dingzhi, Feng Chaoran, Wu Daiqiu, Wu Hufan, Tang Yun, Zhu Yachen, Wu Qingxia, Zhou Lianxia, Gu Qingyao, Li Qiujun, Chen Xiaocui, and Pang Zuoyu, all well-known to society. Listing all of their works would be exhaustive. There were also rare and valuable pieces such as Dr. Mei Pohua's "Jin Mei" (Exhausted Plum Blossoms), couplets and scrolls by Jiang Zhuzhuang, Ma Xulun, Li Bake, Zhang Jusheng, and Yuan Xiluo. Various Hanlin scholars and grand historians also contributed works. Shen Maishi's landscapes and flowers, with brushwork and artistic conception that were both exquisite, belonged to an old master. Zhou Shushun's flowers and birds, with their colors and brushstrokes, were refined and transcendent, and hard to come by. Gu Yaojun's clerical script and Feng Wen's script could be called twin jade perfections. The calligraphy couplet of the twelve-year-old Chen Hanshi demonstrated mature brushwork. In addition, there was a special item displayed in the same cabinet as the epigraphy works: a handscroll in the Ouyang Xun style of calligraphy, an imperial edict bestowed upon the Gu family by the Wanli Emperor, priced at 250,000 yuan for a charity auction, making it an especially rare treasure.

It is said that all the proceeds from the sales will be used for the Hongying Library's expenses. Visitors and buyers have been coming in a continuous stream, both contributing to a charitable cause and feasting their eyes.
