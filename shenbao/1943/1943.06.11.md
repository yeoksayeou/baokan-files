### Hoping Wealthy Classes Will Voluntarily Donate

Since the establishment of the Shanghai All Circles North China Relief Association, fundraising efforts have been underway in various ways. We have repeatedly stated before that disaster relief is like fighting a fire, and everything must be handled quickly and efficiently. It is said that the authorities of the Relief Association also attach great importance to this point and have reversed the bureaucratic habits of circuitousness and formality, which is gratifying. We believe that if this style can be carried through to the end, the North China disaster victims will directly benefit. On the other hand, people from all walks of life will have confidence in this kind of disaster relief, and they will be willing to donate more, thereby enriching the amount of donations, strengthening the power of relief, and saving more North China disaster victims, which is also expected.

We once agreed with Mr. Lin Kanghou's suggestion that if we wait until the donations are fully collected before purchasing relief supplies and distributing them, it will be too slow to meet the urgent need. We must first borrow funds from the national bank and then gradually repay the loans with the donations received. This method seems to be feasible in terms of both reason and emotion. Because the national bank is established by the government, and it is the government's responsibility to provide relief to disaster victims. Mr. Lin Kanghou is now one of the actual persons in charge of the Relief Association, so we believe that Mr. Lin must be doing his best to promote the realization of his suggestion!

However, although we suggest that the bank provide loans, the loans must be repaid after all. Therefore, how to step up fundraising is still the most important issue. Whether it is to repay loans or directly purchase relief supplies, we must ultimately have relief funds to use.

The Relief Association has already set a plan for fundraising and is implementing it accordingly. However, the essence of this plan can only be said to be "wishful thinking." In fact, it is entirely entrusted to the donors' spontaneous sympathy. If the donors' sympathy is not aroused enthusiastically, then the plan will become a dead letter, and the provisions in the plan will not be effective. This is not to say that the plan is useless, but that it is even more necessary to arouse the donors' high degree of sympathy and enthusiastic support. Only then can the plan achieve practical results. For example, the plan stipulates to hold a charity ball game, and the tickets are sold particularly high than usual. We hope that those who have the strength and enjoy ball games will first initiate the psychology of sympathizing with the disaster victims, regardless of whether the ticket price matches the ball game or not, and should have the generous spirit of "donating even if there is no ball game to watch," and regard watching the ball game as "extra income." With such a mentality supporting this charity game, participation will be enthusiastic, income will increase, and the plan will achieve practical results.

Today, we sincerely represent the North China disaster victims in expressing our most sincere hopes to the citizens of the whole city—especially the ladies of the wealthy class—for the highest degree of spontaneous sympathy, generous donations, and active support. Please pay donations at the designated nearby banks and money houses of the Relief Association. The more the better, the continuous stream. We have carefully examined the past lists of donations collected on behalf of the News and this newspaper, as well as the actual situation at the time of payment. Although there are a few donations from the wealthy class, the salary and working class account for the majority. Although we dare not say that the wealthier the class, the more focused on enjoying themselves and lacking sympathy. However, the current reality is that the salary and working class have a higher degree of sympathy. Conversely, the number of wealthy class is not as large as the working class, so the number of donors is not as large as the working class. However, we want to assert that all the ladies who are happily enjoying themselves in the aristocratic dance halls, restaurants, tea rooms, hotels, theaters, and other places in Shanghai when the lights are on, are qualified for the wealthy class, and this number will definitely not be too small. We sincerely urge these ladies to spontaneously initiate the noblest sympathy of mankind, and send a portion of their expenses to the nearby disaster relief collection agencies. We believe that this amount must be more than the contribution of the salary and working public. It seems to be a drop in the bucket for the wealthy class, but the North China disaster victims will regard it as righteous grain and benevolent slurry.

We further offer a little opinion to the wealthy class. We have already discussed the life outlook of donating money. Donating money is a noble, supreme, and joyful act for individuals to broaden their horizons and see the interests clearly, and it is the noblest moral expression that comes from the heart and sincerity, which cannot be forced by others in the slightest. But as the saying goes, "A rich man's feast, a poor man's half-year's food." Now it is "A rich man's feast, ten disaster victims' lives." People are not made of wood or stone, how can they not be moved by their sympathy and express their highest morality? As for enjoying oneself while ten thousand people are starving and freezing, gathering a lot of money and not using it, it is unkind and unjust, and obsessed with money. How can one not broaden one's horizons, help others to help themselves, and express the act of supreme goodness and joy? In short, hoarding money is useless, only to harm oneself, or even harm one's descendants. Using it properly is not letting down the money. Gathering it and not using it is being obsessed with money. Donating what I have left over and saving people from death is using it properly, and I am also happy. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the ladies of the wealthy class in the whole city will launch the highest sympathy and generously donate, which is fortunate for the disaster victims.

In addition, since the North China Relief Association has been established in this city, and there is a unified leading agency, for the sake of concentrating forces, all relief affairs should be presided over by the association. For example, this newspaper's collection of donations on behalf of the association was an expedient measure before the association was established. Now that the association has designated banks and money houses to collect donations on its behalf, it should be transferred, and the collection on behalf of the association has been stopped since yesterday. It is hoped that all aspects of this city's actions to provide disaster relief to North China will not be carried out independently, merely dispersing forces. This is a step that should be taken under the same goal of providing relief to disaster victims, to concentrate power and enhance strength. It is hoped that the separate organizations that existed before the establishment of the Relief Association will promptly establish close contact with the association and proceed in unison.

### National Defense Conference Passes Wartime Cultural Propaganda Outline; Appoints Rong Zhen and Zhang Xueming as Military Commissioners

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Supreme National Defense Conference held its 17th meeting on the 10th to discuss various important proposals, the most important of which was the chairman's submission of the basic outline of wartime cultural propaganda policy. The case is divided into three parts: first, the guiding principles; second, the main points; and third, the implementation. The main points section is divided into seven items, and the implementation section is divided into eleven items, all of which have clear provisions for strengthening the national wartime consciousness, rebuilding Chinese culture, and reviving East Asian culture. The case will be sent to the National Government for promulgation and will be uniformly followed throughout the country as the highest standard for wartime cultural propaganda. In addition, the draft organization law of the Department of Health was also approved in principle. It will be implemented first and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. In terms of personnel, Rong Zhen and Zhang Xueming were specially appointed as members of the Military Commission.

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – Rong Zhen and Zhang Xueming, the newly appointed members of the Military Commission who were approved by the 17th Supreme National Defense Conference, are both from the old Northeast Army. According to reports, Commissioner Rong Zhen is over sixty years old and was a subordinate of General Zhang Zuolin of the Northeast Army, serving as regimental, brigade, and division commander, and even as the Chief of General Staff of the Northeast Frontier Defense Army. Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng, who recently participated in the peace movement, is his eldest son. After the incident, Mr. Rong retired to Beijing but was very concerned about national affairs. This time, being appointed to the National Government's Military Commission with the qualifications of a senior member of the Northeast Army has its significance. Mr. Zhang Xueming is the younger brother of General Zhang Xueliang and once served as a brigade commander in the Northeast Army (with the rank of major general). After the incident, he served as the garrison commander of Tianjin and was a powerful figure in the political circles of North China at that time. Mr. Zhang then went to Western countries to study military affairs. He returned to Hong Kong two months before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. At that time, Mr. Zhang had intended to participate in the peace movement. This year, he flew to Nanjing to pay his respects to the government authorities and was deeply valued by the authorities. After being appointed to the Military Commission this time, the personnel of the central military organs have been further strengthened. Although Mr. Zhang is only over forty years old, he is full of vigor and is a pure military figure.

### Japanese Army in Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Conducts Comprehensive Operations Last Month

Shijiazhuang, 10th (Central News Agency) – A certain unit of the local Japanese army announced on the 10th that the comprehensive results of the Japanese army's May operations to mop up the Communist troops in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region (including the operations in western Hebei) and the achievements of the Chinese armed groups are as follows: (1) Comprehensive results of the Japanese army: 541 engagements, 918 Communist troops engaged in battle, 3,513 Communist troops abandoned their bodies, 2,257 were captured, the Japanese army seized 30 mortars, 1 heavy machine gun, 33 light machine guns, 1,083 rifles, 16 automatic rifles, 645 bayonets, 100 rounds of heavy machine gun ammunition, 895 rounds of light machine gun ammunition, 56,888 rounds of rifle ammunition, and destroyed 247 facilities. (2) Achievements of the battles with the Chinese armed groups: 23 engagements, 1,102 Communist troops engaged in battle, 171 Communist troops abandoned their bodies, 251 were captured, and the Communist army seized 1 mortar, 1 light machine gun, 68 rifles, 6 automatic rifles, and 75 pistols.

### Sightseeing Group of Japanese Reporters in Beiping Pays Respects to Chairman

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The sightseeing group of Japanese reporters from Beiping visited the Central Military Academy yesterday (the 10th) morning and visited Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department, Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry in the afternoon. They also went to the Chairman's residence at 4 p.m. to pay their respects to the Chairman. It is learned that the group will take the train to Shanghai early this morning, the 11th.

### Severe Drought in Chongqing; Food Supplies Cause Panic

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The shortage of food in various parts of Chongqing has become more acute during this lean season due to the reduction in agricultural production, the forced conscription of the army, and the drought. According to reliable sources received here, the drought in various parts of Chongqing in southern China is rare in recent years. Starving people are everywhere, and desolate scenes are everywhere, which is unbearable to witness. Due to the severe lack of rainfall in various parts of Chongqing in Guangdong and Fujian provinces in March, April, and May, it has had a huge impact on agricultural production. Therefore, Xiang Hanping, the commander-in-chief of the Chongqing (border area of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces), specially issued a notice to make it possible to reclaim Nanfeng, Yihuangxia. The Jiangshuifeng and other places (all in Jiangxi Province) have 85,000 mu of cultivated land. It is reported that 50,000 disaster victims are planned to be accommodated, but the number of refugees flowing into the area has now exceeded 100,000, so food is even more insufficient. 10,500 people have now starved to death in the area, so the refugees are fleeing to peaceful areas, with thousands of people every day, but these refugees mostly starve to death on the way before reaching their destination, and the Chongqing county governments and border command do not care about their exposure. Given this situation, the food panic in Chongqing will further promote the people under its rule to admire peace.

### Ministry of Education to Issue Primary and Secondary School Textbooks in the Autumn; Books to be Sold Immediately

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – Since the issuance of the state-approved primary and secondary school textbooks, schools across the country have followed them uniformly. Recently, the Ministry of Education learned from the report of the General Distribution Office of the National Textbooks for the Spring of the 32nd Year of the Republic of China that the distribution of the National Textbooks for the Spring of this year has been completed by the end of this month. As for the general management of the National Primary and Secondary School Textbooks for the Autumn of this year, the China United Publishing Co., Ltd., which was jointly established by major bookstores in the Shanghai publishing industry, is responsible for undertaking it, and it has also been submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval. Recently, a person in charge of the Ministry of Education announced that the promotion and sale of state-approved primary and secondary school textbooks in the future should be sought universally. In addition to the Ministry of Education's formulation of the state-approved primary and secondary school textbook sales regulations and ordering the China United Publishing Company to abide by them, the Ministry of Education will also separately notify the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities under its jurisdiction and send letters to the relevant agencies to assist in the promotion. Before the opening of school in the autumn of this year, the supply of state-approved primary and secondary school textbooks has been prepared early, and major bookstores across the country will soon be able to sell them simultaneously.

### Frontal Conflict to Occur Between Chongqing and Communist Armies in Northwest China

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to a special Shanghai dispatch carried by the local Mainichi Shimbun, it has been a week since the Chinese Communist Party announced the resolution to dissolve the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, etc., and Chongqing has remained silent, which is enough to prove the depth of its shock. Since the Chinese Communist Party severed its ties with Moscow, it has made superficial concessions to Chongqing and Chiang by abolishing the Border Region Government in order to seek self-reliance and cleverly avoid Chongqing's offensive. At the same time, it is taking the opportunity to demand that the Chinese Communist Party be granted legal status in order to resolve this long-standing issue. However, although Chongqing believes that the abolition of the Border Region Government will at least nominally expand Chongqing's political power and further strengthen the national united front, it feels that the gains do not outweigh the losses based on this proposal, so it feels very difficult. Therefore, the conflict between Chongqing and the Communist Party has been caused again by the Chinese Communist Party's actions of abandoning name and taking reality this time. The Chinese Communist Party originally borrowed the dual names of the International Communist Party branch and the Border Region Government to gain an advantageous position to suck up the people, and openly propagandize and expand its territory under the name of the national united front and patriotism. At the same time, since Chongqing wants to use the northwest as the last base for the war of resistance, it is inevitable that Chongqing and the Communist Party will compete fiercely for territory in the northwest. In addition, what is most noteworthy in this regard is that Chongqing has recently implemented the reduction of the area of each province and the increase in the number of provinces in order to allow its political power to penetrate into various localities. In addition, after the dissolution of the International Communist Party, the Chinese Communist Party's organ newspaper Xinhua Daily once commented: "The Chinese Communist Party will continue to exist regardless of whether the International Communist Party exists or not. Because the current Central Government has made leaps and bounds in all aspects of party politics and military affairs that are more than five times greater than when it was established, the Chinese Communist Party must still strive to expand and strengthen after the dissolution of the International Communist Party," and so on. Judging from this, it can be concluded that Chongqing and the Communist Party will inevitably have a frontal conflict in the northwest. In addition, the Chinese Communist Party attempted to realize the state of the Wuhan government during the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in this proposal, and demanded that Chongqing recognize the Chinese Communist Party as a legal party, so that Chinese Communist Party members and Chongqing party members have the same qualifications to participate in politics, and the Chinese Communist Party headquarters can enter and exit Chongqing. However, Chongqing feels very uneasy about this. And this time, the Chinese Communist Party admitted that it would place the Communist army under the command of the Chongqing Military Commission, and demanded that the Chinese Communist Party be allowed to retain the actual command of the Communist army and be paid all military expenses. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Communist army has nominally been reorganized into the Eighteenth Group Army, but in reality, it is still entirely commanded by the Chinese Communist Party itself, so its demands this time are obviously still the same as before, only in form, and its intention is actually to erase the New Fourth Army Incident in January of the year before last and attempt to rebuild the New Fourth Army. As for the issue of military expenses, the military expenses currently paid by Chongqing for the tens of thousands of Communist troops nominally under the Chongqing Military Commission are extremely small. Because Chongqing still feels that the military expenses for the direct troops are insufficient, it is even more powerless to take care of the Communist army, so the situation in which the Chongqing and Communist armies compete for territory in order to be self-sufficient will inevitably become more and more intense.

Yujing, 10th (Central News Agency) – Although Chongqing and the Communist Party are nominally cooperating now, they are still mutually rubbing and fighting in the dark. Since April 1938, until recently, there have been more than 100 large and small such infighting incidents. Recently, Chongqing's offensive against the Communist Party has become increasingly active, and the mutual infighting between the two sides will become more intense. The reasons are: (1) Recently, Chongqing intends to resolve the Communist Party issue purely as an internal issue. This tendency has become more obvious since the dissolution of the International Communist Party some time ago. (2) Due to military failures and the hardship of the people's lives, Chongqing is actively focusing on cultivating combat power in order to recover the depressed morale of the people. Therefore, it is strictly forbidding the armed factions to make trouble internally. (3) Chongqing's attitude towards the Communist Party is that although it recognizes the status of the Communist Party after the dissolution of the International Communist regime, it does not recognize any armed groups other than the Chongqing army. Therefore, the Communist army, which attempts to invade the Chongqing army's territory, is of course dissatisfied with being restricted under this coercion.

### Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Formulate Concrete Measures for Receiving French Concession in Shanghai

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – Our government has successfully completed the reception of the French-administered concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. The issue of receiving the French Concession in Shanghai will begin soon. Yesterday afternoon, Minister of Foreign Affairs Chu Minyi specially invited Receiver Xia Qifeng, the Minister of Auditing, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the direction of the proceedings. It is learned that concrete measures have been formulated and will be actively negotiated with the French side in the coming days.

### Comprehensive Results of Japanese Air Force in South Pacific; Destroyed Over 200 Enemy Aircraft in Three Months

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The decisive battle between the Japanese and American air forces in the South Pacific is becoming more and more intense. Although the enemy aircraft stubbornly attempted to counterattack, the Japanese army and navy air force units actively bombed the enemy's forward bases after advancing to Guadalcanal Island, and severely damaged the attacking enemy aircraft. The Japanese army and navy ground forces also severely damaged the enemy aircraft that came to air raid day and night in close connection with the air force units. The Japanese army's war results announced by the Japanese headquarters today: a total of 249 enemy aircraft were shot down and destroyed independently by Japanese anti-aircraft artillery fire in the three months from March to May. This is enough to prove the strength of the Japanese army's anti-aircraft guns and other anti-aircraft fire, which has obviously improved compared to before the war. Therefore, the enemy air force does not dare to enter the power circle of the Japanese high-altitude guns and only hovers in the vicinity of its periphery. This also shows that the enemy's power has been weakened. In addition, the captured enemy air force personnel were all deeply amazed by the power of the Japanese army's anti-aircraft guns, which clearly shows that the enemy has been threatened by the Japanese ground anti-aircraft weapons. In addition, the number of times enemy aircraft raided New Guinea Island and the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific has reached 1,600 per month since February. However, the Japanese army front-line soldiers calmly dealt with them and maneuvered with them, often overcoming all difficulties and grasping the anti-aircraft situation, so they were able to obtain this great war result. This is the gift of the Japanese army's unyielding fighting spirit, and the enemy aircraft avoided the day raids and used the night due to excessive damage. However, because the Japanese army's anti-aircraft artillery fire is extremely accurate, the enemy army often dropped bombs from high altitude and then fled in a hurry. Occasionally, there were brave enemy aircraft that turned their noses to Japan and fired machine guns on the ground after seeing that the situation was favorable. Therefore, the Japanese ground anti-aircraft units never slackened for a moment and were very accurate and rapid in their air strikes, so the enemy aircraft immediately fled. The main types of enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed by the Japanese army ground anti-aircraft units include the Giant P38, P39, P40, and Asa bombers, which are the latest fighters and bombers boasted by the enemy.

### Reshuffle of Japanese Army Officials

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Lieutenant General Tadashi Sano, who had outstanding military exploits during the Hong Kong operation, and later made immortal feats on the southern front, was suddenly appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Eastern Defense Headquarters after Lieutenant General Asasaburo Kobayashi. In addition, Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the Chief of Staff of the troops in China, has now been appointed as the Commander of the Tokyo Division. In addition, Lieutenant General Shizuo Sakaguchi, who was famous in the Java Capture Operation, has now been appointed as the Commander of the Zentsuji Division. The above three lieutenant generals and seven major generals including Katsuzo Matsuoka have been transferred. The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced this on the 10th.

### Lieutenant General Iwao Sodeshiro Sacrifices His Life for the Country in Burma

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Lieutenant General Iwao Sodeshiro of the Japanese Army died in battle near Burma and Thailand on January 26 at the age of 52. He graduated from the Army University in the 14th year of Taisho (1925), served as a staff officer of the Nagoya Division in the 9th year of Showa (1934), promoted to Colonel in March of the 13th year of Showa (1938), promoted to Major General in March of the 16th year of Showa (1941), and served as the commander of the stationed Manchurian troops, and in September of the 17th year of Showa (1942), he served as the commander of the first-line troops in the South.

### Tokyo Metropolitan System Bill Passes Japanese Cabinet Meeting

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Tokyo Metropolitan System Bill passed the Japanese Cabinet meeting on May 11 and will be implemented from July 1. From then on, Tokyo will be free from the disadvantages of the double administrative structure of the government and the city. Recently, the Privy Council has been carefully deliberating on the essential outline of its official system, and the final decision was made at the Privy Council meeting on the 9th. According to the essential outline of the official system, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has a grand structure that is not weaker than the central provinces, so it was decided that the head of the metropolitan government would be specially appointed, and there would be one assistant administrator of a simplified rank below him, who would be the highest assistant official of the metropolitan government. In addition to the chief officer's office in the metropolitan area, there are eight bureaus: Civil Affairs, Education, Economy, Planning, Defense, Transportation, Water Supply, and Port. The directors of each bureau are all of simplified rank, which is much simpler than the current Tokyo city agency (mayor's office with nine bureaus and two departments).

### Burmese Inspection Group Arrives in Japan

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – After the Burmese autonomous government official Ba Maw and others visited Japan, the country is actively moving towards the path of independence. Since the establishment of the Independence Preparatory Committee on May 8, each department has actively carried out various preparations for independence. Recently, the core members of the Burmese government's political parties, youth movements, and industrial relations decided to send an inspection group to visit Japan in order to understand the situation in Japan and contribute to the establishment of a new Burma. The group is headed by U Ni, with a total of 28 members. The group arrived in Moji at 3:30 pm on the 10th and is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on the 12th of this month for a one-week stay to conduct a detailed study of Japan's administrative, police, industrial, educational, cultural, and other aspects under the decisive battle system. After personally experiencing the reality of wartime Japan, they will strengthen their determination to build a new Burma.

### Comparison of Wartime Manpower Between Axis and Anti-Axis Powers

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to German news agency reports, the German Labor Minister declared to foreign reporters yesterday that the manpower on the Allied side has decreased by a quarter, while the manpower on the Axis side has increased sixfold. The current ratio of manpower between the Axis and Allied powers is 9 to 11, that is, 850 million people are on the Axis side, and 1.1 billion people are on the Allied side. Mr. Smith continued that during the First World War, the population on both sides was 136 million and 141.1 million, that is, a ratio of 1 to 10. The sixfold increase in manpower on the Axis side this time includes Japan. Even in Europe, the manpower on the Axis side has increased by two and a half times. From another perspective, there are 72 people living on every square kilometer in Axis Europe, while there are only 7 people in the United States and only 1.3 people in Australia. In this way, the people of Axis Europe and East Asia must still fight for survival. This natural training, coupled with intensive learning, and what is more, the Axis side also has excellent experience in technology. Mr. Smith declared in his conclusion that Germany's fixed labor force is due to the health of the German people.

### US Envoy to India Meets with Roosevelt

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to Washington sources, President Roosevelt's envoy to India, Phillips, had lunch at the White House yesterday and met with the President. Mr. Phillips returned to Washington from New Delhi a few weeks ago to report to the President on the situation in India.

### The Path of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation (3)

— Juichi Tsushima

Currently, there is no one in the Chinese government or among the people who is not grateful for Japan's new policy of strengthening the political power of the National Government, reforming administrative institutions, and promoting economic measures. Everything is progressing. The autonomous activities of Chinese civilian economists and a system to assist government policies are gradually being established. Even the Political Affairs Committee in North China has strengthened its lineup, reorganized the Xinminhui, and newly established the North China Anti-Communist Committee to unify and strengthen the various agencies involved in anti-communist work in North China.  The establishment of the North China Material and Price Control Committee is truly a breath of fresh air. At the same time, the people have risen to respond and establish a cooperative system. The recent joint organization of various economic groups and business circles in North China, the "North China Price Cooperation Committee," is clear evidence of this civilian assistance to the authorities. In short, the post-war movement of China is aimed at enhancing combat power through the combined strength of China and Japan, which is a gratifying phenomenon.

At this time, the economic status of North China is becoming increasingly important. North China has inexhaustible military supply resources and abundant human resources. In the past, emphasis was placed on development and increased production to meet Japan's needs, and considerable achievements have been made. Among them, the clearly investigated reserves of coal, a basic military supply material, amount to 1.7 billion tons. With such abundant coal, it is no exaggeration to say that coal is everywhere in North China. Moreover, the quality of coal in North China is not only impressive in quantity but also of a quality not found elsewhere. Therefore, its production exceeds the planned target and increases year by year, fully achieving the two major goals of increasing production and increasing exports to Japan. Regarding iron ore, there are huge reserves in Longyan, Jinlingzhen, and other places. In addition to meeting local needs, there is also the possibility of increasing exports to other places. Regarding ironmaking, due to the establishment of the North China Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., a large-scale ironmaking plan has been implemented. At the same time, small-scale smelting furnaces are being built to meet urgent needs, and ironmaking has already begun in various parts of North China, taking into account the production areas of iron ore and coal. When this plan is realized, it will surely supply a huge amount of steel. As for alumina shale, there are extremely large reserves in Yidong and Zibo, Shandong Province. Like refined aluminum, it is an indispensable raw material for manufacturing alumina and firebricks and production is currently being increased.

Regarding salt, the Changlu and Shandong salt fields are the largest production areas in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Due to its inherent characteristics and effective management, last year's results showed great progress and exceeded the original plan, achieving the goal of supplying Japan. This year, further increases in production are expected. Salt used in industry within the Greater East Asia Sphere will not be in short supply and can fully rely on North China salt. In addition, cotton, the most important wartime material, is also being produced according to the increased production plan. North China has always been known as the largest source of cotton supply within the Greater East Asia Sphere. There are also other important industries, which will not be discussed for the time being. However, in summary, the immediate priorities are to find ways to increase the production of these raw material resources, while striving to produce these raw materials locally, and seeking to adjust transportation capacity. For example, the ironmaking industry mentioned above, various industries using coal as raw material, the chemical industry using salt as raw material, and the fiber industry using cotton as raw material are all economic missions that North China should shoulder in the future. In order to meet this need, various policies have been implemented and will be gradually promoted in the future.

At the same time, the most important thing is the exchange and cooperation of manpower and capital between China and Japan. I believe this is the true meaning of China's participation in the war. This kind of thing has already been realized in the important parts of the North China economy, and in the future, China's manpower and financial resources are also expected to increase to these important industrial parts. It is estimated that tens of millions of yuan will be needed annually for the expansion and addition of various important industries. The allocation of these huge funds will be partially supported by the domestic Japanese market, and at the same time, they will be allocated as much as possible locally, in preparation for gradual implementation. The local allocation of industrial funds has been advocated for many years, but in the past, there was very little industrial capital that could be allocated locally. Fortunately, the timing is now ripe, and in the future, a considerable amount of capital will surely be available locally. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and American financial institutions based in the concessions have been closed or controlled. The unified control of North China's finances by the United Reserve Bank of China has been established, financial institutions have also been prepared, and deposits have surged. Moreover, due to the increased issuance of banknotes, civilian funds are extremely abundant. However, absorbing civilian funds and turning them into industrial funds in order to regulate finance and currency is an urgent task. To reiterate, absorbing civilian funds and creating industrial funds is not only a two-pronged approach of collecting funds and utilizing funds, but also the only way to realize the development of industry through Sino-Japanese cooperation, and it truly has a two-pronged effect. Therefore, it is now being made concrete, and a considerable amount of the development funds needed this year are being considered for local fundraising.

Finally, there is one point regarding the economic trends in North China that deserves attention, namely the issue of food prices. Ensuring food supply is the cornerstone of wartime economic operations. North China still relies on foreign imports for part of its food supply and has not yet reached self-sufficiency. However, due to the needs of the situation, it is urgent to establish a self-sufficient system, so all policies are being prepared. What should be given special consideration here is that for the sake of the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere economy, a great deal of cotton production is expected from North China. Therefore, increased agricultural production in North China must advance in both food and cotton. Originally, seeing the arable land, human resources, natural conditions, and other factors in North China, it is extremely possible to implement the two increases in food and cotton. However, ensuring food requires a comprehensive strategy across the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere for appropriate adjustments. The issue of commodity prices is also a basic condition. It is not only an important element in the operation of the heavy industry but also the key to the entire wartime economy. Since last autumn, commodity prices in North China have risen sharply and considerably. Currently, countermeasures are being studied in various departments to combat and suppress price increases.

Regarding the currency sector, on March 10 this year, the China Joint Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan concluded a loan agreement to strengthen Sino-Japanese financial cooperation, indicating the maintenance of the ratio between the Japanese yen and the joint reserve notes. In late April, Central and Southern China stopped issuing new military scrip notes. The exchange rate between the joint reserve notes and the Central Reserve notes, as well as the ratio of the Japanese yen to the Central Reserve notes, were the same, at 8 yuan to 100 yuan. The status of the joint reserve notes has gradually increased and stabilized, suppressing the trend of runaway inflation, which is worth noting. As for the material sector, promoting its movement, improving the procurement and distribution institutions, and controlling commodity prices are expected to succeed. However, handling the commodity price issue requires the cooperation and practice of the entire population. No matter how hard you try, it will be useless. In particular, the scope of Chinese economic activity is broad, so it is most important for the Chinese to rise up and cooperate to control commodity prices. China's participation in the war has promoted this spirit of cooperation and strengthened this practical system, which is truly gratifying.

In short, China after the war is striving to complete the greatest task of enhancing combat power, as indicated by Chairman Wang, and is working hard to prepare the wartime economic system. The Japanese side has also risen to respond, believing that this invincible and undefeated system will inevitably become more and more solid. (Yunpeng: Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun)

### The Solidarity of the Axis Powers is Increasingly Solid, Laying the Foundation for Final Victory; Italian Participation in the War Third Anniversary; Prime Minister Tojo Sends Words to the Italian People

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo of Japan, considering the 10th as the third anniversary of Italy's participation in the war, and to express respect for the solidarity of the allied nations in facing national crisis, specially sent words to the Italian people on the 10th through the Italian Stefani News Agency, expressing his firm belief in achieving the final victory. The gist of the words of appreciation is as follows: The Italian nation has resolutely wielded the sword of justice and implemented glorious participation in the war for three years now. This war has gone through two major stages since its beginning: one was Italy's participation in the war in June of Showa 15 (Republic of China 29), and the other was the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in December of Showa 16 (Republic of China 30). It has been four years since the outbreak of this war. We have established an inevitable foundation for victory in both Europe and East Asia. Now, responding to each other in the East and West, we have entered a decisive battle to annihilate the enemy on a grand scale. The enemy countries, in extreme disarray due to repeated defeats, have attempted to drag neutral countries into the vortex of war, and at the same time boast that they will take large-scale offensive. However, the unity of our Axis powers is becoming increasingly solid with the progress of the war. In particular, the people of Italy, under the guidance of Prime Minister Mussolini, know how to overcome various difficulties with all their strength, and with an invincible spirit, go to the national crisis with one heart and one mind. I pay deep respect at this time. This war is the greatest war in history, so its difficulties are unprecedented. Even if there are any difficulties and obstacles in our path, since we are fighting for justice, I am confident that we will achieve the final victory.

The details are as follows: The sunk warships include two battleships, totaling 65,400 tons; 17 cruisers, totaling 120,850 tons; 35 destroyers and torpedo boats, totaling 53,850 tons; 89 submarines, totaling 91,909 tons; 21 auxiliary ships, totaling 34,104 tons. The damaged warships include three battleships, totaling 90,750 tons; two aircraft carriers, totaling 7,450 tons each; 24 cruisers, totaling 188,000 tons; 15 destroyers and torpedo boats, totaling 22,500 tons; three submarines, totaling 3,000 tons; six auxiliary ships, totaling 870 tons.

Italy Reaffirms Determination to Fight

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to Haitong News Agency: Italian political figures took the opportunity of the third anniversary of their participation in the war to reaffirm Italy's special position in the current war. It is roughly said that when Italy joined Germany's war to defend its rights in the Mediterranean, the Western countries tried to coordinate the Allied forces to attack from both sides. Berlin has always trusted Italy's active force and has not slackened until now. Italy participated in the war out of protecting common interests. Churchill also expressed deep disappointment at the time. When Italy participated in the war, the strength of the British and French Mediterranean fleets was still complete. In just a few years, Italy has now pierced the artery of the British Empire. Although the United States has disregarded its interests in the Pacific and has managed to drive the Axis powers out of Africa, Britain and the United States are still unable to move freely in the Mediterranean. On the contrary, the strength of the Axis powers in dealing with the forces of Britain and the United States with common political motives is increasing day by day. Italy, representing Europe in resisting Britain and the United States in the Mediterranean, knows that Europe is our backing. This is also the confidence that Germany and the entire Europe share. They are determined to fight the enemy to the end.

### Italy's Will to Resist is Firm, Fully Defending Pantelleria Island; Anti-Axis Air and Naval Forces Repeatedly Attack; 116 Aircraft Shot Down

Rome, 10th (Central News Agency) - After the end of the Tunisian war, the anti-Axis forces launched fierce attacks on the various islands in Italian territory that served as forward and rear bases for Italy itself. Among them, the island of Pantelleria has been bombed as many as 140 times. Recently, the anti-Axis forces have shelled the island four times. In the past month, the island's garrison has shot down 116 anti-Axis aircraft with coastal artillery and anti-aircraft guns, and damaged one enemy warship. On the 8th, the British fleet shelled Pantelleria Island with cruisers and advised the Italian army to surrender, but the Italian army ignored it and shot down five enemy planes and five pursuit planes from the 53rd Air Force Regiment, and resolutely expressed its determination to resist. The commander of the Italian garrison on Pantelleria Island also mobilized all the residents of the island, determined to crush the anti-Axis forces' attempt to land. The islanders, in the difficult situation of the anti-Axis air force bombing, cooperated with the garrison to defend the island.

Selected Translations of Current Events

### The Italian Situation on the Eve of the Decisive Battle: Inside the French Committee of National Liberation

(Special dispatch from Rome by correspondent Ozaki, 2nd) Britain and America are intensifying their air raids on Europe and initiating what they call a "spiritual infiltration of Europe." Britain and America are repeatedly bombing Italy's mainland and its islands, such as Sicily and Sardinia. At the same time, they are using fabricated facts to underestimate Italy's military and economic strength, proclaiming that "Italy has no ability to defend its mainland." They are also conducting propaganda campaigns against the Italian national will and the Fascist regime, aiming to incite anti-war sentiment among the Italian people and begin the work of alienating the Axis powers.

On May 16th, Rome was subjected to its first air raid. British planes scattered leaflets over Rome, stating: "Quickly pursue a separate peace. If you do not separate from Germany, all the cities of Italy will be reduced to ashes."

Italy's strength in both material and spiritual terms is a strong pillar of the Axis camp. Needless to say, Italy is prepared and determined to respond to all Anglo-American propaganda with facts.

Since the withdrawal from Tunisia, the Italian military has not altered its offensive posture. Currently, in conjunction with the German Air Force, it is launching daily strong attacks on Cap Bon, Philippeville, and Algiers in Tunisia. In particular, the bombing of East Africa in recent days, with flights reaching 5,000 kilometers, is sufficient to demonstrate the possibility of bombing the American mainland. At the same time, fighter planes are intercepting enemy aircraft coming to bomb the Italian mainland, shooting down an average of ten aircraft per day, demonstrating Italy's strong stance of resistance. With the cooperation of the navy and air force, Italy firmly maintains control of the Strait of Sicily. The air force, departing from numerous air bases on Sardinia and Sicily, is monitoring the Strait of Sicily day and night.

Since the outbreak of this great war, the Italian Navy, with the exception of some damage to cruisers, its battleships and light cruisers remain intact. The two battleships attacked by British aircraft at Taranto naval port in 1940 have now been completely repaired and have rejoined the fleet. The strength of the so-called homeland defense fleet is actually superior to that of the enemy.

British Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham recently said in the Evening Standard:

"The victory of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa cannot guarantee control of the Mediterranean."

Since Italy adopted the so-called strategy of concentrating the battle line, the elevation of the power of the navy and air force has become even more substantial.

As for the army, although it suffered some losses in the North African campaign, there are now [redacted number] of Italian troops, plus volunteers, in Italy, Albania, Greece, and the Balkans. These troops in Italy and Greece are currently earnestly implementing enhancements and strengthening equipment in preparation for an Anglo-American invasion of the mainland. The number of tanks and automobiles is increasing rapidly, and the number of cannons deployed along the Italian coast alone has reached [redacted number].

These many weapons are, of course, all manufactured in Italy. Due to air raids and transportation issues, current military industries have undergone some changes, with smaller factories being forced to make some adjustments. However, large factories are all fully operational. The supply of steel and other materials from Germany is also quite smooth, and there is no state of operations being halted due to material shortages. Aircraft are also being manufactured in these many factories. Fighter planes and night fighters are the most urgently needed, so production is being greatly increased. New types of bombers have also recently appeared. In short, there is no anxiety regarding the operation of general military industries and the equipping of the military. After the Tunisian campaign, they are expanding and strengthening rapidly.

What, then, is the will of the Italian people, which Britain and America regard as the center of their propaganda strategy? Fascism, the spiritual foundation of the Italian people, and the Fascist regime, the root of war guidance, are becoming increasingly solid, regardless of the slanderous propaganda from Britain and America. Today, in order to carry out war, all countries are more or less adopting totalitarian or Fascist economic controls and national organizations. How will Britain and America themselves explain the fact that democracy is disappearing as a result of this great war and that dictatorial political forms are being adopted, while propagating that "the Italian people are estranged from the Fascist regime"? Even a three-year-old child understands that this propaganda is completely baseless.

Fascism has a longer history and foundation than the decade-long Roosevelt administration. Moreover, workers, farmers, and the military are the body of the movement. Regarding this point, let's cite an example to illustrate how foolish British propaganda is. Britain recently propagated that "the number of Fascist Party members has greatly decreased this year compared to last year." However, the fact is that last year's survey was for a twelve-month period, while this year's survey was only for a four-month period. During the busy farming season, most farmers have not yet completed the procedures for renewing their party membership cards. Italian farmers simply laughed at this propaganda.

In short, Italy, under the leadership of Prime Minister Mussolini, is absolutely not lagging behind and is fully fulfilling the important task of being a pillar of the Axis powers. (Extracted and rewritten from the Yomiuri Hochi newspaper of June 4th)

(Special telegram from Zurich by correspondent Taguchi, 4th) As a result of the meeting between Giraud and de Gaulle, the newly established "French Committee of National Liberation" in North Africa held its first meeting in Algiers on the 4th. They discussed the dismissal of French West Africa Governor-General Boisson, West African Atlantic Fleet Commander Missouri, and others. The discussion lasted quite a while. De Gaulle's side plans to have two members of his faction, Rochat and d'Argenlieu, fill two vacancies in the aforementioned committee. The outcome is not yet known. According to observations by some neutral parties regarding the establishment of this "French Committee of National Liberation," Giraud and de Gaulle have reached an understanding, and they will mutually serve as chairmen of the committee. The British headquarters handed over the political leadership of the French rebels to de Gaulle, while entrusting the actual military power to Giraud. As a result of Roosevelt and Churchill's earnest discussions, although they want to utilize the labor of Giraud's faction for the reconstruction of France after the war, the problem now is that they still have concerns about the Soviet Union. They cannot disregard de Gaulle either. Therefore, at least for the time being, they plan to implement a two-headed policy.

Everyone knows that de Gaulle himself is not a progressive. The people surrounding him include moderates, liberals, and even extreme leftists such as communists. According to reports from Nyon and Zuger Nachrichten, de Gaulle is not only a member of the original French Popular Front, but also continues to secretly move and maintain close ties with the French Communist Party. As for Giraud, he is directed by capitalists and bureaucrats in French North Africa and naturally has incompatible relations with de Gaulle's faction. Despite this, the reason why the French rebels are still implementing a two-headed policy is that, in addition to the aforementioned political reasons, there is also a military necessity.

In order to carry out the war against the Axis powers, they must enlist all French elements. Regarding this point, it should be noted that former French Legion commander Georges, the proposer of the so-called "Georges Plan," has been appointed as a member of the committee. This "Georges Plan" is a plan to conquer the Italian mainland using French bases. Whether this plan is within the scope of the anti-Axis powers' European landing operation is another matter, but the fact that such an active proponent has been selected as a member of the puppet government surely explains the intentions of the anti-Axis camp.

Why is the "North African French Central Executive Committee" not called the "French Provisional Government" but is still called a committee? Neutral observers believe that even Roosevelt and Churchill doubt to what extent the labor of de Gaulle, Giraud, etc. will be utilized after the war, because they lack the actual support of the upper echelons of French society. At the same time, they are very aware of how powerless and provisional the French social structure, especially in politics, will be after the war without a financial foundation. Therefore, even if they want to utilize Giraud's labor in the future, the problem now is that a puppet regime without territory is ultimately an abnormal form. The name "committee" is fully understood based on this inner situation.

According to further intelligence, de Gaulle once caused a dispute over Giraud's proposal for a "complete merger" during the establishment of this committee. The above situation suggests that the merger of the two factions is only at the level of a partial "understanding." (Extracted and translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun of June 6th)

### Police Authorities Guide the Baojia System to Prevent Terrorism, Assist the Police in Exerting Self-Defense Forces

The Public Concession Police Department, recognizing the complexity of the residents within the Concession and the fact that the jurisdiction is the general transportation hub of this city, inevitably harbors lurking criminals or transient passersby. If criminal incidents occur, they may also be regarded as target areas by these individuals, disrupting the overall public order of this city. This situation is, of course, observed by the police authorities. However, the desire of residents to generate their own self-defense forces and assist the police in seeking a life of peace and security is the responsibility that Baojia self-defense personnel in service should fulfill. According to the reporter's inquiries, the police authorities have already actively launched work to prevent and control terrorist incidents and have formulated a general outline of measures. They will establish closer contact with the affiliated Baojia personnel, striving to ensure that when terrorist and other major incidents occur, proper assistance will facilitate the arrest of offenders. The key points of this general outline are excerpted below:

Measures that Self-Defense Corps Members Should Take: (1) When an incident occurs, the self-defense corps members should take the following measures:

A. When encountering criminals and suspects, do their best to arrest them and take preventive measures to avoid escape.

B. Immediately sound the whistle to alert other self-defense corps and on-duty police officers to provide assistance, and report to the police station in the fastest possible way.

C. The crime scene should maintain its original state, and avoid trampling, waiting for the police authorities to arrive at the scene for investigation.

D. If hand grenades, timed bombs, or other explosives are found at the incident site, take appropriate measures to isolate the public and prevent them from approaching the dangerous area.

E. Those who discover the incident and eyewitnesses to the prior and subsequent circumstances are all powerful witnesses. They should all be detained near the incident site and reported when police officers arrive at the scene.

F. Those injured as a result of the incident should be moved to a safe place immediately, and within the possible scope, first aid and hemostasis should be provided. Personnel should be assigned to guard them and report when police officers arrive at the scene.

(2) When an incident occurs, senior Baojia officials (Deputy Lianbao Chief and above) should immediately try to contact the police station and rush to the incident site to await investigation. The head of the search headquarters will order and direct subordinate Baojia personnel to assist the police authorities in the search.

(3) The Baojia officials of the Baojia district within the small blockade area will immediately gather in front of the search headquarters and line up to await orders. (Note) The small blockade area is designated by the head of the search headquarters.

(4) Within the small blockade area, the Bao Chief, Jia Chief, Household Chief, and Self-Defense Corps members of the Baojia district should take the following measures while waiting for orders from the police station:

A. Pedestrians on the road should be arranged in male and female rows in the center of the road, waiting for instructions from the guiding police authorities.

B. Those who linger or escape into the lanes, or those who pass through the lanes but are not residents of the lanes, should be led to the road near the lane and arranged separately (still divided into male and female, and not mixed with those passing on the road), waiting for instructions from the police authorities.

C. Those indoors should be arranged indoors according to the household registration survey form. Those from outside the household should stand in front of the door, waiting for the guidance of the police authorities.

D. Department stores, theaters, cinemas, dance halls, amusement parks, hotels, restaurants, teahouses, etc., if they hear the blockade alarm in their jurisdiction and learn of the incident, must immediately close the entrances and exits, and the people inside should remain in their original seats, quietly waiting for the guidance of the police authorities.

The Lao Zha Police Station Actively Promotes: The above regulations are what Baojia personnel and residents should do and abide by. At the same time, the police chief who receives the report of the incident will immediately arrive at the scene and set up the search headquarters. The head of the search headquarters will then contact the neighboring police stations and police authorities, and direct subordinate police officers and senior Baojia officials to handle the situation and proceed. Furthermore, it is learned that the Lao Zha Police Station area is the bustling heartland of the Public Concession. Therefore, Chief Nakano of the police station has been actively promoting this general outline of measures. He has given detailed guidance to all Baojia personnel at the joint Baojia meeting, hoping to complete the task as soon as possible. It is also learned that this measure can be effective. After the police and the people truly cooperate, it is possible to arrest the criminal offenders within one hour if an incident occurs.

### Mayor Chen Approves Unified Planning to Improve Civil Servants' Treatment

In recent years, due to the continuous increase in the cost of living index, the lives of ordinary civil servants have become a serious problem. Since this newspaper has repeatedly called for improved treatment, it has now aroused the attention and sympathy of people from all walks of life. It is learned that Commissioner Zhang Yongding and others of the Municipal Government, upon Mayor Chen's instructions, said: "I have always sympathized with the living conditions of civil servants, and I have repeatedly presented them to Chairman Wang, hoping that everyone will share the difficulties, temporarily persevere, and wait for unified planning. There must be a way to comfort the expectations of officials." It is hoped that in the near future, the issue of improving the lives of civil servants in this city will have a satisfactory solution.

### North China Relief Society Studies Fundraising Methods, Organizes a Design Committee for Discussion at Any Time

The Shanghai All Circles North China Relief Society held its second meeting of the Standing Council at its headquarters at 4:00 PM yesterday. Municipal Government Secretary-General Zhao Zunyu also attended and participated. Standing Council members included Yuan Lvdeng, Wen Lant Ting, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunzhai, Li Sihao, Pei Yunqing, Xu Jianping, Qin Runqing, Chen Binhe, Huang Jinrong, Xu Tieshan, Tang Shoumin, Ye Fuxiao, Zhao Jinqing, Sun Mingqi, Pan Da, Wu Zhenxiu, Yan Junren, etc. Attending were Chen Dongbai and Li Gongjie, etc. Chairman Yuan Lvdeng first reported on the agenda items and then discussed the proposals: (1) A notice will be published to solicit donations from painters, calligraphers, and collectors to hold a charity sale. The contributors will indicate the price of each item sent to the society, and the society will give a receipt and number them for registration. The society will then ask experts to re-mark the selling price. After the sale, all proceeds will be donated to the society to relieve the disaster victims in North China. (2) Organize an entertainment committee. The society's propaganda group will separately hire people familiar with the entertainment industry to organize it. They will separately contact various entertainment groups for performances. (3) Organize a design committee. The society will hire enthusiastic people with experience to organize it. They will meet once a week to study fundraising methods for reference. Zhang Yunbo, Lin Kanghou, Li Wenjie, Sun Mingqi, etc. will handle this. Secretary-General Lin will report at the third meeting of the Standing Council next Thursday, and the resolutions were passed and approved: (1) Publish a notice to unify donations. (2) Add four banks to collect donations: Bu Ye Bank, Universal Trust Bank, Dahua Bank, and Sha Ye Bank.

### This Newspaper's Collection of Relief Donations Has Ended

Yesterday, various circles still submitted North China disaster relief donations to this newspaper for collection. However, now this donation has been entrusted to various banks and financial institutions by the relief society to handle in order to unify it. This newspaper has already ended this collection. Therefore, those who donate for relief can directly pay to the designated banks and financial institutions nearby. Yesterday (the 10th), Mr. Sun Zhaoming of Xie Da Xiang sent a letter donating 10,000 yuan, which has been paid to Jin Cheng Bank for collection (receipt number 000190). His enthusiasm for helping relief efforts is truly admirable. Also, on the 9th, we received 4,000 yuan donated by the Shanghai Dairy Factory and its colleagues for the Dragon Boat Festival, 4,000 yuan remitted by Dean Gu Nanqun and colleagues of Nanyang Hospital, and 2,000 yuan remitted by Tongde Sauce Garden and others in Chongming Bridge Town, all of which are commendable.

Furthermore, previously, Pei Jun wished to sell a violin for 2,000 yuan for charity to help relief efforts, which has been reported in previous reports. Now, we have received a letter stating that Mr. Jin has purchased it and the money has been paid to the Bank of China for collection.

### Charity Performance to Help Relief Efforts

After Huang Jinrong, Chen Fuyuan, Gong Tianjian, etc. contacted the major theaters regarding this North China relief effort, the response was quite satisfactory. In addition to the Jin Cheng Grand Theater, which held a charity performance last night, the Great World will donate its entire ticket revenue on the 14th to help relief efforts. Other theaters, such as the Huang Jin Grand Theater and Tianchan Stage, will jointly hold a charity performance with a target of 50,000 yuan. The Gong Stage and Grand Stage will jointly hold a charity performance with a target of 30,000 yuan. The Queen's Grand Theater and Renewal Stage will jointly hold a charity performance with a target of 40,000 yuan. If the above targets are not met, each theater will make up the difference. If the target is exceeded, they also plan to send the excess to the relief society to help relief efforts.

The Guangming Barber Shop at the corner of the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road has decided to donate all of its business revenue on Saturday, the 12th of this month, without deducting expenses, to help disaster victims. It is heard that the money will be paid to the Shanghai Chinese Christian United Association for transfer to the North China Christian Protestant Group, managed by Bishop Jiang Changchuan, to implement relief efforts. This is also noted here.

### This Newspaper Has Paid All North China Relief Donations Collected on Behalf of Donors, Except for Guohua Bank, Which Paid Interest

The North China relief donations collected by this newspaper from all walks of life, up to the 9th, totaled 861,327.70 yuan, plus 1,000 yuan in Joint Reserve Notes. On the 5th of this month, 500,000 yuan was first transferred to the Tongrun Money Shop, and a temporary receipt was obtained. Yesterday, the remaining funds were delivered to Tongrun Money Shop for collection and the previous temporary receipt was exchanged for two official receipts, numbers 728 and 729, from the North China Relief Society. These will be published in the next two days to show the truth.

Before the North China Relief Society designated the collecting banks and financial institutions, the money collected by this newspaper was transferred to the Guohua Bank every day. Now, it has been withdrawn. However, although the date of receipt and payment was very short, the bank still agreed to pay interest as an exception. After the settlement, it will be delivered again. This is noted on behalf of the disaster victims to express gratitude.

### Charity Exhibition of Paintings and Calligraphy

This newspaper launched a charity sale of paintings and calligraphy to relieve the North China disaster victims, which was deeply supported by all sectors of society. Many people donated famous paintings and calligraphy to support the charity. The titles of the gentlemen who donated paintings and calligraphy for the charity sale yesterday are listed below:

### Baojia Youth Department Lecture

At 8:00 PM tonight, Mr. Chen Binhe will be invited to give a lecture on "North China Disaster Relief and Youth Responsibility" on the third floor of the Western YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road.

### The Police Authorities Talk About the Suicide of Lu Hengming

The police authorities issued a statement on the suicide of Lu Hengming, saying: "Regarding the case of the police officer of the Jing'an Temple Police Station and Lu Hengming, in order to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world, the police authorities now release the truth as follows: This incident occurred on June 6 at the Zhengzhang Dry Cleaning Shop at the intersection of Foch Road and Muir Road. The shop owner, Zhu Jueiming, dismissed six of the twelve employees and detained the citizen cards of the six people. This is actually the major reason for the accident. Therefore, this incident was a private dispute between Lu Hengming and the shop owner. When the incident occurred, the police officer of the Jing'an Temple Police Station was off-duty and happened to be in the Zhengzhang Shop. Therefore, he mediated at this time and did not actually participate in this incident. The autopsy results showed that there were minor injuries on both hands of the body. This was caused by the mutual dispute between Lu and the shop owner. Moreover, these minor injuries were not the cause of death. Lu committed suicide by taking poison because he felt wronged and dissatisfied."

### Mr. Wen Lant Ting Responds to the Frugal Banquet Covenant

Since this newspaper advocated the "Frugal Banquet Covenant," various circles have sent letters responding, saying: "I have been practicing frugality in banquets for a long time, but it was only carried out within myself and my family. I did not have the idea of popularizing it in society at first. Now that your newspaper is widely promoting it, who would not want to abide by this covenant under the current level of living? I am the first to agree to participate. I hope that people in society will abide by this covenant and change the decadent customs," etc. This is truly a social model.

### Shanghai Public Cemetery Registration Deadline Extended to the 15th of This Month

The Shanghai Special Municipal Government has approved a letter from the Supervisory Section of the Japanese Naval Attaché's Office regarding the need for relocation due to military use in the Shanghai Public Cemetery area.

It is now learned that the bureau has submitted a request to the Municipal Government to extend the registration period to the 15th of this month in order to facilitate the self-relocation of graves, as some grave owners may not be able to register in time.

### Clearing of Streets in Western Shanghai, Managed Entirely by the Municipal Government and the Public Works Department

After the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and the Public Works Department jointly announced the satisfactory resolution of various issues in the western Shanghai area, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government decided to cooperate with the Public Works Department to launch a campaign to clear the streets in the entire western Shanghai area in order to prevent the possible outbreak of epidemics and to emphasize public health. At that time, the cleaning of the main roads in the area will be entrusted to the Public Works Department of the Public Works Department. At the same time, the land outside the roads will be cleaned by personnel sent by the Municipal Government. Cooperation with Baojia personnel will be obtained to promote the work smoothly. Detailed methods are being formulated by the two municipal authorities.

Short Comments

### Suggestions Regarding Emergency Relief Funds

Yesterday, we received suggestions from two young people regarding emergency relief in North China. We found them to be quite insightful:

(1) Regarding how relief goods should be distributed fairly and equitably after they arrive in the disaster area, thorough preparations should be made beforehand. Information should be gathered from local authorities and impartial local individuals regarding the area of the disaster zone, the population, the extent of the disaster, etc., to serve as the basis for distribution.

(2) There are many tofu shops in Shanghai and neighboring counties. The leftover residue from their soybean products (i.e., tofu dregs) can be made into dried cakes to serve as food for the disaster victims. The price is low, the quantity is large, and it is worth purchasing.

Although the first point concerns future events, it is the most important step in the end. If preparations can be made in advance, there will be no confusion when the time comes. It is indeed a point worth emphasizing. We hope that the emergency relief agencies will promote this work. The second point is a concrete measure, and we hope that the emergency relief committee will consider it. We also hope that those familiar with this issue, or who have expertise in the technology of purchasing and making these cakes, will communicate and consult directly with the emergency relief committee, so that anything that benefits the disaster victims can become a reality.

In addition, if people from all walks of life see concrete measures similar to the second point above, they may as well offer their suggestions.

Economic Realm: A Brief Commentary

### Commercial Control and the Spirit of Autonomy

At the beginning of the establishment of the National Association for the Control of Commerce, it advocated the four words "impartiality, integrity, and brightness" to encourage staff. What is impartiality? Sacrificing the interests of the individual to complete the welfare of the public, without favoritism, without benefiting oneself. What is integrity? Eliminating opportunists who exploit opportunities for private gain, selecting talented people who speak frankly and dare to state the truth without flattery or prejudice, working hard and practically, with no room for compromise. What is incorruptibility? Not taking a penny without authorization, not benefiting oneself at public expense, putting others before oneself, and maintaining self-discipline. What is brightness? Concealed and tolerated bad elements in the association must be thoroughly purged. Dishonest personnel who use trickery and labor to infiltrate must be eliminated. If these four can be clarified, the spirit of "collective commercial self-government control" can be realized. It must be known that impartiality, integrity, incorruptibility, and brightness are not one-sided, or only for a small number of people, but collective and complete. If one person commits fraud in handling commercial affairs, then strict criminal law should be used to impose the most severe legal sanctions. In particular, lower-level members of various guilds should be strictly prevented from using their names and influence to pursue private gain, commit fraud, and deceive merchants. As far as I know, I already feel that this kind of concern is inevitable. Those who bear the full responsibility for the Commercial Control Association should realize this as soon as possible and urgently plan preventive measures. Official assistance and social supervision must not be relaxed in any way. If even this spirit of autonomy cannot be achieved, then one wrong move will lead to total failure. In the future, villains and flatterers, under this beautiful name, will do evil and commit wrongdoing to facilitate their private business and seize their private interests, I fear they will arise one after another. Thinking about it, I am alarmed; thinking about it again, I feel sweat running down my back. The wise and enlightened standing committee of the Commercial Control Association should examine themselves in the still of the night and consider how to be vigilant and fearful, encourage colleagues, and exhort people in various guilds to live up to the spirit of "collective commercial self-government control"!

### Methods for Various Banks and Financial Institutions to Submit Active Deposit Reserve Funds: Public Debt Grain Certificates Accepted for 60% of Payment

In order to protect the interests of depositors, various banks and financial institutions in the silver and money industry shall pay deposit reserve funds in accordance with the law. The Central Reserve Bank shall open a reserve fund account. The 5% reserve fund for fixed deposits and special current deposits has already been paid. The 10% reserve fund for current deposits has been accommodated in two installments. The second installment of the reserve fund to be paid has recently been remitted starting in June. The methods of payment are recorded below:

(1) The second 5% reserve fund for current deposits to be paid by various banks and financial institutions is allowed to be accommodated with a two-month extension, delayed until June 1. The amount of current deposits listed in the statement as of May 31 will be re-verified and continue to be deposited. (2) The interest on current deposits in the Central Reserve Bank is 1% per week, and the interest on interbank deposits is 2% per week. The interest on the deposit reserve fund for various banks and financial institutions has been increased to 3%, which is higher than the general deposit interest rate. Moreover, according to the regulations of the Inspection Office, the reserve fund for current deposits may be temporarily paid with substitutes such as real estate gold bars, stable public debt, or grain warehouse certificates for 60% of the value. (3) Regarding the item of overdrafts in current accounts, but which are indeed in the nature of current deposits, and the Inspection Office does not calculate the reserve fund on a daily basis, but verifies and deposits it according to the monthly statement at the end of the month. For example, if someone deposits one million yuan on the first day of a certain month and withdraws it on the 29th, the Inspection Office will not verify the payment of the reserve fund. Therefore, for a single account, changes in the amount of deposits and debts are inevitable, but for the total amount, there should not be much difference. The matter concerns a general case, and it is not appropriate to exclude the item of overdrafts in current accounts from calculation. The deposit reserve fund should be paid in accordance with the regulations. (4) The payment of a portion of the reserve fund for current deposits with substitutes is a temporary accommodation measure. The reserve fund for fixed and special current deposits should not be taken as an example. The entire amount should be paid in cash according to the verified amount.

### The Central Reserve Bank Provides Interbank Lending, Still Handled by the Bankers' Association, Limited to 400 Million Yuan

After the Central Reserve Bank took over the clearing of the balance of the Bankers' Association's bill exchange, interbank lending will continue to be handled by the Bankers' Association. The Central Reserve Bank will provide lending funds, limited to 400 million yuan, but the specific measures are being negotiated. The major ones will be handled in accordance with the new measures revised on March 24. The lending banks and financial institutions are limited to the following: (1) Member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association. (2) Member money shops of the Shanghai Money Shop Association. (3) Various banks and financial institutions that have dealings with the Reserve Board. Anyone requesting a loan must provide collateral, such as government securities, Chinese merchant stocks, real estate, or goods. The Loan Committee of the Reserve Board will determine the total amount of loans for each bank and financial institution, but it must not exceed the sum of the paid-in capital and reserve fund of the bank and financial institution. It will be handled according to the discounted assessed price. The term is limited to ten days, and the interest rate will be determined by the Bankers' Association at any time.

### The Ministry of Food Revises the Regulations of the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office

The Aquatic Products Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Food, in order to develop the aquatic products industry, has, upon submission, been approved by the Executive Yuan to resume collecting fisheries construction fees, and collect them at the original rate of 2.5%. In January of this year, a Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office was established to be solely responsible for management. Since the start of collection, the receipts have been prosperous. It has been found that the organization regulations of the office were originally submitted to the Ministry of Industry and approved for implementation. Now it is learned that the authorities of the Ministry of Food believe that the bureau has changed its affiliation, and the organization regulations of the office should be revised and promulgated for implementation to clarify the system. Therefore, the ministry has copied and issued a revised order, instructing the bureau to be informed, and instructing the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office to comply with and implement it from the date of promulgation.

### The Ministry of Food Plans to Build Grain Storage Warehouses in Various Places

After the National Government issued two types of grain warehouse certificates, A and B, in 1942, for a total of 500 million yuan in national currency, to purchase rice and build grain storage warehouses, they were all taken over by the Central Reserve Bank and sublet to the various banks and financial institutions in the silver and money industry for recognition. Recently, it was heard that the Ministry of Food, in view of the availability of funds for purchasing grain and building warehouses, has decided to establish warehouses in appropriate locations in various provinces and cities, in addition to implementing unified purchasing and centralized distribution, in order to properly store grain in accordance with scientific principles. The locations of the storage warehouses are Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Douying, Fanshui, Taizhou, Dongtai, Xinghua, Jiangyan, Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Kunshan, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Huzhou, Wuhu, Dangtu, Anqing, and other places.

### The Municipal Economic Bureau Continues to Investigate Chinese-Owned Businesses

The Municipal Economic Bureau has reviewed and approved 350 Chinese-owned businesses and issued licenses for them to operate. It is reported that the bureau is still sending personnel to continue the secret investigation of other businesses that have applied to the bureau for registration but have not yet been approved. It is also learned that, for the sake of caution, in addition to the personnel sent, the bureau will still issue attendance certificates, and instruct the personnel to first hand over the attendance certificates to the businesses for inspection before the investigation, in order to verify their identities. Those who do not hold this attendance certificate are obviously lawless people who intend to extort money. It is hoped that businesses will pay close attention to this. If there is such a situation, it can be immediately reported to the bureau for transfer to the police authorities for strict handling. Please do not be fooled.

### Trends in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were stable. New and old investors were active in absorbing stocks in the midst of growing credit, sparing no effort. However, they were suppressed by some sellers seeking cash. Various stocks rose and fell in succession, fluctuating within a narrow range. Although people's hearts in all directions are still uneasy, the foundation has become firmer. Yong'an Company in the department store industry rose slightly due to the news of bonus shares, Xin Xin declined slightly, and Guohuo rose slightly, all only shrinking by more than a yuan. Chinese underwear and Liangfu socks held steady at the original price. The textile industry was the most stable. Yong'an Yarn Factory, Meiya Silk Factory, Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing, etc. were not short of buyers in progress. The new pharmaceutical industry has become stagnant. Sino-French fluctuated only by a few cents that day. New Asia insisted on staying around the pass, and Zhongxi Drugstore continued to rise. The transaction price of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory was slightly lower. The cultural industry Commercial Press was stagnant and flat, while China and World Book Company both fell slightly. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Great China Match Company had an oversupply and fell again. Zhabei Water and Electricity in the public utility industry rose slightly, and Chinese Electric was still weak. Various miscellaneous stocks, such as Tongyixin Trust, Jiu'an Industrial, Xinyi Real Estate, and Zhongxing Timber, had slight rises and falls. The new stock Defeng Knitting was suddenly raised by more than a yuan due to the absorption by a certain household. There were few transactions in financial stocks, while food stocks were stable.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Public Debt: The black market for unified public debt was stable. Compared to the previous morning, the five types of bonds, A, B, C, D, and E, rose slightly.

Gold and Silver: The jewelry gold market in the city's silver building industry Dashin Tonghang was priced at the limit price plus handling fees per tael, and the in-house and out-of-house prices rose slightly. The price of silver taels remained unchanged.

Yarn and Cloth: Cotton yarn was quiet because there was no real demand from buyers, and the prices of various grades of yarn and cloth were extremely flat. The cloth market was stable at first and then firm. Due to the rumor of cloth rationing, people's hearts became more optimistic, and major players from all sides were very interested. In this situation of excess demand over supply, prices rose. Longtou fine cloth, Four Gentlemen twill, Taohua women's linen, etc. all rose, but transactions were very rare.

### Activities of Various Trade Associations

### The Vitality of Youth

— Hong Ying

Youth has vigorous vigor, an active mind, and passionate emotions. Youth also has great ambitions, lofty ideals… Therefore, the youth era is the most beautiful era in life.

Youth is rich in initiative and creativity. Often, many young people, due to a momentary emotional impulse and the drive of curiosity, bravely and firmly move forward. There are also young people who, in order to realize their ideals, disregard everything and use their own strength, heat, and blood to promote everything in difficult and contradictory situations, so that life continues to progress to new realms. This kind of force-created phenomenon is a characteristic of general youth.

When we read the biographies of great men, we learn that their true lives began in their youth. In their youth, in addition to diligently seeking knowledge to satisfy their thirst for knowledge, their thoughts often changed due to the influence of the outside world. Their lives were also shifted due to the control of the environment. They had one characteristic, which was that they were never satisfied with the reality of life, but worked non-stop to create. Relying on reason, they exerted their talents, used the vitality of youth, and devoted themselves to the work they considered most valuable, hoping that their lives could reach a realm of beauty and goodness. Therefore, they obtained a fulfilling life, leaving behind many generous, passionate, and moving great deeds in their lives.

The great German philosopher Fichte said: "If we want to accomplish great things, we must do it in our youth." This is a very valuable sentence. Youth has many innate superior conditions, like the light in the middle of the day, full of the breath of "youth." The "vitality of life" makes us brave to work. Young friends, don't you feel the emptiness of life? Don't you have beautiful dreams? I advise you faithfully, please keep Kant's words in mind, don't be timid, don't hesitate, you must seize reality, use youth, and work hard to create your career and create your new life!

### The Depression of Children

— Can Jun

Children are the future masters of the country, but now these future masters are encountering dangerous misfortunes!

In this turbulent era, the changing environment, the difficulty of life, and the heavy responsibility of supporting families and cultivating children are the most serious problems that every parent currently feels. Parents struggling below the lifeline slowly become thin and old. Due to the harsh environment and the difficulty of life, these future masters have produced various tragedies.

1. Parents living in a depressed and struggling situation are often plagued by troubles and grievances, and innocent children are the only tools for venting, which gives children a great stimulus. Therefore, they are gradually deprived of their innocent and lively minds and develop a timid and weak temperament.

2. Because parents are forced by the economy, it is difficult for them to bear the cost of their children's schooling. Therefore, children rarely receive a fairly complete education, and the level of knowledge and culture is invisibly reduced. Children growing up in this environment, even if they have good talents, are difficult to develop, so they often make low-pitched requests, hoping for effective help.

3. Because of the simplicity of daily diet, poor nutrition affects the health and incomplete development of the body; in addition, poor and incompetent parents cannot afford expensive medicines, so when diseases often ravage children's bodies, they are allowed to run rampant, killing their small lives in a short period of time.

4. Many children are already helping their parents, relying on their small strength to obtain this small income, but children's strength is limited, often exhausted due to overwork, groaning in bed; or even becoming ill and unable to recover. Furthermore, there are those who are whipped by life, living like beasts, with no day to look up under the cruel treatment; there are also orphans who are forced by life or have no relatives to turn to, wandering the streets, being used by others, engaging in abnormal activities, and being seduced by the poor environment, losing their will and the depravity of their personality. This affects the evolution of society and the country, and perhaps even affects social security and the future of the country.

Although there are many children who are free from the danger of freezing and starvation, live in wealthy environments, and lead comfortable lives, children in high positions are not necessarily successful, and children in low classes are not necessarily unsuccessful. Because the lessons they have learned are hard work, self-motivation, diligence, and endurance, they are gradually tempered by the lessons of the environment and the difficulties of the situation, so their talents may be higher. Therefore, saving these poor children is a serious problem today. We must strive to irrigate these small lives that are about to be destroyed, so that they can be reborn, develop, and bear great fruit.

### Collection of Couplets in Regular Script by Elder Chongde

— Zhu Xingzhi

Elder's handwritten maxims and couplets have frequently appeared in newspapers. Some years ago, I received a post of handwritten couplets collected in regular script by the Elder from the late Zheng Zhongying, which is especially precious and worth reciting. The characters are also quite elegant. I had this couplet mounted and hung beside my seat as a reminder. Although the Elder has now passed away, looking at this couplet is like seeing the man himself, forever immortal. I am recording the original couplet as follows:

"Often cultivate the taste of sweet dew liberation, Eliminate stinginess, greed, and jealousy."

Postscript: Jealousy is resentment, greed is seeking; The late Minister Wenzheng wrote a poem on resentment and seeking, using these two words to severely discipline himself. He once said that by achieving serenity, one can eliminate jealousy, which is one joy; and that by luck, one can obtain the taste of sweet dew liberation. Therefore, I have compiled a couplet from the Compassionate Water Repentance, as the ways of self-cultivation in Confucianism and Buddhism are indeed the same. Written by Elder Chongde in the late winter of the year Ji Mao [1939], at the age of eighty-eight. (To assist with the urgent relief in North China)

The opera "La Traviata" will finally be performed on the 12th under the management of the China Opera Company. Anyone concerned about the development of Western music in China cannot but pay attention.

The "China Opera Company" was organized by Mr. Luo Jingwei, Mr. Wu Zhengqian, and Mr. Wang Jutan. They originally hoped to hire Chinese performers to perform Italian opera, creating a new page in the history of Western music in China. However, due to various difficulties and practical impossibilities, they had to borrow a few foreigners this time.

I believe that the greatest goal of every singing student is to be able to perform in an opera. There are many singers among the Chinese in Shanghai, but because they have never been organized, they have never had the opportunity to show their talents. The purpose of the China Opera Company is to promote opera, so that every singer can have the opportunity to perform.

Opera originated in Italy, and Italy is also the most developed country. "La Traviata" composer Verdi is one of the most famous silent film writers in Italy. Italian music is light, subtle, and full of poetry. As for the story of "La Traviata", it has long been known to the Chinese people, and its touching plot is most suitable for the Chinese national character. Because of the above conditions, it has become the maiden performance of the China Opera Company. Although the lineup of actors is not entirely satisfactory, the greatest effort has been made.

### Forging

— Xi Qiang

Friends!

We are like a piece of iron,

Time: a pile of fire,

Must be struck every day;

Must be sharpened often

Forged into iron:

Sharpened into a knife;

Friends! Remember

"It must be so..."

Everything we do will succeed.

### Creation

— Han Feng

Human life can be said to be a kind of creative power, so it is by no means static, but rather active and positive. Its existence relies entirely on contact with matter, using it to create incessantly, so that the vitality of life can constantly develop; the content of life is also constantly advancing towards richness. Creation is the expansion of the power of life, and the content of life is creation. Losing creation means losing life. To put it plainly: "No creation, no life."

### From Manchuria to Shanghai (1)

— Hashimoto Kansetsu

On the train on the Chosun Railway, I heard the person sitting opposite me say that there was a train to Chengde, so I immediately changed my itinerary to go directly to Beijing and got off in Jinzhou along the way. This route from Jinzhou via Chengde and Gubeikou to Beijing has only opened since the Incident. I originally wanted to visit Rehe, but I heard that from Jinzhou, I had to take a truck and be jostled on uneven roads for two or three days, so my interest waned. Now that there is a train, it is much more convenient.

After getting off at Jinzhou Station, I was unfamiliar with the place, so I prepared to go to a certain guest house designated by the travel agency at the station, but after leaving the station,

I looked for a rickshaw, and it was getting dark. I was wearing leather-soled straw sandals and carrying not-very-heavy bags in both hands, walking on the sandy road, which was difficult to walk on. When I got to the inn, I was almost refused, and it was only with great difficulty that I got to the second-floor room. It seemed that the treatment I received this time had changed. I have been to Manchuria dozens of times. Every time, there are things worth cherishing, but from the past to the present, nothing has changed. It is a kind of colonial atmosphere, a kind of dishonesty that floats like duckweed without roots. In Korea, you can see a firm and quiet attitude everywhere, but in Manchuria, everything seems to be unstable, as if it has not taken root. This seems like a regret to us people traveling abroad from our own country.

The impression I got from Jinzhou was like an old warehouse filled with broken cotton wool. Although there are modern buildings near the station, they are decorated, but they have no elasticity, and what catches the eye is a scene of decadence.

Early in the morning, I arrived in Chengde, and a sand rain was falling as I left the station. Wearing a kimono and leather-soled straw sandals on my feet, I felt extremely inconvenient. I originally thought that the place I had planned to stay would have a car to pick me up, but it was nowhere to be seen. Following the instructions of my fellow traveler, I called the lodging place to inquire, but they said the rooms were full and there was no room for me. That person looked around and heard people on the steps of the station talking about a local hotel, and I was overjoyed as if after a long drought. I unloaded my luggage here.

In the open space in front of the station, Manchurian soldiers and some Japanese soldiers gathered. Horses were loaded with food and weapons. After unloading their luggage at the hotel, they went about their business. At that time, the unpleasantness I had felt earlier disappeared, and my chest was relieved.

The Rehe Imperial Palace was not as impressive as I had imagined, but it seemed more elegant than the Northern Tomb of Fengtian. The Lama Temple, the so-called Eight Outer Temples of Rehe, is quite large in scale. It is rare to see in Central China. Old pines with gnarled trunks are everywhere, adding to the interest.

In the rain, at the entrance of the Puren Temple, I bought a few eggs from a roadside vendor and shared them with the driver. While carefully appreciating the surrounding scenery, my impression was filled with wartime scenery.

I thought the station hotel would be very noisy, but because there were very few trains coming and going, I hardly heard the whistle. It was much better mentally than staying in a mixed and restless inn. The service of the Manchurians here was also relatively cordial, and I slept soundly that night.

From Chengde to Gubeikou, it was my first time. Clusters of villages surrounded by ochre-peeling earthen walls could be seen everywhere. After the snow melted, the tender buds of willows swayed with a soft green color. I asked if there were pear trees with snow-white flowers, and although there were barbed wire and sandbags mixed among the East Four, I never felt like there was any sign of killing. It was truly a very good painting, and the impression was different from the impressions of previous trips to China. Especially the small stations in the mountains, hidden by 〇〇, with lambs wandering around, all these sceneries were unprecedented. I really wanted to get off in the middle of the road to sketch, because it was a fortress area. The train only passed once a day, and there was no place to stay, so I could only give up. I heard that this place is where the Communists haunt, but fortunately I had a permit, which I showed to the military police on the train. Taking advantage of the temporary stop, I left a coded sketch, hoping to pick up my pen when I remembered it in the future.

The Great Wall of Gubeikou has always been famous. Although it is very convenient to view the various scenery of the Great Wall, the scenery for painting is not enough, and some must be omitted. I think that the scenery from Juyongguan to Badaling is much better than here because there are more mountain gorges.

A person in the same room on the train, who claimed to be from Kyoto, was making wine in Mengjiang and said to me, "I want to send wine to your residence." We parted without exchanging names. After arriving in Beijing, someone sent two bottles of wine, and looking at the attached name card, I knew it was Mr. Sakurai.

The grapes of Mengjiang have been famous since ancient times. When I was young, there was a poem I loved to recite: "Grape wine in golden cups, pipa on horseback, urged under the moon." When I thought of the concluding sentence, "How many people have returned from ancient battles," I tasted the ancient expeditions and modern wars while appreciating the taste of the wine.

Social Service

### South City Almshouse Requests Donations from All Walks of Life

The South City Almshouse has been established for forty years, housing single elderly men and women over the age of sixty. The quota is three hundred and fifty people. Nuns carefully care for their daily lives, so that they can live out their twilight years and fulfill their natural lifespan. According to a letter from the almshouse: This almshouse was founded by Catholic nuns, and the almshouse business has a hundred-year history in Europe. After completing their studies, the nuns all vow to abandon worldly affairs and spend their lives caring for poor and elderly people, and taking it as their duty to beg for alms. When people reach old age, they all want the care of filial sons and obedient grandsons. Unfortunately, they encounter misfortunes, lose their support, have no place to turn to in their old age, and have no way to make a living. The feelings of grief and pain cannot be borne by the old, and are indeed a constant occurrence in the world. The establishment of almshouses is intended to use an extraordinary spirit of love to act as sons and daughters for these lonely and dying elderly, hoping to slightly alleviate their suffering. The water courtyard has no servants or workers, and all the labor is undertaken by the nuns, such as cooking, washing, serving, and managing the household. They strive for cleanliness to meet hygiene standards, and after death, they are properly buried.

The almshouse has no foundation funds, and the annual operating expenses are entirely dependent on the nuns' personal daily alms-seeking. In the past, when times were good, it relied heavily on European aid and the support of benevolent compatriots. For forty years, it has never been interrupted and has often been able to develop and progress. Unfortunately, since recently, donors have either moved elsewhere or ceased operations. In particular, the large-scale donations that rely on major foreign firms and general societies are also difficult to obtain due to the vastly different market conditions. On the contrary, rice and firewood are expensive, and prices are soaring. The supplies needed by the population are on the verge of exhaustion. Therefore, the problem of living is very serious. If there is no source of continuous supply, how can we ensure their declining years? If they leave, they have no home to return to. Faced with these declining elderly people, we cannot bear to sit idly by and watch them starve to death. If we support them, we have no clothes or food, and life is getting harder every day. At this time of retreat, we really cannot bear to sit idly by. Considering the enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life, we are calling for their help to fulfill their loving responsibilities. In addition to earnestly hoping that our compatriots will donate generously, we also ask philanthropists to subscribe monthly to a certain amount, regardless of how much. The nuns will come to receive the fixed amount every month, or it can be transferred by the Shenbao. Shanghai South City Almshouse (Donations to the Almshouse can be collected here.)
