### Contributions to the National Police Administration Conference

Today, the Ministry of the Interior convened the second National Police Administration Conference in the capital, where police executives from across the country gathered to discuss strengthening police administration in the future. We deeply feel that police administration is extremely important for safeguarding public order and local autonomy. As this conference begins, in addition to sincerely wishing it a smooth process and complete success, we would like to offer a word of sincere contribution.

The Police Administration Department convened the first National Police Administration Conference before August 15, 1940, more than three years ago. During this considerably long process, the national political situation and social order dynamics have undergone various changes. Generally speaking, all aspects of the government are advancing towards a path of "seeking order." In particular, the police administration itself has also undergone significant changes. The Police Administration Department was originally the highest authority in charge of national police affairs administration, but it was abolished in August 1941 and reorganized into the Police Administration Headquarters, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior. The political police department, originally under the jurisdiction of the Police Administration Department, was transferred to the Investigation and Statistics Department of the Military Affairs Commission. Since then, the reorganization of the police administration agency has been finalized and remains in effect to this day.

At the first National Police Administration Conference, more than 130 proposals were discussed. Classified by proposal content, there were 30 organizational proposals, 20 personnel proposals, 15 funding proposals, 24 public security proposals, 25 training proposals, 14 business proposals, and 6 other proposals. Looking at the nature of the proposals, it can be said that they covered all aspects of police affairs. Attendees shared their experience and insights in handling police affairs, brainstorming and discussing together. All the resolutions passed were no different from a police administration manual, which could be regarded as a model. The attendees were all responsible for police administration in various regions, and they took the resolutions back to their posts and implemented them. According to our ideal, this would surely lead to considerable progress in police administration. Now that three years have passed, what is the gap between the reality of police administration in various regions and the content of the resolutions at that time? We dare not make reckless assumptions, but we hope that the participants of this conference will first conduct a practical reflection and review themselves. Perhaps some of the participants in this conference also attended the previous conference, and they should especially reflect deeply. We believe that only with deep reflection and practical review can we discuss more reasonable countermeasures for the future. Someone once said that the usual meeting is "meeting without discussing, discussing without deciding, deciding without acting, acting without effort," which is the utmost in criticizing its ills. However, we certainly hope that the outcome of this police administration conference will absolutely break away from this irony, so as to give police administration a new look in the future.

Police are the public officials closest to the people, so the tasks of the police are most likely to cause direct impressions on the people. The people's belief in politics can be most effectively gained from the service of the police. Secondly, the police are the hub of internal affairs. The implementation of most government orders relies on the police to transmit them to the people. Therefore, good government orders must be executed by good police to achieve good results. Conversely, even with good government orders, without good police, the results will be diminished. The relationship between police and politics is so important, and the closeness to the people is also like that. Therefore, advanced countries all take improving the police as the first priority in promoting politics. For example, friendly country Japan is renowned in the world for its strict and perfect police system. Today, with enlightened politics, officials and the people are united, exerting a unified strength, and its success is attributed to police administration, which is certainly not insignificant. We hope that all members of the conference will have a deep understanding of these essential meanings.

We have twice discussed strengthening the police system in May, and we have stated as much as possible what we wanted to say. Looking at the current situation, we deeply feel that what we said is still a matter of urgency, and we would like to solemnly provide it to the gentlemen of the Police Administration Conference for reference:

We require the police to be devoted to their duties and secure in their service, to love and be close to the people, and not to harass or insult the people. However, this requirement cannot be achieved solely by imposing great righteousness on them in spirit. We believe that "eating one's fill and fulfilling one's duties" are one and the same. It is necessary to provide them with enough to eat while holding them accountable for fulfilling their duties. This is appropriate and possible. If "eating one's fill" and "fulfilling one's duties" are regarded as two separate matters, and it is not necessary to "eat one's fill" but necessary to "fulfill one's duties," it seems that the ideal is too high for the police. The result is very likely to be the opposite, becoming not necessary to "fulfill one's duties" but necessary to "eat one's fill." Therefore, police compensation must be increased so that they can "eat their fill" and maintain a minimum standard of living. It is not entirely without reason that some police officers inevitably engage in corrupt activities, which stems from a single thought of "not being able to eat their fill." As the situation changes, it gradually evolves from initially "eating their fill" through corruption to "corruption" for the sake of corruption. To completely eliminate this undesirable reality, it is especially necessary to increase legitimate compensation.

Increasing police compensation universally inevitably leads to the issue of funding. The government must determine that police administration funding should be regarded as one of the important government expenses. According to our ideal, the people will be more willing to bear the burden of increased funding for improving police administration than to bear the burden of other expenses. After police compensation is increased, it is necessary to strictly define their powers, value their position, and hold them accountable for their tasks. In this way, those who are knowledgeable, have excellent skills, and are willing to serve will also be happy to join the police force and enrich police administration personnel.

Since the police are the closest to the people, no different from the people's teachers and protectors, and the scope of education is extremely broad, police education must be improved. The police originally take "sleeplessness and tireless work" as their motto, and they must especially be able to cope with emergencies, so police physique must be trained.

After the police receive rigorous knowledge and physical training, the people will naturally change their past perception of them, and feelings of respect and closeness will arise. Then, promoting government orders and communicating official-civilian cooperation can achieve considerable results.

Finally, we sincerely expect that the proposals and resolutions of this conference can be adapted to our suggestions and in line with reality. At the same time, after the attendees bring back the resolutions, they must break the criticism of "deciding without acting, acting without effort." Strengthening police administration and improving politics begin here!

It is also learned that Zhou Jiangxiang, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, also accompanied the Chairman on this trip to Japan.

Statement Released

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Chairman Wang, concurrently the President of the Executive Yuan, visited Japan on September 21st with Legislative Yuan President Chen Gongbo and held discussions with friendly government authorities. Upon returning to the capital on September 23rd, he issued the following statement:

"On this trip to Japan, I had the honor of paying respects to His Majesty the Emperor and listening to his profound insights, and I was deeply honored and moved by the preferential treatment I received. His Majesty's earnest concern for the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations has further inspired me to strive harder, and I hope that all compatriots across the country will work together towards the path of revitalizing China and defending East Asia. Strive forward.

Yesterday, I had earnest discussions with Prime Minister Tojo and Ministers Shigemitsu, Aoki, and Shimada for a considerable amount of time. I deeply expressed my gratitude for their good intentions regarding the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, as well as for their various assistance in suppressing commodity prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Furthermore, we discussed various issues of the current situation, and I received the Prime Minister's candid remarks. He expounded on the foundations for the Axis powers, especially the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War, and provided clear and precise instructions. In addition to my admiration, I felt that the bright future is increasingly expanding.

Although this trip to Japan was short, what I saw and heard confirmed that the unwavering belief in the inevitable victory of our friendly nations is firmly rooted in everyone's hearts. The operation of government affairs and the increase in production all prove that this belief has a deep and solid foundation. What is particularly gratifying is that since the Greater East Asia War, the people of our friendly nations have regained their Asian consciousness and are striving for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This spirit is in perfect harmony with the Greater Asianism advocated by our Founding Father. All our comrades should have a deep understanding and enthusiastic empathy for this point.

During this visit, I had earnest discussions with government authorities of our friendly nations on various issues, and I learned that Japan's attitude towards China is extremely fair and kind, and they sincerely hope for China's independence and prosperity. To achieve this hope, they are willing to provide full assistance. I sincerely hope that government colleagues and the people of the whole country understand the truth of the current situation. For the sake of defending East Asia, the peoples of East Asia should not be constantly hostile to each other. For the sake of revitalizing China, a comprehensive peace should be achieved as soon as possible. We must ensure that the whole country works together with one heart and mind, so that unification and construction can be completed, and the remaining poison left by Britain and the United States in China can be swept away, and the traces of unequal treaties can be permanently eliminated. Only in this way can we live up to the Founding Father's dying wishes, and the spirit of "the world is for all" will ultimately become the foundation for revitalizing China and defending East Asia."

Significant Meaning

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Local political figures have stated that the significance of President Wang's visit to Japan is that the Japanese government previously implemented a new policy towards China in September, with the aim of assisting China in achieving autonomy and independence, strengthening the cooperation between the two nations based on the spirit of morality. In addition to transferring concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, it continues to transfer enemy properties. At the same time, other rights and interests in China are also being adopted by various countries in the same manner as Japan, cooperating with each other. Therefore, China has been able to fulfill its long-cherished wish of a century, break away from the shackles of unequal treaties, gain liberation, and establish a foundation for independent and complete self-governance. Furthermore, the political power of the National Government has recently been strengthened. Now, President Wang's second visit to Japan, where he frankly exchanged views with Prime Minister Tojo and key Japanese government figures on strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation, is of extremely significant importance. Regarding the Sino-Japanese countries dealing with the current war situation and strengthening various connections between the two countries, opinions have been completely unified. Therefore, the cooperation between China and Japan will inevitably be further strengthened, which will make a great contribution to the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, Chairman Wang's visit to Japan has particularly demonstrated the solid spirit of unity in Greater East Asia.

The inland area or the area close to the enemy area is designated as Area B. The Chinese side is responsible for purchasing rice grains in this area.

The contents of the two telegrams are as follows: "Telegram from Prime Minister Tojo to Leader Hitler" stated that upon hearing the news that your army had rescued Italian Commander Mussolini, in addition to congratulating, I deeply express my respect for your efforts and the bravery of your army, and please convey my congratulations to the Italian Commander. "Reply Telegram from Leader Hitler" stated that I am extremely pleased to receive your congratulatory telegram, and I hereby reply with this telegram to express my gratitude.

### Italian War Situation is in a Stalemate, British Forces in the Central Region Have Encountered Obstacles in Their Advance

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to frontline reports, the German army on the Italian front is actively strengthening its new positions north and northwest of Salerno. The US Fifth Army seems to have received reinforcements and is reorganizing, but has not yet taken any action. Although the British Eighth Army, under the command of Montgomery, attempted to attack Naples, the German defenses are strong, and the British advance has been obstructed. It is reported that fierce fighting finally broke out on the 22nd, centered on the Salerno fortress. Furthermore, the British Eighth Army advanced to Potenza, a key transportation point in the central part of the Italian peninsula, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the German army north of the city. In short, the war situation in southern Italy is currently maintaining its original state. According to the German authorities, if the anti-Axis forces want to launch a new battle on that front, they still need to replenish their strength, so the war situation has now entered a stalemate.

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Military dispatch from the Haitian News Agency: The British and American forces in southern Italy have not taken any further offensive, but are still limited to reconnaissance movements, and are entering the area retreated by the German army with caution. The German army has retreated to a new defense line, so the battles are only limited to local nature. The center of the German army's new position is northwest and north of Salerno, and the situation is completely unchanged. The German army continues to strengthen its position and successfully repel the advances of the Allied forces. The area of Bari has also been evacuated according to the original plan. Although the advance of the US Fifth Army has received a large amount of regular reinforcements, it is still extremely cautious. General Clark's purpose is clearly to concentrate his artillery before making another large-scale offensive, and he still feels the need to advance in areas where the range of naval artillery has not been established. The advance of the Eighth Army has also slowed down, and the German army's terrain positions and ingenious rearguard tactics have all prevented the rapid advance of the British vanguard, so Montgomery's troops are still stranded on the line of Muro, Potenza, and Agnone. At the same time, the Anti-Axis forces landed on Sardinia, and the German army had already evacuated from there the previous day. The landing force should be the US army, but it has not been determined at this time whether this US army is the vanguard of the US Tenth Army, because this army has not been seen since the Battle of Sicily. However, the fact that the Anti-Axis forces have occupied Sardinia makes their attack on Corsica inevitable, so the Anti-Axis forces have been conducting exploratory landings in Corsica with weak forces. However, it is not easy to gain a foothold on the rocky coast. The great battle has not yet begun, and the main positions are still in Corsica, and there is not a large amount of guerrilla activity as reported externally.

### Rumors that Marshall Will Be Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Forces

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - There is considerable confusion in the British and American military camps. Rumors are circulating that US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall will be dismissed from his post. United Press International previously reported that Marshall had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British and American Army, Navy, and Air Force, but said that this appointment had not been officially confirmed. London sources say that Prime Minister Churchill refused to comment in the House of Commons on Washington's rumors that General Marshall had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis forces. Later, Washington sources said that a formal announcement could be made today.

### German Troops Did Not Invade, Vatican Neutral

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a Havas report from London, contrary to Allied propaganda suggesting that the Vatican City's neutrality had been violated by German troops, a British government spokesperson in the House of Lords, Lord Cranborne, has indirectly denied this. Cranborne stated that while German troops are stationed in Rome and its vicinity, they have not yet entered Vatican City. A dispatch from the capital of Argentina reports that radio communication between Buenos Aires and Vatican City has not been interrupted.

### British and American Arms Supplied to French Rebel Army, Paid for with French Gold Reserves

Geneva, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Britain and the United States are reportedly planning to use French gold reserves stored on Martinique Island, valued at $85 million, to equip the Free French forces in North Africa. The arms and supplies will be paid for with this gold upon delivery to the French rebels. The Free French Committee has previously attempted to secure these gold reserves but has been unsuccessful each time.

### German Troops Withdraw from Two Important Cities on the Eastern Front: Poltava and Chernihiv

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency, quoting a war communiqué issued by the Führer's Headquarters on the 23rd, stated: "Although the enemy on the Eastern Front has launched fierce offensives, German troops are still able to conduct their disengagement maneuvers according to plan, particularly in the central sector. The enemy continues to intensify its attacks. German troops have now commenced a planned withdrawal from Poltava (southwest of Kharkiv), after demolishing all military-related installations before withdrawing." Between Eastern Cherkassy and Chernihiv, on the middle reaches of the Dnieper River, the enemy is pursuing our troops but inevitably suffers attacks from our forces. Fierce fighting continues. In the areas southwest of Gomel and around Smolensk, all enemy attempts to break through have been thwarted.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – German authorities announced on the 22nd that German troops have withdrawn from Chernihiv, a key strategic point 120 kilometers northeast of Kyiv. Simultaneously, German war correspondent Colonel Hammer reported that German troops, after thoroughly destroying all military facilities, retreated from the forward base of Chernihiv to new positions, inflicting heavy blows on the pursuing Soviets.

### Heavy Troops Gathered on All Fronts

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – With the autumn mud season approaching, Soviet forces are continuing to amass large forces along the Smolensk-Dyatkovo, Poltava, and northern Crimea lines, attempting to break through the German central positions. German forces are implementing planned evasive maneuvers. Three months after the Soviet offensive began, they have repeatedly suffered heavy losses and have failed to encircle and annihilate German forces in any single location. A summary of war reports from the German front lines on the 22nd is as follows: Smolensk Front: After concentrating substantial forces, Soviet troops are attempting to penetrate the German rear from both the north and south of the city, aiming to completely encircle it. However, these attempts have been repeatedly repulsed by vigorous German counterattacks, so the battle remains unchanged. Roslavl Area: Soviet pressure is visibly intensifying, but their advance has been checked by resilient German defenses. Dyatkovo Front: Soviet troops west of Bryansk have not launched an offensive for two days, consolidating their forces. On the 21st, they began a general offensive towards Gomel, a key point in Belarus, deploying a large mobile force along the Bryansk-Gomel railway. Additionally, Soviet troops who captured Chernihiv are now advancing towards the middle reaches of the Dnieper River, but are making no progress due to fierce German counterattacks. Kyiv Eastern Front: The situation in the Niezhin and Pryluky areas remains unchanged. However, Soviet troops have launched a pincer attack from the north and south in an attempt to recapture Poltava, and German forces are fiercely resisting. Melitopol Front: The situation around Chaplynka and Melitopol is currently quiet, but Soviet troops are massing in the Azov region, preparing to advance through the steppes between the lower Dnieper and Crimea.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – German authorities announced on the 22nd that German troops in the Kuban bridgehead, after completely destroying the landing facilities and other military installations at the port of Anapa, have withdrawn from the port according to plan. The port, a naval base on the Black Sea, is located 45 kilometers northwest of Novorossiysk and 96 kilometers from Kerch across the strait, serving as the starting point for the military road along the western Caucasus coast connecting Novorossiysk to Tuapse.

### Fierce Air Battles in the Southwest Pacific

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a Japanese base in the South Pacific reports that on the afternoon of September 22nd, Japanese army aircraft encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire near the coast between the Busu River and Hobai in New Guinea. Bombing small vessels, they set two cruisers ablaze, and near misses forced two other ships to flee. Simultaneously, they engaged ten enemy fighters in fierce aerial combat, shooting down eight and damaging the other two. Two Japanese aircraft were lost to self-destruction or failed to return.

South Pacific Base (Central News Agency) – On the dawn of the 23rd, Japanese naval air units attacked enemy positions at Buna in New Guinea. Braving intense enemy fire, they bravely bombed the area, setting two docks ablaze. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. Another Japanese unit attacked enemy positions in the Busu River basin northeast of Lae and at Gabmadzung northwest of Lae at dawn on the 22nd, thoroughly bombing them. Because it was nighttime, the results could not be confirmed. There were no Japanese losses.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – A Japanese source in the South Pacific reported on the 23rd that on the 20th, a Japanese naval seaplane unit, while on patrol near Lae in New Guinea, discovered a group of enemy transport and torpedo boats. They immediately launched a fierce attack, destroying one medium-sized transport ship and one torpedo boat. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

### Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Meeting to Be Held in the Soviet Union; Post-War Issues to Be Discussed

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to London sources, British Foreign Secretary Eden announced to the House of Commons that the British and Soviet governments had decided not to conclude any post-war agreement with European anti-Axis countries in the near future. This decision was made last year. He also said that the British, American, and Soviet foreign ministers' meeting to be held in Moscow would discuss a post-war agreement.

Amsterdam, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a London dispatch, British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Czech exile government leader Beneš on Wednesday to discuss matters before visiting Moscow. When Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov visited Britain last year, he signed an agreement with Britain and other British allies and discussed post-war issues. At that time, the British government believed that it was best not to establish any agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union for the time being, so Beneš postponed his visit to Moscow. Eden said that he personally hoped to discuss the issue with Molotov and representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union.

### British-Spanish Relations: Eden Answers Questions from Parliament

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a London dispatch, during yesterday's session of the British House of Commons, a member raised questions regarding the Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front and the port of Tangier. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the Spanish government held a discriminatory attitude toward British interests, so Ambassador Hoare met with General Franco before returning home to call the country's attention. Our ambassador has stated regarding the Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front that if the division engages in combat on the Eastern Front, it will hinder friendly relations between Britain and Spain. Furthermore, the member questioned whether German submarines were using Spanish ports. Eden replied that the Spanish government had agreed with our government to investigate the truth. Finally, Eden declared that the British government had protested to Spain regarding German activities in the Tangier international zone.

### Britain Invites Representatives from All Sectors to a Secret Meeting

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Allied victories in the recent Mediterranean campaign have led to optimistic fantasies regarding the future of the world war. In Britain, there has been much discussion, and it is reported that strikes are very common in various industries, especially aircraft manufacturing factories. In response, British officials convened a secret meeting of representatives from all sectors in London on the 22nd.

### British Aircraft Raid Germany, 21 Shot Down

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Führer's Headquarters specially announced that British air forces attacked several locations in northwestern Germany last night. Residents and houses in Hanover and Oldenburg suffered significant damage. According to current information, 21 enemy aircraft were shot down.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Today, local officials said: "For several weeks, enemy aircraft have only made threatening flights over German territory. However, on Tuesday evening, British aircraft resumed attacks on German cities. While enemy aircraft were still flying over the ocean, German fighters took off and pursued them fiercely. The remaining enemy aircraft dropped bombs on residential areas in cities in northwestern Germany. Because they could not aim accurately, some of the bombs were dropped on open ground. Germany's newly implemented air defense strategy has severely damaged the enemy. German fighter squadrons and anti-aircraft artillery divisions and searchlights are working closely together, so many enemy heavy bombers have been shot down."

### Britain Plans to Convene a Conference of Dominions in Early Spring; Churchill's Statement in the House of Commons

Amsterdam, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Churchill declared in the House of Commons on Tuesday: "I hope to convene a conference of prime ministers from across the British Empire in early spring." This conference will be extremely important.

A Japanese Authority Comments on Churchill's Speech

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – A certain authority in this city commented on Churchill's speech in Parliament, saying: "Although Britain and the United States have invaded the Axis countries with careful planning, they have ultimately suffered significant sacrifices and are trapped in a protracted war. Churchill's speech was to report to the British people that the plan to seize Rome has been completed and is being carried out by Allied troops, fully revealing Britain's cunning tactics. Today, the US military bears the greatest responsibility on the European front. The US Congress's criticism of Britain that the British military has contributed too little to the war is not without reason. Roosevelt and other American war leaders are being used by Britain, which is also pitiful. Churchill has frankly admitted the fact that Mussolini was rescued. However, what is most surprising is that Churchill publicly announced the plan to assassinate Mussolini. This may be what they often call 'civilization.' Also, Churchill said that although Italy has suffered internal strife, it is still cooperating with Germany toward a common goal. This is also a matter of concern for Britain and the United States.

### Swedish Trade with the Soviet Union

He stated: "Today, the News Federation is hosting the newly appointed Chief of the Reporting Department of the Army, Mr. Izubuchi. We are honored that Chief Izubuchi has personally attended, along with Mr. Akaboshi, Mr. Koike from the Army Department, and colleagues from the news industry. The News Federation has long planned to welcome and host Chief Izubuchi since his appointment, but we were unable to do so because the Chief was in Beijing on official business. We are even more excited to see the Chief's elegant demeanor today. The News Federation has been able to progress smoothly under the cooperation and guidance of the Army and Qing Army authorities since its establishment, and we are deeply grateful for that cooperation. The world is currently facing a situation where more guidance from the reporting authorities is needed. Chief Izubuchi has a long history in China and is very familiar with the national conditions of our people. Therefore, we hope that the Chief can give us more guidance in the future and cooperate in the development of the news industry. I, on behalf of the News Federation, wish Chief Izubuchi and all the gentlemen good health."

Chief Izubuchi Made a Speech

Chief Izubuchi stood up and gave a speech, stating: "I am deeply grateful for your taking the time to hold this grand banquet for me today. I have been in office for a month, and I had intended to meet with you all earlier to hear your valuable opinions. I apologize for being hosted first. As the Chairman mentioned, I have been serving in China for quite some time, but this is my first time working in Shanghai. I feel that the responsibility of handling the reporting work in Shanghai is very important, so I expect the efforts and assistance of all my colleagues in the news industry to help me fulfill my mission. The current situation is becoming increasingly serious, and the nations of Greater East Asia must unite and strive together. The people of China and Japan must also unite as one to cope with the current situation. You are all talented individuals in the news industry, and I hope that you will continue to work hard to cope with the arduous tasks, and I hope that the news industry in your country will develop more and more in the future and provide more assistance to us.

### The First District Abolished the Fire Department's Volunteer Reserve Team

The person in charge of the Shanghai Special Municipality's First District Office recently told reporters: "Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the First District Office's Fire Department Volunteer Reserve Team has seen a significant decrease in its total number of members due to the departure of British members. When the office decided to disband the team on August 6th of this year, only fourteen members remained, making it difficult to continue to perform the original duties. In view of this, the office had no choice but to abolish the team. The Volunteer Reserve Team was officially established on March 3rd, 1931. At that time, the team had as many as seventy foreign members. The following year, it was reduced to fifty members. In that year, the first incident occurred in Shanghai, and the team members assisted the regular fire brigade in extinguishing fires in Zhabei District. Later, when the China Incident occurred in 1937, the team assisted the fire department in fire-fighting work, which was extremely effective. In the same year, a "Special Support Transport Team" was established, with a total of 34 members, assisting the fire department in rescue work. The Special Support Transport Team was subsequently merged into the Fire Department Volunteer Reserve Team in 1938, greatly increasing the strength of the Volunteer Reserve Team. The Volunteer Reserve Team has consistently made outstanding contributions in assisting the fire department and has made contributions to the community. It is reported that on the day of the team's dissolution, the office sent a letter expressing its gratitude and, in order to commemorate the team's achievements, planned to issue commemorative medals to the team members who were still in the team on the date of dissolution."

### The Fang Jiuxia Bank Robbery Case: Continued Trial Held Yesterday, Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 27th

Huang Cifu, a former detective from the Huishan Police Sub-bureau, attempted to rob four diamond rings from the Fang Jiuxia Silver Shop on Nanjing Road. When the shop raised the alarm, Huang used his official handgun to resist arrest, fatally shooting Indian constable Terripu Xin and Shen Heqing Jiang, a member of the civilian medical corps. Huang was subsequently apprehended and handed over to the former First Special District Court. Huang's lawyers, Zhu Gu, and Tao Wuzhi, argued that Huang suffered from a congenital, hereditary mental illness and requested a psychiatric evaluation. The court ordered a postponement for this purpose. Yesterday, the case was heard by the current Shanghai Local Court in the Third Criminal Division.

Heavy Security

To prevent any unforeseen incidents, Du Bingjun, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, specially dispatched Inspector Ma of the Judicial Police Brigade, along with over twenty fully armed forensic officers, to assist Pan Junchang, the leader of the Judicial Police Group stationed at the court, in securing the area inside and outside the court. The Xihongkou Police Sub-bureau also sent officers on duty to the court. Xiao Linfeng Saburo, the Deputy Director of the Judicial Affairs Department of the First Police Bureau, and Liu Shaokui, the head of the Compilation and Intelligence Section, also personally attended the court. The level of security was unprecedented. At 9:30 AM, Zhao Zhengfang, the President of the Local Court, with Judge Wu Kechou and Chief Prosecutor Qian Sensheng presiding, brought the defendant Huang Cifu for questioning. Two Chinese constables supported Huang, who stood in the defendant's dock, swaying from side to side and muttering to himself. President Zhao began by asking Huang his age, name, and origin, but Huang did not answer. President Zhao then instructed him, "Do not feign madness. Know that today is your last opportunity to argue your case. If there is anything that benefits you, you can explain it as much as possible now, otherwise there will be no further opportunity for defense." But Huang still did not answer.

Summary of the Prosecution

The President then ordered a retrial of the case and asked the prosecutor to present the summary of the prosecution. Prosecutor Qian then stated, "The defendant, at twelve noon on July 18th of this year, at the Fang Jiuxia Silver Shop at No. 479 Nanjing Road, purchased a ring, then took it outside under the pretext of looking at the light, and then fled. When the shop employees shouted 'Thief!' he encountered an Indian constable and civilian medical corps members. The defendant then opened fire, killing one Indian constable and two civilians. The former Municipal Council is prosecuting him for robbery and murder," and so on. The families of the victims also hired lawyers Mao Xianshen, Cheng Zhengping, and Ji Chao, among others, to file civil suits, totaling 284,000 yuan for Shen Heqing and 840,000 yuan for Jiang E. President Zhao again questioned the defendant about the homicides. The defendant remained silent. After repeated urging by President Zhao, he finally muttered vaguely, saying that he did not know anything about the incident, that he only went there on official business, and had nothing else to say.

Witness Testimony

Jiang Jun, the brother of Jiang E, and Shen Hengfu, the younger brother of Shen Heqing's aunt, Zhen Zhu, then took turns requesting justice for the deceased and proper handling of the case. Next, witness Tao Liqing testified that he and Lu Shilin were inside a room at the Great Shanghai Hotel when they heard a theft alarm. They went downstairs to investigate and saw the defendant wrestling on the ground with a member of the civilian medical corps. Tao and Lu stepped forward and took the handgun from the defendant. Xu Banfang and Zhang Zhonglie, shop employees of Fang Jiuxia, testified that the defendant came on July 18th noon to buy a ring. "We handed him four rings. Who knew the defendant would make the excuse of looking at them in the light, and then flee. We then shouted 'Thief!' The defendant ran across the road. We heard gunshots. Before the incident, he did not seem mentally unstable. He was no different from a normal person. We did not know he was a detective," and so on. Chinese Constable No. 102 also testified to assisting in the arrest and said that he knew at the time that he was a "Bao Detective." After the arrest, when asked why he shot so many people, the defendant replied that he was having a mental breakdown.

Forensic Evaluation

President Zhao stated that someone suffering from a mental illness would not be able to claim to have a mental illness. He then ordered the reading of the evaluation report by forensic doctor Hou Guangji. The report stated in essence: "During the examination of the defendant during this period, his appetite was normal, he was aware of his bowel movements, and his patellar reflexes were normal. No violent behavior was observed within 24 hours a day. His demeanor was calm, but he mumbled in his mouth, and his hands and head were often moving. Aside from alcohol-induced mania, there is no obvious possibility of a mental illness. He should be considered free of illness." The report was then given to the defendant's lawyer. Considering the facts of the case were clear, and the defendant had no testimony, he was waiving his right to speak. He then ordered the start of closing arguments. Prosecutor Qian Sensheng argued that according to the forensic report, the defendant was determined to be free of mental illness. Moreover, someone with a mental illness could not be a civil servant. However, since the defendant went to buy a diamond ring, it did not seem like coercion, but rather fraud. Therefore, he should be sentenced according to fraud and ordinary murder. Finally, the defendant's lawyer, Zhu Hui, argued that the facts of the case were undisputed, but the defendant did indeed have a congenital, hereditary mental illness, and had been deeply stimulated by various factors. On one occasion, due to ulcerative colitis, the segment of his intestine that was removed was larger than that of a normal person. He brought the removed section of intestine as evidence, and this incident should be considered to reduce his penalty. The court ordered the closing arguments concluded and scheduled sentencing for the morning of the 27th of this month. The defendant was remanded to custody, and the attached civil suits were transferred to the civil court for handling.

### Unauthorized Entry to the Procuratorate Prohibited

The Shanghai Squad of the Judicial Administrative Department stated that the Shanghai Local Procuratorate's Prosecutor's Office and courts were all confidential and important locations. Outsiders and irrelevant personnel are not allowed to enter without authorization. Therefore, door guards will be strictly enforced.

### Streamlining the Second Line of Production

The recent National Policy Outline decided by the friendly nation of Japan includes a point on streamlining the second line of production as a special measure to strengthen the domestic situation. Streamlining the second line of production means streamlining various external organizations, various control agencies, and control companies in the second line of production, while thoroughly refreshing and reducing the number of personnel in their operations and affairs. In addition, the price and allocation system, which is closely linked to streamlining the second line of production, seeks to thoroughly simplify it.

Because the various organizations on the second line of production were originally created out of necessity and developed with the changes of the times, there is a need to refresh them at any time in their operation. As for the price and allocation system, in order to eliminate the current malpractices, it is necessary to simplify it.

Based on this idea, we believe that our country's second line of production and allocation system should strive to emulate our friendly nation of Japan. Therefore, in our recent editorial "What Happens After the Purchase of Gauze?" we believed that the fewer steps involved in the allocation procedure of cotton gauze, the better, so as not to cause the final recipient to suffer both time and economic losses. In our hypothetical allocation procedure, we must again accommodate the current organizational system of the Commercial Control Association, so we believe that if the level of the federation can be eliminated, the handling will be more agile, so we said, "In the allocation system, wholesalers are superfluous and profit-sharing, and there is no need for their existence." As for the personnel in our control institutions, is there any "creation of positions for people?" Is everyone "making the most of their talents?" That is another part of the problem, and we will not discuss it here.

In short, our advocacy is precisely to demand the refreshing of the control mechanism and the simplification of the allocation system.

### Guangtian, Chief of Intelligence, Discusses America's Invasion of East Asia, Elaborating on the Process of America's Invasion of the Philippines

Central News Agency Report: The joint press conference of the Japanese Army Overseas and the Shanghai Standing Bureau was held yesterday (the 23rd) at 3 p.m. on the fifth floor of the Astor House Hotel. Guangtian, the Chief of Intelligence of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, attended with Deputy Consul Tongfuwen. Lieutenant Yantian of the propaganda department attended. During the meeting, Chief of Intelligence Guangtian gave a speech on America's plot to invade East Asia, detailing the Roosevelt uncle and nephew's policies of invading the Philippines. The details are as follows:

Invasion of East Asia

Chief Guangtian first stated, "President Roosevelt recently gave a lecture-style speech in Congress, the content of which was empty and insignificant. However, according to the content, it is enough to expose the past actions of Roosevelt, who represented the vanguard of America's invasion of East Asia. His uncle, Theodore Roosevelt, was also a person who represented America's invasion of East Asia in his time. Therefore, the Roosevelt uncle and nephew are truly a pair of living treasures of two generations in America. Judging from their views on the past records of invading East Asia, they were truly the implementers of the policy of invading the Philippines." Guangtian continued, "Burma has already declared its independence on August 1st, and the Philippines will also formally declare its independence soon. He also said that the Philippines was at war with Spain from 1898 to 1899, and as a result, America won and seized the territory of the Philippines. The reason for America's victory at that time was actually due to America's cunning towards the Philippines, falsely promising the Philippines independence. Unexpectedly, afterwards, it went against its promise. However, in 1934, the American government passed the Philippine Independence Act, but it had to wait until 1945 to achieve complete independence. America did not want the Philippines to gain independence. Therefore, the so-called 1945 is likely to be postponed at that time.

Two Generations of Conspiracy

Guangtian also said: "However, based on historical evidence, America's invasion of East Asia began with the Philippines. In America's policy of invading East Asia, these two generations of Roosevelts were both the main figures in colluding to invade the Philippines. The former American advocates of expansionism argued that since its founding, America's strength was limited to the thirteen states, advocating development to the Pacific coast. After the Spanish-American War, America occupied the entire Philippines, establishing a base in East Asia. Although there were supporters domestically, there were also many opponents, confronting each other. As a result, the expansionists won. However, the reason for America's successful occupation of the Philippines was also that it achieved its ambition to invade Cuba. Thus, Theodore Roosevelt's conspiracy was realized by him. Looking at this world war, the culprit that ignited this great war was the attempt to dominate the world. In order to achieve his desire for the Far East, Roosevelt did not hesitate to instigate conflict between China and Japan behind the scenes, and even imposed economic pressure on Japan. Therefore, Franklin Roosevelt was truly the successor of America's traditional policy of invading East Asia, using the same methods as his uncle.

Taking Independent Measures

Looking back at the conspiracy before the Spanish-American War, at that time, the American warship Maine, which was docked in Cuba, exploded and sank. Theodore Roosevelt made great use of this incident, attempting to expand it. In February, before the war with Spain, Roosevelt secretly instructed the commander of the American East Asia Fleet stationed in Hong Kong, Dewey, that once the war between America and Spain began, he should immediately dispatch to the Philippines and launch a surprise attack on the Spanish fleet docked in Manila Bay. At that time, Roosevelt was still the Under Secretary of the Navy, yet he independently issued this order. The actions of the current Roosevelt are very similar to those of his uncle. Before the Far East War broke out, Roosevelt used economic problems to put various pressures on Germany, Italy, and Japan. Everyone present is already clearly aware of this. Three months before the outbreak, in early September of the previous year, Roosevelt ordered the American fleet to attack German submarines if they encountered them at sea. Therefore, this statement is enough to prove that these two generations of Roosevelts were completely instigators of war, and can even be said to be manipulators of war.

Deceitful and Scheming

Regarding Uncle Roosevelt's attitude towards the Philippines, when the Spanish-American War broke out on April 24, 1898, the American East Asia Fleet, docked in Hong Kong, was ordered by Dewey to set sail for Manila Bay and destroyed the Spanish fleet on May 1. However, America did not have land forces. America then reached an understanding with the Philippine independence activist, Aguinaldo's army. America finally obtained this assistance and pacified the security of the entire Philippine territory, falsely promising the Philippines independence on May 24 of that year. In June, Aguinaldo was elected president. This uncle saw that his plan was successful. Not long after, Roosevelt suddenly mediated, sending 10,000 domestic troops to the Philippines, occupying Manila, controlling Aguinaldo's independent army, and plotting its destruction. This kind of method was Uncle Roosevelt's scheming and self-interested means. And now Franklin Roosevelt's actions are exactly the same as his uncle's. Furthermore, Uncle Roosevelt's restriction of the Philippines' independence was entirely a plan based on American economic principles. Because the Philippines is an agricultural country, a large number of field products are transported to the United States, and non-agricultural products are abundant and cheap. The interests of the two countries are contrary. Taking sugar as an example, America abandoned the import of Philippine sugar to the United States, partially using tariffs to benefit its own agricultural interests. In addition, it restricted immigration to the Philippines. Furthermore, before the Great East Asia War, Franklin Roosevelt sent Executive Officer General MacArthur to the Philippines to plan the construction of the Philippine army, expanding and strengthening it. On the one hand, he interfered in the Philippines' internal affairs and diplomacy, and on the other hand, he established military bases. This situation is no different from America's previous facilities on Cuba. America's granting of independence to the Philippines is only in name and not in reality. Therefore, the conspiracies of the two generations of Roosevelts are the invaders and challengers of East Asia.

### Military Allocation Group Delivers Large Quantities of Miscellaneous Grains for Sale at Affordable Prices by Guben Company

Recently, the military allocation group, in order to supplement the shortage of people's food, purchased a large quantity of miscellaneous grains from various places to Shanghai for sale.

It is heard that the bank originally planned to hold the lottery at the end of this month, but it was changed to October 2nd due to a conflict with the lottery date of the Central Construction Association's special savings bonds.

### Flour Production of Various Factories Reaches Two Million Bags

After the completion of the first phase of wheat purchase in various regions of Central China, various flour mills have resumed work one after another. It is heard that since the start of work, the flour mills in this city have produced no less than two million bags of flour. A part of it has been supplied to the local people's needs, and more than one million bags have been transported to North China as material exchange. Therefore, there are about 500,000 bags in storage in Shanghai. According to reporters, the distribution of wheat flour in this city is still handled by the original organization. The first and eighth districts are temporary inspection offices, and the urban area is the Japanese wheat flour distribution group.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market was in a state of rapid advance to a peak. People from all walks of life were in a state of excitement. Under the demand-side advantage, all stocks rose continuously in the morning. New Leye Department Store and Industrial stocks were especially favored by investors. Other stocks had ample funds and prosperous trading. In the afternoon, the situation was stable and slightly similar. It was the sell-off of those who were generally weak. The future seems to have the hope of gradual development. Now, the stock trends are recorded as follows:

Department Store - Yong'an Company's new shares opened after the second capital increase. From early morning to noon, they even rose by two levels. The highest price appeared in the afternoon, but it fell back slightly. In the end, the combined price of two and a half new shares was much higher than the old shares of the previous day. The Xinxin Company once soared to knock on the gate, then fell back slightly, rising more than half a level compared with the Guohuo Company. China Underwear's rise was also outstanding, and it is still rising steadily.

Textile - Yong'an Textile rose by one and a half levels after the opening. It was hovering in the afternoon, but still rose by more than one level. Dasheng No. 1 Factory rose slightly, No. 3 Factory remained flat. Zhongfang, Xinhe, and Meiya rose the fastest. Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving, Fangqin, Qingfeng, and Rongfeng Textile's increase was relatively poor.

Industry - Dachina Huorong soared by more than half a major level. Nanyang Tobacco Company leaped beyond Guanguai. Huacheng Tobacco also saw a rise. Jiu'an Industrial rose a lot in the morning.

Qinggong and Jinsheng Paper also had buyers raising them.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds - Yesterday's price was excited several times, but still fell in the end, contrary to the stock market. It was obviously selling government bonds to buy back stocks. Yesterday's initial trading of Type C rose again, with a small similarity in the middle. At around 11 o'clock, it suddenly竄 up sharply. The final price at noon was the same as the previous day. Types A and B were smaller, but Type A was particularly good, and Type E was also small. The trend was more falling than rising.

Call Loan Interest - The money industry association's call loan interest rate of 1.8% remained unchanged.

Rice and Grain - Not many South Port rice shipments arrived at the rice market. Retail sales were flat. A lot of caged goods were thrown out, so the situation was gradually loosening. As a result, the new japonica rice and aged broken rice fell again slightly, and white yuan was also weak.

Gunny Bags - Weak for a long time, recently there have been slight changes, but the market price has made little progress.

Tea - The opening of the agricultural market followed the previous day's sluggish trend, and the actual sales have not been very impressive. Therefore, the trend is generally flat. Until noon, it was heard that the shops and banks on this street were active in selling low-grade green tea, and people's hearts were also becoming bullish. Although transactions were still sparse, the market has become firmer. Shops on the street in the city added 13% green tea, and 22 boxes of black tea were sold at the same time. It is heard that Rongchang and Xiefeng tea houses sold them.

### After Badoglio's Surrender, Germany's Determination to Fight Becomes More Resolute

What impact will the defection of Badoglio, the traitor of the Axis powers, have on the world war situation? How will Germany, which is fighting the enemy in the east and hopes to win, cope with the future war situation? Sato, the Berlin branch manager of the Mainichi Shimbun, reported to Tokyo via international telegraph as follows:

Mainichi Shimbun:

How does Germany view the surrender of the Badoglio government?

Kato: According to the German Foreign Ministry today, Badoglio's betrayal is a planned criminal act. His crime is the most vicious betrayal of the fascist regime centered on Mussolini and of the true representatives of the Italian people. Since Mussolini's tragic dismissal, Germany has long expected this to happen, so it is not panicked or shaken at all. The government's announcement shows that the German people are calm.

Our company: Japan is also equally calm. This must be because Japan and Germany are both thoroughly convinced of their inevitable victory. What about the so-called new fascist government established in northern Italy?

Kato: That has already been announced. The German people were very happy to hear that the Fascist Party, representing the true intentions of the Italian people, resolutely rose up to cooperate in completing the war against Britain and the United States. Their morale was greatly boosted, and they wholeheartedly applauded their support. Today, in addition to the establishment of the new government, the details of its organization, structure, etc. are still unclear. What form the government will use to cooperate in defeating Britain and the United States, and the composition of the army supporting the government are also not clear. The location of the government seems to be a small city in northern Italy near the German-Italian border.

German Army's Strategy in Italy

Our company: What will the German army's future operations in Italy be like?

Kato: The enemy forces will continue to land in various parts of Italy. However, the German army's strategy of defeating the landing enemy forces has not changed at all. Letting the enemy forces land in various places is not a sign of indecision or inability to cope, but is based on a predetermined strategy to lure the enemy forces to the north and then annihilate them in one fell swoop. Furthermore, the German army had minor conflicts with the Italian army in the south, and there may still be more to come, but that has no impact on the overall war situation.

Our company: What about the Italian army on the Eastern Front and in the Balkans?

Kato: The Italian army on the Eastern Front has now been moved to the rear. Their number is not a problem.

Our company: What is the situation of the Japanese in Italy?

Kato: The connection between Berlin and Rome has been cut off, so everything is unclear. In short, in our view, the era of exalting the spirit of the Axis powers and consolidating unity has passed. Japan and Germany, as well as the reborn fascist new government, should become truly one and march towards defeating Britain and the United States with the belief in inevitable victory—that is the most important thing. The German people generally think so too.

Our company: What was the national morale in response to Hitler's speech on the 10th of this month?

Kato: The people of Berlin were very excited about it. The German Morning News of the 11th, of course, reported it extensively. The main points of the speech: First, the impact of Italy's secession on Germany's overall war situation is extremely small. Second, the speech fully expressed Hitler's friendship with Mussolini. Third, he used strong and angry tones towards Badoglio's infidelity, arousing the public's sympathy and giving them great encouragement.

German People's Fighting Spirit is High

The German people's impression of this speech so far is that the heavy burden of fighting alongside the cumbersome Italian army, which was unclear whether it was friend or foe, has now been lifted. From now on, they can use all their energy to fight Britain and the United States according to their own will. The unclear atmosphere before today has been swept away. With the spirit of the people as the backdrop, the President's Headquarters announced that it would actively implement the aftermath of Italy's betrayal according to plan. Many strategic locations, one after another, have fallen into the hands of the German army. The disarmament of the Italian army is also proceeding smoothly. Therefore, the German people are very happy.

Our company: How is the German army deployed?

Kato: Judging from the fact that German generals Rommel and Kesselring are stationed in Italy, Germany's determination can be understood. Before today, Germany had to bear the heavy burden of maritime transport at any time to confront the British and American forces. Now the situation has changed. It is they who cannot do without maritime transport, while Germany can start its most得意 land war and confront Britain and the United States. This time will make them taste Germany's strength and give them a head-on blow. The actively implemented post-war strategy is proof of this. Churchill and Roosevelt issued a joint statement calling on the Italian people to "trust the British and Americans in the war with Germany," which led to the surrender of the Italian army. But from a fair perspective, the war situation is right for Germany. Among the Italian army, those who have the courage to cooperate with Germany and go to the enemy's side are cowardly troops, so Churchill and Roosevelt have obtained this kind of army, which is of no use in the war against Germany. In the current situation, British and American forces have already landed with considerable forces in southern Italy. In the north, the German army is stubbornly resisting, and Italy is divided into two parts, which has the potential to become a major battlefield.

Our company: What will happen to the Badoglio regime after this?

Kato: Badoglio has already fled Rome. It is not known where he has gone. He is probably in southern Italy or Sicily! The treacherous regime seems to have become a fugitive regime. It is also unclear what will happen to the cadres within the Badoglio regime.

Our company: How will the fascist regime that was born in northern Italy be active in the future?

The Movements of the New Government in Northern Italy

Kato: It will be very active. The personnel of the government will be announced in one or two days. It is said that former Fascist Party Secretary-General Farinacci, former Minister of Culture and Propaganda Buffarini, and Mussolini's son Vittorio Mussolini will be the leaders. Nominally, it will still use Mussolini's form.

Our company: What about Italy's navy?

Kato: British intelligence says that part of the Italian navy has already fled to Malta. Of course, part of the one in Taranto has escaped, and part of the one in La Spezia has also escaped. So, it is true that some have escaped to Malta and Gibraltar. But Germany's methods are also very clever. Some were detained before they escaped, and some were sunk while escaping, so the enemy did not get that many.

The Surrender of Italian Warships is Worth Paying Attention to

But we must not forget that British and American forces have already landed on the Italian mainland, and their control of the Mediterranean Sea has been strengthened to some extent. A part of the Italian fleet has been captured. Therefore, the enemy's passage through the Mediterranean Sea is more free, and the pressure they exert on the Indian Ocean will also be strengthened. From Japan's point of view, this fact cannot be overlooked. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun on September 11 and 13)

### What is Expected After the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth

— Shui Zhaoxiong

The purchase of cotton yarn and cloth is like a thunderbolt on a sunny day. Its impact and consequences are profound and enormous. As far as leveling prices is concerned, the common people are all excited! However, the implementation of the policy must be comprehensive and thorough, so that the effect is universal and benefits all beings. I, who serve in the cotton textile industry association, would like to briefly describe my hopes after the purchase from the point of view of maintaining the production industry of my colleagues!

China's cotton textile factories are still in their infancy. Their capital is generally small, and their equipment is mostly simple. Most factories are alley factories, no different from alley elementary schools, lurking in various alleys and scattered throughout the city, which are small and many manufacturers. However, the number of citizens who rely on it for work and life, directly and indirectly, is no less than one million. In addition, processing, dyeing, and finishing are all handled by other factories, so the number of people related to this industry is more than ten thousand! On weekdays, the machines and workers in the factory are already packed without gaps, let alone have room to store raw materials. Since the movement of yarn and raw坯 has been prohibited, the raw materials in the factory have long been exhausted. Although the raw materials stored in the foreign stacks are within the prescribed reserve, they are not enough to solve the urgent need, and they can only sigh at the opportunity! To date, the number of factories that have successively stopped work is increasing day by day, and the workers who rely on them for life have nothing to rely on. If this continues, the future of people's livelihood is really worrisome!

Then how to deal with it? It is easy. If cotton yarn and cloth are illegally hoarded, it will be enough to endanger the foundation of the country. If the government purchases it and uses it for legitimate production and exchange of food, as long as management and operation are proper, it will not be difficult to restore production in an instant and save the people from water and fire. What is the method? First, the purchase and distribution should be quick. Delay will inevitably lead to the death of the factory. Second, the distribution must be organized and orderly. Confusion will make it difficult to achieve practical results.

Why should the purchase and distribution be quick? Since the factory's raw materials have been applied for sale, and most of them are stored in foreign stacks, the raw materials within the reserve amount cannot be moved. Therefore, the number of factories that have stopped work will inevitably increase, workers will lose their jobs, and employees will be idle, making it more difficult for the factory to maintain. Now that the hope of distribution has not been cut off, the factory is in a half-open state, and the employees are in a half-idle state. The workers are inquiring about the news of the start of work every day. The state of their wandering and dispersal is indescribable. Therefore, we urgently hope that the purchase will be completed as soon as possible, and the distribution will be implemented as soon as possible, in order to reverse the worrying situation. In addition, if the raw materials stored in foreign stacks are under proper circumstances, the factory should be allowed to move them to maintain production, which is also an urgent matter.

What is meant by distribution must be organized and orderly? The purchase of cotton yarn and cloth is prepared for long-term wartime use, so the distribution must be organized and orderly in order to facilitate management and avoid waste. In particular, it must be in line with the actual situation, and adjustments and supplements should be made to supplement the lack of production, so as to avoid affecting the livelihood of laborers. Now, I will try to describe the initial plan of distribution as follows, in order to serve as a reference when the authorities discuss the method:

A. The style of the products of the allocated raw materials should be specified. Since the allocation is prepared for long-term use, people's consumption should be restricted. There are many varieties of products and many raw materials are consumed. To save consumption, the first thing to do is to simplify the products. Therefore, it is appropriate to specify several styles of daily necessities for easy manufacturing.

B. Stipulate appropriate profits for factories and wholesale and retail merchants. If the profits are stipulated appropriately, the selling price will inevitably be reasonable. The stock in the market will be continuously produced due to the new goods, and the price will be appropriate. Therefore, the original selling price will naturally be flattened without pressure.

C. Factories should be "linked" to produce in order to facilitate distribution. Cotton textile factories vary in size. The organization is different. It is difficult to achieve the effect of control by distributing them among more than a thousand factories. If ten families can be combined into one "link", then a thousand families will only have one hundred "link". Distributing to hundreds of "links" will be twice as effective with half the effort.

D. Workers should be registered, work in shifts, and wages should be increased. The number of workers in the city is large, and they all belong to the production class, and they are all entrusted with the national lifeline. If they are allowed to be displaced, how can it be the country's happiness? Furthermore, the allocation of raw materials must be continued for a long time, and should not be "taken and demanded" casually. Imitating the "linking" of factories, workers should also be registered and "linked", work in shifts, and increase wages to maintain their livelihoods, so that national strength can still be preserved. Moreover, since the price of raw materials is low, increasing wages will never affect the selling price of the products.

E. Provide loans to factories and regulate factory funds. Factories are the source of national vitality. After their stocks have been purchased, the capital is sluggish and exhausted. It is necessary to assess their actual needs, provide loans to factories, and maintain them, so that revitalization can be expected.

The above-mentioned matters may already be under consideration by the Standing Bureau. There is no need for excessive worries from the people. However, this matter is of great importance to our country's cotton textile industry, so the expectation is as strong as a drought望雲兒. I think the authorities will definitely take appropriate measures to meet our high expectations!

### Method for Safely Storing Citizen Certificates

Recently, incidents of lost citizen certificates have occurred from time to time, mostly due to improper storage. In my opinion, the most important thing is to never put the citizen certificate together with banknotes. It is best to put it in a cloth bag and hang it on your belt to avoid losing it. Fortunately, the weather is getting colder, and this can definitely be put into practice. If not, the citizen certificate should be put in an envelope with your detailed address written on it, along with postage stamps, and the words "Kind Sir/Madam, please drop this into a mailbox." This way, if someone finds it, they can drop it into a mailbox to be returned. However, the envelope does not need to be sealed, so that it can be used for citizen certificate checks at any time.

### Improving the Paste at Post Offices

Yesterday, when I went to the Sichuan Road Post Office to mail a letter, I saw that the quality of the paste provided by the bureau was very poor (probably made from sorghum flour). It had no stickiness at all. Moreover, the postage stamps sold now are not as good as before. After the stamps are pasted, they easily fall off. I sincerely hope that the bureau will improve and use the black flour it used to use, which is much better. (Liu)
