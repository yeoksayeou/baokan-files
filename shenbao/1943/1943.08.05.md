### Editorial: Wartime Economy and Social Morality

The need to implement a wartime economy has long been recognized by all parties, and it has been more than half a year since the promulgation of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policies. However, what are the actual achievements? What are the effects in various places? What are the people's perceptions? To be honest, none of them are satisfactory! National policies have not been thoroughly implemented, the outline has not been fully realized, and cooperation with the war externally and the stability of the people's lives internally are far from the topic. What we hear, what we see, what we experience, and what we feel, looking around in confusion, thinking about the future, there is infinite warning, and we cannot but express it to the people of the country with great pain.

The essence of the so-called wartime economy, in terms of our country's position and obligations in the Greater East Asia War, lies in enhancing war power to assist friendly nations. This includes two major items, namely, stabilizing people's livelihoods and increasing production internally, and concentrating national strength and assisting the war externally. In order to achieve these two, we must implement the Outline of Wartime Economic Policies without reservation, in order to thoroughly implement national policies. Therefore, the state's control over the economic sector will inevitably become stronger day by day, which is beyond doubt and should not be hesitated. However, judging from today's actual achievements and thinking about past facts, there are indeed some experiences and lessons that are worthy of our attention and research.

Our country's national organization has always been unsound, and the people of the whole country are accustomed to being scattered, which is undeniable. Strict discipline and absolute rule of law have always been regarded as empty words by the people, who believe that there must be another set of practices when they are implemented. Therefore, regarding the implementation of wartime economic policies, some people believe that controlled economy is fundamentally unsuitable for China's national conditions. Even if it is implemented, it will inevitably lead to numerous malpractices, causing more disturbance to the people than benefiting the country. Of course, this is an extreme view, but reviewing the facts of the past implementation of controlled economy, there are indeed things that are unsettling. We cannot but reflect on this. At the same time, there is another type of person who believes that the reason why today's wartime economic policies have not been as ideal as expected is because of the failure to implement thorough control. Therefore, they advocate that complete control should be implemented over all economic sectors, so that the people's daily economic life, including food, clothing, housing, and transportation, is placed under control. Then the national policy will be carried out without fail. This kind of proposition is naturally not without basis. Japan and Germany are examples, and they are worthy of our research.

From a theoretical point of view, if a country wants to implement a wartime economy, it must concentrate the power to control the national economy in the central government, so as to exert the greatest operational efficiency with the least amount of resources, labor, and capital, and strive for the victory of the war for the country. This is inevitable and absolute. There is absolutely no way to implement a liberal economic policy during wartime and obtain any results. We see that the great powers of the past, whether it was the United States, Germany, or even the Soviet Union, have all implemented controlled economies since the war, and the scope of control has been expanding day by day, and the methods of control have been becoming more and more thorough and strict. Therefore, if we want to improve the wartime economy, the control policy must not be relaxed. No department or individual can attempt to avoid or take chances.

We believe that on the one hand, we must strengthen control and improve institutions, personnel, and methods, but in addition to paying attention to the soundness of institutions, we must also seek improvement in politics and the promotion of social morality. Make the people correctly understand the meaning of wartime economy, understand their own responsibilities to the country and the war, cooperate in promoting national policies, abide by laws and regulations, and contribute to the government with the greatest strength, so as to jointly seek the realization of national policies. At the same time, the central departments of the National Government, like the central nervous system of the whole body, occupy an important position. In order to promote national policies, they must establish close ties with each other and seek ways to cooperate and make progress in their respective responsible departments, so as to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. And the local governments, as the foundation for guiding the people to promote national policies, should maintain contact with the central departments and equivalent institutions, adhere to the central guidelines, follow the central instructions, and earnestly perform their due responsibilities for the same national policy. Between vertical and horizontal, absolutely avoid separation and unfamiliarity, and each act in its own way, resulting in a fragmented or confrontational situation. As reported in the Continental News yesterday, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the head of the former Japanese economic mission, told the Chinese financial community in an article (translated in today's Japanese newspaper, second edition), based on his personal diagnosis of China's economic ills, put forward several ways for China to deal with the economy at this time. He especially emphasized: The close relationship between politics and economy, if they are not integrated, cannot become a powerful country; The practice of destroying selfishness and serving the public, putting the country before the family, if everyone only knows how to pursue their own personal and family interests and ignores the interests of the country and the public, then the wartime economic policy will be difficult to implement; It is necessary to first strive to stabilize people's livelihoods, and the government can guarantee the basic living standards of the general public, not just the interests of a very small number of people, then the wartime economic policy will be easy to achieve. Mr. Ogura's golden words are indeed a symptomatic medicine for assisting the control policy and reviving China's wartime economy. The realization of these three points has no other method, only seeking the promotion of political morality and social morality.

Indeed, talking about political morality and social morality today may be too circuitous! However, to save China's current economic crisis, we really need to rely on this point. We earnestly hope that the authorities and social leaders will set an example, demonstrate the great public spirit and selfless political and social morality, and at the same time, in a negative way, put righteousness before family loyalty and severely punish those who violate wartime economic policies, so as to give a new look to the Chinese and foreign media. The government's prestige is improved, the credit of currency is improved, the atmosphere of national speculation is suppressed, the people's lives are guaranteed, everyone recognizes that the government is respectable and lovely, the production industry will naturally develop, the wartime economy will naturally be on the right track, and the realization of domestic and foreign policies can also be expected soon! True knowledge and action, we are eagerly awaiting from the authorities and social leaders!

### Chen Zhishuo Discusses Shanghai's Financial Problems

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency)

The two Shanghai concessions have been recovered by the National Government, and the financial construction of Shanghai in the future and the current general financial problems are of great concern to all parties. The reporter specifically visited Vice Minister Chen Zhishuo of the Ministry of Finance, who answered the questions as follows: What are your observations on the financial construction of Shanghai after the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession? The two Shanghai concessions have a history of nearly a hundred years, and because they enjoy special privileges and have various special relationships, they are superficially prosperous, mostly in terms of consumption. Now that the concessions have been recovered, they can gradually return to the true economic track. We should seize this excellent opportunity to focus on general wartime production, and at the same time focus on improving necessities, and adopt extreme thrift, limiting consumption. The construction of the industry is the development of production, and the development of production is the construction of finance. The prosperity of tax revenue and the vigor of production are closely related, and are mutually cause and effect. We cannot only focus on the financial income, but forget that other aspects of finance are branches. If the roots are solid, the branches and leaves will naturally flourish, and there is no need to discuss it in depth. What are your thoughts on the Japanese National Exchange Economic Mission? The Japanese Economic Mission came to China to inspect and conduct various on-the-spot investigations and interviews on our country's economy, and both sides have achieved great results in their respective economies. In the future, the two sides will work hard to cooperate, and there will be better phenomena in agriculture, industry, and commerce. Has the government's budget for the second half of the 32nd year been established, and what are the key points? The government's budget for the first half of the 111nd year has been approved by the National Defense Conference and has been formally established. The key point is to adapt to the wartime state, and the focus of the general budget should be on the needs and differences. What is the general financial situation now? The current general financial situation has a great impact on the recovery of the Shanghai concessions, and it also has a considerable relationship with the national economy and the general social economy. This is well known and need not be repeated.

According to Mr. Ishiwatari's statement in Fukuoka regarding the current situation of the Chinese economic community, the general idea is: After Japan implemented new policies in China, the cooperation of people in the Chinese business community has become more and more active. From this, it can also be seen that they are eager to revive China. Regarding the current problems in the Chinese economic community, a method has been formulated to deal with them, and it will be implemented soon. In addition, the establishment of a stabilization fund for the currency in North China and Central China is currently underway. Chairman Wang of the National Government arrived in Shanghai the other day and met with people from the Shanghai business community and gave many instructions, and the results were quite satisfactory. The Chinese National Government, in order to implement the New National Movement, launched a large-scale savings encouragement campaign on August 1st, so China's economic construction can be said to be gradually entering the right track. The characteristic of the Chinese economic community is that there is a surplus of labor, so use this surplus labor and revitalize industry. In short, China is currently a strong wing in establishing the Greater East Asia Economic Sphere, and is developing steadily forward.

### Japanese Army Wins Surprise Attack on New Guinea Front, Captures Solid Position Built by US Army

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - In the South Pacific region, a fierce battle is being waged by the navy, army, and air force for days. On the New Guinea front, since the US army landed in Nassau Bay on June 30th, it has been constantly attacking with the aim of capturing a Japanese base. A part of the enemy's strong force, possessing a large number of tanks, had advanced to a place south of Shoramoa, where they built a solid five-stage position, attempting to continue their attack. Therefore, in order to crush the enemy's advanced base in one fell swoop, the Japanese army began operations at dawn on the 29th of last month, crossed the rear end of the enemy's position, broke through the woodland area, and carried out a large detour operation. By about 5:00 pm on the 29th, they had advanced to the rear of the left wing of the enemy's position and began to carry out a surprise attack from the rear of the enemy. The enemy was caught off guard and fell into a state of confusion. Later, seeing that the Japanese army was very small, they dispatched war markets to resist tenaciously, and a melee broke out in the enemy's position. The Japanese army waved their bayonets and charged, with the leader and major Hisahisa leading the way, penetrating deep into the enemy's position, waving his knife to kill the enemy, and throwing grenades to repel the enemy. They repeatedly took the enemy's position. At 10:00 pm, they seized the army's ammunition, and continued to fight bravely. After a while, Lieutenant Tanaka also stepped forward and jumped in, fighting with the enemy soldiers everywhere for about half an hour, finally capturing the five-stage solid position built by the enemy. The enemy abandoned many corpses and fled in embarrassment. At the same time, 12 enemy tanks, 5 automatic rifles, 13 automatic pistols, 50 grenades, 1,500 rounds of ammunition, and many other weapons were captured. The Japanese side lost three soldiers and 14 were injured.

### US Aircraft Attacked Japanese Base, Four Shot Down

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain Japanese military location, the US military has launched several attacks on a certain Japanese forward location in the Solomon Islands since July 17th, but they were all met with fierce attacks from Japanese fighter squadrons or anti-aircraft fire, suffering great damage and retreating. However, disregarding all damages, the enemy attacked again on the evening of the 1st with 20 Type 100 (B24) heavy bombers, fighter jets, and 90 carrier-based bombers, totaling 100 aircraft. The Japanese war gates immediately took off to meet the enemy, shooting down four enemy aircraft and repelling them, forcing them to flee south. The Japanese side suffered very little damage.

In this autumn of world turmoil, in order to establish the permanent prosperity of all Asian nations and to overcome the current national crisis, we should do our best to go all out.

### Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Meets with German Ambassador to Discuss the European Situation

### US Economic Pressure Forces Argentina to Submit

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - US President Roosevelt dreamed of controlling the world, and this time he suddenly adopted economic pressure against Argentina, the only neutral country in the Americas. It remains to be seen whether Argentina, which has been subjected to such strong economic pressure, can continue to maintain neutrality. The Domei News Agency reporter specifically visited Naval Attaché Bortolo, a major general from the Argentine Embassy in Japan, to inquire about his views. He said: "The Argentine Embassy in Japan has not yet received a telegram from its home country, so it cannot express an official opinion. However, judging from the past, the United States has often adopted a strong pressure policy towards Argentina, so this incident was also expected. The United States has repeatedly tried to get Argentina to participate in the war against the Axis powers, but the Argentine government, based on its own independent position, resolutely rejected it, so the United States has taken this further pressure. The people of Argentina are independent people, and once a major policy of the country is decided, it will not allow other countries to interfere. Since Argentina has its own policy, it will continue to strictly adhere to neutrality. In terms of trade between the United States and Argentina, Argentina has always imported industrial products such as working machinery from the United States, and Argentina's main exports are food. After the United States implements an economic embargo against Argentina this time, what kind of impact will it have directly? It is necessary to see the future situation before it can be clarified, so it cannot be asserted at present. In my personal opinion, Argentina's policy will not change because of this. Although Argentina is under pressure from the United States, it will still act according to its own will and will not be moved by the United States."

### The Righteous Government Expresses its Position: Determined Not to Be Forced into Ceasefire, Vowing to Cooperate Loyally with Allies to the End

Rome, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The anti-Axis powers, taking advantage of the Italian political upheaval, presented Italy with seven articles, coercing Italy into a ceasefire. The Italian government authorities, on the 3rd, expressed their position on this matter, stating: The seven conditions proposed by the anti-Axis forces are nothing more than a demand for Italy's unconditional surrender. However, Prime Minister Badoglio, upon taking office, had already expressed his determination to continue the war. Therefore, the Italian government vows to cooperate loyally with its allies to the end, fully and completely. Among the articles proposed by the anti-Axis forces, the withdrawal of German troops was listed as one of the conditions. However, German troops are currently fighting alongside Italian troops in Sicily, which is the Italian government's concrete response to the anti-Axis demands.

Rome, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to Mr. Ho Han Burke, a special correspondent for Huitong News Agency, the relationship between Germany and Italy is currently in a very friendly state, with even closer cooperation among military leaders. The reception for the German and Japanese press conference continues to be held. The friendly atmosphere can be seen in the fact that Italian announcements still refer to the "Axis forces." Newspapers are now focusing on assisting German troops in resisting in Sicily. They are actively praising the German air force's contributions in western Sicily. The Italian public sincerely rejects the anti-Axis peace proposals. The daily newspaper on Tuesday carried a commentary on recent changes and overtures, with political circles believing that the publication of the conditions allows the Italian public to understand the enemy's surrender demands. The public remains calm, believing that the Badoglio government will decide on the most beneficial policies for Italy. In northern Italy, normalcy has been restored, and no new demonstrations have occurred.

Milan, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a report from the German News Agency, the Italian newspaper "Stampa" published an article entitled "Italy Under the Military Strategy System." The article stated that Italy's internal affairs must be coordinated with the military situation. The newspaper asserted that Europe at war is undergoing the organization of a military strategy system. From a military perspective, Europe today represents a unified organic whole. No country in Europe can act independently in this system. Italian troops are not only fighting in Sicily, but also strong detachments are stationed alongside German troops in the Balkans, the Dodecanese Islands, and French-occupied territories. The military and political system of European warring nations unites all countries. No country can pursue its selfish interests independently outside this system.

### Southeastern Orel Region: Fierce Fighting Between German and Soviet Forces; Strong Soviet Offensives at Donets and Belgorod Repelled by Germans

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to reports from the Eastern Front, by August 2nd, German forces had captured 17,895 Soviet troops in the Mius region. The number of Soviet troops killed and wounded was several times higher than this. In addition, 730 heavy cannons, 398 mortars, and a large amount of other military equipment were captured. Enemy troops whose war equipment was destroyed or captured had broken into the German positions north of Kuibyshevo but were surrounded and sealed off by German tank units and infantry. After several failed attempts to break through, Soviet forces are now concentrating their attacks on the Donets and Belgorod regions. Yesterday, they launched a large-scale offensive with strong infantry and armored units, which was completely repelled. In the Belgorod region, fierce fighting is ongoing. Yesterday, Soviet forces launched a major offensive in the southwestern Orel region, where a major battle is underway. However, these localized battles on the Southern Front have been repelled by German forces, inflicting significant damage and losses. The German air force has been assisting the army effectively. Soviet forces launched another large-scale attack with infantry and tank units south of the Ladoga River, but all attempts were unsuccessful.

### Central Sector of Sicily: Axis Forces Victorious

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to Mr. Braeunaege, a special correspondent for the German News Agency, German and Italian troops achieved a significant defensive victory yesterday in the central sector of the Italian front. Although the British attack was strongly supported by the air force, the attacking forces suffered partial losses during the defenders' counterattack and a significant amount of equipment was captured. German military officials stated that after this victory, the Anglo-American forces would need at least three divisions to be replenished from new reserves.

Rome, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Italian military headquarters' official report today stated that the anti-Axis forces repeatedly attempted to break through the central sector of the Sicilian front between Regalbuto and Sant'Agata, but were repelled by the stubborn resistance of the Axis forces. Fierce fighting has been ongoing in that area for four days, and the battle situation is currently intense. The Axis air force is assisting ground operations and frequently bombing targets on land and at sea. German fighter planes shot down three enemy "Liberator" aircraft in the eastern Ionian Sea. Italian minesweepers also shot down two enemy twin-engine aircraft in the same area.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to London news, British Prime Minister Churchill announced on Thursday that the anti-Axis forces had begun a new offensive in Sicily. He stated, "Our overall attack in Sicily began on the afternoon of the 1st. There was widespread fighting throughout yesterday. The anti-Axis command has used the lull in fighting last week to send reinforcements to the front lines."

### Crete: Defense is Extremely Well Prepared

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to the Huitong News Agency, "German Military News" reported that after the British and American forces landed on Sicily, those concerned with military affairs were paying particular attention to Crete in the eastern Mediterranean. Some people believe that Crete, which has been occupied by German forces for two years, may be attacked by the anti-Axis forces. The German occupation of the island holds a strategically important position. In the past two years, the island's defensive facilities must have been greatly strengthened. While German officials have neither confirmed nor denied this report, German reports mentioned the fortifications on Crete. The German troops who seized the island two years ago participated in designing the island's defense enhancements. Based on their experiences, they must have made appropriate contributions. There has been thorough research on how to respond to all offensive strategies. In order to counter enemy paratroopers infiltrating the interior to carry out harassment, not only are the coastal areas fortified, but there are also various preparations in the central part of the island. The island's terrain is steep and rugged, making it very unfavorable for paratrooper landings. The few plains that exist have been equipped with barbed wire and other obstacles. The island's key passes have been heavily fortified.

### Turkey's Reply to Anti-Axis Note Already Drafted

Ankara, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – It has been learned that the Turkish authorities have drafted a reply to the anti-Axis note of last week, which demanded that neutral countries not harbor Axis leaders. This was acknowledged by Reuters correspondent Walter Fiedler here. The reply is said to be strongly worded and rejects the anti-Axis proposal. Turkish officials have expressed strong resentment that the anti-Axis note violates international law regarding asylum regulations and infringes upon Turkish sovereignty. The Turkish Foreign Minister departed Ankara for Istanbul this evening. It is believed that the purpose of his trip is to personally deliver the reply to the Turkish President for approval.

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to Ankara news, the Turkish Foreign Minister, in conversations with foreign diplomats over the past few days, declared that Turkey's policy of strict neutrality would not be affected by the recent developments in Italy.

### To Those in Chinese Financial Circles

– Ogura Masatsune

The National Government of China once resolutely joined the Greater East Asia War, declaring its determination to live and die with Japan. Now, it has recovered its concessions, shedding its century-long semi-colonial status and rightfully restoring the honor of an independent nation, which is truly cause for celebration. This century has been a thorny and arduous path for China, filled with trials and tribulations. Now, its long-cherished wishes have been fulfilled. The revival of China is within reach. It has taken a giant step toward the liberation of Greater East Asia. The joy of the Chinese people is not hard to imagine.

However, recovering the concessions is merely a political measure. As for its actual effects on the ground, that is a matter for the future. For example, if public order were to deteriorate due to the recovery of the concessions, all the painstaking efforts would come to naught, and it would also damage China's reputation. In short, all future policies should be implemented under the responsibility of the Chinese themselves. Success or failure depends solely on one's own efforts. The responsibility of the Chinese people is very great, and especially for those in financial circles, who in reality occupy the central position in Shanghai, I express my expectations. Taking this opportunity, I will briefly state my humble opinions for the reference of those in Chinese financial circles.

Shedding Foreign Shackles

First, what I want to say is that Shanghai has legally shed its foreign shackles, and at the same time, it must mentally eliminate Western and American ways of thinking, and respect the talents of the Chinese and other Asians. Considering the current situation, I hope for the full implementation of the ideal of cooperating with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War swiftly. Shanghai has always been a distribution center for goods from the interior, and at the same time, it is highly dependent on foreign trade. Therefore, it has inevitably been influenced by the West. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, foreign trade was completely cut off. In terms of not following the economy and taking an independent form of spirit, haven't the remnants of British and American influence been wiped away?

No Need to Worry About Material Shortages

For example, when Shanghai is mentioned, decadent culture comes to mind. Recently, many Chinese have said: "Japan only talks about the spirit, while America has given us a large amount of material trade." From this viewpoint, they harbor a fearful feeling towards Japan's strength in the Greater East Asia War. This is misinformed and merely a superficial view.

However, firstly, the Chinese will not forget that while the British and Americans imported large amounts of goods, they also imported opium. The Chinese have deeply experienced that no British or American will give away a thing without taking anything in return. Secondly, now is the height of an unprecedented war. It is only natural that even in Japan, there is not an abundance of material trade. This is not unique to Japan; it is a common phenomenon in Britain and America. Moreover, Japan has already occupied abundant resources in the South and is actively developing them. Therefore, those who harbor fear for Japan's future are completely worried unnecessarily. However, the reason for presenting this argument now is that although China possesses a vast and resource-rich land, the supply of materials is somewhat geographically imbalanced. Therefore, its spirit itself becomes the problem. Does China prefer this abundant material wealth or, at the same time, a permanent independence? If it misses today's opportunity, China will have no hope of revival! The result of the Greater East Asia War is China's future. Even for its own sake, China should seek every means today, endure hardship, and win the Greater East Asia War. Remember that the destroyers of the Six States were not Qin, but the Six States destroyed themselves.

Below, I would like to speak about slightly more concrete issues based on the aforementioned ideals.

Politics and Economy as One

First, politics and the economy are closely related. All independent nations must possess solid political power and strong economic power. In today's world situation, these two are ultimately not separate things. If they are not integrated, then a nation cannot become a powerful one. However, in China, an ideal relationship between the two has never existed.

In today's situation, every nation cannot have economic development that is not adapted to national policy. For example, the credit of currency is based on trust in the government. If the currency has no credit, then the economy cannot operate.

Second, what should be the guiding ideology for the economy? The economy should adapt to national policy, so its guiding ideology should naturally be to prioritize the interests of the public, eliminate selfishness, and serve the public good. Needless to say, the economic ideology of the capitalist era was to pursue profit, but today, all countries in the world are prioritizing the interests of the public, practicing the morality of putting the nation before the family, and concentrating the nation's economic power on the point of waging war. Now, to violate the demands of the nation and only indulge in the pursuit of profit is to be out of step with the countries of the world.

Now, the biggest problem in Shanghai that is being noticed, such as the hoarding incidents, although the situation is complex, is ultimately the result of a lack of a sense of public welfare. I hope to quickly eliminate this thinking to stabilize people's livelihoods.

Stabilizing People's Livelihoods, Public Welfare First

Third is to stabilize people's livelihoods. In all wartime economies, the public is forced to reduce their standard of living. This is truly an unavoidable phenomenon. If the minimum standard of living cannot be maintained, then the war cannot be waged. Herein lies the importance and difficulty of the people's livelihood problem.

China's current situation is characterized by high prices, especially the soaring prices of necessities, which makes it difficult to stabilize people's livelihoods. The biggest reason is based on the lack of a public-welfare-first concept as described above. On the other hand, the decline in production leading to a shortage of materials also plays a big role. After foreign imports have been cut off, the livelihood issues are immediately related to the issue of increasing production. Increasing production is not only related to people's livelihood, but also a crucial issue in completing the war. It does not seem easy to immediately implement increased production in Shanghai, but if China supplies abundant resources and labor, and Japan supplies capital and technology, then there may be a way to break through.

The Chinese People are Rich in Economic Adaptability

Above, I have boldly stated my humble opinions. The implementation of these matters cannot be accomplished immediately. Without the full effort of the entire Chinese people, success will ultimately be difficult to achieve. I have visited China and personally had earnest conversations with influential figures in local financial circles. I learned that you all have a firm will to complete the war, and I was deeply moved. Originally, the Chinese people are rich in economic adaptability, and their economic skills have long been recognized around the world, so once they have determined their will and put it into practice, there is no need to be uneasy about it. Our psychology is also to put all our efforts into the revival of China and the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, for China, the most powerful member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, we earnestly hope for further cooperation in the future.

### Former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Broadcasts His Views on the Return of Concessions: "The Chinese People Should Control Their Own Destiny," Expressing Deep Hope that the New Municipal Authorities Will Continue to Cooperate

Mr. Oka Katsuo, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, gave a radio address last night (the 4th) on the return of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession to the National Government of China, broadcast from the Greater Shanghai Radio Station. His speech was as follows: Today, we in Shanghai are celebrating the return of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession to the National Government of China. This event is a turning point in the history of this great nation and its people's century-long struggle for national freedom and independence. At the same time, China and its people are to be commended for their successful efforts to regain complete administrative and jurisdictional rights over the Shanghai Concessions. In my capacity as the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, I would like to briefly express my views on this grand event.

A Historical Turning Point of a Century

The importance and significance of this historic event are truly immense. Perhaps this significance and importance cannot be fully appreciated at this moment, but I firmly believe that it will be easily understood by all of China. What I wish to particularly express at this time is that the Japanese government and people have always wished to see China break free from the shackles of unequal treaties, as well as the exploitation and oppression of Britain and America. China's strength and independence are not only important for the welfare of the Chinese people, but also closely related to the common welfare of East Asia. This is what the nations and peoples of East Asia have been hoping for.

Realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Ideals

Several years ago, China and its people may have felt frustrated, and may have even abandoned the struggle for freedom and independence. Britain only gave empty promises to China and its people, and these promises, as we know, have never been fulfilled. Not only that, but those British and American countries, for the sake of developing and maintaining their selfish interests, incited China and Japan to fight each other, in order to carry out their traditional policy of division. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said that China and Japan should be natural friends, not enemies. Today, as we celebrate this historic event, we witness the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong ideals. Although the Chinese and Japanese people once had misunderstandings and engaged in war, not long after, with Japan's friendly cooperation and the understanding of both allied nations, China has regained its national independence and freedom. There is nothing that Japan and the Japanese people are more pleased about than China's ability to realize its aspirations at an early date. This fact is very clear.

Administrative Affairs Not Yet Successfully Completed

Since I took office as Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Council's administrative efficiency has improved, social order has been completely restored, and sound municipal financial policies have been implemented. This is something that I and my colleagues can be gratified about. All sectors of society have enthusiastically cooperated with the Council, enabling various plans to be carried out smoothly, for which I and my colleagues are deeply grateful. What is most noteworthy in Shanghai is that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the entire society, regardless of nationality, has been united in striving for a common goal, namely, to ensure Shanghai's security and prosperity. What I regret is that there are still many administrative matters that the Council has not been able to successfully complete and that need to be continued. This is due to the fact that Shanghai's municipal administration is divided into three areas, each with its own policies on taxation, price controls, and so on. Fortunately, Shanghai's administration has now been unified, and these problems will soon be improved.

Joint Efforts by All Parties to Share Responsibilities

I would now like to express my views on the public opinion in Shanghai. The progress of the Greater East Asia War has made the citizens of this great city develop a sense of self-awareness, which has been of great help to the reform of municipal affairs. All the Chinese people, especially the citizens of Shanghai, are gradually realizing that the Chinese people should be the masters of their own destiny. As a result, a close connection has developed between the execution of municipal affairs and the opinions of leaders from all walks of life in the Chinese community. The ability of all sectors of society to understand the responsibilities of citizens is one of the healthiest signs, and the progress and development of Shanghai's future can be predicted. This point deserves to be emphasized.

Now that the entire municipal administration of Shanghai has been handed over to the Chinese government, I sincerely hope that the Chinese leaders will properly address the issue of China's revival. Enhancing the public spirit of the general Chinese people, and maintaining good municipal administration in Shanghai, are the two factors that guarantee Shanghai's future progress and development.

Hope that Citizens Trust the Authorities

Shanghai has a large number of civil and commercial institutions, such as clubs, trade associations, church organizations, as well as major banks and stores. I believe that the interests of these institutions and organizations should be taken into account when establishing a sound municipal management policy. The prosperity of this city is inextricably linked to sound methods of budget preparation and revenue enhancement. I also believe that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Shanghai Municipal Council has cultivated the faith of the citizens of the city, which the Council has tried to grasp for the benefit of the public. The citizens' faith has been invaluable in helping us to perform our complex duties, and I sincerely hope that the general public and all capable people will continue to provide full assistance and support to the new municipal authorities under the leadership of Mayor Chen in the future. Mayor Chen has vast experience and a great reputation, and he is most suited to lead the administration of this great city. I am confident that Mayor Chen will gain the greatest trust and reliance from all levels of society, both Chinese and foreign. Finally, I and my colleagues would like to express our greatest confidence in the future of Shanghai. China and its people are now standing at the beginning of a new era, and we hope that they will be able to use their own creativity and intelligence to strive for progress and complete China's revival.

Thank you all for listening.

### Gao Regiment Reinforces in the Battle of Tangzizhen

According to a conversation with a person from Yuhua, the New Fourth Army's Fourth Regiment and part of an independent force, totaling about 800 people, recently attacked Tangzizhen in the Fourth District of Yuhua. After the 23rd Division's Gao Regiment responded and was reinforced by Regiment Commander Gao Jie upon hearing the news, they were repelled. In this battle, the New Fourth Army suffered the death of one deputy regimental commander and more than 50 soldiers. Over 20 rifles, four light machine guns, and a large amount of other spoils of war were captured.

### The Tenth Period of Tax-Appraised Tobacco is Now Widely Available

The Central China Tobacco Distribution Cooperative has already distributed the tenth period of goods to various retail tobacco shops for sale. The public is enthusiastically purchasing them. However, all shops strictly prohibit children from purchasing goods in accordance with the regulations.

### Fine Exhibition Displays "Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Handwritten Letters"

The ancient Buddhas, oil paintings, gold and silver coins, and various rare treasures displayed at the Fine Arts Exhibition Hall have been attracting a large number of visitors in recent days. In the literature section, the most valuable items are the original handwritten letters sent by Dr. Sun Yat-sen from abroad thirty years ago when he launched the revolution.

### All Criminal Cases in the City Will Now Be Sent to the District Procuratorate

After the Shanghai District Procuratorate was formally established, citizens are no longer required to submit complaints or accusations for criminal cases to the Procuratorate. At the same time, all criminal cases handed over by police stations throughout the city must first be transferred to the Procuratorate for investigation. Yesterday, the District Procuratorate informed all police stations in the city that all criminal cases must be handed over to the Procuratorate before 10:00 AM every morning. The case transfer form must clearly state the details of the case, along with the fingerprint card and stolen goods, which must be attached to the case for legal investigation and handling.

### Director Hirota of the Press Section Discusses: The Economic Severance Between the U.S. and Argentina; Each of the Axis Powers Should Be Isolated by Force and Capitalist Domination

On the 3rd, the U.S. government canceled the approved exports to Argentina for 16,000 exporters throughout the U.S. that were calculated before May of this year. In effect, the U.S. and Argentina have taken steps toward economic severance. Director Hirota of the Press Section of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai recently made a statement on this matter, pointing out that this measure clearly reveals the

U.S.'s Strategy and Policy

Mr. Hirota stated that the U.S. government, on August 3rd, issued an order to cancel export permits to Argentina for 16,000 exporters throughout the U.S. With this, the U.S. has taken the first step towards economic severance with Argentina. It is well known that Argentina has maintained a neutral policy since the outbreak of the European War and the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, Argentina has never done anything to obstruct the U.S., and the two countries have maintained friendly relations. However, the U.S. has, without reason, imposed such unfriendly and coercive policies. From this, we can deeply understand how unreasonable the U.S.'s world policy is, and it exposes its

Ambition to Dominate the World

According to reports, after Bestor stepped down and Ramirez took over as the new president, we all knew how the new president suppressed pro-British and American factions and communist countries, dissolved right-wing groups, and devoted all his efforts to maintaining a just and pure neutral policy. However, the U.S. took advantage of the Argentine military revolution to try to implement its strategy of increasing its say, which was initially valued by the general public. In reality, this kind of U.S. strategy did not progress, so it eventually resorted to forcing Argentina through economic trade. The U.S. not only attempted political interference in Argentina, but also used

Economic Pressure

to compensate for its lack of political power, exhausting all means to make Argentina comply with the U.S.'s true intentions. If we carefully and comprehensively observe this fact, we can clearly understand the U.S.'s intentions. In the past, the U.S.'s policy towards Central and South American countries was based on the Monroe Doctrine. Recently, it used Commemoration Day as the center, and Secretary Hull and Vice President Wallace, etc., used the term "idealism" to vigorously promote "free trade" and "economic cooperation between North and South America," and even said that the U.S. would bring prosperity and peace to the Americas. However, now it is using strong-arm tactics against Argentina, which is defenseless. This further shows that U.S. diplomacy is

Double-Faced

capitalist diplomacy. Japan has also experienced this kind of experience. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, U.S.-Japan relations gradually became dangerous from 1937 to 1938. Therefore, the U.S. began to expand its military in 1938, and in December 1939, it implemented the so-called morally prohibitive exports to Japan. On the other hand, the U.S. government issued an export ban, but this measure could not be applied because it conflicted with the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce. Therefore, the U.S. government instructed exporters to take a morally prohibitive export ban. In reality, the U.S. was no longer able to export aircraft, trucks, ships, and machine tools. By July 26 of the following year (1940), the U.S. announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Navigation and Commerce, which took effect six months later on January 26, 1941. From that time on, the U.S. ban on exports to Japan became legally effective. Following this, on July 26 of the same year, a capital freeze order was issued, and exports of oil to Japan were also included in the ban. The U.S.'s attitude towards Japan

verbally

used beautiful words of justice, humanity, and friendship as its diplomatic policy. However, on the other hand, it expanded its military and adopted economic policies to contain Japan, the core of military expansion, which eventually led to the unavoidable outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Chile also severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers on January 20 of this year. However, the U.S.'s policy towards Chile is the same as its policy towards Argentina this time. The U.S.'s actions towards Argentina, which is the most impartial and sincerely maintains neutrality, are enough to show that the U.S.'s purpose in waging war is to use coercive means to prevent other countries from being independent and self-reliant. At the same time, it is also clear that although the U.S. verbally claims to implement idealistic policies and guarantee the independence of other countries, in fact, the U.S.

has no scruples

and intends to dominate the world with its military and capital power. I therefore advocate that it should be isolated from the world war instigator, Roosevelt. This should be implemented not only by the Axis powers and neutral countries, but also by all the Allied countries other than the U.S.

### District Head Chen Inspects the Fire Department; Delivers Instructions to Staff

Since the establishment of the Eighth District Public Office, the heads of all departments in the district office have fully taken over their duties. Mayor Chen, concurrently District Head of the Eighth District, inspected the fire department staff of the district on the morning of the 4th. After arriving at the district office at 10:00 AM, he went to the Songshan Road Fire Department of the Fire Department at 10:30 AM, accompanied by Chief Secretary Zhao Zunyue. Director Xia Guoliang and Deputy Director Bao Ru of the department greeted them at the entrance. After District Head Chen inspected all the fire department staff, he delivered an address, and then rested in the director's office. During this time, Director Chen inquired about the details of the fire department's affairs in the district from Director Xia and Deputy Director Bao Ru. After 11:00 AM, he accompanied Chief Secretary Zhao, Director Xia, and others to inspect the Xin Kaihe and Bai Li Tong Road fire departments.

Director's Address

He briefly commented that today, seeing you all energetic and full of spirit, I am very pleased. Your service as firefighters in the city is crucial, and your work is as important as the police force. Everyone's efforts in this district in the past are well-known. Now that Shanghai's municipal administration is unified, the fire department's work should also be unified. Therefore, I hope that you will continue to work hard with the spirit of the past, so that Shanghai's fire department will be further strengthened. I would especially like to thank you all for your hard work in the past, and I hope that you will work even harder in the future, so as to strengthen Shanghai's fire department.

### 43rd Installment of Household Rice; Approximately One and a Half Liters to Be Sold Soon

According to the Datong News Agency, the Rice and Flour Allocation Office of the Materials Control Department will distribute warehouse receipts to rice shops starting today (the 5th) for the 43rd installment of household rice. Sales are expected to begin in about a day. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired at the Rice and Flour Allocation Office, the amount of rice for this installment is still one and a half liters due to the limited amount of rice allocated by the Joint Cooperative, priced at 9 yuan. The quality of the rice is the same as the previous installment.

### No Foreign Language on Junior High Entrance Exams

The Municipal Education Bureau believes that many junior high school entrance exams in the city include English as a subject. This is not only inconsistent with the regulations, but also prevents students who have not learned English in elementary school from taking the exams, which is quite inappropriate. Therefore, it has issued a notice to all schools, stipulating that junior high school entrance exams should not include foreign languages as a principle. If necessary, students may choose one subject of Japanese or English.

### Director of Finance Bureau's Broadcast Address

The celebration of the recovery of the concessions, organized by the Municipal Propaganda Office, was broadcast yesterday by Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau. The broadcast address briefly stated: The Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession were recovered two days ago on the 5th and 6th. The joy of the people has reached its peak. You can imagine this from the joy and excitement of a group of people. Why are the people so excited about the recovery of the concessions? In reality, the sins of the concessions were too many, and the oppression by the British and Americans was too severe. Oppression leads to resistance, and the more severe it is, the more likely it is to lead to resistance. Now that the concessions have been recovered, Japan has taken over the concessions for a very short period of time and has established a self-defense corps, allowing the people to directly defend themselves and fulfill their duties. I believe that in the future, the police can be well-trained. Although we do not advocate leaving doors unlocked at night or not picking up lost items, we can at least allow the residents to sleep peacefully. As long as the people live and work in peace and contentment, the city will naturally be peaceful and prosperous, making this the largest city in East Asia and turning it into an ideal paradise. That way, we will not fail the good intentions of those who have returned and helped us.

### First District Education Director Lin Jiong'an Discusses Education Facilities; No Major Changes in the Education Department's Personnel; Future Policy Focuses on Improving Thought

After the official establishment of the First District Public Office, the educational administrative facilities in the entire district have been of great concern to all parties. A reporter from the Guofeng News Agency visited Director Lin of the Education Department at the First District Public Office yesterday, and Mr. Lin made the following statement.

No Major Changes in Department Personnel

Since the reorganization of this department, there have been no major changes in personnel. I am the director, and Mr. Ueno Taichu, the former director of the Education Department of the Public Works Department, is now the deputy director. In addition, Mr. Tian Jun has been appointed as the deputy director. Mr. Tan has served as a professor at St. John's University and has a lot of experience in educational administration. I come to the department to work every morning and return to the Municipal Bureau in the afternoon to handle affairs. Although the time is a bit rushed, everything here has a basis because of the grand plans of the former director, Mr. Ueno.

Improving Thought in Future Education

Regarding the focus of future education, we will start with improving thought. This has already been seen in my broadcast speech yesterday. We will do our best to eliminate enslaved education and will not take British and American comprador education with an excessively individualistic color as the central curriculum standard. We will follow the central government's instructions and take Chinese language as the foundation. The detailed reform plan is currently being drafted. In the past, the Public Works Department had two departments: Western education and Chinese education. All former public primary and secondary schools have now been renamed Shanghai Special City Public Primary and Secondary Schools. There are currently four male middle schools, one female middle school, seven primary schools, one night school, and five ordinary night schools. The school opening date was originally scheduled for September 1st. In order to be consistent with other districts in the city, the middle school will be changed to August 24th, and the primary school will be scheduled to open on August 22nd.

Improving Efficiency and Treatment

Regarding the state of anarchy in private schools in the past, we will strictly rectify them from now on. We will thoroughly manage the income and expenditure of the schools. This department has clear regulations on the fee standards according to the methods stipulated by the Municipal Bureau. The minimum and maximum fees must not be exceeded. In order to improve educational efficiency, it is necessary to hire excellent teachers. In order to stabilize their lives and make them feel excited about their work, we have issued a notice to all private schools that 70% of the fees collected will be used for teachers' salaries and 30% will be used for the school's regular expenses. This department will also send personnel to the schools to investigate.

### First and Third Police Bureaus to Establish Security Corps Office; Su Chengde Concurrently Serves as Deputy Director

The First and Third Police Bureaus of Shanghai Special City have decided to strengthen the original security corps organization within their jurisdictions and establish security corps offices directly under the jurisdiction of the respective police bureaus. The position of director has already been internally determined. Deputy Director Su Chengde will concurrently serve as deputy director. In the first district, Mr. Shigeta Mitsuji, the former director of the Security Corps Guidance Committee, will concurrently serve. The eighth district has not yet been determined. The internal organization is still under review. As for the lower-level organization, it will temporarily maintain its original state and is not intended to be changed.

### First Anniversary of Mr. Sun Yinbin's Death; Donation of Condolence Money to Support Education; The Filial Piety of His Sons Is Commendable, Continuing His Legacy, Donations From All Walks of Life Are Enthusiastically Given

Yesterday, we received a letter from the Sun brothers, Ji Cheng, Ji Lian, and Ji Min, from Deqing Lane, Muran Road, stating, "Recently, on the first anniversary of our late father's death, we held a sutra chanting ceremony at Huguo Temple for one day. We are deeply grateful for the generous gifts from relatives and friends. Because our late father had a plan to help young people who had dropped out of school during his lifetime, and passed away with this aspiration, we have decided to donate all the condolence money received this time, plus the remaining savings from frugality, totaling 10,000 yuan in Central Reserve Notes, to be used as scholarships to fulfill our late father's legacy and benefit relatives and friends. In addition to sending 5,000 yuan to the News Daily, we are sending a check for 5,000 yuan and a list for your review and to issue a receipt." In addition, Xu Peiji donated 2,000 yuan, Xie Feng Company, Shao Gongzi's soup party expenses, Cun Pushi, Le Mei Long's feast expenses, and other donations from all parties are commendable.

Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday

The scholarship funds received yesterday are listed below: Sun Jicheng, Jilian, Jimin, and their brothers 5,000 yuan (condolence money and savings from frugality from relatives and friends for the first anniversary of their late father, Mr. Yinbin, the list of relatives and friends is as follows) (Ji Yonggang 820 yuan, Bao Zaming 640 yuan, Yin Peizhang, Li Yongnian, Liang Shaoshen each 540 yuan, Gao Shuan 460 yuan, savings from this residence 1,460 yuan, totaling 5,000 yuan). Xu Peiji 2,000 yuan, Xie Feng Enterprise Company Zhang Mingwei 1,000 yuan, Shao Qianli (Gongzi Jiu'an's full moon soup party expenses) 1,000 yuan, Cun Pushi 1,000 yuan, Le Meilong (saving feast expenses) 1,000 yuan, Yuan Henghe Store 500 yuan, Shanghai Bookbinding Industry Association 220 yuan, Miss Xi Deqi 100 yuan, Huaiyang Old Lady Zhang Jun each 10 yuan, totaling 11,840 yuan in Central Reserve Notes, leaving a balance of 1,470,336 yuan.

### Masnan Road Prison Reorganizes Detainees; Those Awaiting Trial Are Sent to Shanghai Prison; Those Under Investigation Are Temporarily Returned to the Original Police Station

The former Masnan Road Prison in the French Concession has been converted into the Shanghai Local Procuratorate Detention Center. The newly appointed director of the detention center, Mr. Wang Baosan, has taken over his duties. It has been found that the detainees in the detention center are those awaiting trial who have been detained by various police bureaus and transferred to the procuratorate for investigation. Those who have been convicted are transferred to Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison for execution. Since the prison was converted into a detention center, it still detains more than 100 convicts of the former Special No. 2 Court and more than 200 detainees of the Security Command, who have not yet been transferred to Shanghai Prison. Therefore, the detention center is rushing to handle the matter. At present, the suspects who have been transferred to the procuratorate for investigation by the police bureaus are temporarily returned to the police bureaus for detention after the investigation. Once the detention center has completed the transfer of the convicts, it will officially detain the suspects detained by the police bureaus.

### New Business Hours for Nanjing Road Stores

Closed Sunday Mornings Public Place Rotation Shanghai Nanjing Road stores, in the past, except for large stores and large companies, which were mostly closed on Sunday mornings, other stores were open as usual. Now, the Nanjing Road Business Association has, in response to the requests of various stores, resolved to close for half a day on Sunday mornings starting this week, and to open as usual from 1:00 PM. However, restaurants, hotels, public places, cold drink and food stores, etc., are exceptions to the rotation.

### Portuguese Consul General Sends Congratulations to Mayor Chen

After the recovery of the Shanghai Concessions, Mayor Chen also served as the head of the First and Eighth Districts. Letters and telegrams of congratulations arrived in droves. Here is a letter from the Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai, He Dongru: "I am honored to serve as the head of Shanghai's district administration. I am sure that you will make great achievements. Congratulations."

### The Murderer of Yuan Qimei, Who Taught at Minli Nanyang Women's Middle School and Sanyu Middle School, and Whose Essay Was Selected as the First Prize Winner in the Monthly Essay Contest in this Newspaper, Was Arrested and Sent to Shanghai

Yuan Qimei, a native of Jiading, who was a teacher at Minli Nanyang Women's Middle School and Sanyu Middle School, and whose essay was selected as the first prize winner in the monthly essay contest in this newspaper, was killed by bandits this spring when he accompanied his wife back to his hometown of Tangzhen. After his family reported the incident to the local military and police authorities, requesting the arrest of the murderer, Zhang Weiguang, the captain of the Jiading Rural Clearing Enforcement Team, arrested Yuan Nengwen (nicknamed A Xiang), the main culprit in the case. After interrogation, it was learned that the murderer was also the victim's nephew. Captain Zhang believed that the murderer dared to commit such a murder in the Qingxiang area, and that the murdered person was his uncle, which was extremely illegal. Therefore, he was immediately sent to the Shanghai Security Command Vehicle Law Office for strict punishment according to law. Economic Affairs

### Commenting on Oath; Matchsticks Distributed by Household

According to the Daily News, matchstick distribution is currently being actively planned and may be implemented around the end of this month. It is also heard that a household allocation method will be adopted to eliminate merchants from profiting from it. If matchsticks are really distributed by household, it would be a somewhat satisfactory thing, because matchsticks are the most indispensable of daily necessities, and they are also relatively inexpensive among daily necessities. However, the price of matchsticks has also skyrocketed along with other items, threatening the lives of ordinary people no less than firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and should not be ignored due to their small size and light price.

Due to the household distribution of matchsticks, I think of the necessity of reforming all allocation systems in wartime economic control. Take cigarettes, for example. If strict allocation methods are really adopted, even using the Baojia system to implement cigarette allocation by head (of course, it must be certified by the Jia head as a genuine smoker), then the limited-price cigarettes will not become the current open cigarette black market.

In short, in a word, the widespread implementation of the consumption allocation system can block the path for the industrial and commercial sectors to make illegal profits.

### Authorities Pay Close Attention to Real Estate Speculation in This City

The real estate in this city has been rising continuously in price since last year, and speculative merchants are even using real estate as a "kick the ball" type of transaction. As a result, real estate prices have also risen several times a day in the past six months. This kind of "kick the ball" transaction method involves large companies with strong financial resources purchasing a large alley at once, and then distributing the houses in the alley for sale. Another type involves smaller real estate speculators gathering three or five people to jointly purchase several houses, and then selling the houses at a good price within three to five days, making countless profits with one turnover. However, once this trend starts, the residents of the alleys in this city often suffer from the unreasonable bullying of the landlords, forced to move and increase rent. Under the pressure of heavy pressure, the narrow living spaces are even more restless. Recently, in the past month or two, the authorities in this city have been thoroughly investigating hoarding, sparing no effort, and those who hoard commodities have been severely punished. As a result, the general hoarders have shifted their sights and turned to hoarding real estate, and this hoarding behavior is becoming larger and larger. It is heard that the relevant authorities are now paying close attention to it.

### Celebrating the Acceptance of the Football Second Act in the Concession; The Italian Navy Lineup Announced; A Performance at Yiyuan With the Three Provinces Team Tomorrow

The second act of the charity football match celebrating the recovery of the concessions, organized by the Three Provinces Sports Association, will be held tomorrow (Friday) at 6:00 PM at the original location. The Three Provinces team will face the Italian Navy, which has not appeared for a long time. The Italian Navy has been absent from Shanghai fans for four months since the end of the last Western League. The audience has been longing for the team's superb skills for a long time. This time, the lineup is completely new. The strength of the whole team is strong and abundant, and it can be said to be comparable to the Three Provinces team. Tickets are still sold for 20 yuan and 50 yuan and are pre-sold at the four major theaters of Da Guangming, Nanjing, Guotai, and Meiqi, as well as at the National Speed ​​Equipment Company at the intersection of Yihai Road and Father Jingu Road.

Therefore, they are currently uniting with all relevant parties to conduct urgent discussions in order to implement effective measures. At the same time, it has been learned that the authorities will not change the previously set price limits for various goods unless absolutely necessary, and will devote all their efforts to lower prices. The punishment methods for unscrupulous merchants who exceed the prices will be more severe.

### Hua Stock Trend

Yesterday, Hua stocks were small, which was a legacy of the fatigue of the past two days. Selling followed one after another, but suddenly became firm at the foot after noon. The selling prices of various stocks at noon had already been absorbed by those who had entered. The good reason was that the price drop of gold had stopped, and new and old investments had restarted. Among the various stocks, there were still those that were smaller than the previous day. Yongan Company broke through the seventh level and then went out. Xinxin and Guohuo successively broke into the fourth level. China Underwear was flat and fatigued, Jingfu Shirts and Socks firmly stood at the fifth level, Jinglun slightly recovered, Yongan Textile was reduced by another fifty. The shares of Xinxiang, Rongfeng, Xinfeng, Guoguang, Guoxin, Zhenfeng, Gonghe, Wuhe, and other small denominations all had considerable drops. Hongshen and Da Zhonghua Weaving also saw a reduction, and they all broke into the level. Zhonghua Dyeing and Weaving alone was firm and cultural industry was the most stagnant. Commerce, Zhonghua, and World Bookstores, and Yongxiang Printing House all firmly stood at the original price. The price of the new pharmaceutical industry, Xinyi, Zhongxi, and Wuzhou, was around the same. Da Zhonghua Match Factory retreated to the fourth level. The public utility industry fell sharply. Zhabei Water and Electricity and Beishang Electric each fell by dozens. The latter retreated near the third level. Shanghai Tricycle alone was firm and expensive. Among the industrial stocks, only China Investment still saw an increase. Xinghua Industrial has already risen, and demand exceeds supply. The rest, such as Jiu'an and Da Zhonghua Industrial, Xinya Construction, and Guohua Investment, all had small trades. Xin Yi and Lianhua Real Estate also saw a slight decrease. Standard Flavor Powder and Gaomei Food have stopped the fatigue and returned to firmness, and each jumped out of the level. Standard Paper Products has been ex-rights and opened a new stock, with a price exceeding the face value by 20%. Jinfeng Papermaking Security Glass is stable, and Scientific Chemical has debuted, with a price exceeding the face value by 150%.

### New Soybeans Arrive on the Market; Tofu Industry Petitions for Supply

New soybeans will soon be successively available. It is reported that the new "cowhide" soybeans from Changzhou have already arrived on the market. Grain merchants are already heading there to purchase them in succession, and a large amount is expected to arrive in Shanghai within days.

Furthermore, the local tofu industry has been suffering for some time due to the suspension of soybean rationing. Relying on the black market has proven to be both expensive and difficult to procure. They have recently petitioned the Grain Bureau, requesting that they devise a plan to supply soybeans in order to maintain their businesses.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Gold and Silver: Yesterday morning, the gold shops' trade association dealt in jewelry gold, but there were still no retail sales. The after-hours price had become stable. The opening price once rose, then immediately fell back outside the major checkpoints. The after-hours price for silver stood at 100.

Government Bonds: The over-the-counter market for unified government bonds showed mixed movements. Series C rebounded, Series B slightly declined, Series A slightly rose, Series D fell, and Series E remained unchanged. Transactions were only recorded for Series A.

Yarn and Cloth: Due to difficulties in transport, actual sales were nonexistent, resulting in scarce transactions. Only 20-count Hangzhou yarn and Shuangma cloth had asking prices, slightly lower than yesterday. The trend in the cotton cloth market weakened. After the initial opening in the morning, prices fell across the board due to widespread selling, leading to a generally lower close compared to the previous day. Longtou fine cloth, Four Gentlemen quasi-gingham, Peach Blossom Nvshi cloth, San Yang serge all experienced slight declines, and transactions were scarce.

Rayon: The market was quite weak, mainly because yarn and cloth transactions were sluggish. As a result, both insiders and outsiders adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and prices had fallen into the 60,000 range.

Bean Cake: Recently, due to infrequent inland transportation and a small amount of cottonseed cake being shipped eastward, confidence was particularly lacking, and the price remained firm.

### Activities of Various Trade Associations

Tea Industry Federation: The joint conference of tea industry trade associations from various regions (Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Kangjiang, Shaoxing, Dinghai, etc., included) held its inaugural meeting yesterday (the 4th) at 3 PM at the clubhouse on Tiantang Street. More than a dozen representatives from ten regions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and from Beijing and Shanghai attended. Representatives from the relevant authorities were dispatched to provide guidance. After discussing the association's articles of association and electing directors and supervisors, an inauguration ceremony was held. The elected directors included Zhang Jialing, Wang Zhenshi, Zhan Shiyuan, Hong Jingwu, Huang Yantang, and seventeen others. The supervisors included Tang Jisan, Sheng Yixing, Chen Shisheng, Fang Jihong, Wu Hongsheng, and seven others.

Songtai District Grain Industry: The Songtai District Grain Industry Trade Association believes that Huangdu Town in Qingpu County is far from the county office, and transportation is obstructed, but grain production is abundant, making it necessary to establish an office to facilitate the handling of association affairs. Wu Shixing has been appointed as the director of the office and is starting to organize it. It will be established soon.

### The True Meaning of Freedom

— Yi Bi

Some people say that the meaning of "freedom" is not having anyone controlling you—that a free person can do anything he pleases. He is not like a horse or an ox being whipped forward or backward by someone else. If "freedom" is defined merely as being able to do what you please, then there would never be such a thing as "freedom" in this world.

In a chaotic country without laws, police, or government, you can come and go as you please, work or wander as you please, and even steal or kill as you please. However, this is not your true freedom, because under this so-called "freedom," you are also in danger of being robbed, hindered, or even killed. In a savage region where there are no rules, laws, or anything else; on a deserted island where no one opposes or stops you, your true "freedom" can be said to be completely lost, because everything you do is worthless, the content of your "freedom" is useless, and the meaning of your "freedom" is too small.

On the other hand, in a country with a strong government and strict laws, a person has the most opportunities for development, which means he is the freest person, because he can use the opportunities given by the country to contribute to great undertakings. This is true freedom that benefits the masses.

### The Relationship Between Profit and Disorder

— Gan Zhong'an

The Analects say: "Zi Gong speaks of profit." Mencius also says: "Those who rise at cockcrow to pursue profit are followers of [the villain Zhi]." From this, we can see that the great sages and virtuous men of ancient times did not approve of "profit" because profit is the origin of disorder.

In modern times, customs are base, and those who seek profit are everywhere. Speaking of profit, there are two types: legitimate and illegitimate. For example, a farmer works hard to cultivate the land and contributes his harvest to society after the autumn harvest. Earning a profit to maintain a livelihood is a legitimate profit. As for the hoarders in Shanghai today, who take advantage of others' misfortunes, hoarding goods on a large scale and then selling them at illegally high prices, exploiting the common people, their so-called profit is extremely illegitimate. People toil for profit, endure all kinds of hardships for profit, and even lose their lives for profit. From this, we can see that its allure is truly unparalleled. In the past, warlords fought each other for territory, which led to war. As a result, the people suffered, becoming displaced and lacking food and clothing. What is the reason for this?

If we want to stop the disorder, we must first eliminate the concept of profit from people's minds. How can we do this? In this degenerate age, "if the Taoist is one foot high, the devil is ten feet high." This is due to the defects of the system, which need to be reformed. On the other hand, we must pay attention to the function of education. If everyone receives a good education, then knowledge will be enhanced, and people will know what they should and should not do. They will also understand the difference between good and evil. If everyone has no concept of "profit," disorder will naturally not occur.

### Pen Flowers

— Ji Zi

Whatever you do, if you don't do it, don't do it. Once you do it, you should not only do it well but also do it the best.

Work is not a pain, but the joy of life.

Never rashly criticize others. Observe everything with a calm attitude.

Resisting tyrannical forces without surrendering is the best character.

"Honesty" is the magic formula for gaining the faith of others. We should use it carefully.

Exploiting the labor and happiness of others while enjoying the fruits of their labor is the most shameful behavior.

### Struggle

— Xi Qiang

Don't hesitate, don't retreat, now is our opportunity to struggle! With our great hands and intelligent minds, we will not be afraid of hardship or toil. We will ignore the unconscious ridicule and pay no attention to the jeers of the backward. Clenching our teeth and gripping our fists, we must struggle towards a new future! Struggle!

### A Humble Word to the "China Railway" Authorities

— Wang Guoyuan

Railway transportation is like the aorta of the human body. It not only bears the mission of transporting nutrients to the various tissues of the body but also has a close relationship with all the systems of the body. When this circulatory system is obstructed or its effectiveness is hampered by the aorta's unhealthiness, it will not only affect the health of the human body but also seriously affect a person's life. In the past, because inland waterway transport could not fully operate and develop, the importance of railway transport became even greater. On the vital lines of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, how many millions of people come and go through the large throughput port of Shanghai North Station every day? Therefore, the responsibilities of the "China Railway" authorities are not only for transport but also have a great impact on the economy, people's livelihood, public safety, and order.

Regarding the urgent need to improve railway transportation, the Shen Bao's editorial has boldly and faithfully said many things that everyone felt in their hearts but was reluctant to say. Today, I take the opportunity of the "China Railway" authorities thoroughly reorganizing the internal mechanism to offer some superficial suggestions that I feel with the utmost sincerity to the "China Railway" authorities.

Originally, the reorganization of "China Railway" was to adapt to the rapidly increasing business and to achieve thorough streamlining and upward efficiency. Therefore, the new system that emerges after the reform will surely live up to the expectations of the people and achieve the desired results. However, I believe that in the process of reform, we should not pay too much attention to the big picture and neglect the small details. It is best to be able to "focus on the big picture and start with the small details!" For example, to make the business prosper, the defense along the way is strict, the security and order within the station are enhanced...etc., are all big goals. If you want to achieve this big goal, you must start with the training of grassroots cadres. If you pay too much attention to the big and neglect the small, it is like a big tree without half of its roots wanting to have lush branches. Some small details that need to be improved may not have been thoroughly observed by the authorities, so I offer a little bit for the company authorities to improve: that is, the work skills and service ethics of the employees: I am not criticizing, nor am I blaming. Indeed, a group of employees have neglected their responsibilities and ethics too much. For example, skimming off the top when selling tickets, being rude and fooling strangers, and openly defrauding vendors often cause serious consequences, causing resentment and aversion among citizens! I hope that the directorate can at least do the following: Increase the number of trips and vehicles to reduce the phenomenon of crowding, so as not to allow unscrupulous elements to profit from it. Pay attention to training employees' thinking and morality; strictly implement the method of rewarding merits and punishing sins so that they all have the virtue of serving and loving people. Ban financial vendors to help increase the effectiveness of the system and at the same time ensure the order and tranquility of real passengers. Adopt the suggestions of the public opinion circles as much as possible, and adhere to the attitude of accepting advice, "correct it if there is something, and encourage it if there is nothing." Finally, in order to ensure public safety, it is really necessary to drive away the ruffians, hooligans, and Bai Xiang people who are in the station! This will prevent passengers from having the psychology of treating going out as a long journey.
