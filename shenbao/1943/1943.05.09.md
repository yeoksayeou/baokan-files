### How to Accomplish the Greater East Asia War

The accomplishment of the Greater East Asia War is the sole and highest objective in the current stage of Greater East Asia. However, to achieve this sole and highest objective, it is absolutely necessary to eliminate the aggressive forces of British and American imperialism within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere externally, and to establish freedom and equality for all nations and countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere internally. These are indispensable conditions.

The Greater East Asia War is a common war for the one billion people of Greater East Asia, and it is by no means limited to a war of a single country or a single ethnicity. If it were limited to a war of a single country or a single ethnicity, then even if the aggressive forces of British and American imperialism were eliminated as a result, freedom and equality for all nations and countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere could not be established. Therefore, every single person within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere cannot ignore this understanding, and must, based on this understanding, assume the common mission of completing the Greater East Asia War.

We have pointed out that the Greater East Asia War has already transitioned from a stage of military operations to a comprehensive stage of operations encompassing politics, economics, diplomacy, and military affairs. Therefore, in the current stage, to complete the Greater East Asia War, the most important thing is to achieve comprehensive peace and unite all nations and countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere for joint cooperation. In other words, achieving comprehensive peace and uniting all nations and countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are the preconditions for completing the Greater East Asia War.

So, how can we achieve comprehensive peace? First, the government must value the demands of the people within the peace zone, improve people's lives, strengthen their belief in peace, and sincerely support the government. Then, the government's position will be strengthened, politics will be on track, and the people under Chongqing's rule will be drawn to return automatically.

As for strengthening the position of the National Government, it is the most important issue in the recent policy of our friendly nation Japan regarding China. However, strengthening the National Government must not separate the government from the people, and promoting political strength must not create political contradictions between the people and the government, adding a spiritual burden to the people. These are basic conditions that cannot be forgotten when speaking of strengthening the National Government. If the result of strengthening the National Government is to separate the government from the people, and the result of promoting political strength is to create political contradictions between the people and the government, then not only will the nation not be able to revive, but it will also not be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of completing the Greater East Asia War.

Secondly, the one billion people within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere encompass more than a dozen ethnic groups and countries. To unite these complex ethnic groups and countries, we must adjust the interests of each ethnic group and country. To adjust the interests of each ethnic group and country, we must stand on the spirit of mutual respect, mutual understanding, freedom, and equality. Regarding this point, we believe that our friendly nation Japan has already established it as a basic national policy. Because the recent return of concessions to China, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the return of enemy property, etc., all prove the change in Japan's new policy toward China. Therefore, we expect all ethnic groups within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to understand what was said above... The Greater East Asia War is a common war for us East Asians. We must take on this common responsibility in order to have the right to claim freedom and equality.

We have already recognized that the two preconditions mentioned above must be completed before the Greater East Asia War can be completed. Then, the so-called achievement of national peace and the union of all nations, etc., although it depends on each of us East Asians being aware of our own responsibilities and mutual respect and cooperation, we cannot ignore the impact of the world situation on us. Because all current issues are inseparable from the international situation and have a closely related effect. Therefore, how to coordinate with the world situation to promote everything, and further, how to influence the world situation to make it a condition favorable to us, are very important issues. However, the main driving force for these issues, its center, must be said to be mostly on the Japanese side, because Japan is the strongest country in East Asia in the current stage, and Japan's actions have the possibility of influencing the world situation. Therefore, we attach great importance to Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's new diplomatic measures. We hope that Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's diplomacy can help Germany eliminate the power of Britain and the United States and build a new European order. At the same time, we also hope that Foreign Minister Shigemitsu can promote the realization of a new Pacific Charter in the near future, and enable the Soviet Union to jointly assume the responsibility of building a new order in East Asia.

### To the New Ambassador to China

After the all-out and dramatic unfolding of Japan's policy towards China with the National Government's participation in the war, the duties of the ambassador to China have become even more important. Although some of the concessions under exclusive control have already been returned to the National Government, the abolishment of extraterritorial rights is still in preparation. The adjustment of national policy companies and other pending economic relations issues are piled up like mountains, awaiting urgent handling. Furthermore, the advancement of the policy towards China is generally considered to be completely unexpected, so it is said that among the Japanese people residing in China, there are still those who do not understand the truth and hold feelings of unease. If what is being said is true, then it must be clarified as soon as possible to appease the masses. After the abolition of extraterritorial rights, ensuring the safety and enhancing the welfare of the Japanese people residing in China must be carefully studied and negotiated.

Strengthening the National Government and increasing its production after joining the war are crucial tasks assigned to the National Government itself. Currently, the National Government's strength is not sufficient to complete this task relying solely on its own power; it still needs comprehensive support from the Japanese side. And the person who introduces the Japanese side's support, stands between Japan and the National Government, and closely connects them is naturally the ambassador to China. Former Ambassador Shigemitsu's appointment as ambassador to China was extremely appropriate. Before and after the transition of the policy towards China, his painstaking efforts made great contributions. Due to the recent cabinet reshuffle, he was transferred to the position of Foreign Minister, and former Foreign Minister Tani was appointed as ambassador to China to succeed him.

The knowledge, skills, and power of the new Ambassador Tani as a diplomat have long been established and need no further elaboration. However, the duties of the ambassador to China are so significant, as mentioned above. We take this opportunity to express our hope that the new ambassador will fully recognize this and exert his best efforts to ensure the smooth development of the new policy towards China.

### Prime Minister Tojo Returns to Fukuoka after Completing His Mission to the Philippines, Expressing Pleasure at the Military and Political State of the Region and Deeply Believing That the Completion of Reconstruction Is Not Far Away

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister and concurrently Minister of the Army, Tojo, completed his mission of visiting the Philippines this time and arrived safely in Fukuoka at 2:50 PM today. He also issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: "During this inspection of various regions in the South, I had the opportunity to visit the Philippines first, to inspect the military and the military and political state of the region. The officers and civilians who are active in this area, and the key figures of the Philippine Executive Government held sincere talks. I witnessed the close cooperation between Japan and the Philippines in moving towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War and striving to build a new Philippines. I am very pleased to see the real situation. The activity of the Japanese soldiers in the Philippines is beyond what we imagined in the country. They not only overcome various difficulties in the heat and concentrate on carrying out the war, but also ensure security and diligently continue training. Furthermore, the military administration of the Philippines is also overcoming various obstacles and progressing smoothly. Whether Japanese or Filipinos, military officers or civilians, they can fully understand the meaning of this operation and the mission of the Philippines. Everyone is making the best efforts in their duties. After seeing this situation, I have more than doubled my determination, especially since the Filipino people understand the true intentions of Japan and actively cooperate with the military administration, and Director Vargas and others are devoting all their efforts to rebuilding the Philippines and striving to complete the construction of Greater East Asia at all times. This is not only a celebration for the regeneration of the Philippines, but also a celebration for the entire Greater East Asia. Because the United States' policies towards the Philippines have always been for its own sake, it superficially used the beautiful forms of material civilization to dazzle the eyes of the Filipino people, while actually deliberately failing to promote the robust and enterprising national spirit necessary for creating a nation, and even more failing to cultivate the economic power necessary for independence. Everywhere, it implemented policies that would benefit the United States itself, turning it into a colony. The Filipino people, unknowingly, have been intoxicated by its poisonous wine for many years. Fortunately, the progress of the Greater East Asia War has now completely awakened the Filipino people. Furthermore, if this kind of understanding and effort by the Filipino people is further strengthened, then I firmly believe that the day of completing the construction of a new Philippines is not far away. The views I have gained in the Philippines this time, combined with the recollection of the gradual development of Manchuria and Mongolia and the progress of the new Burma construction, are all observed together. I deeply express my gratitude to the boundless grace of our Emperor and believe that the construction of Greater East Asia will definitely progress step by step. Furthermore, when thinking of our distant future, our belief in victory becomes even stronger."

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a telephone dispatch from Taipei, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo departed from Manila on the 7th to return to his country, making a brief stopover in Taipei.

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - After the tripartite declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo, the relationship between China and Manchukuo entered the path of formal diplomacy.

The ceremony was solemn. It is noted that the orchid is the national flower of Manchukuo, and the Order of the Orchid is the highest order of Manchukuo, which has only been awarded to the Japanese Imperial Family and the King of Romania. The awarding of this order to our country's head of state this time is of great significance.

### Japanese Army in Northern Hunan Occupies Anxiang County Seat; Japanese Army Continues Southeast Advance; Wang Zanxu's Troops Surrounded

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army captured Anxiang, the stronghold of the 77th Division of the Chongqing Army, on the 8th, it continued to pursue the defeated troops of Wang Zanxu's command. At 9:30 AM on the same day, they advanced to Baibukou, an important point on the northwest bank of Dongting Lake (16 kilometers southeast of Anxiang). The Japanese army, moving south along the west bank of the Ouchi Canal, has cut off the retreat route for the Chongqing army attempting to escape from the Anxiang area, and has continued to move around to the south of Anxiang. The Japanese army, advancing south along the west bank of the Jiudu Canal towards Nanxian, broke through Langbo River, 8 kilometers northwest of Nanxian City, at 10:30 AM on the 8th. Nanxian City, the main stronghold of the 161st Division of the Chongqing Army, is now looming in sight. Its fall is only a matter of time. Furthermore, the 5th Division, compiled by Chongqing and advancing southwest from the Huarong area, after a fierce mountain battle, advanced to Dacheng Temple, an important point in the Nanshan Mountains, on the 8th. The Chongqing army, which made a stubborn resistance in that area, has gradually collapsed. In addition, the motorized unit of the Japanese army's boats advancing south along the Yangtze River defeated about 2,000 of the Chongqing army near Yuanshan Temple and Liubuan, and is still continuing to pursue the remnants of the defeated Chongqing army towards Xiangyin Temple (20 kilometers south of Anxiang). In short, the current war situation has entered the stage of pursuit and maneuver warfare. The lifeline of Wang Zanxu's four divisions, about 40,000 men, is like a candle in the wind.

A Certain Place on the Hunan Front Line, 8th (Central News Agency) - The elite troops of the Japanese army, in order to annihilate the Chongqing army (29th Army Group), led by Wang Zanxu, with approximately 40,000 men, which continues to move in the Hunan Plain, cooperated with the air force and launched a simultaneous offensive from all directions, advancing to Gao Hecheng (2 kilometers southeast of Ouchikou), Kami Sando River (2 kilometers south of Ouchikou), Nanshan (10 kilometers south of Huarong), and other areas, breaking into Anxiang, the most important stronghold of the Chongqing army, at 4:35 AM on the 8th. At the same time, another unit of the Japanese army responded to this and continued to advance, forcing its way to a location only a few kilometers away from Nanxian, gradually forming a large encirclement circle linking Guanlang, Anxiang, and Nanxian. The four divisions, 15th, 162nd, Provisional 5th, and 77th, with approximately 40,000 men, of the Chongqing army (29th Army Group) are now wandering within the encirclement circle, and their fate is imminent. Furthermore, the Japanese air force, responding to the ground troops, has been unusually active for days. On the dawn of the 5th, it discovered the 162nd Division of the Chongqing army putting up a stubborn resistance in the marshland area of Shaqiao (12 kilometers west of Ouchikou), and immediately carried out a fierce bombing, covering the ground troops and forcing the Chongqing army to collapse southward. Early on the 6th, it was detected that the Chongqing army was trying to escape the encirclement and was gathering transport ships in the lower reaches of the Ouchi Canal north of Anxiang. Large formations were immediately dispatched, dropping direct hit bombs on about 50 Chongqing army boats sailing on the north bank of the canal, destroying more than a dozen ships and severely damaging more than 20 others. Then, near Baibukou, 10 kilometers south of Anxiang, a large 500-ton transport ship full of Chongqing troops was discovered, and it was heavily bombed, causing it to be severely damaged. In this way, the Chongqing army's attempts to break out of the encirclement were completely frustrated. Furthermore, large formations of Japanese aircraft strafed the Chongqing army ground troops moving in the sky above Anxiang.

### Japanese Army in Southern Shanxi Occupies Matian Town

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army units launched a fierce attack on the Shixian Basin, the stronghold of the Communist "18th Army Group," on the 7th, a fierce hand-to-hand combat was launched in the area of the Communist army's positions in the county. From today onwards, a three-dimensional fierce attack by land and air was launched. In addition, the Japanese army attacked approximately 3,000 troops of Chen Geng's "Independent First Division" and "Taiyue Column" of the Communist army surrounding Qinyuan and Yueyang in the Taiyue Mountains. This morning, the main force of the Communist army was completely surrounded in the Qinyuan area, and in conjunction with the Shanxi anti-Communist army, the encirclement was compressed and a fierce attack was launched.

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - A certain advancing detachment of the Japanese army completely occupied Matian Town, the location of the headquarters of the Communist "18th Army Group" (an important point on the border of Shanxi and Henan Province), at 10:00 AM today. This area is the central area of the Communist army, where the main military, political, and party organs are clustered, and it is the source of the Communist bandits in North China. Centered on this area, there are multiple arsenals, ammunition factories, textile factories, and other factories in the surrounding area.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the front line of the southern Taihang Mountains on the 8th, the Chongqing regime, due to the failure of the "24th Army Group" operation, the entire army was annihilated, and the only anti-Japanese stronghold remaining in North China was also lost. On the one hand, the Chongqing side severely questioned Jiang Dingwen, the "Commander-in-Chief of the Ji-Cha War Zone," who was responsible for the defeat. At the same time, in order to cover up the truth of the collapse of the anti-Japanese camp, it tried its best to publicize that powerful units of the Chongqing army had crossed the Yellow River and advanced towards the Pu Province area, engaging in disrupting the rear of the Japanese army. However, in fact, the Chongqing army attacking along the Yellow River bank was all small-scale units, which were annihilated by the Japanese army's North China garrison at any time. On the 29th of last month, the "49th Army" of the "First War Zone" of Chongqing, with approximately 800 men, invaded near Yangmu Bay, Yuanqu County, southern Shanxi. After being discovered by the Japanese army, it was immediately surrounded. As a result of the fierce battle, 40 men were killed and 30 men were captured. Furthermore, approximately 300 men of the "First Independent Column" of the "Seventh War Zone" of Chongqing, stationed near 12 kilometers west of Pinglu, on the banks of the Yellow River in southern Shanxi, attempted to cross the Yellow River. After the Japanese army waited for them to cross the river, it sealed off the crossing point and completely annihilated them. The Chongqing army left 122 corpses and 22 prisoners, including the commander of the Second Detachment, a colonel. Furthermore, on the 3rd and 4th of this month, the Japanese army thoroughly attacked and wiped out a bandit gang of Gong Zhenyi of the Chongqing faction stationed near Hengshui Ridge in the Zhongtiao Mountains, killing 130 Chongqing troops and capturing 50 prisoners.

Hankou, 8th (Central News Agency) - During the battle in Nanboyu, Zhanghezhuang, and Houhezhuang, south of Shennanzhen, western Hebei, on the 6th, the Japanese army units destroyed many Chongqing army warehouses and armories, and captured a large number of items. The results of the battle were as follows: 37 Chongqing army corpses were abandoned, 4 prisoners were captured, 35 rifles, 2 automatic rifles, and many other items were captured.

### Proclamation of War Against Britain and America by the National Government

On December 8th of the previous year, at the start of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with friendly nation Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public order, and improving people's livelihoods, aiming to enhance national strength and assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, countries like Britain and America continue to employ their centuries-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified their efforts, even luring elements from Chongqing to participate in the so-called British and American front, sending troops to Burma and India, to have East Asians slaughter each other. Recently, as their violent forces have been gradually defeated by the friendly nation Japan's army, navy, and air force, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have been lost, they have become even more cunning. Moreover, they are jealous of the peaceful development of the areas governed by the National Government, instigating elements from Chongqing to constantly harass us, in order to hinder the progress of various construction projects, and even directly using their own aircraft, using Chongqing as a base, to repeatedly bomb places like Wuhan and Guangzhou, harming civilians. As for the elements from Chongqing, willingly accepting the manipulation of Britain and America, and acting as traitors to East Asia, they are indeed shameful. However, the fact that Britain and America are scheming against East Asia, exhausting their ability to sow discord, in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, is even more something that East Asian nations should unite against with common hatred. The National Government hereby declares that, from today onwards, it is at war with Britain and America, and will devote its full strength to cooperate with friendly nation Japan, to sweep away the brutality of Britain and America, in order to seek the revival of China, and the liberation of East Asia. The two nations of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations, and are particularly united in their desire for East Asian co-prosperity. From now on, they should further strive to cooperate, in order to jointly build a new order in East Asia based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have, for several years, been confronting British and American forces in the West, and have repeatedly won glorious victories. Our nation now joins the Greater East Asia War, and should echo them, in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Great Asianism of our founding father, and that the revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity, and the attainment of justice and peace for the entire world, all depend on this. May we be of one heart and one mind, and exert our efforts from beginning to end, in order to carry out this great mission of this great era!

### Japan Loans 100 Million Yen to Mengjiang Bank

Tokyo, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: The plan to establish a financial sphere within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been steadily implemented since May of last year, based on the basic policy of Greater East Asia economic construction.

The government feels satisfied with this and expresses its full gratitude to the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan authorities. Under the Greater East Asia War, the mission undertaken by Mengjiang is becoming more and more important. The government's basic economic construction policy for this year is to increase food production, supply North China with the development of underground resources, enhance the Greater East Asia war effort, rapidly prepare a self-sufficient system for daily necessities, and stabilize people's livelihoods. At present, our officials and people are unanimously gathering all their strength to seek the steady realization of these measures. The establishment of this international credit loan will undoubtedly further stabilize the financial system and provide a great impetus to the construction of Mengjiang. It is believed that the value of the Mengjiang currency will be absolutely stable. It is hoped that officials and people will work together, trust Japan, increase production, save consumption, increase savings, and strive to prosper the paradise.

Similar to the Atlantic coast, every inch of land has the strongest arrangements and is guarded by specially trained elite troops. The beautiful scenery of the Azari coast is world-renowned. After the war, it will be able to restore its original appearance, but at present, the area has become a zone as strong as steel, capable of withstanding any fierce attack.

### Struggle for the Coastal Area of Tunisia Reaches its Fiercest Stage. Axis Forces in Tunisia Retreat in a Fighting Withdrawal, Street Battles in Tunis.

Berlin, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: The German High Command officially stated on the evening of the 7th regarding the situation on the Tunisian front that, although the Allied forces had broken through the Axis defenses, the Axis forces were now launching a counterattack on the flanks of the enemy, and fierce fighting was underway. The center of the battle has now shifted to the coastal area. Due to the Axis forces' skillful maneuver warfare, progress has been made between the outer and inner defense lines of the Axis positions. The Axis forces are now resisting the superior enemy forces, holding their positions to the death, to resist the fan-shaped offensive launched by the Allied forces. Under the mobile operations of the Axis defense forces, the enemy has suffered heavy losses.

Rome, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: The Italian High Command issued a communiqué on the 8th, stating that the resistance of the Axis forces in Tunis and Bizerte has failed.

Berlin, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: A German spokesman, at noon on the 8th, explained the situation in Tunisia, stating that the Axis forces had withdrawn from Bizerte after destroying military facilities, but fierce battles were still taking place in Tunis, and most of Tunisia was still under the control of the Axis forces. On the 7th, the Allied forces continued their offensive with superior mechanized units, but the Axis forces immediately counterattacked, frustrating the Allied forces' encirclement attempt. The Allied forces suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources, and the Axis forces also suffered considerable losses.

Berlin, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: The German High Command officially stated at noon on the 7th that the Axis forces on the Tunisian front, with a disadvantage of ten to one, had withdrawn to new positions. Furthermore, the French News Agency quoted Reuters as saying that the Allied High Command announced on the evening of the 7th that the Allied forces had completely occupied the two ports of Tunis and Bizerte.

Berlin, 7th - Central News Agency Dispatch: According to German news agencies from military circles, after the enemy reorganized and redeployed its forces on the northern and central fronts of Tunisia, it launched a new large-scale attack on Thursday. In other words, the most intense struggles at the focal points of the Tunisian front, which had been repeatedly postponed due to the Axis forces' stubborn resistance, have finally begun. The Axis artillery positions controlling the key roads in the war zone met the enemy's advance with fierce artillery fire. The enemy only made slight progress after suffering heavy losses. In this battle, the Axis forces deployed hedgehog formations, bravely resisting the larger enemy force. Fierce fighting is taking place near the coast between the inner and outer circles of the central positions. Disregarding heavy losses, the enemy continues to attack under the cover of tanks and aircraft, but the Axis forces launched a counterattack, which is still in progress. The enemy is using air force units to resist the Axis forces' actions, but the Axis forces, relying on skillful tactics, have divided the entire war zone into several sections on Thursday.

Germany Constructs the Southern Siegfried Line on the Mediterranean Coast

Berlin, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: In view of the developments in the Tunisian war, the German Presidential Headquarters is establishing a thorough battle plan, with Sicily and Sardinia as the outer defenses. The Southern Siegfried Line will be constructed on the Mediterranean coast, completing an iron-barrel-like defense. Therefore, as the Tunisian war undergoes a major turning point, the newspapers here are still saying, "The German army has not revealed any signs of wavering, and the mission of the Tunisian front has already ended." Among them, the Berlin Trade News once published, "When the Allies invaded North Africa last November, they said that they would be able to recover the area within a few days. However, due to the Axis forces' courageous fighting, their attempt was completely shattered, and the Allied forces were forced to withdraw to the Algerian border. If the Allied forces want to attack again, they must reinforce a large army for sacrifice. According to the current situation, it can be said that the Allies have reached their intended goal, but it must not be forgotten that it has taken six months. The damage suffered by the Allied forces on the Tunisian front will probably be an obstacle to their operations forever." The German People's News also published that the Axis forces used the past six months of fighting in Tunisia to prevent the Allied forces from launching a second front on the European continent in response to the Soviet winter offensive. The Axis forces used this period to construct an iron wall of defense on the Atlantic coast. This cannot be published for the time being due to confidential reasons. In short, the Axis forces have completed all necessary measures. Therefore, from the overall situation of the war, the gains and losses in Tunisia are completely irrelevant.

### Swedish Foreign Minister Reaffirms Policy of Maintaining Neutrality

Stockholm, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: Swedish Foreign Minister Gunther gave a speech in the Eskilstuna industrial area last night. Sweden's neutrality in the two world wars cannot be said to be fully guaranteed, but we are convinced that neutrality is a useful foreign policy. Gunther's speech was very long, mostly about the legal basis of Swedish neutrality and the history of the country's foreign policy in the recent war. It is said that this war and Swedish foreign policy can be divided into four stages: (1) From the outbreak of the European war to the Norwegian campaign, Sweden tried its best to maintain its foreign trade. (2) From April 9, 1940, when the war approached Sweden's front door, Sweden had to adopt a new attitude, prohibiting countries from passing through, according to the Hague Convention. (3) After Norway was completely occupied, Sweden was surrounded by Germany and the Soviet Union. The Swedish government believed that this situation would last for a considerable period of time, so the relationship with foreign trade had to be greatly changed. Sweden was trapped within the blockade lines of various belligerent countries, so it had to conclude agreements with Germany and the United Kingdom, allowing the passage of German troops and war materials. At the same time, 600,000 tons of Swedish merchant ships outside the blockade line were first chartered to the United Kingdom. Afterwards, the Swedish escort fleet was able to enter and exit Gothenburg, relying on this neutrality policy. (4) Beginning with the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Sweden allowed a German division to pass through Sweden to Finland. Although this violated the principle of neutrality, it was only limited to once. Since the outbreak of the war, foreign aircraft and warships have often invaded Swedish airspace and territorial waters, especially Soviet submarines. If Sweden did not adopt this neutrality policy, today's situation would be very different. It must be known that every neutral country must have its own policies. If neutrality is to be completely balanced in the relationship between the two belligerent countries, it is naturally impossible. Sweden was forced by circumstances to give other countries a price in order to obtain necessary materials. The price given to Germany was greater than that given to Western European countries, which was unavoidable. It is hoped that the national public will not be misled by rumors and will continue to trust the government's neutrality policy.

### Building Economic Shanghai: Completing Sino-Japanese Co-prosperity

— Takenouchi Fumin

Mr. Takenouchi Fumin is a renowned economic scholar from the friendly nation of Japan and currently serves as the managing director of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Shanghai. He is familiar with the Chinese economic situation. This article was originally titled "Royal Restoration" for Sino-Japanese relations. The meaning of "Royal Restoration" is akin to the Meiji Restoration. The conclusion calls for building economic Shanghai and ultimately achieving Sino-Japanese economic co-prosperity. His intentions are fair, and his arguments are insightful. Since the shift in Japanese policy towards China on January 9th of this year, the situation here has shown complex and subtle trends. Its concrete impact is seen in both ideological and socio-economic divisions. Roughly speaking, the impact is twofold: one group feels pleased and optimistic, while the other expresses anxiety, grief, and unease. This impact can be further divided into Chinese and Japanese perspectives. Generally speaking, the current situation finds the Japanese side anxious, grieving, and uneasy, while the Chinese side is pleased and optimistic.

Can this be considered the true success of this policy shift?

The true purpose of this thorough policy shift, especially in economic policy, lies in achieving a new Sino-Japanese relationship. It seeks to eliminate the distinction between "us" and "them" in people's minds, aiming for a state of unity between China and Japan. Given this objective, no distinction between light and dark is permissible between China and Japan. I believe the current distinctions are merely transitional turbulence in the pursuit of correcting imbalances and creating a unified Sino-Japanese state.

Seeing the natural relationship between China and Japan necessitates such a view. However, impractical and conflicting theories leading to confusion are unacceptable. Unfortunately, such phenomena still exist among Japanese residents. The true intentions of the government's policies are not yet fully understood, and the implementation of these policies on the ground is not entirely widespread. This situation seems ill-suited for the decisive period ahead.

I have two suggestions to offer to those feeling lost: First, seek truth by escaping from illusions. Second, even in a dreamless life, a grand dream is needed to navigate the tangled Sino-Japanese relations. The bigger the dream, the better. Realizing the vastness of the waves, everyone should have the courage, the willingness to sacrifice, and the perseverance to establish an enduring Sino-Japanese relationship. The darkest hour is nearest the dawn. Being misled by temporary fluctuations would prevent the attainment of the best and greatest achievements.

In this complex and subtle environment, I am reminded of a past event: rowing against the current and the impression of the innovative Meiji Restoration.

The Meiji Restoration, along with the Taika Reform and the Kemmu Restoration, marked major turning points in Japanese history. The first thing that won popular support during the Meiji Restoration was the slogan "Royal Restoration and Expel the Barbarians."

Mori Arinori, who first advocated abolishing swords and marrying in church, also had a peculiar theory: he proposed adopting English as the national language of the new Japan and calling upon the world to do so. Some even suggested abolishing Japanese clothing, requiring everyone to wear Western attire, burning down the entire city of Tokyo, and rebuilding it with Western architecture. Naturally, such strange theories clashed with public opinion. Today, there is a magnificent pagoda by Sawaike Pond in Nara, built solely through ten yen of private donations. However, demolishing it would require a huge sum, so demolition was avoided due to the cost-benefit analysis.

Such unconventional guiding principles were part of the popular "Royal Restoration."

This major shift in Japan's policy towards China is essentially another expression of the Sino-Japanese "Royal Restoration" and the East Asian "Royal Restoration." If that is truly the case, we must realize that the overlapping waves, the joys and sorrows of the "Royal Restoration" of the Meiji era will reappear today, guided by that lofty spirit and the call for innovative change.

The new Sino-Japanese agreement abolished extraterritorial rights and returned concessions that had colonized China, freeing China from a century of shackles and completing the nation's full sovereignty. If this cannot be called a "Royal Restoration," what else could be considered a "Royal Restoration" in China's international history and in the history of Sino-Japanese relations?

Waves and sacrifices are naturally anticipated. The arrow has already left the bow; hesitation, subservience, and retreat will lead to failure. All meanness and bystander attitudes should be cast aside. The spirit of advancing on the path indicated by national policy is the way to survive. Only then can the brilliant iron tower of the Sino-Japanese diplomatic transformation be erected.

Next, our discussion will focus on the economic sphere. The most difficult and contentious aspect of this transformation lies in the economic sphere, where the opposing positions of China and Japan are most evident. Whether or not this economic cooperation succeeds will be the deciding factor in judging the merits of this diplomatic transformation. Let's look at some examples:

First, the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association on March 16th as a unified guiding and controlling body for implementing purchase and distribution. Second, the gradual easing of restrictions on the movement of goods in the Yangtze River Delta region, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Third, the imminent establishment of the Central China Trade Control Agency, which is closely linked to the National Commercial Control Association. Fourth, the issue of building "Economic Shanghai," which holds the key to the economic revival and construction of all of China. Fifth, using the massive inventory accumulated in Shanghai to stimulate the economy of all of China. Only when this method of utilizing inventory is determined can the scale of the new economic policy after the transformation possess a complete and comprehensive system.

Of the above (3), (4), and (5), the main bodies have not yet been realized. The forms of (1) and (2) have already begun to emerge. Namely, the National Commercial Control Association and the warming of restrictions on the movement of goods, something that could not have been dreamed of since the incident, have already undergone a great change in nature as described below.

### Hua Detectives Involved in the Zhang Jinhai Case Sent to Court for Severe Punishment; French Consular Tribunal Judge Decides to Charge Millet with "Intentional Injury Resulting in Death"

The case of Qingnian Zhang Jinhai, who was brutally murdered by police officers in the French Concession, has prompted serious protests from the Second Special District Court and the Shanghai Special City Government. Yesterday morning, Luo Junqiang, Minister of Judicial Administration, and Chen Bingjun, President of the Second Special District Court, issued separate statements. The main culprit in the murder of Zhang Jinhai, French Inspector Millet, has been formally indicted after an investigation by the French Concession Consular Tribunal. The details are recorded below.

Minister Luo's Statement

Minister Luo Junqiang made a special trip to Shanghai to closely monitor the development of the case. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Minister Luo, who graciously received him and issued a statement saying: "The central government attaches great importance to the case of Zhang Jinhai, who was brutally murdered as a result of the abuse of illegal torture by police officers in the French Concession. After arriving in Shanghai, in addition to listening to reports from all parties regarding the case's beginning and end, I immediately ordered my subordinates to argue based on legal grounds to seek a reasonable and fair resolution. This case is a legal issue, not simply a diplomatic one. The French Inspector Millet, the main culprit, is currently being interrogated by the French Consular Tribunal. I will naturally monitor the progress of the case at all times. As for the thousand or so Chinese detectives who participated in the beating to death, they should be transferred to the competent court for severe punishment in accordance with the agreement, so that the deceased's grievances can be redressed and the national law upheld."

President Chen's Statement

Chen Bingjun, President of the Second Special District Court in the French Concession, returned to Shanghai yesterday after a special trip to Beijing to seek instructions on the Zhang case. He also issued a solemn statement to reporters: "The details of the case have been reported in various newspapers. Our court has already reported the autopsy results to the Ministry. Before going to Beijing, I had already lodged a serious protest with the judicial advisor of the French Concession Administration based on the facts. Such brutal behavior is intolerable in terms of law, reason, and human feelings. Our court is determined to adhere to the central government's intentions, argue strictly based on legal grounds, urge the punishment of the murderers, and handle the case impartially to redress the grievances and satisfy public expectations. We will also do our best to persuade the French Concession Administration to improve its measures in the future to ensure the mission of protecting human rights is not disgraced."

Consular Tribunal Investigation Concluded

The group of Chinese and French criminals involved in the murder of Zhang Jinhai have been suspended from their duties by the French Concession Police Department. The French Consular Tribunal has held hearings to investigate. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the French Consular Tribunal summoned the criminals again to continue the investigation. The investigation has been concluded, and French Inspector (the main culprit in the tragedy) Millet has been deemed guilty and formally charged under French criminal law. The other Chinese detectives, including Zhu Songcheng, who participated in the beating of Zhang Jinhai to death, have been transferred to the Second Special District Court for punishment according to law. According to the French side, the group of Chinese criminals were sent to the Second Special District Court yesterday morning before 9:00 AM for preliminary hearing.

Announcement Issued by the French Authorities Yesterday

After the French Consular Tribunal announced the conclusion of the investigation yesterday morning, the French Police Department officially issued a public notice at around 1:00 PM, saying: "The President of the French Consular Tribunal, under the order of the French Consul General and the request of the Police Superintendent, after many days of investigation, has determined that Inspector Millet violated orders and appears to have inflicted violence on Zhang Jinhai. Therefore, this morning (the 8th), the Tribunal judge decided to charge Millet with the crime of 'intentionally injuring Zhang Jinhai in Shanghai on April 29, 1943, although without intending to kill him, but resulting in his death,' under Article 309 of the French Criminal Code." The defendant Millet was formally detained by the French Police Department yesterday to await judgment.

Our National Officials Discuss in Detail

After the Shanghai Special City Government lodged a serious protest with French Consul General Magre earlier, there has been no official statement so far. After the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court of the French Concession sent a protest letter to French Police Superintendent Fabre, Fabre personally went to the Second Special District Court yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to meet with Chief Prosecutor Shen Wenjie and made a reply. After Fabre left, Shen went to the City Government to discuss the matter in detail with Mayor Chen and Secretary-General Zhao. At the same time, in order to achieve consistency in our national officials' external steps, he also copied the case's proceedings and the autopsy report of the corpse and sent them to the City Government for reference.

Hearing Postponed

The Chinese detectives, including Zhu Songcheng, who participated in the beating of Zhang Jinhai to death, were transferred from the French Police Department to the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court yesterday morning at 9:00 AM for investigation. However, due to the simultaneous opening of the French Consular Tribunal, the hearing was postponed.

Family Petition

Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at the Lafeichengji Sock and Shirt Factory on Caishi Road, was tragically tortured to death by the French Concession Police Department. Zhang's family has been petitioning various authorities and organizations in the city for days to redress the grievances of the deceased, asking for continued assistance and upholding justice. They also express deep gratitude for the strong support for the deceased. Yesterday afternoon, Zhang's family first went to the Journalists Association, where a general membership meeting was being held, to express their gratitude to the city's reporters. Then, they went to the Social Welfare Bureau. The City Party Headquarters, the China Daily, and the Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency were also petitioned. Director Sun Wuqi, Secretary-General Chen, Chief Editor Chu, and Directors Wu and Yang received them separately. It is said that the family will continue to petition various newspapers and agencies in the city today.

Mr. Wen Lantin is seventy-four years old this year. He usually devotes himself to social undertakings and is getting stronger as he gets older, which is deeply admired. However, due to overwork, he fell ill at the end of last year. His energy has not yet recovered after the illness. We are deeply distressed by the fact that Mr. Lan's evening social engagements and conversations are time-consuming and exhausting. Therefore, we advise him to decline evening banquets and rest early to increase his energy and use it for social undertakings, which will benefit both sides. Mr. Lan quite agrees. Therefore, we respectfully inform Mr. Lan's relatives, friends, and old acquaintances that from now on, please do not invite him to evening banquets or visit him in the evening. We hope you will understand.

In each district, a designated flour shop or a number of "cooperative sales offices" will be established to handle the rationing. The names and locations of these rationing shops or cooperative sales offices will also be officially announced in the short term. Therefore, the flour needed by Shanghai residents in the future will be more abundant.

### Various Organizations Send Telegrams to the National Government

According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League, the Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association, the East Asia Anti-Communist League, the Chinese Hongmen United Association, the Chinese Construction Youth Corps, the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, the Zhenjiang Fellow Provincials Association in Shanghai, and other mass organizations sent telegrams to the National Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, saying: "Chairman of the National Government in Your Presence, Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Your Presence, We have found that the case of Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at the Chengji Sock and Shirt Factory, who was brutally tortured to death by the police station in the French Concession of the city, has aroused public outrage. Foreigners have long relied on extraterritorial rights and concession relations to abuse their powers and disregard human life, which is a great sin. Our associations cannot stand idly by in order to protect human rights and safeguard national dignity. Moreover, the National Government is now working with its friendly nation of Japan to build a new order in East Asia. Shanghai, in a corner, is a place where all people pay attention. It is not allowed to have such an inhuman event that insults the national image. Therefore, we jointly request that Your Excellency immediately lodge a serious protest with the French Concession authorities in Shanghai and demand the fulfillment of the following conditions: (1) All murderers shall be handed over to the Chinese courts for trial. (2) The families of the deceased and the wounded shall be compensated. (3) The French authorities shall apologize to our government. (4) Guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. In addition to the above four conditions requiring the French Concession to strictly implement them in order to calm public anger, it should also speed up the process of returning the concessions so that the lives and properties of all citizens in the city can be effectively guaranteed. Then all the citizens will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League China General Association, Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association, East Asia Anti-Communist League, Chinese Hongmen United Association, Chinese Construction Youth Corps, Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, Zhenjiang Fellow Provincials Association in Shanghai, etc. salute."

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, the Ningbo Fellow Provincials Association in Shanghai, the Women's Welfare Association, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, and the Suzhou Rice Industry Workers' Union and other social organizations in the city yesterday strongly advocated the punishment of the murderers in the Zhang case.

It is said that Ms. Zhang was born on the Lai Luo Road near Bu Luo Nie Sen in Paris. She returned to China with her parents at the age of three, and later went to France many times to study painting. Her art has now achieved great success.

2.  Regarding the letter from Huang Shiqian and others, tenants of the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank Building, requesting negotiations to exempt them from relocation: Due to the urgency of time, a formal letter in the name of Secretary-General Zheng Ti was sent to the military authorities for direct consultation. The result is that the stores on the ground floor and the two locations at the northern end of Carter Road and west of Jing'an Temple Road will not be requisitioned for the time being.

3.  Regarding the letter from Huang Shiqian, Shi Cheng Sun, Qian Qi Peng, and others of the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank Building, requesting separate letters to the Ministry of the Army and the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, stating that the house will be returned one day and requesting to retain the lease: The letter was forwarded to the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, and it seemed unnecessary to send one to the Ministry of the Army.

(2) Discussion Items

1.  Regarding the Zhang Jinhai wrongful killing case, numerous requests for relief have been received. How should the case be handled?

Resolution: There are special laws for murderers, and the punishment for public officials committing crimes should be even more severe. Since the victim has filed a lawsuit according to law, we should wait quietly for the court's judgment. However, according to reports in various newspapers and letters from the Zhenjiang Association in Shanghai and the victim's father, there is evidence that the French Concession police used private torture. It should be suggested to the French Concession police authorities to immediately abolish such torture to emphasize humanity, etc., and separate letters should be sent. (Rest omitted)

Economic Circle - Commentary

### Rural Loans

Under the important principle of the "Wartime Economic Policy Outline" that loans should be limited to support production enterprises, we have repeatedly mentioned rural loans, precisely because the reduction in agricultural output is enough to cause economic panic throughout the country and society. Therefore, among the loan sectors of production enterprises, agricultural loans should occupy a primary position.

The Ministry of Finance, in order to revive the countryside and enhance production, has instructed the Bank of Communications to handle rural revival loans. The Bank's rural survey team, organized last year, has completed its on-the-ground survey of rural areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Zhili provinces and is currently studying the methods of agricultural loans.

Regarding this point, we would like to express some opinions from a third-party standpoint. As far as we know, the authorities, in order to assist in the revival of rural production enterprises, will strive to lower the interest rate on rural loans, which is certainly essential. However, we believe that in terms of loan methods, the principle lies not only in lowering the loan interest rate but also in the universalization and directness of the loans. Why is universalization necessary? Because the vast majority of farmers in our country are poor farmers; their lives are the most difficult, and their need for funds is the most urgent. And this vast majority of poor farmers is precisely the driving force for promoting agricultural production; therefore, what we want to assist and support, to make them live in peace and work happily, is this vast majority of poor farmers. Secondly, why is directness necessary? Because in rural areas everywhere, there are always villains and scoundrels mixed in, causing trouble in the middle; loans are most likely to flow into the hands of these people, to carry out their high-interest lending and land speculation activities. In that case, how can genuine farmers obtain the benefits of rural loans? Therefore, the design of loan methods, in addition to paying attention to the universality of loans, must also take direct lending as a prerequisite.

In short, reviving rural production naturally requires agricultural loans as the only means, and the success of agricultural loans still depends on whether the methods, procedures, steps, and implementation of the loans are ideal in every aspect.

### Ministries of Industry and Food Separately Designate Controlled Commodities, Assigned to the General Chamber of Commerce to Handle

The main commodities handled by the National General Chamber of Commerce under the supervision and guidance of the Ministries of Industry and Food have been determined by orders from the Ministries of Industry and Food. The controlled commodities under the jurisdiction of the Ministries of Industry and Food are listed below:

Ministry of Industry

Designated Controlled Commodities: (1) Cotton, (2) Cotton Yarn, (3) Cotton Products (including cloth and knitwear), (4) Chemical Industrial Products (including raw materials, Western medicines, pigments, dyes, and alcohol), (5) Wool Fabrics and Wool Products, (6) Cocoons, (7) Silk and Silk Products, (8) Industrial Oils and Fats, (9) Candles, (10) Soap, (11) Matches, (12) Lump Coal and Coal Balls, (13) Cigarettes and Tobacco Leaves, (14) Rubber (including raw materials and products), (15) Hardware (including raw materials and products of iron, steel, white iron, and non-ferrous metals), (16) Glass (including raw materials and products), (17) Electrical Appliances (including raw materials and products), (18) Leather (including raw materials and products).

Ministry of Food

Designated Controlled Commodities: (1) Flour, (2) Grains (including wheat, naked barley, barley, corn, peanuts, soybeans, broad beans), (3) Livestock Products (including cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, and lard), (4) Eggs (including chicken eggs and duck eggs), (5) Sugar (including brown sugar and white sugar), (6) Edible Oil (including peanut oil, rapeseed oil, and cottonseed oil).

### Food Industry - Shanghai Association Organization Completed

The national commercial control work, under the supervision and guidance of the Ministries of Industry and Food, has already begun to organize control work. The highest authority, the National General Chamber of Commerce, has comprehensively planned the control of various food materials, divided into thousands of departments. There is a department within the General Chamber of Commerce, and externally there is a Federation. Under the Federation, there are local trade associations. The Federations and trade associations in the Shanghai urban area are separately supervised and promoted by the Shanghai offices of the Ministries of Industry and Food. Once the middle-level organization Federation and the lower-level organization local trade associations are completed and integrated with the upper-level National General Chamber of Commerce, the giant wheel of overall material control can begin to turn. At that time, not only will legitimate merchants in various industries be protected, but the general price level will inevitably tend to stabilize. Therefore, the early completion of this control mechanism is what the government and the people are currently jointly looking forward to, and its impact on the future of the war is particularly significant. Minister Gu of the Ministry of Food, due to the slow start of the organization of the middle and lower-level organizations that the Ministry should supervise and promote, is deeply concerned that it will delay the entire control work, so he strictly ordered the responsible personnel stationed in Shanghai to intensify their work and complete it within a time limit. With the instructions of Mayor Chen and the enthusiastic assistance of the General Chamber of Commerce and various parties, all food materials under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Food, except for rice which has separate regulations, including flour, grains, livestock products, eggs, edible oil, and sugar, will have their middle and lower-level organizations fully completed within days.

### Ministry of Finance Approves Temporary Payment of Current Deposit Reserve Funds by Banks and Pawnshops; Fixed Deposit Reserve Funds Cannot Be Paid with Substitutes

The Financial Inspection Office of the Ministry of Finance previously instructed, in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Financial Institutions," that banks and pawnshops in this city should pay their current and fixed deposit reserve funds to the Central Reserve Bank. The banks and pawnshops have already paid the reserve amount for fixed deposits in full, but the reserve funds for current deposits have not been paid in accordance with the law due to various reasons. The Banking and Pawnshop Association has submitted four requests to the Financial Inspection Office for approval, including: (1) Temporarily postpone the payment of current deposit reserve funds. (2) Please increase the interest on the reserve funds that have already been paid. (3) Please do not include current deposits under overdraft accounts in the current deposit calculation. (4) Please also allow the payment of fixed deposit reserve funds with 40% cash and 60% substitutes. After receiving the submission, the Financial Inspection Office forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. It is now understood that the Ministry of Finance has replied to the four requests made by the banking and pawnshop industry in this city one by one as follows:

(1) The current deposit reserve funds that each bank and pawnshop should pay are allowed to be temporarily postponed for two months (i.e., payment will begin on June 1).

(2) It is inconvenient to increase the interest on the reserve funds that have already been paid.

(3) For current deposits under overdraft accounts, the reserve funds can be paid based on the month-end deposit balance.

(4) Allowing the payment of current deposit reserve funds with a portion of substitutes was originally an accommodation measure, so it is not appropriate to follow suit for fixed deposit reserve funds.

### Municipal Economic Bureau Continues to Designate Promoters for Six Industry Associations

### Evaluation Committee Implements Standard Price Limits; Violators Will Be Investigated and Dealt with Publicly

The industry associations in this city, in order to assist the authorities in suppressing the selling prices of all goods, previously established "Evaluation Committees" in their respective industry associations. In addition to being responsible for evaluating and setting standard price limits, they also conducted investigations and distribution matters. It is now understood that the Evaluation Committees of the various associations, in view of the fact that member stores are secretly raising the prices of goods in order to obtain undue profits, which is contrary to the original intention of the evaluation, have decided to convene meetings one after another to review whether the previously set price limits meet the standards, and secretly send personnel to the front offices of various member stores to conduct close investigations. If it is found that the marked prices are raised, or if the goods are not sold according to the limits, the investigators will copy down the store number, address, item name, etc., and send them to the association. Then, the Evaluation Committee will discuss the punishment methods. It is also understood that in the future, the distribution and procurement matters will be handled by the industry associations or a group directly under them, so the responsibility of the associations has become more complicated than in the past.

### Dynamics of Various Industry Federations

Flour Industry: The National Federation of Flour Industry Associations, with Sun Zhongli and others designated by the Ministry of Food as preparation directors, is actively preparing. It is now ready and will convene a founding meeting at 3 p.m. tomorrow (10th) on the second floor of 43 Jiangxi Road. All districts must send representatives to attend in order to complete the organization.

Commercial and Industrial Products Industry: The National Federation of Commercial and Industrial Products Industry Associations, with Xie Meisheng and Liu Bin designated by the Ministry of Food to be responsible for preparations, has been ready and will hold a founding meeting at 2 p.m. on the 12th of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and elect the first board of directors and supervisors to be responsible for promoting association affairs. The industry associations in Jintai, Tongzhou, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Jindan, Nanjing, Bengbu, Anqing, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Suxi, Changtai, and other districts must send personnel to Shanghai on time in accordance with the newly promulgated Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Industry Associations and the Organizational Rules for the Food Industry Association to maintain the rights and interests of the industry.

Department Store Industry: Li Ze, who is in charge of preparing the Department Store Industry Federation, convened the first preparatory meeting on the 6th of this month to ensure the early establishment of the association after receiving the order from the Ministry of Industry. In addition to the attendance of the preparatory committee members, Supervisor Chen Zhong and Guo Shun, Supervisor of the National General Chamber of Commerce, and Lu Fengjiu, Deputy Director, also attended the meeting for guidance. Li Ze, Zheng Zhaobin, Li Kangnian, Ba Lingyun, Zhang Wenkui and other five people were appointed to be responsible for drafting the articles of association, and the second preparatory meeting was scheduled to be held on the 13th of this month. The Huuanqiu Goods Industry Association on the fourth floor of Wing On Department Store on Nanjing Road is temporarily used as the temporary preparatory office.

Fresh Pork Industry: After the Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Association was ordered to reorganize, it convened a general meeting of all members at 3 p.m. yesterday at the Ningbo Road Fresh Meat Industry Association, and publicly elected Chu Jiasheng as chairman, and instructed industry members to register with the Shanghai Municipal Food Bureau on schedule. Then, the meeting discussed the revision of the association's charter, and re-elected Sun Bingquan, Chu Jiasheng and other fourteen people as directors. It is reported that fresh pork vendors from various provinces, cities, districts and counties who are stationed in Shanghai must also join as new members, and should complete the membership procedures as soon as possible, obtain a member registration certificate, and then follow the registration of the Food Bureau and apply for registration within a time limit, and then obtain formal membership.

### Hua Share Trend

Hua shares were quiet, mainly because it was Saturday, and people were holding steady. Only Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory shares in the new pharmaceutical industry were in high demand and short supply, with significant progress. The price of Sino-French Pharmacy shares has returned to small. The World Book Company in the cultural industry also has news of returning to the factory on the 15th of this month, and the transaction was not weak. Commercial Press and China Bookstore were both flat. Xinxin Company in the department store industry saw a slight decrease, Guohuo Company rose slightly, and the transaction price of Wing On Company was similar to the previous day. Wing On Textile Factory and Meya Silk Factory were both traded sparsely and the prices were stagnant. In the public utilities industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity rose slightly, and no one cared about China Electric. Nanyang Tobacco and Great China Matches rose slightly, and Jiu'an Industrial and Xin'yi Real Estate were stagnant.

### Purchase of Wool Yarn Requires Application to the Association; Applicants Limited to Adult Women; Goods Will Be Collected from Stores After Approval

The Shanghai Wool Yarn Industry Association, in view of the scarcity of wool yarn inventory in the market, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and profiteering, and in order to save wartime materials, has specially formulated restrictions on purchase methods, which have already been implemented. All wool yarn stores have uniformly stopped over-the-counter transactions. If citizens want to purchase wool yarn and it is indeed for their own use and indispensable, they can obtain a wool yarn purchase application form from the association. Applicants are limited to adult women and must show a citizen's certificate. Underage women and men are not allowed. After filling out the application form, submit it to the association for review. If it is qualified, the association will indicate the approved quantity and the name of the issuing store on the application form, and also notify the store. The applicant can go to the designated store with the approved application form to pay and collect the goods.
