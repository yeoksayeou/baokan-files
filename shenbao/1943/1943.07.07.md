### Our Reflection

Six years ago today, the unfortunate Lugouqiao Incident occurred. Although past grievances are gradually being resolved, the Chongqing communists are still resisting in a corner, and full peace has not yet been achieved. Even within the peace zone, there are those who harbor doubts and remain hesitant, neither approaching nor distancing themselves. As a result, cunning individuals seize the opportunity to profiteer, while those who consider themselves "virtuous" remain silent. This has led to a distorted and turbid social atmosphere, and the nation's construction is suffering serious setbacks. Looking back at the past and considering the present, one cannot help but feel deeply moved.

We trace the origins of the incident to two main points: Firstly, the lack of mutual understanding between the governments and people of both countries at the time, which led to national policies that were off by a hair's breadth but resulted in a great divergence. Each side went to extremes, causing the unfortunate incident. Secondly, the conspiracies of British and American imperialism, and the incitement of the Communist International, exhausted every means of provocation and discord, causing war between China and Japan in order to reap the benefits.

Because there was insufficient understanding between China and Japan, the emotions of both sides were inflamed, and tensions were already high. Further provoked by Britain and the United States, conflict erupted suddenly. However, because the conflict arose from misunderstandings, both sides will eventually realize that schemes are not the way to resolve it. Consequently, on December 22, 1937, former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement outlining the fundamental principles for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, namely, good neighborliness and friendship, joint anti-communism, and economic cooperation. Subsequently, Mr. Wang (Jingwei) issued a telegram echoing Prime Minister Konoe's statement and advocating for the peace movement. He stated, "Based on these three points (in Konoe's statement), if we exchange sincerity with the Japanese government in order to restore peace, and use this as the basis for peace negotiations, then the path to negotiation will be opened. The purpose of China's resistance war is to seek the survival and independence of the nation. After more than a year of resistance, we have suffered great trauma. If we can end the war with a peace that conforms to this principle, the nation's survival and independence can be guaranteed, and the goal of resistance will have been achieved." He further clarified the point of good neighborliness and friendship, saying, "Japan solemnly declares that it has no territorial demands on China and no demands for war reparations. Japan will not only respect China's sovereignty but will also follow the precedent of the Meiji Restoration by returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights on the condition that it be allowed freedom of residence and business in the interior, so that China can fully achieve its independence. Since the Japanese government has made this solemn declaration, we can, through peaceful means, not only preserve the northern provinces but also recover the lost territories since the start of the resistance war, and maintain the integrity of sovereignty and administrative independence." Looking at this today, Mr. Wang's peace movement policy appears even more correct and timely. In particular, Japan's policy toward China has repeatedly moved toward a foundation of mutual benefit for both countries, gradually fulfilling its promises of no territorial demands and respect for Chinese sovereignty. Regarding the point of "returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, so that China can fully achieve its independence," today's reality has fully proven that this is not merely empty words. Compared to the British and Americans, who have already been driven out and have no foothold in the concessions, offering favors to the Chongqing regime while making arrogant and shameless, base and deceitful statements, they are truly not on the same level.

Since the Sino-Japanese Incident arose from misunderstanding, and both sides have realized that schemes are not the solution, each should eliminate misunderstandings with sincerity and promote reconciliation. Logically, they should smoothly return to the old state of affairs. Why, then, after six years, has a thorough resolution not been achieved, preventing the nation from dedicating itself to the great task of rejuvenation and causing the people to suffer from the pain of an insecure life and economic oppression? We wish to deeply reflect on this today and express our views, hoping that the authorities of both countries will expedite the full realization of the overall peace, strengthen the power to complete the Greater East Asia War, and that China will also be able to prepare for the construction of national rejuvenation and jointly establish the foundation of a new order in East Asia as soon as possible.

Firstly, the National Government's peace movement policy is extremely accurate for the nation's future and the people's livelihood, and it has overcome difficulties and created today's achievements. The arduous struggles it has gone through are recognized and admired by us. However, after more than three years of effort, pockets of resistance still remain within the country, and full peace has not yet been achieved. Prices are soaring, and the people's lives are not stable. Although the political and economic systems are gradually being established and are moving towards the goal of wartime strengthening, the actual results not only lack the anticipated benefits but often have unexpected drawbacks. We should not shy away from frankly examining its successes and failures, and studying the root causes of its problems. If the problem lies in personnel, then replacements and adjustments should be made without regard to personal feelings. If the problem lies in institutions, then redundant branches should be eliminated, and a rational reorganization should be carried out. In short, any problems that are discovered on any side should be addressed with countermeasures as soon as possible. This is one point we hope the government authorities will deeply reflect on.

Secondly, the people in the peace zone suffered from the ravages of war at the beginning of the incident, and in recent years, they have suffered from the high prices and economic oppression. The psychological wounds have not been immediately healed, which is natural. However, we must further understand our own responsibilities and value our own strength. Rejuvenating the nation is everyone's responsibility, and only by gathering the strength of the masses can the nation be rejuvenated. We must actively and sincerely support the policies decided by the government; at the same time, we must also actively and seriously supervise the government's implementation of policies. We must not adopt a passive and indifferent attitude; we must adopt an active and supervisory attitude. By unleashing the power of the people, we can ensure that the government follows the will of the people, and there will be hope for stabilizing lives and rejuvenating the nation. This is one point we expect all compatriots to deeply reflect on.

Thirdly, our friendly neighbor Japan, with the aim of strengthening the National Government's position and promoting genuine amity between China and Japan, is transforming its new policies and gradually realizing them concretely. This is, of course, a very reasonable approach, and in fact, it has already achieved considerable results. However, we believe that strengthening the power and position of the Chinese people, and paying attention to the needs and demands of the Chinese people, are equally important. This is something that our friendly neighbor Japan has not yet fully achieved. We can say that this is one of the main factors why full peace between China and Japan has not yet been achieved today. Japan's policy toward China is lofty and far-reaching, but the Chinese people need policies that are closer and more practical. This is one point we offer to our friendly neighbor Japan.

Finally, we sincerely hope that the authorities of both countries will strive to do work that is beneficial to Sino-Japanese cooperation; conversely, work that is unhelpful or harmful should be absolutely avoided. We hope to expedite the realization of full Sino-Japanese peace, concentrate the entire strength of both countries, and complete the Greater East Asia War!

### Chairman Wang's Thoughts on the Sixth Anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident

Nanjing, July 7th, Central News Agency: Chairman Wang (Jingwei) issued the following thoughts on the sixth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident:

Since the Lugouqiao Incident until now, it has been the sixth anniversary. At the very beginning of the incident, if we could have exercised restraint and self-respect, even if we could not have prevented the incident from breaking out, we could at least have prevented it from escalating. If this had been the case, then two years later, when the European war broke out, the situation would have changed, and Sino-Japanese relations could have been adjusted without resorting to war. Even if it was unavoidable at the time to escalate, if the Chongqing side could have immediately responded to the Konoe statement and stopped the war, and opened up a new path to peace, then when the European war broke out, China and Japan could have dealt with it in unison. Not only would the Greater East Asia War not have broken out, but the world war would also not have spread so widely. Even if this was not possible, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, if the Chongqing side could have immediately realized the necessity of East Asian unity and united with Japan to expel British and American forces from East Asia, then there would have been no internal worries after the Greater East Asia War, and its success would have been easier and faster. However, the Chongqing side has made one mistake after another, and continues to make mistakes to this day, willingly acting as a separate unit for Britain and the United States, causing China to not have achieved peace and unity to this day, and causing East Asia to still have some East Asian traitors, causing worries for the future. Thinking about this kind of self-deception, deceiving China, deceiving East Asia, is truly hateful. The National Government now can only exert its utmost efforts to unite the people and establish the foundation for China's rejuvenation within the peace zone, prepare a model for Sino-Japanese cooperation to rejuvenate East Asia, ensure security, and increase production, in order to assist in the Greater East Asia War and seek the completion of the war's objectives. All new national movements, as well as economic construction and rural reconstruction, should focus their attention on this. At the same time, we analyze that the Chongqing side, willingly acting as a separate unit for Britain and the United States, and turning against East Asian compatriots, are ultimately a minority. They are merely using these few people, holding military power, the majority are coerced, unable to express their free will. Moreover, these few people, in addition to holding military power, also use British and American forces as their wings, and use communist bandit forces as their claws, causing the majority of the people to feel deeply grieved and to be helpless. Thinking of this, we should take it upon ourselves to liberate the majority of the oppressed people on the Chongqing side. For these few unscrupulous elements, willingly acting as East Asian traitors, we should condemn their crimes and punish them, defeat the military power they hold, and sever the forces they collude with. Only in this way can the majority of the oppressed people on the Chongqing side be freed from their shackles, rise up in unison, and thoroughly overthrow these traitorous elements, in order to remove the obstacles to rejuvenating China and protecting East Asia. We love China, save China, love East Asia, save East Asia, and should all join forces in this. These are all the thoughts and missions we have when commemorating the sixth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident.

### Japanese Air Force Attacks Rendova Island, Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses in Aircraft and Ships

Tokyo, July 6th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 10:30 AM on the 6th that the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces advanced on the 4th on the enemy's transport fleet and pier facilities in Rendova Harbor, with the following results: (1) Enemy losses: Five transport ships and more than ten boats were sunk, twenty-three aircraft were shot down, and a military supplies depot was bombed and burned. (2) Japanese losses: Nine self-detonated aircraft.

Tokyo, July 6th, Central News Agency: From June 30th to July 4th and 5th, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces and destroyers repeatedly attacked Rendova Island. The results of the battle, which have been announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, are summarized as follows: 118 or more enemy aircraft shot down, 8 transport ships sunk, 4 destroyed, many boats sunk, 1 Class B cruiser sunk, 1 heavily damaged, 4 large destroyers sunk, 1 destroyer sunk, 1 destroyed, 1 torpedo boat sunk, 1 destroyed. Japanese losses: A total of 40 self-detonated and unreturned aircraft.

Tokyo, July 6th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces in the Solomon Islands, in close cooperation, have been fiercely attacking Rendova Harbor, the enemy's landing point, since June 30th, inflicting heavy losses. They again fiercely attacked the harbor on the 4th, inflicting heavy damage. At 12:00 PM on that day, a large joint formation of Japanese fighters and bombers arrived over Rendova Harbor and engaged in a fierce air battle with the enemy fighters patrolling the harbor. Enemy anti-aircraft fire was also heavy, resulting in a chaotic battle. Japanese aircraft shot down 23 enemy fighters, greatly weakening the enemy. The Japanese bomber squadron then seized the opportunity to drop bombs, bombing 8 transport ships of 3,000 tons class, 1 warship, numerous boats, and military supplies piled up at the landing point. Soon after, a dozen boats, five transport ships, were sunk and a military supplies depot was destroyed. A large fire broke out in the harbor after the Japanese aircraft bombing, and it was covered in black smoke. The results of the battle on that day will exceed what has been announced. The enemy suffered heavy losses in several attacks from June 30th to July 4th and it is impossible to replenish. Hence, the enemy's anxiety is no longer concealable.

### General Numata Discusses American Strategy

Vichy, July 6th, Central News Agency: According to the Huitong News Agency: General Numata, the Japanese military attache stationed in Vichy, stated in a conversation with reporters yesterday: Since the American military launched its so-called offensive against the Japanese base in the Solomon Islands, up to July 1st, we have sunk six transport ships, four cruisers, and six destroyers, and shot down 77 aircraft. The American plan to eliminate the forward outposts in the Pacific is clearly an event with a very high price. The American offensive in the Pacific may not be a military action but a political action. Roosevelt has the ambition to serve four terms as president, so he is using this to appease the public's demands.

### Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department Abolished

Nanjing, July 6th, Central News Agency: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in December of the year before last, the Propaganda Department, in order to promote propaganda work in Shanghai and handle temporary events locally, was approved by the Executive Yuan to establish an office in Shanghai on January 4th of last year. Now, with the return of the Shanghai International Settlement by the friendly nations, in order to strengthen local propaganda work in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Government has specially established a Propaganda Department. In order to unify authority, the Propaganda Department has been approved by the Executive Yuan to abolish the office in Shanghai. The propaganda work within the former jurisdiction of the office in the concessions, except for those directly under the Propaganda Department, will be transferred to the Municipal Government's Propaganda Department. However, since the return of the concessions by the friendly nations to assist us in completing independence and sovereignty is of great significance, and the cultural propaganda in Shanghai has a great relationship with the national cultural propaganda, the former Director of the Shanghai Office, Feng (Yuxiang), who was originally the Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, after relinquishing his position as Director of the Office, was re-appointed by the Executive Yuan's Propaganda Department as a concurrent consultant, in order to assist, guide, and coordinate the promotion of propaganda work in Shanghai in these two capacities. As for the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Propaganda Department, Liang Xiuyu, a consultant to the Propaganda Department, was appointed by the Shanghai Municipal Government and approved by the 169th Executive Yuan meeting today. It is reported that Director Liang will go to Shanghai to take office immediately and begin the work of the Shanghai Municipal Propaganda Department. All parties have great expectations for the development of propaganda work in Shanghai in the future.

### Chongqing's Lieutenant General Councilor Ma Jun Joins the Peace Movement

Taiyuan, July 6th, Central News Agency: Ma Jun, "Lieutenant General Councilor of the First War Zone Command" of Chongqing, in view of the wrongs of the War of Resistance, has defected from the War of Resistance camp this time and arrived in his hometown of Jincheng on the afternoon of the 1st. On the 2nd, he visited the commander of a certain Japanese Army unit and expressed his determination to pledge allegiance to the Peace Movement. Ma Jun, a lieutenant general, is 62 years old and joined the London Branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party when he studied in the United Kingdom. After returning to China, he successively served as a member of the Shanxi Provincial Government, a senior senator of the Beijing Government Senate, a supervisory envoy of Hedong in Shanxi Province, and the heads of the construction, political, and educational departments of Shanxi Province. He is also the most influential person among the co-religionists in Jin Province. He once served as the Vice Chairman of the China Islamic National Salvation Association and is highly respected by Islamic believers. Bai Chongxi trusted the general very much, so the general's participation in the Peace Movement this time has had a great impact on the Chongqing side. At the same time, it will also have a significant impact on the Muslims on the Chongqing side and is attracting much attention from all parties.

Taiyuan, July 6th, Central News Agency: Ma Jun, "Lieutenant General Councilor of the First War Zone Command" of Chongqing, made the following statement at his residence in Jincheng County after joining the Peace Movement: If I had not entered the War of Resistance at the beginning and had always strived for the Peace Movement, then I would have been able to be loyal to the country and filial to my late mother. I have now joined the Peace Movement, and my mother may be able to rest in peace underground. This is the only thing that can bring me some self-satisfaction. The War of Resistance cannot teach the country, but only plunges the people into misery. Now that friendly nations are fulfilling their moral promises, China's rejuvenation can be expected soon. I will henceforth swear to work under the leadership of Chairman Wang (Jingwei) and make glorious efforts to eliminate the Communist Party and rejuvenate the country.

### Reflections of the Manchurian Premier on the July 7th Incident

Xinjing, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegraph - This July 7th marks the sixth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident. Zhang Jinghui, Prime Minister of Manchukuo, issued the following statement:

The establishment of Manchukuo is one aspect of Japan's creation of a world political ideal since its founding. The Lugouqiao Incident and the Greater East Asia War, and even the current World War, can be said to have originated from the founding of Manchukuo. In particular, the significance of the Lugouqiao Incident has become even clearer since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War two years ago. Japan's long-held ideals are being realized step by step with the victory of the Greater East Asia War, which is truly cause for celebration. Furthermore, the spirit of cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo has grown stronger due to the change in Japan's policy towards China, which is even more gratifying. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, the people of the Republic of China have been actively cooperating in the construction of Greater East Asia since the Greater East Asia War, improving domestic affairs and fostering diplomatic relations. The nation's fortunes are improving daily, which is cause for celebration for its future. However, the stubborn and unyielding Chongqing has long lost its anti-Japanese purpose and is merely prolonging its existence, clinging to one area to the best of its ability, acting only as a puppet of Britain and the United States. Now, on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident, our Asian compatriots should remember that it was Japan that eliminated the poison of Britain and the United States in East Asia for over a century. The people of East Asia, especially China, Japan, and Manchukuo, must not miss this opportunity, but strive to build East Asia.

### German Forces Launch Major Offensive on Eastern Front Southern Sector - Attack Soviet Positions on Three Routes

Stockholm, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegraph - According to a special communiqué released by the Soviet Information Bureau last night, German forces launched a three-pronged attack on Soviet front lines in the central sector yesterday. The stalemate on the eastern front has now been broken. Powerful German forces, supported by tanks and air power, simultaneously attacked in the Orel, Kursk, and Belgorod sectors. Orel is one of the main bases for the German central front line, located approximately 200 miles southwest of Moscow, and was occupied by German forces early in the war. Kursk is located 130 miles north of Kharkov and was the northernmost point of the German offensive last year. The city was seized by Soviet forces this spring. Belgorod is located 50 miles north of Kharkov on the Kursk railway line and was recovered by Soviet forces in the winter offensive, but was occupied by German forces again this spring. The area is close to the front line, so sporadic fighting continued in its vicinity during the period of quiet on the front. Reuters military correspondents believe that the purpose of the German offensive is to preempt the Soviet offensive plans, or even prevent their realization. Although the German side has not yet confirmed the above news of the three-pronged offensive, news from Berlin last night stated that military activity on all sections of the Eastern Front has intensified, especially in the Velikiye Luki and Belgorod areas.

Fierce Fighting in the Central Sector

Stockholm, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegraph - The offensive and defensive battles in the area south of Velikiye Luki in the central sector of the Eastern Front have reached an extremely intense stage. On the 4th, Soviet forces launched a powerful large-scale attack on the flank of the German positions, and dispatched a large number of tanks and aircraft to assist in the battle, engaging in fierce fighting with the intercepting German forces. According to German front-line news, after a long period of fighting, the Soviet forces were completely repulsed. On the 5th, Soviet forces launched another attack north of Velikiye Luki. German forces in the Kholm region also began a fierce attack, seemingly penetrating Soviet positions in certain areas, thus significantly hindering the Soviet offensive in the southern Velikiye Luki area.

Stockholm, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegraph - On the morning of the 5th, German forces on the southern sector of the Eastern Front suddenly launched an offensive along the entire 270-kilometer line from Orel via Kursk to Belgorod, under the cover of powerful air forces. Powerful tank groups led the vanguard, attacking important Soviet positions like a raging tide. The scale of the offensive is unprecedented since the winter battles. Soviet forces are currently mobilizing reserve forces in a state of panic, defending to the death. Fierce battles have broken out everywhere. Due to the strength of the German forces, Soviet positions have been penetrated in several places. The Soviet Information Bureau's special communiqué on the night of the 5th also acknowledged this. Whether this operation marks the beginning of the German summer offensive remains to be seen. However, considering the Soviet report stating that the operation was a "large-scale offensive with superior forces," this operation may be a prelude to the summer offensive.

### Japanese Prime Minister Meets with Malay Sultans

Shonan, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegraph - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo met with Johor Sultan Ibrahim and nine other Malay Sultans at his residence here on the afternoon of the 5th. The Johor Sultan, representing the entire group, addressed Prime Minister Tojo, expressing deep gratitude for the Japanese army's complete expulsion of British forces from Malaya, and clarifying their determination to assist Japan with all their strength in the future. Prime Minister Tojo expressed his gratitude for this and for the cooperation given to the Japanese army by the Sultans during the Japanese operations in Malaya, and guaranteed the future status and reputation of the Malay Sultans, hoping that the Sultans would further cooperate with the Japanese army in the future. The Sultans then took their leave. After his departure, the Johor Sultan issued a statement saying, "I consider it the greatest honor of my life to have been received by Prime Minister Tojo today. I remember that when I visited Japan thirteen years ago, I was granted an audience with His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, for which I was extremely grateful. Now, to be treated so kindly by Prime Minister Tojo is even more touching. I am determined to do my best to promote Johor's politics under a new ideology, so that Johor can fully realize its strength."

Prime Minister Tojo Pays Respects to War Dead

Shonan, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegraph - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and his entourage departed from their residence here at 9:40 a.m. on the 6th to first pay respects at the memorial tower dedicated to the war dead who died in the operation to capture Singapore, and then inspected successively Bukit Timah, Bukit Panjang, and the former site of the Ford factory where General Yamashita met with the enemy General Percival, as well as overlooking the Johor River crossing point, etc., the sites of the Japanese army's battles. Prime Minister Tojo repeatedly nodded his head with great enthusiasm as he listened to the explanation of a staff officer while peering through binoculars in all directions. He then visited the old Ford factory where General Yamashita met with the enemy General Percival and went to the army hospital to comfort the wounded and sick Japanese soldiers.

### "The Current Situation and Future of New China" - Economic Advisor Ishiwatari Writes Article to Commemorate the July 7th Incident

Nanjing, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegraph - Mr. Shotaro Ishiwatari, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, recently wrote an article entitled "The Current Situation and Future of New China" to commemorate the July 7th Incident. Here is a summary of its main points: "The main purpose of China's participation in the war is to destroy Britain and the United States and cooperate with Japan, which goes without saying. Since China's participation in the war, Japan has been seeking to implement the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions, and expects China to promote its own will and exert its total economic power. At the same time, the Chinese side is extremely grateful for Japan's kindness and intends to reorganize the economy based on this intention. Regarding the current state of China's economy, due to the remaining forces of Chongqing and various past relationships, considerable difficulties are felt in implementing economic policies. It was not until the implementation of easing restrictions on the movement of materials and the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, with Tang Zhongmin, a Shanghai financial tycoon, as the chairman, that preparations began and activities were launched. The focus of the wartime economy is to supply the materials necessary for the war and to stabilize people's livelihood. In this sense, China's economy is also striving to supply the materials necessary for the completion of the Greater East Asia War as much as possible and to stabilize the livelihood of the Chinese people. Judging from the situation from all sides, the reliance and self-sufficiency of the war economy are inevitable trends. From this perspective, the Chinese economy centered on Shanghai will inevitably undergo a major change. After the Chinese economy turns to a self-sufficient economy, rural products and minerals will strive to increase production. The key point of China's economy in the future lies in the overall increase in production in all departments. The National Government's recent establishment of a three-year construction plan can be said to be an appropriate measure. This plan is centered on increasing production, which is naturally necessary. Increased production of materials will make a great contribution to the stability of the Chinese people's livelihood and the Greater East Asia War. The first issue is thrifty consumption and rigorous savings. No matter how much production increases, if national consumption also increases, the materials supplied for the war will still decrease, and people's livelihood will not be stabilized. Therefore, it is inevitable that China is implementing thrifty consumption and encouraging savings, which are the two wings of the wartime economy, along with increased production policies. Regarding the promotion of savings, the National Government and Chinese and Japanese banks are taking the same steps and actively carrying out work. All kinds of measures to promote work are appropriate. Regarding the price issue, the rise in prices should be curbed by the material aspect, and efforts should be made to increase savings to reduce the amount of currency. The Central Reserve Bank plans to issue food coupons and has begun to issue them. From August 1st, it will sell prize-winning savings bonds and issue Fuxing lottery tickets, which are also a means to reduce currency. It is expected that buyers will be extremely enthusiastic. Next, regarding the solution to the problem of hoarding, the problem of hoarding is also an important issue in the wartime economy. The act of hoarding materials necessary for wartime and materials needed by the people to seek exorbitant profits should be absolutely prohibited, and it is even more necessary to prevent it in the wartime economy. The National Government organized the Materials Investigation Committee, with Shanghai Mayor Su Gongbo as the chairman. In the past, China's economy was based on liberalism, and it was considered natural for hoarding to occur as a daily commercial activity, but this is not the case in the wartime economy. Now that China and Japan are on the same front to destroy Britain and the United States, hoarding based solely on personal freedom should be absolutely eliminated. This is an act that disregards national interests for personal gain, so it is hoped that China and Japan will work together to eliminate this kind of behavior. Furthermore, it is necessary to study and increase production. China is known to be vast and rich in resources. If economic production is further studied, significant progress and improvement can be made. This does not mean that China's research is not good, but China still has room for further research in modern research. For example, Japan's agricultural products are harvested in large quantities in China, which shows that there is still room for progress in increasing China's agricultural production. Since the economies of China and Japan are in harmony, all economic departments in China's agriculture and industry can actively increase production, and the future is very promising. In the future, China's economy still has many difficulties, but if China, which is vast and rich in resources, makes efforts to increase production, great achievements will be made in the future, which we hope and expect. The issue of increasing production is the foundation of China's economic policy. I believe that if this issue can be resolved smoothly, issues such as currency and prices can also be resolved naturally. In short, today's Chinese people's hearts are increasingly inclined towards the National Government because of the appropriate policies of the National Government and the sincerity of Japan. The National Government's political power is increasing day by day, which can be seen from the increasing number of Chongqing troops surrendering. With the increasing political power of the National Government, it is believed that the promotion of its various economic policies will have a great effect."

### To Manage Materials and Prices - Thoroughly Rectify Institutions - Unify Authority to Achieve Lasting Results - Deliberation, Control, Investigation, and Corruption Prevention All Considered

Although the recent surge in prices in this city stems from temporary stimulation, to achieve lasting results and place the material and price issues of this city under unified control, the authorities have thoroughly rectified the implementing agencies to ensure that the authority of control is unified and clear.

Three Major Institutions Working in Parallel

(1) The highest authority for managing materials and control is the Materials Control Deliberation Council. To effectively perform its duties, the council plans to establish an administrative office and set up an office in Shanghai. From now on, it can maintain a close relationship with the work of material control in this city. (2) Under the Materials Control Deliberation Council is the National Commercial Control Association. Although this association is national, its work is centered in Shanghai. In the future, all industry associations and trade associations will be under the unified control of the Commercial Control Association. (3) The Materials Investigation Committee, specially established in the Shanghai area, has begun to operate. The committee is composed of Chinese and Japanese personnel and is equipped with investigators and surveyors to conduct thorough investigations of hoarding of materials. In summary, under the auspices of the three institutions of deliberation, control, and investigation, the price and material issues of this city are expected to maintain a stable situation without the risk of deterioration.

Real Number of Materials Investigators

To ensure the smooth implementation of wartime policies and to completely eliminate hoarding, the National Government decided on the "Organizational Outline of the Materials Investigation Committee" at the Supreme National Defense Conference on May 13th and announced it on the same day. The Japanese side has also expressed great cooperation in this regard. Both the Chinese and Japanese sides have appointed members and held the first committee meeting on June 19th. After the establishment of the committee, it began to work on this day, and Shanghai's economic situation can gradually become normalized. The committee's office address will be located in the racecourse on Maluhou Road. The most urgent task for the committee is to complete the appointment of investigators. It is reported that the quota for investigators has been internally set at three Japanese (two dispatched by the consulate general and one dispatched by the military police), four from the Municipal Council, two from the French Municipal Council, and six from the Municipal Government, for a total of fifteen. A meeting will be held today.

### Local Court Evacuates Inmates

The detention center of the local court in this city holds nearly a thousand inmates, and the climate is becoming increasingly hot, which is detrimental to the health of the inmates. Moreover, the source of prison food is insufficient, and even a grain of rice is difficult to obtain. Therefore, to alleviate the situation of the inmates, the president of the court has strictly ordered the handling judges to consider the case and implement bail for undecided inmates. In addition, starting yesterday, sentenced inmates with longer terms have been transferred to the Zhenjiang and Hangzhou prisons for execution. It is estimated that there are more than one hundred and thirty people in Hangzhou Prison and forty-eight in Zhenjiang Prison.

### Municipal Government Propaganda Office Officially Established Yesterday - Director Liang Also Issues Statement

The Executive Yuan meeting on the 6th of this month approved the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Propaganda Office and appointed Mr. Liang Xiuyu as the director of the office. It is reported that Director Liang arrived in Shanghai yesterday (6th), and the preparations for the office have been completed and will begin operations shortly. A Central News Agency reporter visited the Municipal Government Propaganda Office and was granted an audience. Director Liang issued the following statement:

Statement

Propaganda is one of the important policies of modern countries. Since the founding of the capital, the central government has established a propaganda department, and each province and city also has a propaganda office. The Shanghai municipal propaganda administration, within the scope of the urban area, has been handled by the fifth section of the Municipal Government Secretariat. The area within the concessions was under the direct jurisdiction of the various specialized agencies of the Propaganda Department. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Propaganda Department established a Shanghai office in the concession to command its subordinate agencies and coordinate with the Municipal Government to handle local propaganda. In addition, since the start of the rural pacification work, the Pacification Division had a propaganda office. Recently, with the recovery of the Shanghai concessions as the mechanism and the expansion of the scope of the Municipal Government, the propaganda departments also need to be adjusted and strengthened. The Shanghai Municipal Government has specially established this office in accordance with the organizational regulations of the propaganda offices of various provinces and cities. The Propaganda Department will abolish the Shanghai office to unify the authority. After the reorganization of the Pacification Division, the propaganda office will also be merged, and all staff will be employed by this office. This is a summary of the establishment of this office. As for the future work focus of this office, there are about four points.

First, the previous central and local propaganda agencies in this city have achieved significant results. The foundation has been deeply rooted in the propaganda cause of this city. This office will resolutely inherit the work within the scope of its authority to ensure that the original work is not interrupted.

Second, the construction of modern cities lies first in the unity of the will of the government and the people. Now that the administrative scope of this city has been expanded, all municipal measures will become more burdensome in the future, and it is necessary to communicate them to the citizens at any time. This office will follow the instructions of the Municipal Government and disseminate the policies of the government to all citizens as much as possible, and at the same time, widely solicit the opinions of the citizens as a reference for government policies.

Third, peace and common national construction are the unchanging national policies since the return of the capital. From the central government to the local governments, all propaganda events are based on this and strive to promote it. The existence of the concessions in this city has been relied upon by Chongqing for anti-Japanese propaganda. After the start of the Greater East Asia War, it gradually subsided. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the various propaganda administrations will be more convenient than before. This office will formulate all necessary measures in the future to ensure that millions of citizens in the city are imbued with the awareness of peace, anti-communism, and national construction, and contribute their strength to the great cause of revitalizing China and protecting Asia.

Fourth, propaganda work and cultural movements are inherently closely related. Since the government promulgated the basic guidelines for wartime cultural propaganda policies, it has become increasingly clear that the direction of the two is consistent. Shanghai has always been the cultural center of the country and a base for Britain and the United States to spread colonial culture. The result of its ideological anesthesia has been that all the winds of worshiping Britain and the United States and enjoying decadence, freedom, and indulgence have filled the city. How to wash away and eliminate them, so that the cultural movement in this city is based on national goals and wartime needs, and follows the proper regulations to achieve its development, and to guide the improvement of citizens' cultural life and the revitalization of the spirit of self-discipline, is also the subject of this office in the future. We should follow the established policies of the central government and work together with the city's cultural propaganda organizations to implement them. The above four points are the foundation of this office's future work. As for specific projects, we should consider the situation at any time, determine the steps, and supervise the subordinates to implement them. However, I am of shallow talent and knowledge and bear this heavy responsibility. I am deeply worried that I will not be able to reach the hope that the central government and friendly propaganda and reporting agencies in Shanghai, and the advanced people in the city's cultural and journalistic circles, will continue to cooperate to achieve their mission."

Liang's Brief Biography

Here is a brief biography of Liang: He is a native of Guangdong, graduated from National Sun Yat-sen University, and graduated from the Faculty of Law of Meiji University in Japan. After returning to China, he worked at the China Daily as the chief writer, editor-in-chief, and editor of the China Monthly. After the Sixth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, he served as the chief secretary of the Central Propaganda Department until now. Since the return of the capital, he has served as the director of the General Affairs Department of the Propaganda Department, concurrently as the director of the Business Department, the executive director of the China Broadcasting Business Construction Association, the major general training committee member and chief instructor of the Central Army General School Training Corps, the secretary-general of the New National Movement Promotion Committee, and the director of the Management Office of the China Youth Model Corps. Deputy Education Director of the Central Youth Cadre School and other positions.

Japanese Manufacturers Support the Imposition of Scrap Paper Tax

Since the Municipal Scrap Paper Business Transfer Tax Office presented the Financial Bureau to approve the establishment of the paper business tax office, it has been progressing smoothly. Recently, the Municipal Government received a letter from the Japanese Embassy regarding the situation of the tax collection agencies in the concession, so that they could cooperate with each other at any time in order to make progress smoothly. According to rumors from Japanese paper mills, many Japanese manufacturers, in order to comply with the purpose of their embassy and the spirit of Chinese-Japanese cooperation, are doing their best to support the opening of the scrap paper tax, so as to be a model.

### Municipal Education Committee Considers Giving Preferential Treatment to Teachers

The Municipal Education Association believes that the future of education is greatly related to the upcoming return of the concessions in this city. Yesterday (6th) at 3:00 p.m., the fifth committee meeting was held in the Municipal Government Conference Hall to discuss future progress. First, Chairman Chen reported: (1) the opinion on reorganizing the Municipal Education Bureau after the recovery of the concessions, (2) the plan on the relief of teachers and staff. Then, the discussion began and the proposals were submitted: (1) Committee Member Wang Yan proposed to stipulate that teachers' children should be exempted from tuition fees when they are admitted to schools. Secretary-General Zhou proposed to hire fundraisers for the Poor Education Fund and to establish a Poor Education Fund Management Committee. (3) Section Chief Chen Dashen proposed to subsidize the living of teachers and staff in this city by appropriating funds from the government. All of the above proposals were approved satisfactorily. The list of members of the Poor Education Fundraiser was also decided immediately.

### Thoughts on the Unified Promotion of Charitable Undertakings: Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association, Lan Ting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng (II) Difficulties in Promotion

Charity is a social undertaking. The promotion and development of charity rely entirely on the spirit of sacrifice and service by those running charitable organizations, and the automatic support of enthusiastic people in society. These groups encourage and complement each other to achieve their shared goals. Therefore, success or failure largely depends on the appeal of this spirit, which cannot be achieved by mere laws and orders. Therefore, there are considerable and serious difficulties in our current desire to unify and promote charitable undertakings.

First, in terms of the thinking and habits of the Chinese people, freedom from control is seen as glorious, and each going their own way is considered normal. In the past, people were accustomed to dispersal and feared regulations most of all. Those running charitable organizations have no personal gain to seek, and must endure hardship and resentment. Their tireless efforts seek only spiritual comfort. If strict "unified promotion" is suddenly implemented, it is likely to encounter some unnecessary doubts and resistance, at least in the initial stages. The benefits of unified promotion may not be seen, while charitable undertakings may suffer adverse effects. Some people, unaware of the truth, may spread rumors based on suspicion, believing that the government will control charitable organizations, which will have an even greater impact on future endeavors.

Second, in terms of organization, of the more than 330 charitable organizations and undertakings in Shanghai, a small number are carried out with the cooperation of the government. Most were founded by religious groups, followed by various civic groups and private friends. While they generally expect assistance from the government, the goals and content of their undertakings may have fixed religious directions and scopes, or historical characteristics and merits, or represent the dedication and hard work of those running them. While operators may not view charitable undertakings as their private property, if they are suddenly enlarged, reduced, or changed in the name of "unified promotion," it will inevitably cause stimulation, and in fact, it may not be easy to achieve results.

Third, in terms of personnel, in fact, most established charitable organizations, with a few exceptions, have a relatively long history and have achieved considerable success. Although their scale varies, they have all developed specialized talent over a long period of time. They regard helping and teaching people as their lifelong career, embracing the spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" Regardless of their past enjoyment and status, they personally serve and nurture unknown, impoverished elderly, and orphaned children, as well as the sick and disabled, as if they were their own parents and children. Technically, they excel in fundraising, management, care, diagnosis, treatment, and education. In practice, they regard these organizations as their families. This kind of personnel cannot be cultivated by ordinary schools, and cannot be easily changed due to the need for "unified promotion." At the same time, those who are in charge of the unified promotion work, if they do not have the same spirit of sacrifice and service as these talents, nor have the experience in managing charitable affairs, and are unfamiliar with the hardships involved, it will not be easy to achieve the benefits of unified promotion.

In addition, in terms of fundraising, in the past, during the non-unified period, except for special events such as disaster relief in North China, which were launched temporarily and received good results through widespread response, in reality, each charitable organization had its specific fundraising scope and target. They relied on the credibility and personal relationships of the organizers, or on religious affiliations, kinship ties (such as people from the same hometown or clan), or on the respective achievements of the charitable organizations, to win social sympathy and obtain regular and temporary donations to support their undertakings. There is no doubt that this old fundraising method is ineffective and urgently needs improvement. However, if "unified promotion" is implemented without solid guarantees, although the original intention is to seek reform and promote development, the result may be the loss of the basis for self-preservation, and those who are sought to help may instead be harmed. This is something that those who advocate "unified promotion" should pay attention to. (To be continued)

### King Kong Company Sponsors Education

The King Kong Company specially held a three-day charity sale to support the Shen Bao’s education aid program by donating a percentage of their sales. Their benevolent and righteous act is a model for the business community. The Shen Bao is deeply grateful. Yesterday, the company sent a letter stating: "In order to support your newspaper’s education aid program, we held a charity sale by donating a percentage of the sales, which started on the first of this month and ended three days later. However, due to the uncertain weather, the results were not as satisfactory as we had hoped. We have checked the total business turnover of our three branch stores, which amounts to 156,627.60 yuan in national currency. We will donate 10% of this amount, which is 15,662.80 yuan in national currency. In addition to this amount, customers who won prizes during the three-day charity sale generously donated 321 yuan in national currency. (Liu Zongyuan: 200 yuan, Huang Zongxian: 20 yuan, Zhao Pingqian: 43 yuan, Pan Jiayong: 10 yuan, Cai [omitted character]: 48 yuan.) The total amount is 15,983.80 yuan.

### The Su Yizhi Case: Final Arguments Concluded Yesterday

In the case of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School, who died from being defiled, the court hearing was held yesterday morning. First, the lawyer representing the Public Works Department, Zhang Tianyin, stated: The wine bottle found in the room of Principal Yu Jierong by the police last time was sent to the Public Works Department's Health Department for chemical testing. The results confirmed that the wine contained no poison. Currently, Chief Detective Jiang Yingxiang, who is handling the case, has a report to present and should be questioned. Chief Detective Jiang then reported to the court that the facts were clear. The court ordered the commencement of the defense. First, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, Zhang Tianyin, spoke, stating that according to the coroner’s report, the deceased died from injuries. This is consistent with the testimonies of witnesses. There is no doubt that the defendant should be held criminally liable. He requested the court to impose the maximum penalty according to Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The defendant's lawyer stood up and argued that the testimonies of witness Li Jinghong were inconsistent, and that the elementary school students were not of legal age and were not qualified to testify. He also believed that the coroner's injury report was unlawful and requested a re-examination. The plaintiff's lawyer, Shao Bao San, then presented a supplementary claim for damages totaling 80,000 yuan. The court announced the conclusion of the arguments and scheduled the judgment to be announced at 10:00 am on the 2nd of next month.

### Mainichi Shimbun Hosted Reception Yesterday

The Japanese Mainichi Shimbun hosted a reception yesterday (6th) from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM at the Japanese Club to mark the handover between the outgoing Shanghai branch chief, Taniyoshi Naozumi, and the incoming branch chief, Yokota Takaaki, as well as the inauguration of Murakami Takeshi as the editor of the Chinese magazine "Kouyu."

This year, the Chinese and Western teams are divided into two groups. Whether the overall championship will be decided by the leaders of the Chinese and Western groups still needs to be decided by the league committee. The Huatong team is a new force that has emerged this year, with unparalleled combat power. It has many talented players, such as Cai Shengsen, Wu Qixiang, and Qu Yongfu. Hequn is also extraordinary. The Group B final will be between Huabu and Changming.

### Japanese Ambassador Gu Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday: Negotiating the Return of Concessions in Shanghai; Foreign Minister Chu and the French Ambassador Have Both Arrived, and the French Concession Should Be Returned Soon

Japanese Ambassador to China, Gu, arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 2:00 PM, accompanied by two councilors, Ota and Shimizu, and Secretary Terashima. He immediately went to the Broadway Building to rest. During his stay in Shanghai, the ambassador is scheduled to hold important meetings with relevant parties on the return of concessions and other important matters. The Shanghai International Settlement was signed on June 30 by the Chinese and Japanese authorities and will be recovered on August 1. Therefore, the only remaining concessions in China that have not been returned are the Italian Concession in Tianjin and the French Concession in Shanghai. After Italy's National Government entered the war on January 9, and China and Japan signed an agreement to return the concessions and abolish extraterritoriality, Italy returned its concessions in China on January 14. Thanks to the decisive decisions of French leaders Laval, France also declared on the 23rd that it would abolish extraterritoriality in China and give up its concessions. Therefore, it is only a matter of time before the National Government takes over all the concessions. This time, thanks to the signing of an agreement between China and Japan, the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement can be realized quickly. Regarding the recovery of the Italian Concession in Tianjin and the French Concession in Shanghai, the Government has been actively negotiating with the governments of these countries since the beginning of this year, and has achieved great results. Therefore, it is feared that the recovery of the French and Italian concessions may be resolved before August 1. French [omitted name] and French Consul General Majere arrived in Shanghai from North China one day before Ambassador Gu came to Shanghai. Foreign Minister Chu is also scheduled to come to Shanghai in the next day or two. It is reported that the French side hopes to postpone the implementation in order to prepare for related matters. However, the current issue is not simply a matter to be dealt with administratively, but rather requires major political considerations. The French government has always adopted a proactive and cooperative approach to building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and is making every effort to promote its concrete realization. Therefore, it is deeply believed that it will also remove all concerns and quickly coordinate its measures with Japan. It is expected that the negotiations on the recovery of the French and Italian concessions will have concrete progress and achieve a satisfactory settlement in the shortest possible time with the sincere cooperation of the countries concerned.

(Nanjing, 6th, Central News Agency) Foreign Minister Chu Minyi took a train to Shanghai on the 6th to inspect the situation in Shanghai and Zhejiang, accompanied by two staff members.

The Taxpayers' Association is Preparing for a Glorious End

According to sources, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the International Settlement, which was formed more than a decade ago to counter the power of British and American merchants, and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, which was formed in imitation, are now preparing for a glorious end because the International Settlement has been recovered on August 1 through an agreement signed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and allied Japan, and the recovery of the French Concession is also under discussion. Once the two concessions are recovered, the Taxpayers' Associations will no longer need to exist.

### Lower Semester Transfer Licenses: Issuance Has Begun

The issuance of transfer licenses for the current semester of the International Settlement has begun. Applications for these transfer licenses closed on the 24th of last month. Those who wish to apply after the deadline must pay a fine based on the number of days since the application deadline, calculated at one yuan per day.

### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Mail: Shortened Delivery Time, Reaching Destination in One Week

The delivery time for mail to counties and towns along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was previously extended due to transportation delays. Whether express mail, registered mail, or ordinary mail, the shortest time required was half a month. This was because the mail was transported from Shanghai to Hangzhou by train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and then transported by the Zhejiang Postal Administration by boat and vehicle. According to sources, the delivery time for mail to and from that area (Zhuji, Jinhua, Shengxian, Yiwu, Dongyang, etc.) has been shortened compared to the past. Each letter, whether sent from Shanghai to those places or from those places to Shanghai, can now reach its destination in one week. This is mostly due to transportation by train on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which is very convenient for people from eastern Zhejiang living in Shanghai.

### Coal Slurry from Nanshi Trades Should be Removed: Association Asks to be Cleared

The Shanghai Hot Water Store Trade Association has requested the Municipal Health Bureau to find a way to remove the coal slurry left over from daily burning by its members in Nanshi, in order to improve hygiene and facilitate business. In the past, the coal slurry from hot water stores in the meat market was removed by cleaners sent by the Health Bureau. Therefore, each hot water store pays taxes according to the law.

### Wife of Artist Cheng Keguang Attempted Suicide Due to Financial Difficulties: Hoping Relatives, Friends, and Authorities Will Provide Relief

Artist Cheng Keguang was assassinated by Kuomintang agents on March 22, 1940, at 8:30 PM in front of the Jue Lin Vegetarian Restaurant on Xiafei Road, where he was shot eight times and died on the spot. For four years, Cheng left behind his elderly parents, orphans, and a widow, a family of seven, with no one to support them. Struggling in hardship, the entire family's livelihood was in a desperate situation. His wife, Cheng Liu Xiazhen, attempted suicide twice last year in order to die quickly, but was rescued each time. However, requests for help from relatives and friends were often met with cold shoulders. Therefore, on May 23 of this year, she attempted suicide for the third time. Fortunately, she was discovered early and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. She has now recovered and been discharged from the hospital. She has appealed to all parties, requesting relief. She hopes that Cheng's friends and relatives will provide assistance to Cheng's surviving family, and that the government will promptly implement a comprehensive relief and education plan for the families of the martyrs of the Peace Movement, so that the souls of the martyrs can be comforted in the afterlife, and the service spirit of those who die later can be encouraged.

The Circumstances of Cheng Keguang's Martyrdom

Martyr Cheng Keguang was a famous artist who served in the Sino-French Pharmacy and the press during his lifetime. He was young and energetic and highly valued by all parties. In September 1939, on the recommendation of Sun Mingqi, he joined the Peace Movement, taking charge of activities in various Shanghai organizations. Cheng did not avoid danger and worked hard. Due to jealousy from the Kuomintang, on March 22, 1940, at 8:30 PM, he was assassinated by thugs in front of the Jue Lin Vegetarian Restaurant on Xiafei Road, where he was shot eight times, hitting vital parts of his body, and died on the spot without leaving a will. He died with regret at the age of only thirty-five.

His Wife Liu Attempted Suicide

He left behind his elderly parents, orphans, and a widow, a family of seven, who suddenly lost their support. The Central Party Headquarters issued 4,000 yuan for funeral expenses. After the funeral was hastily completed, the Executive Yuan allocated 11,600 yuan in old currency at the end of December of the same year to maintain the family's life. However, due to rising prices and the high cost of living in recent years, Liu, a young widow who did not understand how to produce, owed more and more debts in the past four years. She became disillusioned with the world and attempted suicide twice last year to follow her husband in death. Although she was rescued, she did not know how to live in the long years to come. Therefore, on May 23 of this year, she attempted suicide for the third time in order to die quickly. She was discovered and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment and has now recovered and been discharged from the hospital.

Hoping for Sympathy and Assistance from All Sectors

Cheng's surviving family currently lives at No. 30, Lane 1423, Park Villa, Yuquan Road. His father, Cheng Wenyuan, is 74 years old, his mother, Cheng Zhang, is 52 years old, his wife, Liu Xiazhen, is 32 years old, and they have four children: the eldest is 17 years old, the second is 15 years old, the third daughter is 9 years old, and the youngest son is 6 years old. The eldest two sons are apprentices through referrals, and efforts are being made to enroll the third daughter and youngest son in school. The living conditions of the family of seven are pitiful. Cheng was from Qingbo, and it is hoped that all sectors of Shanghai and Cheng's friends, relatives, and former colleagues will sympathize and provide assistance. It is said that Liu intends to go to Nanjing in the coming days to request relief from the authorities.

### Coal Briquette Materials: Distributed as Much as Possible to Users Below One Ton

One week ago, the coal briquettes in Shanghai's markets suddenly became in short supply, and rumors spread. Now, the relevant authorities are striving to eliminate this situation. The main measures are: (1) To distribute all the coal that should have been distributed in the three months from July to September, effectively increasing the amount of coal stored for three months; (2) To instruct various factories to repair their machines, not only to expedite shipments, but also to resume full operation, turning the existing raw materials into coal briquettes to fully supply the needs; (3) To supply users with less than one ton at any time. In addition to the above effective measures, coal briquette manufacturers also convened a meeting yesterday to discuss supplying as much as possible to various important cases. It is expected that the serious problem of coal briquette supply can be completely resolved in the near future.

Commentary on the Economic Scene

### Germany Bans Hoarding Currency

According to a Berlin dispatch from the Haitong News Agency on the 29th of last month, the German Minister of Economic Affairs, Fink, declared at the 125th anniversary celebration of the Berlin Savings Bank: "The government has strictly banned the hoarding of currency, as well as the purchase of all unnecessary movable and immovable property. The authorities should pay attention to protecting the people of the middle class. During wartime, currency is still the standard of social and individual wealth. Therefore, the government is very cautious about monetary policy. The government has repeatedly advised people not to withdraw currency from the market for unnecessary purposes. Hoarding banknotes is also taboo during wartime, and the authorities often impose heavy taxes to suppress it. Savings deposits are mostly accumulated from the hard work of the middle class. The middle class is the backbone of a country, and the government should find security for them and provide active assistance."

After reading this news, we cannot help but have a strange feeling, that is, what the German government wants to ban now is the hoarding of currency, while what the Chinese government wants to ban is the hoarding of goods. Germans hoard currency during wartime, so prices are stable and people's livelihoods are secure. Chinese hoard goods during wartime, so prices soar and people's livelihoods suffer. Recalling that during the First World War, Germans also hoarded goods, and Chinese also hoarded currency, but now the situation is the opposite, which is worth studying.

Currency is stable or rising, so currency is hoarded; goods are stable or rising, so goods are hoarded. This is the natural law of human self-interest and self-defense. If the world wants to go against it, it will be fruitless. So, how can we make the value of currency stable and rising? This requires a two-pronged approach: increasing the production of goods and tightening the issuance of currency.

### Authorities Pay Attention to Speculation in the Black Market: Cracking Down on Disguised Handling Fees

Although the rise in prices is related to the balance of supply and demand, it would not have drastic changes without hoarding, speculation, and monopolies. At a time when the authorities are controlling materials, facilitating sources, and striving to increase production, prices are not leveling off, but skyrocketing. The main reason is currently attributed to speculation and hoarding, especially speculation in the black market, which is of great concern to society. According to recent price increases, the first thing that started the trend was the soaring prices in the black market. In addition to the limited price, the increase in disguised handling fees for gold ornaments sold in jewelry stores in the black market is very high in a single day, and the handling fee for gold ornaments in jewelry stores increases accordingly. Therefore, the increase or decrease in this handling fee in jewelry stores is a semi-public black market transaction, which directly stimulates the rise in prices of all goods and has a great impact. Because it is not a necessary item for the people, it moves from it and restrains the market price of various major commodities, causing a price increase trend, which is necessary to strictly crack down on. The relevant authorities have sent people to fully understand where the problem lies, and will strictly crack down on the disguised handling fees for gold ornaments sold in jewelry stores. If anyone is found to be a repeat offender, they will be punished as a warning.

### Shaanxi North and Both Concessions: Edible Oil Distribution Period, at the Latest Before the 10th

The Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office has published a notice stating that the fourth phase of edible oil distribution will be from June 28 to July 7, and will first distribute edible oil in Pudong, Puxi, and Nanshi, with each person still limited to four liang. However, the edible oil to be distributed in Zhabei, the International Settlement, and the French Concession has not yet started. Ordinary people need oil very urgently. According to sources, the office is actively expediting the shipment of edible oil to be sold in Zhabei, the International Settlement, and the French Concession. Many merchants have already received the allocated oil. However, before all the merchants in the territory have finished loading the goods, the edible oil must be stored, and the distribution must be carried out consistently at a set time so that residents can purchase edible oil at the same time. Sources also revealed that the edible oil distributed in Shanghai in the fourth phase is still squeezed by military allocation. It is soybean oil and raw oil produced by oil mills in the suburbs of Shanghai. The official distribution date will be before the 10th of this month.

### Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Market Will Be Jointly Operated by Officials and Merchants

The Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Association Market at No. 15 Edward Road temporarily suspended trading on the 30th of last month due to rising prices of miscellaneous grains and edible oil, in order to prevent speculators from outside the industry from taking advantage of the situation. According to sources, the market is currently undergoing reorganization and will be completed in the coming days. It is said that the reorganized market will be jointly operated by officials and merchants.

### This City's Silver and Money Businesses Handle Silk and Tea Loans

Following past practices, the Shanghai silver and money businesses will continue to handle silk and tea loans this year. However, the loan methods have undergone many changes. Previously, they would directly go to the production areas with silk and tea merchants to investigate loans. Now, silk and tea merchants must provide collateral and guarantors in Shanghai, strictly guaranteeing that the loans are used for silk or tea purposes. This is intended to align with the goals of investing in production, revitalizing the rural economy. It is said that the amount of loans issued is much less than before the incident.

### Inspection of Financial Affairs, Hangzhou Branch Officially Established

The Central Reserve Bank's Inspection of Financial Affairs Office, in order to advance the inspection and management of financial institutions in the interior, decided to establish branches as needed based on the financial situation in various regions. Currently, the Suzhou, Nanjing, and Hankou branches have been established separately last month to inspect the business of financial institutions and the payment of required reserve ratios for fixed and current deposits. It is now known that the Hangzhou branch was established on the 1st of this month, operating within the Hangzhou branch of the Central Reserve Bank. The director is Jian Shepei, the chief of the document and management section is Yin Chang Shen Bingxiong, and the head of the review section is Chen Jijiao. They are responsible for urging financial institutions to report their business status on a monthly basis according to regulations, and tables are prepared for reference. It is also reported that the Bengbu and Wuhu branches in Anhui Province will also be established in the near future.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, single-stock factories opened lower, likely because the constant rise in stock prices was not seen as a good thing by the industry, and a certain major firm with strength sold off a large amount, which was also a major factor. However, due to the firmness of gold prices, most new and old investors did not give up their only opportunity, and actively pushed prices up. Although most stocks fell, they consolidated during midday and then turned stable. The two foreign tobacco companies and the public utilities, such as Northern Water and Electricity, continued to advance upward due to demand exceeding supply. China Electric has shown weakness, while China Match experienced a significant decline. Department stores Wing On and Sun Sun had large fluctuations, ultimately closing lower along with Sincere and China National Products. Underwear knocked through the barriers, while King Sun and King Fook socks also showed weakness. In the textile industry, Wing On Textiles was still fluctuating around a key level, Rong Feng re-entered the key level, Sino-Foreign Yarn Mill's trend was stable, and Great China Weaving rose again. In the cultural industry, World Book showed unique strength, while Commercial Press and China Book both experienced declines. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Sino-French and New Asia continued to decline. Five Continents and Sino-Western's prices remained at the original transaction price. Kang Yuan Canning was still opening at the key level, while Jiu An Industrial and Tong Yi Trust were stable, and International Automobile had active trading, with New Asia Construction showing unusual strength.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Gold and Silver: Jewelry stores are still selling gold at the limited price, and the handling fee is the same as the previous day. Off-market prices have risen again due to continued buying from Tianjin, but slightly declined at midday, although still higher than the previous day. The price of sycee silver was slightly lower.

Cotton Cloth: The cloth market was firm at first but then weakened. The opening price in the morning set a new record, but then many people sold off due to excessive gains, and sentiment turned soft, causing market prices to decline step by step. As a result, Dragon Head Fine Cloth fell back below the key level, lower than the previous day. The Four Gentlemen Poplin also saw a price decline. There were no changes in the spot prices of Peach Blossom Ladies' Lawn Cloth and White Cat Printed Cloth. Qin Mei Ren's original color fine cloth was right at the key level.

Cotton Yarn: The cotton yarn market fell slightly, with thin trading volume. 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix and 32-count double-strand Fairy Peach fell significantly, while 10-count Red Double Horse fell only slightly.

### Brief News

### The Return of Concessions and Shanghai's Economic Problems (3): Participating in Municipal Administration and Shanghai's Economy

The issue of participating in the Shanghai Special Municipality is an important one for building a new Shanghai. According to general observations, after the National Government announces the new Special Municipality Organizational Law, it is possible for citizens to participate in politics. The National Government and the Municipal Government authorities should review how to organize participation in politics, especially how to enable the business community to contribute to municipal administration. The strengthening of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce in relation to the new municipal administration is worth noting. After the establishment of the Commercial Control Conference, the major commodity trade associations were all under the jurisdiction and guidance of the conference. As a result, the tasks of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce became narrower than before. Apart from the promotion of citizen consumer cooperatives by its key leaders, there has been little noteworthy activity. However, the current political situation is about to change, and municipal administration will soon be unified. Given the importance of Shanghai, it is necessary to establish a citizen participation organization. The most powerful of the people's organizations is the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, the importance of the position of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce in municipal administration, especially in various economic policies, is self-evident. The Commercial Control Conference is a control organ directly under the Executive Yuan, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is the only economic self-governing body under the Municipal Government. It is therefore necessary to attach equal importance to both. Of course, the cooperation system between the Municipal Government and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is gradually becoming organized. Currently, under the auspices of the Municipal Economic Bureau, there is the Shanghai Municipal Price Review Committee, and the trade associations under the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also have evaluation committees. However, prices have been rising recently, and this organization is almost unable to exert its effect. The future reorganization of the new Municipal Government must be improved. Not only must we concentrate our efforts on adjusting the administrative organization, but we must also pay attention to the adjustment and strengthening of the trade associations of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and other people's organizations.

### Humor and Wit

— Xiao Lin

"Humor" and "wit," at first glance, both seem to belong to the high realm of the art of dealing with the world and are not easy to distinguish. "Humor" can integrate emotions, and so can "wit." Wit can "turn danger into safety," and the greatest effect of "humor" is also this point.

However, if we can carefully savor and chew on them, their greatest difference can be said that "wit" is "rational," while "humor" is emotional. "Wit" is the clever operation of intelligence, while "humor" is the outpouring of nature. "Wit" comes from the conscious ingenuity of the mind, while "humor" comes from the depths of human nature. Sometimes wit is without sound or color, without emotion, and has a solemnity, while "humor" is the expression of inner true feelings, with sympathy, pity, love, and tears. It is a performance of the whole personality.

To put it further, "wit" is "artificial" and wants to win glory, conquer the jealousy of others, and make one's own talents play out without restraint in a "prepared" and appropriately perfect environment, "cope" properly, and get twice the result with half the effort... These are all the elements for success in a career. As for "humor," it can make people stand outside the world's circle, observe life calmly, give a little love to whoever needs courage and love, give a little sympathy to whoever needs sympathy, and "encourage" "strength" that everyone can understand. The only purpose of "humor" is to relieve human "boredom" and "sorrow"... These are all elements for obtaining comfort in human affairs.

Thus, we can see that "humor" and "wit" are equally important to life. A person needs both "reason" and "emotion." If you want to succeed in your career and get comfort in human relationships, how can we lack either one?

### Impromptu Sentiments (Quatrain)

— Wang Shixiong

The plums are yellow, the duckweed is green, and the grass is luxuriant,
Pairs of orioles sing on the willow embankment.
Frogs croak everywhere, singing the midnight song,
Petals of fallen flowers cross the stream in front.

I have wasted twenty-eight years of my life;
The vicissitudes of the world are like clouds and smoke!
My firm will is as strong as iron,
I do not envy being enfeoffed as a marquis, nor do I envy being an immortal.

Leisurely, I linger with poetry and wine,
Forgetting gains and losses, I learn to be a drunken madman.
A hundred years is originally a hundred springs,
Why worry so bitterly about fame and fortune?

Pomegranate flowers smile, announcing the Dragon Boat Festival,
Fragrance of calamus and moxa fills the painted hall.
Remotely recalling my hometown competing in the dragon boat race,
Cao E's filial piety is praised for all time.

— Shen Shen

"Ah Kun? Isn't that Ah Kun who almost died from a spring illness? Too bad luck! Sick already, and then suffered a man-made disaster, alas! I understand these things. I really want to say a few words for everyone with my old life, but my son always advises me that I am old and shouldn't meddle in other people's affairs. I'm really so full of anger that my stomach is about to burst!" Old Man Huang said slowly at first, but then pushed away the quilt and simply sat up wearing his clothes, his emotions also becoming tense!

"Headquarters or no headquarters, master or no master, they are all a bunch of desperate people, usually idle and not engaged in proper business. These people are doing whatever they want without regard for the law. One day, someone will settle accounts with them. Just watch!" Old Man Huang continued with some indignant words.

"How much money do you plan to want? Although it is said to be lent to Ah Kun, it is actually going to be spent by these bastards. It's really not worth it. But, then again, Ah Kun can't get out without it! It doesn't matter. If the fields are not enough for collateral, I can accommodate you. How much do you want?" Old Man Huang then said these words, while taking out the key from the cloth bag under the pillow and getting out of bed.

"At least seven or eight hundred yuan. We are also prepared to top it off. If they must ask for more or less, we are also prepared to be slapped," answered Village Chief Li to Old Man Huang. Old Man Huang dragged his shoes to another room, went for a moment, came back, and handed a roll of banknotes to Village Chief Li, saying:

"Here are eight hundred yuan. Take it. You will need it anyway. You go quickly!" Village Chief Li took the banknotes, stuffed them into his pocket, and nodded, saying:

"Thank you, Old Man! We will go and handle it."

Li and Lu said goodbye to the Huang family and hurried back to the ×× Headquarters in the town. At this time, in the headquarters, some were happily playing cards, while others were laughing and joking. In another corner of the room, Ah Kun, tied up with his hands behind his back, was hanging his head and waiting for his fate. The sentry at the door caught sight of Village Chief Li coming and quickly greeted him, letting him into the last room, Commander ×'s office.

"What's the matter! Have the firearms been handed over? This matter is too big to be taken lightly. You must understand the heavy responsibility!" Commander × said with an official face, very seriously:

"Commander! Please take care of it. Ah Kun is a good farmer who has never associated with idlers. We are close neighbors and are very clear about his character. We dare to guarantee that he will never harbor firearms, let alone collude with bandits. However, since the commander says he has colluded with bandits and hidden guns, someone must have reported it. Perhaps the reporter has some grudges against Ah Kun? So please, Commander, investigate carefully and forgive him once!" When Village Chief Li said this, Commander × raised his head and glared at Village Chief Li with eyes as big as copper bells, and Lu, the head of the Jia, seeing that the situation was not right, quickly interjected, saying:

"We have also prepared a reward for the brothers who were disturbed just now!"

"What are you saying!" Commander × clenched his fist and slammed it heavily on the table, his eyes widening even more, and pointing at Village Chief Li with one finger, he said:

"You are the village chief and you are responsible for handing him over, but you want to cover up his collusion with bandits? Our team received reliable intelligence, so how could we wrongly accuse people? We are giving you until tonight to hand over the firearms. Otherwise, we will detain you here as well!" Commander × roared sternly. Village Chief Li had originally felt a little unfair, so he had said some conflicting words, but he didn't expect it to come to a standstill. He thought that if he continued to conflict, he would definitely suffer an immediate loss, but he still felt uneasy in his heart and lowered his head in silence. (5)

### Review of Lung Disease Prescriptions

(1) The 29th issue of "Luohan Cai" magazine contains an article by Mr. Nie Yuntai entitled "The Gospel of Lung Disease," which describes the prescription and preparation method of pig pancreas wine for the treatment of lung disease, which is transcribed below for reference by lung disease patients:

Two pig pancreas, cut into small pieces. One tael of green wormwood, mix well and pound into a paste together. Add one catty of Shaoxing wine, stew over low heat for four or five hours, add three cents of cinnamon. (Cinnamon, for lung disease patients, is feared that dry ingredients will cause hemoptysis, so only a small amount is used in the prescription. If it can be eliminated and not used, it will be more stable. Also, lung disease patients should not drink alcohol, so it is stewed for a long time to allow the alcohol to evaporate, so that it has no alcohol odor at all.) Squeeze with cloth to filter out the residue. Drink one warm cup each morning and evening. After about seven days, the wine is finished. If you feel that the condition has improved slightly, you may continue to take it. However, the original text did not discuss whether this method can also be used to treat severe cases. (Note: Hanzhai)

(2) Mr. Jiang Yilan's discussion on the treatment of tuberculosis in the Social Service column on June 23 said that soaking ginkgo biloba in rapeseed oil for 100 days and taking it has a considerable effect. According to the Western name of ginkgo biloba, NutofGingko, it belongs to the seeds of Ginkgo biloba of the Ginkgoaceae family, which can be used for food and medicine. In ancient Chinese medical books, it is said that it is sweet, bitter, and peaceful, enters the lung meridian, benefits lung qi, calms asthma and cough, and sterilizes and expels insects. However, Rongciye of Japan tested aquatic plants and said that it should be classified as an antispasmodic drug. Unfortunately, we are busy with diagnosis and treatment all day long, and we have not been able to add a detailed chemical test. I think vitamin-like things should also be contained in it. As for oils, they are especially essential for lung disease nutrition. Now that cod liver oil is not easy to buy, then whether it is soybean oil or rapeseed oil, its heat generation Carikie should be easier and more than edible protein and starch. As for saying that this medicine can cure general tuberculosis, it has not been scientifically proven, and more research is needed from high-ranking colleagues. We must conduct real-world trials in various lung disease sanatoriums before we can get a clue. (Youzhu Medical Society)

(3) The Social Service column contains a discussion on the treatment of tuberculosis with rapeseed oil soaked in ginkgo biloba. I have quite a bit of knowledge about tuberculosis and have also tried using rapeseed oil without ginkgo biloba, which is quite effective. It can kill all invertebrate small insects, and its effect is the same as using mercury. Ginkgo biloba is produced by the ginkgo tree and is rich in combing yellow matter. It can also kill bacteria and detoxify. And it has fatty properties, which can replenish the lungs, and it can really be a good medicine for treating tuberculosis. (Chen Qichang)

### Medical Treatment and Medicine Distribution

(1) The directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Fashion Industry Association specially established a medical treatment and medicine distribution department in the association's hall at No. 20, Lane 161, Xieqiao Road, Public Concession, and hired five well-known physicians of internal medicine and surgery to be stationed at the association full-time for medical treatment and medicine distribution starting from July 1.
