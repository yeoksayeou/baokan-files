### "Human Resources Exchange"

Currently, the European war situation is approaching the decisive stage. Militarily, both sides are exerting all their strength to strive for the final victory. At the same time, in terms of politics and diplomacy, they are also launching a final competition, each hoping it will be beneficial to their own war situation. Looking back at our East Asian war situation, although our friendly nation Japan has already laid the foundation for victory, it is expected that the enemy will not be willing to stop there, and this cannot be ignored. Therefore, how we will strengthen the defense of the Pacific in the future, and how we will contribute all our human and material resources to the completion of the war, are the common responsibilities of the participating countries.

It has been almost five months since China formally joined the Greater East Asia War. During this period, the National Government has taken participation in the war as a prerequisite for the establishment and implementation of various political and economic systems and policies. At the same time, Japan is also actively promoting its new policy towards China, strengthening the position of the National Government so that it can fully exert its rights and responsibilities, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the power of coordinated operations. Regarding this point, every member of the alliance on the front line of fighting the enemy and coexisting should understand it, and sincerely abide by and support the policies implemented by their respective governments.

However, let us reflect on whether the government has completed the preparations for the wartime system and policies in Shanghai alone. Whether the people have understood, obeyed, and supported the government's policies. We dare not give a definite answer. The mere fact that "luxury remains as before" is enough to prove that Shanghai is not like a wartime national city, and it is impossible to see that the people have the mood of wartime life. Is this phenomenon ultimately "what the superiors do, the subordinates follow"? Or is it "numbness"? We have no time to make this reckoning. We must be vigilant about the current decisive battle situation. To strive for victory and survival, we must arouse the spirit of regarding yesterday as death and today as life. From now on, we must unite from top to bottom and thoroughly practice wartime life. Especially those in power should take the lead in advocating and setting an example so that they can truly contribute all their human and material resources to the country, truly participate in coordinated operations, and truly obtain national status after victory.

Based on the above arguments, and considering the current actual situation, the obligations that China can fulfill by participating in the war can only extend to the economic aspect. In terms of military affairs, Japan still has to bear the arduous task alone. Therefore, we should do our best to contribute the human and material resources that we can offer in the economic aspect. Here, let us take an example of "human resources exchange" to illustrate:

(1) In order to enrich the materials and tools necessary for the war, it is necessary to increase production efficiency. In addition to making full use of machinery, it is also necessary to use human resources to make up for the deficiencies. This kind of human resources must have appropriate skills and experience to increase work efficiency. For example, transportation tools, such as ships, trains, and automobiles, which are most needed during wartime, are still not enough even with mass production, or the output is reduced due to insufficient steel raw materials. Therefore, wooden boats and wooden-shell vehicles must be manufactured to make up for the deficiencies, and human power must be used to supplement the insufficient mechanical power.

(2) In agriculture, such as the use of new agricultural tools, the improvement of seeds, and the research of cultivation techniques; in mining, such as prospecting, mining, and smelting; in industry, such as saving power and increasing output, scientific and technological guidance and promotion are needed everywhere.

For the above two examples, what China needs is the technical experts that Japan has, as well as the methods of scientific research crystallization; and what Japan needs is the large number of workers that China has, especially skilled workers. In this situation, under the conditions of mutual benefit, "human resources exchange" is needed between each other. China will hire Japanese technical experts to help develop the production of agriculture, mining, and industry. Japan will hire Chinese technicians to help increase the production of essential goods, and the purpose of both parties is the same: to increase wartime resources and strive for victory in the war.

As for the implementation of "human resources exchange", in order to ensure smooth progress and eliminate misunderstandings, the following principles should be observed:

(1) Absolute openness, clearly stating the skill requirements of the personnel needed and the treatment given, so that they can participate voluntarily.

(2) The treatment should include all living expenses of the hired personnel themselves and their families, and should be given real guarantees to ensure that they can serve with peace of mind.

(3) The introduction or recruitment affairs should be handled or presided over by local social justice organizations, which are purely obligatory in nature and do not take intermediary benefits.

In addition, from the standpoint of the Chinese, the "human resources exchange" problem, even if it is not aimed at strengthening the war effort, but only at improving the scientific and technological knowledge of the Chinese people and preparing for the future development of agriculture, industry, and the revitalization of the country, is also extremely worthy of implementation. In recent years, Japan's dedication to scientific and technological research in industry and agriculture, and its pursuit of excellence, have been praised by the world. If the Chinese people can study on the spot, in addition to increasing their skills, they can currently be contributors to the Greater East Asia War, and in the future, they can be industrial warriors to revitalize China. It is truly a win-win situation. At the same time, we can hire Japanese experts to come to China to provide scientific and technological guidance, and its goal is the same as those who go abroad to work. Benefiting oneself and others, why not do it!

### The Russo-Japanese War - A Record from This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago - Old Newspaper Re-transcribed (9)

Introduction

We recognize that defending the Pacific in the future will be the responsibility of all Asians, and that British and American interference and aggression will no longer be allowed. However, completing the task of defense depends on a strong naval force. Our friendly nation Japan has established a navy through decades of hard work and continuous improvement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, it showed its strength by defeating the many with the few. In the current Greater East Asia War, it has demonstrated its invincible power. Currently, the entire defense of the Pacific is the sole responsibility of the friendly navy, and we are deeply ashamed that we have not been able to share the burden. Therefore, how we will take the friendly navy as a model, establish a new Chinese navy, and participate in the task of defending the Pacific is a goal that the Chinese people should strive to achieve together. In order to increase the Chinese people's naval knowledge and interest, this newspaper will re-transcribe the records of the Russo-Japanese War from thirty-eight years ago, from the 21st to the 30th, for a period of ten days. Readers are kindly requested to pay attention.

### Documents on the Surrender of Russian Troops and the Acceptance of Surrender by Japanese Troops (Published in This Newspaper No. 11401, the Fifth Day of the Twelfth Lunar Month of the 30th Year of Guangxu, January 10, 1905 in the Western Calendar, Tuesday)

This newspaper has repeatedly reported on the surrender of the Russian army in Lushun to the Japanese. Now, a friend residing in Tokyo, Japan, has sent a letter saying: On the night of the first day of the first month of Meiji 38, a certain commander of the Lushun political group sent a telegram to the headquarters, mainly stating that at 5 p.m. on this day, a certain Russian military officer submitted a document to a certain commander of the first battalion of our army south of the Shuishiying, and at 9 p.m., it was forwarded to the commander Nogi Maresuke, roughly stating that Your Excellency is well aware of everything that has happened in the area of conflict. Our commander anticipates that further contention with your army in Lushunkou will only damage our military prestige and will be of no benefit. Therefore, we are willing to open our gates and arrange a date for surrender. We believe that Your Excellency shares this view. The specific details of the surrender should be negotiated by designated personnel from our side and personnel sent by your side at a selected location. The situation has reached this point, and there is no other choice. Respectfully submitted, with best regards, from Russian Lieutenant General Stössel to Baron Nogi, Commander of the Besieging Army. The following day, at dawn, Japanese commander Nogi wrote a reply, stating: January 2, 1905, Lushunkou Besieging Army Headquarters, Nogi Maresuke, replies to General Stössel, stating that I agree with Your Excellency on the matter of the surrender of your army and the mutual negotiation of all procedures, and I also feel honored. I am now sending the Chief of Staff of the Lushunkou Besieging Army, Ijichi Kosuke. Please follow the instructions and bring several staff members and attendants to meet with the personnel sent by your army at Shuishiying at noon on January 2, 1905, to negotiate the procedures. The seal will serve as proof of good faith, submitted for approval, and granted full authority to jointly discuss this matter. Respectfully replied, with best regards. This to His Excellency General Stössel, Commander of the Kwantung Fortress.

### Famous General Tan Xin (Published in This Newspaper No. 11398, the Second Day of the Twelfth Lunar Month of the 30th Year of Guangxu, January 7, 1905 in the Western Calendar, Saturday)

Yesterday at noon, this newspaper received a special telegram from a friend in Tokyo, Japan, stating: At 9 a.m. on the 30th day of the 11th lunar month, Nogi Maresuke, the commander of the Japanese Lushun Army, met with Stössel, the surrendered Russian general, at Shuishiying (the place name is not a naval base). Stössel praised the Japanese army for its精悍bravery and courage, and admired General Nogi's extraordinary wisdom and courage, expressing his utmost respect. He also thanked Nogi for forwarding a telegram to the Russian Emperor and for the Japanese Emperor's generous treatment of the surrendered soldiers. Nogi Maresuke recounted that his son Kazuhito was a lieutenant and his son Ishi was a second lieutenant in the army, and both had sacrificed their lives for the country. Stössel could not stop shedding tears, saying: "This is also the glory of parents. General, your reputation is truly world-renowned." After the conversation, Nogi Maresuke invited Stössel and the Japanese and Russian counselors to have lunch at the same table. After the meal, Stössel presented his Arabian horse as a gift, but Nogi Maresuke smiled and declined, saying: "This is also part of the military strength, and I dare not accept it." Stössel insisted, so Nogi accepted it in the name of the army, stating that he would take good care of it in the future and treat the horse as if he were seeing an old friend. At one quarter past one in the afternoon, Stössel bid farewell and returned.

### A Translated Compilation of Victorious Telegrams from the Japanese Navy (Published in This Newspaper No. 11536, the 28th Day of the Fourth Lunar Month of the 31st Year of Guangxu, May 31, 1905 in the Western Calendar, Wednesday)

Another telegram from Tokyo stated that the news of the Japanese navy's victory this afternoon shocked everyone. They were also happy to hear that Japan suffered very little damage. This was an unexpected victory and a special blessing from heaven. The speed of the Japanese ships was superior to that of the Russian ships, and the starlight at night helped the torpedo boats to attack. This morning, the Japanese army continued to pursue the Russian ships. The Russian prisoners captured by the Japanese have landed in Incheon, and some have landed in other parts of Japan in batches. It is said that when the Russian ships approached Vladivostok, they feared that the entire army would be annihilated by the Japanese. The Russian ships participating in this battle numbered 26. Tonight, the price of Japanese national bonds rose sharply, so sales were temporarily suspended.

### Japanese Ambassador Tani Masayuki Talks in Peking - Japan's Fundamental Policy Towards China - Assisting the National Government to Strengthen Thorough Cooperation with China - The Issue of Transferring Taxation Rights is in Active Progress

Peking, 28th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, met with a group of Chinese and foreign reporters here at 5 p.m. on the 28th to explain Japan's fundamental policy towards China, which is centered on assisting the National Government to strengthen its power and thoroughly cooperate with China's national affairs. He also stated that Japan will return taxation rights to China following the recent return of concessions. He said that North China has very close relations with Japan and Manchuria in terms of Chinese national affairs, economy, and geography, and its position is also extremely important. After China's participation in the war, the Japanese government still takes mutual concession between China and Japan as its stance, and deeply knows that it must deeply practice living and dying together to be effective. Therefore, the Japanese government is also actively implementing policies based on morality. It has already implemented the return of concessions, and the issue of transferring taxation rights is also in active progress. In order to implement it as soon as possible, things must be carefully considered in advance. Japan's past diplomacy towards China took the Republic of China as the stage, but in fact, it targeted Britain and the United States. After the Greater East Asia War, the influence of Britain and the United States has been thoroughly cleared, restoring the original position of Japan and China, and efforts can be made to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. If Japan can continue to assist China in both material and spiritual aspects with moral diplomacy, it is certain that the Chinese people will understand the true meaning of the foundation and complete the goal of mutual cooperation.

Peking, 28th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, came to Peking on the 27th to inspect the actual situation in various parts of North China after taking office. At 9 a.m. on the 28th, he went to the Shrine and the Rei-Ansho of the Nishi Hongwanji Temple to pay homage. At 9:50 a.m., he summoned and instructed the ambassadors, consuls, and all staff, and listened to the reports of the heads of various departments on the current situation. At 12:00 p.m., he visited Mr. Okamura, the Supreme Commander of the North China Army, for discussions. He also visited Chairman Zhu of the North China Political Affairs Committee. At 1:00 p.m., Chairman Zhu hosted a banquet at the Political Affairs Committee to entertain Ambassador Tani. After the meeting, he continued to visit the Japanese Embassy, the Naval Attaché's Office, the Manchurian Embassy, and the embassies of Germany, Italy, and France. At 5:00 p.m., he met with Chinese and Japanese reporters at the hotel. That evening, he hosted a banquet to entertain important figures from all walks of life in China, Japan, Manchuria, Germany, and Italy. The guests and hosts were extremely happy, and the banquet did not end until about 9:00 p.m.

### The Japanese Air Force Fiercely Attacks Qianniuling - The Japanese Army in Yichang Launches the Battle to Exit the Mountain

Hankow, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain frontline base of the Japanese army in Central China, after the elite troops of the Japanese infantry began to attack the three divisions of the Chongqing River Defense Army stationed southwest of Yichang on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, they have now completely surrounded them. The Japanese air force also cooperated with the ground troops and bombed the Chongqing army, which was stubbornly resisting by holding Qianniuling (20 kilometers west of Yichang), on the 28th, and used machine guns to sweep them, causing them to fall into chaos. At the same time, they also attacked the Chongqing army that was trying to escape the encirclement, making their attempts futile. At that time, a large formation of the Chongqing army was found gathering near Zhoujiakou Muqiaoxi, 15 kilometers northwest of Changyang. They were immediately bombed to annihilation.

Hankow, 28th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army surrounded the 30,000 soldiers of the three divisions of the Chongqing River Defense Army, who were relying on the steep mountains of the Bashan Mountains, and captured Yutaishan and Luojiaba, two key points near Yichang, they completed the posture of controlling the Yichang Gorge. The Japanese army is still engaged in mountain warfare in various places, and the posture of attacking the interior of Chongqing is also ready. Originally, the Japanese army was preparing to attack Changde, the base of the Sixth War Zone of Chongqing, but it suddenly turned to attack the front of Yichang, exerting the power of mechanized unit operations. This was unexpected by the Chongqing army. The Japanese army immediately eliminated the resistance of the Chongqing army and advanced forward. The only natural and steep passes that the Chongqing army relied on had no effect in the face of the Japanese army's fierce attack. The people in the Mou area have been able to live and work in peace since the arrival of the Japanese army, which has a profound impact on the people under the rule of Chongqing. In order to reverse the decline, Chongqing dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle, but in the end, it failed to stop the Japanese army. In an instant, the Japanese army seized the important defense line connecting Changyang, Yuyangguan, Yutaishan, and Yichang Gorge and secured it. The Japanese army is now preparing to launch a fierce attack on the heart of Chongqing.

Hankow, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain area of the Japanese army in the Yangtze River Basin, since the Japanese army launched a summer offensive against the "Sixth War Zone" of Chongqing in the Yichang area, it has dealt a major blow to the Chongqing army. The Japanese naval forces also intercepted many British and American ships in the upper reaches of Yichang and then returned to defense leisurely. Chongqing was very embarrassed by this. The enemy ships intercepted this time included Chihe, Shashi, Xianghua and other ships, as well as small oil tanker barges, passenger ships, tugboats, small steamers, and floating docks, totaling 52 ships.

### The Japanese Army in China's Weekly War Situation

Nanking, 28th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Expeditionary Army in China issued a weekly war situation report on the 28th, stating: After the Japanese army determined the so-called "Hunan Grain Area on the North Bank of Dongting Lake," the elite troops of the land and air forces urgently pursued the remnants of the enemy in order to completely annihilate them, and at the same time launched new actions. Yuyangguan, according to the local area, is the first gateway of the Sixth War Zone of Chongqing and an important supply base. It has completely occupied Changyang, the stronghold of the 86th Division of Chongqing. The war is continuing to expand. Recently, the internal combat power of the Chongqing army has been so low that it cannot be recovered. It can be seen from this operation that there is no quick connection between the Chongqing armies. Under the fierce attack of the Japanese elite troops, they collapse everywhere and at any time. This proves that the Chongqing army's combat power is declining and the anti-war atmosphere among the soldiers is strong. In this operation, Zou Pingfan's army of the National Government has always cooperated and defeated the stubborn enemy. At noon on the 22nd, it completely occupied Yidu, the stronghold of the 185th Division of Chongqing. In North China, 1,500 members of Yang Youbo's troops were completely disarmed. General Wu Huawen's elite troops of the Shandong Army of the National Government and other returning troops all participated and actively played a role in crushing the Chongqing army's operations, achieving great results. The Taihang Mountain operation in North China this spring has completely annihilated the communist army in the area south of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway, achieving great results. It was ended on the 20th of this month. The army aviation unit has closely cooperated with the ground troops in various places for many days, and has bombed Hengyang twice and raided the Chongqing military facilities in Jianou.

### Peking-Hankow-Shanghai Wireless Telephone - To Begin Operations on June 1st

Nanking, 28th (Central News Agency) The wireless communication telephone in Central China was previously prepared by the Central China Electrical Communications Company. Recently, it has been completed, and it is scheduled to begin wireless telephone communication between the three special cities of Shanghai, Nanking, and Hankow on June 1st. It is reported that in order to facilitate the general public, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have decided to adopt a permission-to-talk system, and the language is limited to both languages (Peking dialect and Japanese). However, the content of the conversation must not involve military and economic matters, or reveal other unfavorable matters. If unstable conversations are found, it will be decided to prohibit its use at any time. The issuance of this public conversation has a great relationship with urban construction and even transportation. The opening of the three special cities of Peking, Shanghai, and Hankow will greatly benefit official and civilian enterprises.

### The Restoration of the Yuyao Salt Field

The Yuyao Purge Work has made significant progress. The procurement agencies for Yuyao salt have also been unified, thus sealing off the smuggling routes to Chongqing. Since the start of the Purge Work, the salt extraction policy and the work to stabilize people's livelihoods have been actively promoted, so the salt administration has been unified to achieve the goal. Recently, the Guohua Salt Industry Company took over the business agencies of the former Dacheng Salt Industry Company (Ningbo, Yuyao, Jinhua, Cixi) and will set up sales offices in Xiaoshan and Shaoxing. In addition, decisions have been made on the purchase price, storage methods, and removal methods. For the sake of benefiting the salt workers, it has been decided to increase the purchase price. The original price was eight yuan, but it will be doubled in the future (i.e., sixteen yuan per dan). The salt workers and Baozhang will transfer it to the Zhejiang East Salt Affairs Administration, and then the storage price will be determined. The total production in the area is 3 million dan, which is sufficient for the needs of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Yuyao was originally one of the three major salt fields in China. (May 28, Dalu News)

### Intense Land and Air Battles Resume in the Small Strip of Land on the Eastern Wing of the Kuban. The German Army Repels a Large-Scale Soviet Offensive. Fierce Fighting Also Occurs on the Central and Northern Fronts.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 28th (Central News Agency) – After a quiet spring on the Eastern Front, the first major battle occurred yesterday in the Kuban River area. At that time, more than ten Soviet divisions, covered by aircraft and tanks, launched a major offensive against the German troops near Krymskaya. According to the German war report, the Red Army's offensive was resisted after fierce fighting. The tactics used in this battle were similar to those used in the last World War, with the German troops holding their positions in trenches and the Red Army bombarding them with artillery before attacking. The German troops then retreated to their rear positions, the first line of which was only defended by machine guns and

artillery. As the Soviet infantry rushed in, they fell into this network of fire. Although the German side stated that this offensive had been broken, the Red Army still had the appearance of repeating, and the German war report did not mention the number of Red Army casualties, indicating that the battle was still ongoing. There were no battles in other areas, and both sides were still actively arranging their positions.

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to front-line news, the Soviet troops in the Kuban bridgehead first launched a fierce artillery and air attack on the 26th as a prelude to the offensive, and then launched a large-scale offensive against German positions with six infantry divisions and three tank divisions in the area between Verkhnebakansky and Krymsk. However, they have now been completely repelled by the German army. Fierce artillery battles also occurred between German and Soviet forces on the Leningrad front on the 26th.

In the southern area of ​​the central front, Soviet forces also began an offensive against German positions. Although Soviet forces penetrated German positions in several places, they were eventually annihilated by the German army.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to a phone call from Osaka, Lieutenant Colonel Goro Takase of the Naval Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of the Navy gave a lecture at the Osaka Seikyo Society on the 27th, entitled "The Current Stage of the Pacific War," which lasted for an hour and a half. During the lecture, he specifically discussed the battle of Attu Island as follows: Since the beginning of this year, the US military has begun to move restlessly in the Aleutian Islands, and has gradually become more active. We are closely watching. The US military did use a fleet composed of battleships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, cruisers, etc., to attempt to land on Attu Island. The Japanese ground forces are now bravely fighting with a small number of troops, or conducting night raids to force the enemy to the coast. Although the Japanese soldiers are suffering great hardships, they are all fighting bravely. With the recent cooperation of the air force and warships, our morale is even stronger. We are now steadily expanding the battle results. We hope that the people can rest assured and not worry about the situation in that area in the future.

### Japanese Government Decides to Request Convening of Extraordinary Diet; Session to Begin on June 15th and Last Three Days

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 0:30 PM on the 28th that the Japanese government held a cabinet meeting on the 28th and decided to request the convening of an extraordinary session of the Diet. The session will begin on June 15th and last for three days. The purpose is to request support for special urgent budget proposals and legal bills related to the current situation. At the same time, the government will take this opportunity to clarify its belief in promoting national policy at home and abroad. The cases scheduled to be submitted are as follows: (1) Budget proposals: A. Proposal to increase the purchase price of rice; B. Proposal for emergency food production increase; C. Proposal for enterprise consolidation. (2) Legal bills: A. Bond Act related to the budget proposal; B. Special Accounting Act related to the budget proposal; C. Revised National Regeneration Fund Act; D. Legal bill on enterprise consolidation funding measures. For the cases submitted to the extraordinary Diet, it was decided to consolidate the outline of enterprise consolidation on June 4th and consolidate the budget proposal and legal bills on June 11th.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in order to establish a decisive situation internally and externally, the Japanese government has urgently sought to promote the domestic situation centered on the five major ultra-priority industries, and externally promote cooperative relations with China, Manchukuo, and Thailand, and promote the construction of Myanmar, the Philippines, and other military and political regions within the Co-Prosperity Sphere. All these measures have been successful in the past. In order to achieve a rapid increase in war materials, it has decided to strengthen the domestic production mechanism and provide emergency consolidation to various enterprises. Regarding these points to be consolidated, the Planning Board has previously formulated relevant legal bills and budget proposals, separately by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Finance, and other relevant ministries. Now they are largely completed. In order to request the support of the Japanese Diet, it has been decided to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet on June 13th, with a three-day agenda, to review the cases. The characteristics of this extraordinary Diet can be roughly divided into two. First, in order to smoothly promote the eight major national plans for the 18th year of Showa that were previously decided (especially to ensure the increased production of iron, coal, aircraft, ships, and light metals, the five major ultra-priority industries), the enterprise facilities that are not particularly related to the enhancement of combat capabilities will be shifted to these priority industries in order to form a broad decisive production mechanism. Second, in order to ensure the main food supply for the nation during wartime, on the other hand, the government will take this opportunity to declare its belief in national policy at home and abroad. Therefore, the Prime Minister Tojo's speech at that time is worth noting. This extraordinary Diet, in form, is to submit the legal bills for consolidating the domestic system to the Diet for deliberation, but the government's major statements on domestic and foreign policies are indeed worthy of expectation.

### Rear Admiral Sanbei Sadamitsu Publishes History of Japanese Aircraft Carrier Development

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – Former Commander of the Naval Air Force, Rear Admiral Sadamitsu Sanbei, published an article on Naval Memorial Day on the 27th entitled "History of Japanese Aircraft Carrier Development." The historical process is worth referring to. The following is a record:

"Converting Merchant Ships into Aircraft Carriers" - The creation of new aircraft carriers was only 30 years ago, in Taisho 2 (1913). At that time, in order to further utilize the reconnaissance power of aircraft for naval combat, it was started to convert merchant ships to carry aircraft, which was the initial stage of the creation of aircraft carriers. Various naval powers in the world began to study aircraft carriers at this time. Japan also first converted the merchant ship "Wakamiya" into a seaplane carrier in Taisho 2 to carry Curtiss and Farman seaplane reconnaissance aircraft. The ship participated in the Qingdao battle in the following year and exerted its power. At that time, the total number of aircraft was only twelve, and the number of crew members was only fifteen. Comparing this with the strength of the Japanese naval air force today, there is a great sense of difference between the past and the present.

"Research on Carrying Land-Based Aircraft" - Research on aircraft has made great progress after World War I. It is not only used for reconnaissance, but also shows its unique power in attack. Therefore, the idea of ​​carrying fast and powerful land-based aircraft on ships so that they can take off and land anytime and anywhere in the ocean has attracted the attention of various countries. Based on this requirement, Japan also began to further study seaplane carriers. In December of Taisho 8, construction of the "Hosho" was started, and it was completed in December of Taisho 11. However, because the ship's tonnage was only 9,500 tons, its speed was only 25 knots, and the ship was only 55 meters long and 15 meters wide, it was quite difficult for aircraft to take off and land on this deck. After two years of various experiments and careful training and guidance of operators, it was incorporated into the fleet in Taisho 13. At this point, the Japanese Navy officially had an aircraft carrier (converting battleships into aircraft carriers). The construction of the "Akagi" and "Kaga" began in December of Taisho 9, and their conversion into aircraft carriers was in March of Showa 2, which took five years and four months to complete. The reason why the cruiser "Kaga" and the battleship "Akagi" were quickly converted into aircraft carriers was because the main battleships were restricted as a result of the arms reduction conference and had to be abandoned. At that time, countries were secretly researching the construction of aircraft carriers and carefully studied them. Therefore, the conversion of the "Akagi" and "Kaga" was repeatedly improved and redesigned based on the actual combat experience of the "Hosho," so it took a long time. The two aircraft carriers were incorporated into the fleet in Showa 3. Since then, the Japanese Navy has also been able to use aircraft for combat and conduct formal training.

"Unique Tactics of Japanese Aircraft Carriers" - The 5:5:3 ratio of the arms reduction conference also applied to aircraft carriers. Therefore, the British and American aircraft carriers had 135,000 tons, and Japan had 81,000 tons. Within this limit, new aircraft carriers were built and divided into two types: large and small. Large ones had fewer ships, and small ones had more ships. As a result, the United States adopted the large aircraft carrier form of 20,000 tons, and Japan adopted the small Soryu-type form of 10,000 tons in order to use this to confront the United States. From then on, the "Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday" of aviation began. The technical director of the Aviation Headquarters at that time was the late Admiral Yamamoto. The department also worked hard to improve the handling technology of aircraft carriers and aircraft, and the manufacturing technology of carrier-based aircraft under the command of Admiral Yamamoto. Before the start of this war, our technology and training can be said to have reached the highest level.

"Anecdote About Abolishing Aircraft Carriers" - During the London arms reduction conference, there was once a proposal to abolish aircraft carriers. However, the United States was the first to object. Its intention was nothing more than to allow its aircraft carriers, which were superior to Japan's, to go far into the Pacific Ocean to engage in offensive operations, but they did not expect that they would be wiped out by the Japanese aircraft carriers in one fell swoop.

### Washington Conference Concludes; Churchill Will Issue Detailed Report After Returning Home; Davies Carries Stalin's Long Letter Back to the United States

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to Washington sources, the White House issued a communique regarding the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, stating only that complete agreement had been reached. Therefore, those in the Allied camp who had hoped to glean the future course of Allied operations from the announcement were disappointed. The White House announcement said only: "The joint chiefs of staff meeting recently held in Washington has ended, and complete agreement has been reached on future operations on all fronts." President Roosevelt's secretary, O'Reilly, told the press last night at the White House after reading the communique: "I can only tell you this much." According to Reuters, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill had originally planned to jointly issue a statement, but later decided to issue the brief announcement in Roosevelt's name. It is not known whether Churchill had seen the announcement before it was released. O'Reilly said: The Allied leaders decided on this new approach at the last minute yesterday.

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Haitong News Agency) – Well-informed political figures in London said yesterday that after returning home from Washington, British Prime Minister Churchill will issue a detailed account of the Washington talks. The British House of Commons will then hold a three-day debate.

Moscow, 28th (Central News Agency) – Stalin handed a long letter to Roosevelt, written in Russian, to Ambassador Davies on the night of the 26th. Davies then departed from Moscow and headed back to Washington with the letter.

### Admiral Yamamoto, Though Dead, Still Lives

— Tokutomi Iichiro

When a general star falls from the sky, everyone in the world is shocked. If you say it's an accident, then it's a real accident. Since the issuance of the declaration of war against Britain and the United States on December 8th of Showa 16, Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto of the Combined Fleet has been the most meritorious among the heroes of the Japanese army, navy, and air force. Since the world-shocking attack on Pearl Harbor, his operations have become more and more brilliant, and his great achievements are unparalleled in the history of naval warfare in the world, ancient and modern. Relying on the heavenly power of His Majesty the Emperor and the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers, the leader was Yamamoto Isoroku himself. Even if you say that Yamamoto Isoroku is the number one hero in the Greater East Asia War, it is not an exaggeration.

Now he has unfortunately died in battle. However, his death in battle is neither Zhuge Kongming's Autumn Wind Wuzhangyuan, nor Kusunoki Masashige's Minatogawa. If you want to find an example, Nelson's death in the Battle of Trafalgar is comparable. That is to gain victory with death. Moreover, he not only gained victory, but we believe that Yamamoto Isoroku will forever be a great military god of Japan, taking on the new task of comprehensively guarding the prestige of the Japanese nation in the Pacific.

Commander Yamamoto was full of fighting spirit, courageous, full of pearls, resourceful, and consistently upheld the Japanese spirit. His ancestor Yamakawa took a sword in the army of Kitaetsu and fought hard with the help of Kawai Tsugunosuke. Although his sword was broken and his ammunition was exhausted, he finally remained unyielding and died calmly. Compared with his ancestor, Yamamoto Isoroku's death is a thousand times more glorious and also an effective death. His death can be said to be dying in the right place.

In the Japanese Navy, there are many talented people. With the loss of one Yamamoto Isoroku, there are many more Yamamoto Isoroku. We will never suffer because there is no successor. In the life of all mankind, no one has accomplished such great feats in such a short time as Yamamoto. From this point of view, he can also close his eyes in peace in the underworld. He left the stage of the real world to others, and he himself became a hero in the ghost world, a military god. For the sake of Japan, he is the guardian god in the Pacific Ocean—including the Indian Ocean. He was given special grace, listed in the Marshal's Mansion, awarded the First Class Golden Kite Medal, and given a state funeral. His posthumous glory can be described as the utmost. If some of us are disappointed and frustrated by his death, it is definitely not the attitude we should have to comfort his heroic spirit. If we want to express our sincere condolences to him, we should ignite the spirit of battle even more fiercely and move forward on the road to defeating Britain and the United States.

Yamamoto Isoroku is dead. But his death is the death of a man. If he is a military god, he is still alive. He lives like Kusunoki Masashige, like Marshal Togo. His spirit will never be buried in the sea. Under the new commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, we will see the unfolding of a new situation. (Sho: Eki 5, Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, 23rd)

### Sea Battle of Japan and Pacific Naval Warfare

— Kento Tominaga

(4) Lessons for Modern Naval Warfare Tactics

The Sea Battle of Japan was the first modern naval battle, and its influence on modern naval warfare was extremely significant.

Modern warfare absolutely requires the support of the entire nation and tends towards total war. It can be said that the Russo-Japanese War initiated this.

Secondly, the Russo-Japanese War proved that the Japanese Navy was a decisive factor in maintaining peace in the Far East.

In terms of armaments and weaponry, the success or failure of a naval battle is determined by the size of the forces participating in the decisive battle, which was also proven in this war. This became a strong foundation for the later 5:5:3 ratio. In other words, whether or not an attack can be launched does not depend on the distance between the two countries, but rather on the size of the possessions. The length of the coastline and the breadth of the security area are not the basis for determining the size of the possessions. A nation's holdings are equal to its decisive battle force.

Furthermore, due to this astonishing victory, the single-minded focus on giant guns became fashionable among the naval powers after the war, further stimulating the tendency to engage in decisive battles with main guns, resulting in the era of the "Dreadnought" class battleships. The structure of the ships also changed accordingly, with emphasis on defense and increased bullet resistance. At the same time, shells were improved, and the range of artillery battles was extended to counter them, resulting in a major change in naval warfare tactics.

(5) The Sea Battle of Japan and the Greater East Asia Naval Warfare

Comparing the Sea Battle of Japan thirty-eight years ago with the current Greater East Asia Naval Warfare, it is extremely difficult to compare them in terms of scale and size of the battlefield, the degree of advancement of weapons, especially the active role of new weapons, and the changes in tactics. There are differences, and also many common points and similarities.

The vastness of the battlefield is one of the characteristics of naval warfare. In the case of the Sea Battle of Japan, the battlefield can be said to be almost limited to the Sea of Japan.

The enemy's Pacific Fleet, with Vladivostok or Port Arthur as its base, was only used to threaten the transport of troops. Even if they moved to the Pacific, they only cruised around the east coast of Japan. Although there was reinforcement from the Baltic Fleet, its purpose was only to merge with the remaining fleet in Vladivostok, so its operational range never exceeded the Sea of Japan.

However, this time the operational sea extends from Hawaii in the east, and the American continents, to the east coast, south to Madagascar Island, and north to the Aleutian Islands. Moreover, the Pacific and Indian Oceans, more than half of the earth's sea surface, have become battlefields. From the point of view of the extent, there is a real difference like heaven and earth.

The degree of difference in the advancement of weapons is also incomparable. First, take the increase in ship type as an example: the flagship Mikasa was already considered the strongest and largest warship in the Japanese Navy at the time, but its displacement was only 15,200 tons, and its main gun was 12 inches. The current 35,000-ton capital ships carry 16-inch guns on the bow and stern lines, which is like a pygmy seeing a giant when compared to the past. The increase in range and the improvement of gunpowder also represent significant progress.

The development of shipbuilding and armament technology, as well as popular weapons such as torpedoes and electric machinery, has resulted in extraordinary progress in defensive and offensive capabilities.

The most significant change is the development of new weapons, especially aircraft and submarines, and the resulting three-dimensionalization of tactics.

As a result, naval warfare tactics have undergone a fundamental transformation. The naval battles in the Russo-Japanese War, after the two naval battles of the Meiji 37th year—the Yellow Sea Battle and the Battle of Ulsan—were fought in one battle in Japan. In this war, starting with the naval battles of Hawaii and Malaysia at the beginning of the war, through more than a dozen large and small decisive naval battles, the total tonnage sunk has already tripled that of the Baltic Fleet. Although the US Navy has suffered such losses, it cannot be said that it is still intact, but it has not yet been subdued.

At least before World War I, naval vessels, as the main weapons, were not only extremely valuable, but their construction and replenishment also required a lot of materials and time. Once defeated in a decisive battle involving the concentration of all forces, it would be difficult to recover the strength in the shortest period of time. On the contrary, the emergence of air power, which can be replenished in large quantities in a short period of time, has endowed the content of naval decisive battles with the character of an astonishing supply battle, enabling continuous decisive battles.

The Russo-Japanese Naval Battle elevated the entire possession of military strength to the position of decisive battle strength. Now, the possession of military strength is naturally still necessary, but in the near future, the possession of military strength must also be considered as decisive battle strength. That limit is the national power of all departments.

However, on the other hand, it is now impossible to lie dormant in heavily guarded ports as fortress fleets or standby fleets to preserve their strength, as was possible in the past—for example, the Port Arthur Fleet.

That is the characteristic of modern naval warfare that seeks to resolve the difficulty of forced decisive battles by air attacks, and at the same time, it can be said to be the contradiction of a quick battle and a quick decision.

So, will the Sea Battle of Japan, which decisively determined Japan's fate in one fell swoop, not be seen in the Pacific Naval Warfare? (翔: From "Modern" May)

### Actual Transactions in North and Central China are Settled in Three Ways

(1) Reserve Note Exchange (2) Special Yen Exchange and (3) Imports and Exports Without Exchange

According to sources, actual transactions between North and Central China will be implemented as soon as the authorities' consultations are completed. The settlement of transactions is divided into three types: Reserve Note Exchange, Special Yen Exchange, and No Exchange. (1) Reserve Note Exchange (presumably 18 Federal Reserve Notes equal 100 Reserve Notes). The export items from North China are coal, asbestos, iron, salt, alkali, lime, gypsum, walnuts, charcoal, anhydrous sesame, sodium nitrate, sodium sulfide, and glass plates. The import items are wheat, sulfurized river ammonia, gauze, etc. (2) Special Yen Exchange. The export items include (A) exports exchanged for reserve notes, (B) iron sulfide ore, heavy nitrate, refractory bricks, refractory mortar, pottery, various rubber products, peanuts, raw oil, sesame, kidney beans, soybeans, eggs, salt, and dried fish. (C) Soap, raw lacquer, and other commodities deemed not directly related to export. The import items are soybean cake, thin paper, sugar, cloth rolls, flannel, silk, cotton cloth machines, mechanical equipment parts, alum, zinc oxide, dyes, paints, industrial chemicals, buffalo hides, printing ink, cloth products, silk fabrics, rayon fabrics, plush, wool fabrics, tea, stationery, automobiles, and spare parts. (3) The export items without exchange are the same as those for special yen exchange. The import items include (A) imports exchanged for reserve notes. (B) From soybean cake to printing ink in the imports exchanged for special yen. (C) Luxury goods and other items unsuitable for import.

### Newly Revised Timetable for the Two Routes in Southern Sichuan

The management offices of the Upper Sichuan and Upper Southern routes, together with the Shanghai Special Municipality Ferry Company, have revised the old timetable to facilitate passengers and facilitate connections. It is reported that it will be implemented from June 1st. At the same time, the management offices of the two routes have also moved up and delayed the morning and evening departures on the Upper Southern route due to the summer season and longer days, in order to provide passengers with full convenience. The implementation date is also set to begin on June 1st. The departing trips from Qingningsi are three times a day: 9:45 am, 2:00 pm, and 6:20 pm. The departing trips from Jiangzhen are three times a day: 7:00 am, 11:55 am, and 4:05 pm.

Fare and Passenger Limit for Rowing Boats

The Municipal Public Utility Bureau has recently observed that rowing boats and sampans carrying passengers to and from various docks on the Huangpu River often do not comply with regulations regarding fares and the number of passengers, which has been criticized by travelers, especially at the Qingningsi to Guangxin Road dock. Because the last train on the Upper Sichuan Railway arrives at Qingningsi Station when the last ferry has already departed, passengers have to take sampans or rowing boats across the river. Generally, cunning boatmen take advantage of this opportunity to demand exorbitant fares and disregard passenger safety by carrying more passengers than allowed. It is deemed necessary to take action to address this issue. Therefore, it is hereby announced that the fare for sampans and rowing boats between Guangxin Pier and Qingningsi is two yuan per person, and the number of passengers shall not exceed five for sampans and eight for rowing boats. Water inspectors will be dispatched to Qingningsi and various docks at any time to inspect, manage, and ensure safety.

### Central China Tobacco Distribution, Sixth Phase Begins Picking Up Goods, Eliminate Black Market and Prevent Resale, Yellow Plum Season Approaching Affects Stockpiling

The Central China Tobacco Distribution Association, in order to fully distribute cigarettes to meet legitimate needs, stipulates that goods will be dispatched three times a month, on the 5th, 15th, and 25th, according to A, B, C, and D cargo cards, using a 1-2-4-8 system for dispatching goods. The goods dispatched are limited to wholesale and retail merchants, who must sell them equally in ten days, and hoarding and refusal to sell are absolutely prohibited. Recently, the sixth phase of cargo dispatch has notified wholesale and retail merchants to pay and pick up goods. Most of the cigarettes are from the military-managed Gu Zhong Company and the Japanese-owned China Tobacco Company. It is stipulated that the value of D cargo cards is 3,000 yuan, and the values of C, B, and A increase proportionally. In recent days, due to full distribution and the upcoming yellow plum season, as well as the successive dispatch of goods in various parts of Central China, reselling is no longer profitable. Households are afraid of mold and dare not hoard too much, resulting in a sharp drop in black market prices, and few entrants. The market is trending towards oversupply. Therefore, the black market price is almost the same as the limited price. It is easier for general buyers to buy limited-price cigarettes than before. However, the trend of queuing up for cigarettes has not been curbed. As for (1) retail merchants applying for upgrades, and (2) new tobacco merchants applying for registration and distribution, the association has dispatched personnel to investigate separately. Once approved, they will be processed. It is also reported that the deadline for new tobacco firms requesting cargo distribution is May 1st, and new requests have been temporarily closed.

### The Newspaper Prepares for Next Term Scholarship

The newspaper's scholarship has been supported by donations from all walks of life in the past, enabling poor students to have the opportunity to continue their studies, which has greatly enhanced the glory of education in Shanghai. Now that the summer vacation is approaching, the scholarship matters for the next semester should be prepared in advance. We are grateful for the daily assistance from all parties, but the tuition fees for the next semester, in terms of the current standard of living, are very different from the past, and a large amount of money will be needed. We dare to ask enthusiastic people in the community to think of the situation of these diligent young people, generously donate, so that they can barely overcome the difficulties, which is also the blessing of society.

### Scholarship Donor Titles

The scholarship received yesterday included 500 yuan from Jinshengchang Company, 500 yuan from Jin Jiqiu, 100 yuan from Qian Yintang, 40 yuan from Zhu Gengliang, 30 yuan from Mr. Li, and 10 yuan each from Zheng Shencheng, Zhu Zhenhuan, and Pu Qiting (in memory of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Shengxin Elementary School). A total of 1,200 yuan in reserve notes was received. The remaining balance is 362,805 yuan and 59 cents.

### The City Tightens Security for Tomorrow's May 30th Anniversary

Tomorrow (30th) is the local anniversary of the city. The Municipal Police Bureau and the police authorities of the two concessions have begun to tighten security this morning, dispatching all police officers to work in shifts. Patrol teams and security teams are dispatched to patrol the secluded areas within their respective jurisdictions, and search pedestrians. Those with suspicious appearances must be strictly interrogated and their citizen certificates or residence permits must be checked. Therefore, citizens must carry their citizen certificates with them when going out for inspection. The Japanese military authorities also assisted the police authorities in searching public places such as hotels.

### The Municipal Welfare Association Welcomes Ambassador Sawada

Former Ambassador Sawada to France, accompanied by Minister Yui, flew from Tokyo to Shanghai on the 25th, and will go to Hankou, Nanjing, and then north to inspect. In order to express welcome, the Municipal Welfare Association, at the same time, because Counselor Nakamura of the embassy was recently honorably transferred to the position of Minister to Finland, and will return to the country to take office soon, the association expressed farewell, and held a tea party at the Kangle Hotel at 4:30 pm yesterday (28th), and invited people from the city's industrial, commercial, and journalistic circles to participate. The guests included Ambassador Sawada, Minister Yui, Minister Nakamura, and on the side of the guest country, Embassy General Manager Okazaki, Secretary-General Honno, Consul Nakata, Consul Iwai, Tatsichiro Iwata, Kiyoshi Iwamoto, and Masao Kawasaki, etc. On the Chinese side, Zhang Yipeng, Wu Kaisheng, Chen Shao-wei, Ding Fubao, Xiang Kangyuan, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Su Xiwu, Wang Boyuan, Chen Qiushi, Tan Shuzhan, Yu Zhongxian, Xu Shihua, Cheng Zhongquan, and Shen Guanzhun, Tang Jusheng, etc., were chaired by Lin Kanghou.

Lin Kanghou's Speech

Ambassador Sawada, Minister Yui, Minister Nakamura, distinguished guests, we are deeply honored to have the presence of the guests of honor and distinguished guests today. We know that Ambassador Sawada, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and Ambassador Tani to China are very close friends, and they are all outstanding talents in the Japanese diplomatic circle. This time, accompanying Minister Yui to China for inspection, we hope that the ambassador will observe and listen to the intentions of the Chinese people, and bring this intention back to Japan, as the main basis for Japan's future policy of cooperation with China. This policy is the most practical cooperation policy. The Shanghai Municipal Welfare Association represents the Shanghai citizens in seeking welfare, and it is also an institution for citizens to express their intentions. The significance of today's meeting is just this. We have heard that Ambassador Sawada's elder brother has also served as an ambassador, and it is very rare for both brothers to be ambassadors, and the faces of the brothers are very similar, and it is easy to be mistaken, which is a beautiful story in the international diplomatic circle. We hope that after the ambassador returns to China after the inspection, he will convey the intentions of the Chinese people to the Tokyo authorities, and the friendly relations between China and Japan will be further advanced from now on. And the brothers' ambassadors more symbolize that China and Japan become the two major countries of brothers in East Asia, and cooperate to undertake the same mission, which will be regarded as a permanent beautiful story in later history, and Ambassador Sawada will surely be happy to work hard. Mr. Nakamura has been stationed in China for many years, and he is a friend of China. In recent years, he has devoted much effort to the friendship between China and Japan. Now that he has been honorably transferred to the position of Minister to Finland, we hope that even though the Minister is away from China, he will continue to care about and cooperate with the friendly relations between China and Japan. We sincerely welcome and bid farewell, and wish you all success in your work and good health. Then Ambassador Sawada and Mr. Zhang Yipeng delivered speeches, and the meeting was adjourned at 6:30 pm.

### Industrial and Commercial Circles Collectively Solicit Donations to Relieve the Disaster in North China, Calligraphers and Collectors Promote Charity Sales to Help Relieve Disaster

Since the mobilization of donations for disaster relief in North China, the response from all parties has been increasingly enthusiastic. Various groups and schools have launched collective fundraising, accumulating small amounts into large amounts, which is exemplary. It is hoped that industry leaders will rise to the occasion and join in the good deeds. The newspaper's donation collection has now reached more than 200,000 yuan, but the disaster area is vast and the needs are huge. A drop in the bucket is difficult to solve the problem. I dare to ask all sectors to assist as soon as possible. The workers and other employees of various factories, in accordance with the duty of mutual assistance among human beings, are requested to collect and submit the information to the newspaper for collection and disclosure. Yesterday, we received a letter from the workers of Yufeng Yarn Factory, saying that Shanghai is not lacking in wealthy magnates, and it seems that they have not fully responded to the newspaper's call. Otherwise, with a simple effort, it would not be difficult to collect a huge amount of money, etc. We are deeply disturbed by this. Now, North China is in desperate need of rescue. I believe that the magnates in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles will be able to make a high call and appeal for the people in distress.

Military Amateur Team Comes to Shanghai for Charity Matches

The Nanjing Military Amateur Basketball Team, in order to seek relief for the disaster-stricken compatriots in North China, has specially organized a team to come to Shanghai to conduct friendly matches with Shanghai's strong teams, Xingren, Hualian, and Xilian. The dates are set for three days, June 5th, 6th, and 7th. All ticket income will be used to relieve the urgent disaster in North China in order to fulfill the meaning of disaster relief. It is reported that this move has been negotiated and organized by the city's Education Bureau.

Zhang Zhongyuan's Fan Surface Helps Disaster Relief

Yesterday, we received a letter from calligrapher Zhang Zhongyuan, which roughly stated that in view of the severity of the disaster in North China, starting from today, he will specially order Luoyang fans, each single-sided fan for 100 yuan, and double-sided fan for 200 yuan, temporarily limited to 500 fans (public collection of pieces for seven days). The fees and the names of the consigners will be sent to the newspaper for transfer to the North China Disaster Relief Association (the donation receipt will be given to the consigner separately). Collection points: (1) Dahuaxu Company, 2nd Floor, 7 The Bund, (2) Zhang Wanli Wood Company, 77 Zhili Road, (3) Haiyuan Daguan Art Garden, Haige Road. Mr. Zhang is righteous and public-spirited, which is a model to be emulated.

Charity Sale of Han Qi's Relics

Mr. Meng Wangqu of the Southeast Trust Company, 34 Aiduya Road, wrote: "Recently, I found a painting by Six Boat Monk, Song Dynasty, a hall in Lingyan Temple, with inscriptions by various people from the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods. After investigation, this cliff has been missing for a long time, and the Six Boat rubbings have long become orphans in the country. Now, I have set an initial value of 5,000 yuan for charity sales, and all the proceeds will be used to relieve the disaster, so as to fulfill my wish to help." The enthusiastic good deeds are worthy of admiration. I still hope that philanthropists and lovers of antiquities will go to negotiate directly.

The impression was very satisfactory. He arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 7:20 am yesterday. He will stay in Shanghai for about ten days.

During this period, he stayed in Batavia, Java, for the longest time. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, he was still residing in Batavia. It is reported that he has now safely arrived in Shanghai after traveling tens of thousands of miles.

### Su Yizhi's Teacher's Corpse is Dissected for Autopsy

Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Shengxin Elementary School, 393 Pingliang Road, was punishing a student, Liu Zhijun, for violating school rules. Liu's mother, a woman from Anhui named Liu Wang, insulted Su, and Su died as a result. The police sent Liu Wang to the First Special Court and requested her detention, and sent Su's body to the coroner's office. After the prosecutor of the First Special Court and forensic doctor Hou Guangdi examined the body, Hou conducted a re-autopsy on the 28th of the month, and took out Su's internal organs, etc., and sent them to the Public Works Department's Health Office for chemical examination. Because the procedure for this chemical examination is complicated, the results of the chemical examination will not be clear until a week later.

### Dongye Chuanqi, Yuan Sheng Feng Ji Guan, Arrives in Shanghai

Dongye Chuanqi, specially appointed by the National Government as the Yuan Sheng Feng Si Guan (Official in Charge of Sacrifices to Confucius), arrived in Shanghai after completing his official duties in Nanjing.

Japan has grown strong by adhering to Confucianism, and the revival of our motherland, as well as the cultural development of Greater East Asia, should also be based on it. It is said that Mr. Dongye's visit is for sightseeing and visiting local literati, and he will return to his residence in Qufu on June 1st to preside over the upper and lower sacrificial ceremonies of the fifth month of the lunar calendar.

### Stevedores at Qiujiang Wharf Embezzle Huge Sums, Ordered to Mediate

Lin Qingyuan, the nephew of former Jiangsu High Court President Lin Biao, recently contracted for the loading and unloading of imported goods at the Hongkou Qiujiang Wharf. The workers were hired by Lin through Fang Derong, Zhang Zhaorong, Zhang Guilin, Chen Yuanhong, etc., who served as foremen, supervisors, translators, etc., handling the hiring, moving, loading, and unloading of goods. Fang and others colluded with each other to commit fraud, embezzling a huge sum of over 180,000 yuan. This was discovered by Lin, who then hired lawyer Lin Yingqing and filed a private prosecution against Fang and others in the Special First Court. After the judge opened the court for trial, he ordered the defendants to quickly go out and mediate to avoid severe criminal punishment, and then ordered a postponement for further hearing.

Economic Circle - Commentary

### Raising Price Ceilings

The authorities have already raised the price ceilings for several commodities. For example, the price ceiling for gold has been raised to 5,000 yuan per tael, and the price ceiling for newsprint has been raised to 950 yuan per ream. Those who do not study the principles of raising price ceilings generally believe that once the price ceiling is raised, the black market price will inevitably continue to rise. However, the facts tell us that the black market price of gold has already fallen within the 5,000 yuan price ceiling range; the black market price of paper, which exceeds the price ceiling range, is also insignificant. From this, it can be seen that raising the price ceiling is not enough to promote the increasing rise of black market prices; on the contrary, sometimes it can promote the decline of black market prices.

Therefore, we believe that raising the price ceiling is absolutely not meaningless, because after the price ceiling is raised, the natural results are: (1) Stores are not excessively at a loss in terms of profits, so they will not hoard goods and not sell them; (2) Buyers see that there are goods available in the open market, so they will not seek them in the black market; (3) Black markets see that there are auditors, so they will not hoard and speculate. Therefore, from a theoretical point of view, raising the price ceiling actually achieves three benefits with one action. However, raising the price ceiling should adhere to the first principle of "just enough"; the standard of "just enough" is that when it is determined that there is no way to hoard certain commodities in the black market, then the price ceiling should no longer be raised, but should instead be reduced, because implementing a low-price policy is, after all, a major goal of a controlled economy.

### After the Establishment of the Cotton Industry Special Committee, the Old Cotton Purchase Agency is Dissolved. All Cotton and Cotton Products are Under the Control of the Special Committee.

Since the Materials Control Review Committee of the National General Chamber of Commerce decided to include four major commodities, including cotton, into the scope of compilation items, a new organization is needed for the compilation of cotton to be responsible for handling it. The "China Central China Cotton Compilation General Association" and the cotton purchase agency, originally organized by the Japanese side, must be dissolved, and the compilation affairs are transferred to the Chamber of Commerce to prepare for handling. It is now known that the Chamber of Commerce has a professional committee for the cotton industry, so after consultation with relevant parties, it was decided to hand over the cotton compilation work to the cotton industry professional committee to be responsible for carrying it out, with the hope of integrating it with the compilation work of cotton products. The main content of this matter is as follows:

(1) The Cotton Industry Professional Committee under the Chamber of Commerce is the highest control of cotton and cotton products.

(2) The constituent members of the Cotton Industry Professional Committee are the Chinese Cotton Industry Federation, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Cotton Products Industry Federation, and the Japanese Cotton Products Industry Federation and the Japanese Cotton Industry Federation.

(3) The cotton products part will be set up by a council by the Chinese and Japanese industry federations, and the cotton part will also be set up by a council by the Chinese and Japanese sides to facilitate contact.

(4) The Chinese and Japanese cotton industry federations, on the Chinese side, are composed of the Yarn Factory Federation, the Cotton Industry Association, and other associations related to cotton. The Japanese side is composed of the "China Spinning Industry Association," the "Japanese Cotton Bureau Industry Association," and other industry associations related to cotton.

### Reserve Deposit Passbooks Can Be Discounted at the Central Bank

Qianzhuang banks in Shanghai have previously requested the Central Reserve Bank to borrow cash against deposit reserve passbooks due to tight money and inflexible turnover. The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank did not dare to make its own decisions on whether the reserve deposit passbooks could be borrowed for cash. After requesting instructions from the Ministry of Finance, it is now known that the Ministry of Finance has approved the accommodation, and the regulations stipulate: (1) A promissory note can be issued for 80% of the amount of the reserve fund that has been deposited to request a discount. (2) The discount period is limited to seven days. (3) The discount rate is set at 12 yuan per thousand yuan per month. It is heard that this method is to mortgage at 80% by means of discounting.

### Real Estate Prices in This City Soar, Many Real Estate Companies are Established

Recently, the price of real estate in this city has been soaring due to the authorities' strict crackdown on hoarding and speculation, resulting in excessive speculative funds that are difficult to find an outlet for a while, and thus infiltrating into the real estate sector. As a result, real estate transactions are becoming increasingly busy, and real estate prices are also constantly rising.

### Dissolved Guilds Must Immediately Return Seals

The Municipal Grain Bureau has already implemented organizational adjustments to the various industry guilds engaged in grain business. Some have already been formally established, and the original industry guilds included in the established guilds have been ordered to dissolve, and the Ministry's order to return and cancel the original guild seals has been issued. However, the guild addresses are mostly in the two concessions, so the bureau sent a letter to the authorities of the two concessions to assist in handling the matter, and all the original seals of the guilds were transferred to the bureau with truncated corners for return and cancellation.

### A Perspective on Trainees in Large Companies

— Zheng Bai

"Trainee" sounds more "elegant" than "apprentice," especially in a company? Even more so in a large company.

We work in high-rise buildings all day long (although we sleep in rented lofts at night), wear "uniform" uniforms, work the hours of the writing room, and have the "easy work" and "generous treatment" that outsiders imagine... These are all so good. Look, who doesn't envy mentioning a large company? The fame is so loud that it penetrates the clouds. However, the famous may not have the real. This illusory reputation and appearance do not know how many young people are lured to seek this job, and finally embark on a narrow road.

Don't you believe it? Our uniform fee is deducted from our salary. Speaking of salary, it is even more pitiful. I have been "training" for two years, and now I only have more than 20 yuan a month, which is the result of several salary increases of two yuan. Our company does not provide accommodation or breakfast, so a month's income is not enough to drink a bowl of soy milk every day, let alone talk about the rest. Every morning, we first go to the company to clean the "cabinet," and then move out the goods to wait for the market to open. After that, we only hear the east ringing the bell and the west ringing the bell, running around quickly, and we are very busy. I only hate that I can't turn into thousands of bodies to avoid the contempt of the cargo officers. We also often have to move heavy goods from the fourth floor to the ground floor. Someone in our group has already suffered from spitting blood. After closing, we move the goods back to the designated place, then sweep the floor, wipe the tables, and wipe the glass... We have to do all the trivial things. After a hard day, we should have a little time for self-study. The company is very considerate and organized a free training class for us - "forced tutoring," just like parents urging their children, but the content is only English, only teaching English words - all of which are professional nouns and imported goods names. As for grammar, past talks, they are all classified as "unnecessary" and "postponed for explanation." We have to take an hour of so-called "English class" every day, which is tantamount to wasting an hour of our time.

Our work and life seem to be very hard. However, we do not complain, and we always hope to have a day to stand out. However, the company stipulates that trainees can only be promoted to salespersons at most, and there is no further opportunity. The treatment of salespersons is only a few times higher than that of trainees. If you don't rely on doing other business, it is also difficult to maintain life. In this way, the store clerk cannot work with peace of mind, the efficiency is reduced, and the company's losses are also considerable.

Even though our job is not a "golden rice bowl" or a "silver rice bowl," there are still quite a few people who come to snatch it. Therefore, we are often at risk of being "invited by the company to take up another position," and this problem becomes serious. After the trainees in small shops are dismissed by the boss, they have already gained some experience. Therefore, they can always find a way to make a living anywhere in the world. Only our group, especially the group in the luxurious houses such as floating wine and suits, can only find a way to make a living locally after being dismissed. If you go to a small city, even if you have "trained" to perfection, you will be "a hero without a place to use your skills." Because who in the mainland can afford your noble business? So you have to start as an "apprentice" again, and then the time of several years will be wasted unclearly.

### The Advantages and Disadvantages of Face

— Chuan Wo

It is undeniable that everyone wants to save "face": even if some people do shameless things behind others' backs, they still use oil to disguise their "face" beautifully and completely, perhaps even more meticulously and "want" it than others. Yes, this is not necessarily a "virtue," "Everyone has the heart to be evil," isn't this "wanting face" in line with "the heart to be evil"?

Some people say: "The social order of China can still be maintained well in this dynamic time, really because we are after all a 'land of propriety and righteousness'." At the same time, I often hear: "Ah... it's about face..." "Alas... face can't..." From this, I suddenly realized that "face" is actually the "guardian" of human ethics and customs in Chinese society. Isn't it true that in order to "want face," the poor pretend to be rich, so there are "fewer" poor people in society; in order to "want face," everyone does their best to be "courteous" when dealing with people, so there is "harmony" and "happiness" in society; in order to "want face," they say "Ha... so-so..." "Hey, everyone is convenient...", so everything in the world is "always beneficial," and the world is "peaceful." However, unfortunately, "where there is a common benefit, there must be its drawbacks," because in order to "want face," everyone unconsciously applies a layer of powder to their faces, and over time, they lose their innocent nature and become strange faces that are good at flattering, good at welcoming, good at pretending to be majestic, and good at wearing masks... I think that the reason why most children are afraid of strangers is probably because they have not seen the world deeply and are not used to this kind of "strange" relationship, right?

Some people are blaming some people for not caring about other people's face and making them feel too embarrassed. This can certainly give some correction to some arrogant people, but they did not expect that some people who squeeze out a dignified "face" on the outside but do all kinds of evil in secret are the biggest obstacles to social progress and the biggest criminals in the formation of human hypocrisy! In my opinion, if someone points out my mistakes in person, pulls down my mask, and makes me "lose face," I would be happy to accept it. But if someone always "gives me face," puts on a full face of disguise, I can't help but feel angry: this is "vulgar," and it is undoubtedly unacceptable in a "ceremonial society."

In fact, as long as it is not deliberate, not emotional, but correct teaching or rebuke, what does it matter if the "face" - the paper that inherits people's thoughts - is torn? On the contrary, in order to show respect for the other party's "face" without pointing out their mistakes, and pretending to be a "face" to cater to them and win their favor, is no different from ruining the conscience and personality of both of us! Therefore, instead of pretending to have "face" and desperately wanting "face," it is better to lose it and have everyone stand up frankly and say something true! Otherwise, before the "courtesy" is finished, the society will already be in danger!

### Reality, Ideals, and Humor

— Yuan Gu

Lin Yutang once said, "Humor can prevent idealists from hitting their heads against the stone wall of reality and being severely hit, and it can also ease the tension of those irritable enthusiasts and make them live longer." His meaning is that reality can indeed support lofty wisdom or thoughts. However, humor is also a tool for adjusting ideals and reality, so that they can be properly combined.

Indeed, the position of a person who specializes in reality is very stable. As long as he can understand everything he has at present and make appropriate efforts, he will never fail. However, this kind of life is too monotonous and too mechanical. It's like a fisherman who can only fish. A pole and a cage represent everything he has. He just sits by the river all day long. Of course, the fish in the cage are enough for him to live on. However, he does not know that modern new fishing machines can catch his fish for several days in a matter of minutes and moments, and the cost is less than half of his.

On the other hand, an idealist will never be as stable as the former. They always plan many themes that transcend reality every day, and fantasize about everything in the future, especially in terms of material enjoyment and spiritual pleasure, holding great hopes and extravagance; you must know that these hopes and extravagance are accumulating the roots of harm. On a personal level, this excessive hope makes them suffer. Broadly speaking, if a nation also has this kind of desire, then the whole society will be shaken.

Life is a polymorphic mixture of reality and ideals. If the mixture is accurate and appropriate, then life is interesting, and accuracy and appropriateness depend entirely on humor to adjust. It's like a worker who has worked for eight hours needs sleep, it can reduce your unnecessary fantasies and grasp reality; sometimes it can cultivate your ideals and give your reality a rest.

### Dispatch from the Front Lines (3)

— Written by Mr. Hamamoto of the Naval Reporting Team

5. The Spirit of the Chivalrous Warrior

"If the men of the 'Kurogane' torpedo boat were to go ashore, even the tearful little beggars in Chinese cities would reportedly hide under the beds."

"Perhaps not that extreme, but if they were timid soldiers, they would reportedly often give way."

Upon hearing such talk, Edo Kantarō, who grew up on a crude freighter, could imagine what kind of character the 'Kurogane' torpedo boat he would be serving on would have.

"Hey, before you serve on that boat, you have to stand up for it," Lieutenant Matsumae said with a smile. The members of the reporting team always added some exaggeration to the 'Kurogane's' character.

"First of all, that boat's captain is a real eccentric. The captain is a classmate and contemporary of Major Kōmoto of Nanchang, who died in a plane crash, and later transferred to the fleet. I can't say for sure if this is true, but I know he admires Leader Shimizu no Jirochō; otherwise, he wouldn't hang his picture in his bedroom."

"I can't say for sure, but lately, on the training ground, he has been using a terrible, violent training method to train the soldiers. Even if you just stand by and watch, you can always tell they are from the 'Kurogane.' The captain often appears suddenly from behind and gives everyone a lecture. All training is not enough to have a simple style. Even if the result is a little bit good, if there is no spirit, it is shallow in the battlefield. Training is not work, but spirit, so he tells everyone about the chivalrous warrior Shimizu no Jirochō, whom he admires, and the anecdotes of Leader Ketsurō. Sometimes, he calls the quartermaster and says, 'The soldiers are sweating too much, pour coffee into the buckets and let them drink!' 'You won't see that kind of coffee-drinking method anywhere in the South Seas,'" someone said with a laugh.

"Perhaps not. However, in the end, it's more like water than coffee. But the soldiers are moved by the spirit of this captain."

"I heard that captain only has two orders."

"When enemy planes are spotted, he orders to fire upwards, and when enemy submarines are spotted, he orders to launch torpedoes." Someone said, making a commanding gesture when saying "fire upwards" and "launch torpedoes."

"Then he just instructs the gunners and torpedo men to go to the appropriate places, and because he always gets results, he's amazing!"

"That's a bit strange!" Lieutenant Matsumae suddenly protested.

"However, because it's a small ship, you can't really talk about it in terms of formal warfare conditions," Lieutenant Matsumae added, confirming that statement.

"Has anyone on the reporting team ever been on the 'Kurogane'?" Nanjō asked.

"Although I haven't been on it, I know a lot of people in their 'family.' Among them are the executive officer, Ōmasa, and the engineering lieutenant, Komasa. Ōmasa is a second-dan in kendo, and Komasa is a fourth-dan in judo, which adds up to six dan, and they often boast about it. There's also someone called Yonaka Asata, who was reportedly a sumo wrestler in the naval corps. He's the friendliest of them all. Lately!"

The bald reporter stretched out his legs and said that. The fact that this group of reporters particularly admired the 'Kurogane family' was evident from the beginning of the conversation.

This is the story of the "Kurogane Family" told by the bald reporter stretching out his legs.

It was on a night when the moon was full that this group of reporters went to a banquet halfway up the mountain.

The banquet hall was in the middle of the back of the mountain, two kilometers from the ship's pier. The fragrant, pale red Indian frangipani and the eight-petaled calla lilies were just as beautiful at night, blooming by the windows. The officers who came here called this place, which had a panoramic view of the entire port, the Ben Nevis of the South Seas (the highest mountain in the United Kingdom). The officers' room was used for banquets for those coming ashore and those going to war, and they often brought a lot of beer and canned food, sitting on tatami mats in the Japanese style and feasting.

"Reporting team, come over here!"

Upon hearing the call, they looked over and saw their own captain, surrounded by the heroes and brave men of the "Kurogane Family," all with angry expressions on their faces.

Surprised, they said, "What's going on?" and before their butt could even land on the chair, they said, "I'm currently reading a report, from my old senior, or rather, the captain of the destroyer I used to serve on. Please forgive me for not revealing the name, it's the final report of a certain unit commander, everyone listen!" Suddenly showing a look of great admiration, they began to recite in a crisp voice.

"Due to intense enemy fire, our positions are gradually being breached, and our brave soldiers are constantly counterattacking with suicide attacks, inflicting great losses on the enemy, but our side..."

In a solemn low voice, not intentionally tinged with a little sadness.

"For more than forty days of engagement with the enemy, regardless of military personnel or civilian staff, everyone has done their utmost to fulfill their duties. I am very grateful for the guidance of my superiors, the cooperation of the air force, and the combined operations of the army. I wish for the prosperity of the Imperial Nation and the long-lasting good fortune of all officers. The End."

The captain, who had been reciting with his eyes closed, had two lines of hot tears streaming down his cheeks. The executive officer, Ōmasa, and the others did not say a word for a while. After a moment, Lieutenant Komasa, the chief engineer, suddenly trembled on his pale face and stood up, saying, "Revenge, revenge!"

"Don't be impatient!"

The captain scolded them, saying that. Then he asked the reporter, "How is it? Haven't you thought of an article yet?"

They specially called the reporting team to read the will of their predecessor (which has now become a will), and also to hear various thoughts from the reporters who make a living by writing, perhaps to prove that their own criticism was not wrong.

But the emotional members of the reporting team had been listening angrily from the beginning, and never thought about the quality of the article in their hearts. As for discussion and criticism, they felt that it was something that should not be done.

At this moment, the command post suddenly sounded an alarm. Perhaps an enemy reconnaissance plane had come to scout under the moonlight. After hearing the alarm, generally speaking, there was still thirty minutes before the enemy plane flew over the city.

Even so, the flustered captain kicked the tatami mat, indicating, "Hurry up and go!"

"It's still early, there's no need to panic!"

The reporters said with a laugh. Then Ōmasa, who was standing nearby, stared with a pitiful look and said forcefully:

"We are not avoiding the alarm, we are going back to the boat to prepare for an attack. Tonight, we won't let a single plane go, we will shoot them all down."

Before these words were finished, the shadows of the heroes and brave men had already disappeared from the room. (Tō: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)

### Anecdotes of the Japanese Navy (5)

— Ōshita Udaer

At 1:55 PM on May 27, 1905, on the flagship Mikasa, a signal flag known throughout the world was raised high: "The fate of the Empire rests on this battle, all officers and men must strive harder!"

Although very brief, such a powerful, sincere, and heroic statement is rare. Whether in the event of an incident or in battle, all kinds of orders emanate from this.

In the Battle of Coral Sea, the enemy's large mobile force, centered on the aircraft carriers Saratoga and Yorktown, plus the battleships North Carolina class and California class, and the British battleship Warspite, was surrounded by our fleet and aircraft. Soon, when the time for the planned decisive battle was ripe, the 〇〇 captain on board the 〇〇 gave the following instructions to the entire crew through the speaking tube:

"Gentlemen! You have all been trained into the world's only arms. Now your training has come to fruition. The time is near when those arms will show their colors! Do it! Do it with confidence! As long as we do that, victory is ours!"

The captain's tone was firm and sincere, and in the power of his words, there was a kind of affectionate tone like a father instructing his son. The crew were moved by that tone, their spirits were uplifted, they became joyful, and their courage flared up like fire. So the gunners prayed to the guns, sprinkled sake on the torpedoes, filled with confidence that every shot would hit, each took their place, and completed the perfect battle configuration.

In the northern waters of Kolagong, Java, when the British first-class cruiser Exeter was sunk, before the enemy ship had been identified, the captain of the 〇〇 destroyer had already calculated the distance between the two sides, and knew that they would come into contact with the enemy ship around noon, so he wanted to take this opportunity to have the entire crew eat a hearty meal first. Therefore, he issued the command:

"Members! Eat!"

That was the first order in this battle. The enemy was the latest and most advanced first-class cruiser that Britain boasted of, and it was accompanied by destroyers. But our side had only two destroyers, yet they dared to challenge it and immediately sank the enemy into the seabed of the Java Sea. The Exeter was one of the British cruiser groups that attacked the German pocket battleship Graf Spee in the South American River Plate. A small Japanese destroyer avenged the allied nations. At the beginning of the war, our naval aircraft also sank the Prince of Wales off the coast of Malaya, avenging the German battleship Bismarck. The spirit of Admiral Spee and the German naval heroes who died on the Bismarck are probably smiling! This is a tragic and beautiful marine interlude.

Soldiers are different from great thinkers, orators, and writers; they are not good at these things. Soldiers only know how to move forward bravely, only know the warrior's duty, and thus many famous generals have emerged.

In a certain naval battle of the Russo-Japanese War, a certain captain did not say a word to the entire crew from beginning to end.

Later, he finally spoke. Only one sentence:

"Gentlemen! Excellent! Catch up!"

"Excellent" is a word of praise and encouragement. It was originally used when praising and reciting poetry. Now, in military schools, this phrase can often be heard. (Different: Translated from Western Asahi Shimbun.)

### Female Teacher Dies After Being Beaten and Humiliated; All Circles Donate Condolence Money

The case of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School in Hongkou, who died after being beaten and humiliated by Liu Wangshi, a student's family member, has aroused public outrage in educational and women's circles, and they have successively advocated punishing the murderer and providing compensation to the family. Yesterday, this newspaper received five hundred yuan from the colleagues of E Shun Chang firm on behalf of Su Yizhi's family, one hundred yuan each from Shen Suicheng, Ye Yipei, and Chen Bi, fifty yuan from Zhang Tinggui, and twenty yuan each from Xu Jiajun, Gu Kuilin, Sun Jinyuan, and Bao Dafang, totaling nine hundred and thirty yuan.

### On Liu Wangshi's Beating and Humiliating Su Yizhi

— Shuping

The "Guoyu" says: "People are born from three, treat them as one: the father gives birth to them, the ruler feeds them, and the teacher teaches them." The "Book of Rites" says: "Serving the ruler, serving the father, and serving the teacher all require diligent service to the point of death." This means that teachers are respected equally with rulers and fathers, which is an ancient teaching of our country. If a person is a citizen but does not obey the government's orders, he is a rebel; if a child does not listen to his parents' instructions, he is a rebel; is not a student who disobeys a teacher's punishment in the same category as a rebel?

Punishment as a form of education is mentioned in the "Shangshu," and the use of rods to maintain discipline is seen in the "Book of Rites." Even in schools in this city, it often happens that students are punished for poor character or neglected studies. However, it is shocking and unheard of for a student's parents to dote on their children, beat and humiliate teachers, causing them to commit suicide out of resentment.

Let us ask, what was Su Yizhi's intention in punishing Liu Zhijun? It was nothing more than wanting Liu Zhijun not to neglect his studies and to be able to pass his grades. Is it not also fair to say that she was fulfilling her duties to the best of her ability? School authorities are always happy to have talented people, and students should never complain. Parents should always be grateful for the teachers' enthusiastic teaching. Yet, Liu Wangshi not only did not thank Su Yizhi but hated her like an enemy and beat and humiliated her. If such an ignorant and悍婦 is not severely punished, then the trend of students disobeying instruction will inevitably worsen day by day, and teachers will all be terrified and fearful. Then who will be willing to fulfill their duties to the best of their ability and enthusiastically teach their students? Is this not a blow to the education community? If we still hope for the efforts of teachers and the cultivation of talent under these circumstances, are we not trying to prevent them from entering? Therefore, if we want teachers to work hard and cultivate talent, we must severely punish Liu Wangshi. In this way, the grievances of the deceased can be somewhat relieved, and the arrogance of the ignorant 悍婦 in the world who only know how to spoil their children and despise teachers can also be curbed.

### Shanghai Educational Association Gives Preferential Treatment to Teachers
