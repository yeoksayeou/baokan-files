### On the European War Situation

The European war situation has consistently regarded the Eastern Front as the primary battlefield. Since July 5th, after a four-month period of lull, a fierce summer campaign has begun. However, as we pointed out a few days ago, the German side, based on the lessons learned from the past two years of warfare, has abandoned the strategy of deep, long-range incursions. Instead, they are concentrating their efforts on annihilating the combat power of the Soviet forces to ensure victory. Therefore, in the intense warfare of the past three weeks, from Orel, Kursk, and Belgorod, they have generally not adopted an advancing posture, except for necessary advances in certain areas. What they have been striving for is to use fluid tactics and new sharp weapons, especially the "Tiger" tanks, to inflict serious blows on the already offensive Soviet forces. Now, under the fierce attacks of the German army, the Soviet military authorities have been compelled to adopt a larger-scale offensive, which is to realize the so-called "luring the tiger out of the mountain" strategy, in order to deal a decisive blow. Since last week, the Soviet side has launched a full-scale offensive, starting from the Orel front, and widened the battle lines, not only in the Belgorod area, but also as far as the Leningrad front in the north. Some Soviet forces have even attempted a landing in Norway. Except for the latter being immediately repulsed by the Axis forces, according to a Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 24th, since the 22nd, the Soviet army has launched a large-scale offensive in the Leningrad area, and the northern section of the Eastern Front has become fierce again. The Soviet army has mobilized 18 divisions. Now, from Leningrad in the north to the Kuban bridgehead in the south, the entire front war situation has gradually entered the main battle stage. The German High Command has announced that "the war on the Eastern Front is now unfolding on a scale never seen before. The Soviet army is exhausting all its strength, sparing no sacrifice, and launching strong attacks on the German positions." Therefore, although the Soviet side has recently tried its best to conceal this offensive, claiming that the Soviet army does not want to adopt a full-scale offensive, it is actually a way to conceal the damage in the major offensive, so as not to stimulate domestic morale. In fact, according to German military reports, in the gradual unfolding of this full-scale offensive, the Soviet army lost as many as 566 tanks in a single day on the 22nd, which shows the large number of troops mobilized and the heavy losses suffered. The unprecedented fierce battle between the German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front, spanning hundreds to thousands of miles, has a great impact on the entire European situation and should be watched by those who are concerned about the situation around the world.

In the Mediterranean, the war centered on the battle for Sicily in southern Italy. Since it was launched on July 9th, the British, American, and Canadian allied forces have been continuously reinforcing their forces, using Pantelleria and Malta as bases, and landing to attack Sicily. Now the war has spread to the south, east, and west of Sicily. However, none of these wars can affect the overall defense capability of the Axis forces on the southern front. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces are currently trying to seize air superiority in order to blockade the Strait of Messina. At the same time, naval and land forces are operating on the northern coast of the island, and American troops have been risking landings on the northeast coast to the north for days, but without success. From a topographical point of view, the northern part of Sicily is a mountainous area, which is also a natural defensive line for southern Italy. Whoever can occupy it can dominate the Mediterranean and control the coast of Southern Europe. According to Reuters military correspondent Seto Hughes, the Axis High Command is concentrating its defense of Sicily in the northeastern part of the island, while the western part of the island, including the major cities of Palermo, Marsala, and Trapani, is undergoing a planned retreat. It is likely that the future major battle will unfold fiercely in the northeast, and the anti-Axis forces, under the command of General Alexander, may find their graves in the mountains. However, we cannot observe the Sicilian campaign in isolation from Southern Europe and even Western Europe. The anti-Axis forces obviously have not used all their forces in this area, so how can the Axis forces ignore the overall situation in Western Europe and even Southern Europe and fight for a city or place on the island? From the perspective of the overall war situation in Southern Europe, since Italy has announced that most of its territory has entered a state of war and implemented martial law, and the elite troops of Germany have also begun to march into Italy in greater numbers to assist in defense in order to fulfill their alliance obligations, the Mediterranean war situation may achieve considerable stability.

The most important condition for guaranteeing the final victory of the war is the implementation of the wartime total power system in the rear. Now, the Soviet Union is being pushed onto the dangerous path of trying its best to adopt an offensive. Domestic problems and issues of colonies, autonomous states, and protectorates in Britain and the United States are also arising in succession. It is difficult to say to what extent the mobilization of the anti-Axis countries in the rear and their support for the front have been brought into play, but there are already very obvious limitations on what they may be able to bring into play in the future. Conversely, the Axis countries are increasingly strengthening the "wartime total power system" in response to the development of the international situation. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 24th, the German government has begun the following three new mobilization movements for this purpose. The first is to issue special orders to the middle class, which occupies a considerable majority in Germany, to close and reorganize all unnecessary and non-urgent shops, handicrafts, hotels, and restaurants, so as to free up the remaining manpower and material resources for emergency aspects such as military industries, in order to enhance combat power. The second is to start a large-scale and effective mobilization of the labor force of German women, especially young girls, to serve the war. Recently, German women who directly participate in work in military factories have accounted for 60% of the total. In the future, under the slogan of "divine assistance service", it is bound to mobilize more women to the war departments. The third is the mobilization of male and female students. Except for special circumstances, male and female students in German universities, vocational schools, and other equivalent schools have been ordered to temporarily put down their pens, pick up hammers, and enter military factories to work. This kind of wartime total power system is still a dream for the anti-Axis countries, so the strength of combat power in the upcoming decisive battle between the two sides can be known without divination. For this reason, we must not be confused by the wartime evolution of a temporary place and should strengthen our belief in the inevitable victory of the war and cooperate more closely with the Axis countries.

### Fierce Air Battle Occurs Over Isabel Island Japanese Planes Attack Funafuti US Positions

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) The Japanese naval ground forces on Isabel Island engaged in a fierce battle on the afternoon of the 23rd with 30 enemy "Liberator" bombers and 20 "Flying Fortress" fighters that attacked. As a result, three enemy aircraft were shot down.

Buenos Aires, 25th (Central News Agency) According to a New Gold Mountain dispatch, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces Command announced on the 23rd, after the 21st, the Japanese aviation corps bombed US positions on Funafuti Island again.

Difficult Battle Situation for the Enemy on New Georgia Island

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) The Australian correspondent of the London Times recently published an article in the newspaper entitled "The Situation on New Georgia," describing the difficult battle situation for the anti-Axis forces. The general idea is that, according to news from New Georgia, the situation on the island is very similar to the battle situation in New Guinea. The dense forest area is as dark as night even in the daytime, and torrential rain is pouring down, the mud on the ground is waist-deep, and the soldiers are drenched, like chickens that have fallen into the water. Moreover, they lie down and get up in the trenches and are often disturbed by black insects at night, so they are all suffering unspeakable hardships. The Japanese army is entrenched in the same solid trenches as those built on the northern coast of New Guinea. Once night falls, they penetrate deep into the US positions, disrupt the rear, and set fires in the dense forests, causing the US military to panic and be confused. The Japanese army there has enough food and ammunition to cope with a long-term battle, so it is by no means easy for the US military to capture Munda.

### Recovery of Shanghai Concessions Preparations for Celebrations in Various Places

### The War Zone in Hebei and Chahar is in a Precarious Situation

Guangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency) According to a Chongqing dispatch, after Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying joined the peace camp, the Chongqing side sent Ma Fawu, commander of the newly formed Fifth Army, to clean up the remnants of the war zone in Hebei and Chahar. It is now heard that Ma has arrived in Chongqing after receiving a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek. When he met with the press corps on the 24th, he said that Pang Bingxun's departure from the Chongqing side and participation in the peace movement had caused various difficulties in the war zone in Hebei and Chahar, and the Japanese army had recently increased its pressure on the Chongqing army. Therefore, appropriate countermeasures must be taken as soon as possible to remedy the situation.

### The 22nd Division of the Army Has Completed Its Inspection

Rainy Capital, 25th (Central News Agency) The Military Affairs Commission Chairman Wang specially approved the removal of the word "temporary" from the 22nd Division of the Provisional Army.

Due to banditry, weather, and transportation issues in the area, the inspection committee members only returned to the capital yesterday. The results of the inspection of the division were said to be exceptionally good.

### Head of the Japanese Economic Mission Discusses Two Major Problems in China Today - Stabilizing Prices and Solving the Food Problem

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) Ogura Masatsune, head of the Japanese Economic Survey Mission to China, after returning to Tokyo on the 18th, immediately visited Prime Minister Tojo and other Japanese government authorities to report on his trip to China. On the afternoon of the 24th, he also met with the press corps at the Tokyo Bank Assembly Hall in Marunouchi to talk about the current economic problems in China. The general idea is: the urgent countermeasures for the current Chinese economic circles are the price problem and the food problem. Influential figures in the Chinese political and economic circles unanimously hope that Japan will actively cooperate in stabilizing prices and other current problems, because high prices and insufficient materials are inevitable phenomena in wartime. Domestic prices in China have risen sharply since December last year. The reason is actually the country's backlog. The current countermeasures must strengthen purchasing and distribution agencies to promote the exchange of materials, and take appropriate measures economically and legally to promote the exchange of materials to the south. The solution to the food problem is a very important issue in stabilizing people's lives. The key to solving the food problem lies in improving purchasing methods, and appropriate guidance methods and the development of farmland should be used to increase production. At the same time, if the National Commercial Control Association can further study reasonable purchasing strategies, China's food problem can be solved quickly.

### Governor-General Koiso Leaves Manchuria to Return to His Post

Xinjing, 25th (Central News Agency) Korean Governor-General Koiso has completed his mission to visit Manchuria and returned to his post this morning. When he left Manchuria, he made a speech and strongly emphasized the necessity of cooperation between Manchuria and Korea. The general idea is: During my visit to Manchuria, I witnessed the Prime Minister Zhang and the current government officials shouldering the heavy task of working hard in all aspects of administration, and I deeply admired them. I sincerely feel that the foundation of Manchuria is as solid as a rock, which is by no means accidental. Manchuria and Korea are adjacent to each other and have a common mission. My visit to Manchuria has further confirmed that the cooperation and cooperation between Manchuria and Korea will be further strengthened in the future.

### The Focus of the Battle of Sicily Shifts to the Interior The German Army Relies on Natural Barriers to Hold Its Ground Fierce Fighting is Underway in the Leonforte Area

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) According to Branner, a special correspondent for the German News Agency stationed in Sicily: The focus of the battle in Western Sicily has shifted from the Catania area to the interior of the island. On Friday, the American and Canadian forces launched an attempt to break through the German positions in the Madonie Mountains and the Leonforte area, but the German army is still holding its ground. The anti-Axis forces commander-in-chief changed his plan this time, apparently because the British army repeatedly decided to use the firepower of tanks and warships to assist in the attacks in the south of Catania and near Gerbini, but they were all defeated and suffered heavy losses. In the Catania Plain, the German army used its miraculous tactics to prevent General Montgomery's troops from using the area as a springboard for attacking north, and the British army was forced to explore trench warfare, with the Axis army occupying a commanding position and gaining the upper hand. On a clear morning on the fifth, both sides in the Catania area had only reconnaissance activities and artillery activities. The American forces under General Patton have been reinforced by the British and Canadian troops under General Montgomery. General Patton's mission is obviously to use these reinforcements to break through the Axis positions at any cost. To accomplish what General Montgomery failed to do. The movement of the Axis forward units has strengthened the positions. And a small number of troops can be drawn out to harass the anti-Axis forces. One of the troops raided Termini, about 35 kilometers southeast of Palermo on the northwest coast, and wiped out a strong US outpost. In the Madonie Mountains and the Leonforte area, American and military forces attempted to break through, causing fierce fighting. The Madonie Mountains are 2,000 meters high. About 20 kilometers south of the northern port of Cefalu, and Leonforte is 45 kilometers southeast of the Madonie Mountains, but the forward positions of the German army in all places are holding firm. The Axis forces have withdrawn from all the occupied areas in the south of the island, so the anti-Axis forces have made progress there.

The military commander of the area, MacArthur, declared that if the strike does not stop, a state of emergency will be declared.

### 3,000 German Planes Sortied in One Day Active German Aircraft on the Eastern Front Fierce Bombing of Soviet Rear Transport Lines Soviet Offensive in Orel Thwarted Again

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) Like the German News Agency military reporter Colonel Hammer reported on the 24th about the situation on the electric line war, the Soviet army launched a major counteroffensive in important locations on the eastern end on the 22nd, but were repelled by the German army and suffered heavy losses. On the 23rd, it again attempted to launch an offensive. The focus of the Soviet army's counteroffensive was still in the Orel area. The Soviet army had previously breached the German battle in the north and southeast of Orel, and in order to expand the breach, it dispatched a large number of reserve forces in that area on the 23rd, but its attempt still completely failed. On that day, in the Orel area alone, the Soviet army had 92 tanks destroyed by the German army and 67 tanks bombed by the German army. On the 23rd, the Soviet army launched several fierce attacks on the Kupen bridgehead under the cover of artillery, air force, and tanks, but ultimately failed. On the Mius River front, the Soviet army advanced tank and infantry units under the cover of mortars, but they were bombed by the German air force, and its artillery positions immediately fell silent, so its attempt completely failed. In total, the Soviet army lost 424 tanks on the 23rd. The German air force also cooperated with the German army on the front line on the same day and established special achievements on the front line from the Sea of Azov to the north of the Orel area. It bombed the Soviet rear railways fiercely, destroyed several stations and ammunition depots, cut off important transport routes, and bombed three military trains full of soldiers and materials, inflicting heavy damage. The German air force sortied a total of 3,000 aircraft on the Eastern Front on the same day, and only lost five aircraft as a result.

### Mr. Wang Kemin Concerned About Food in Beijing Listed as One of the Policy Guidelines A Student Sent from Beijing

Since the surge in prices during the old New Year this year, the food problem has been the most concerned thing for all walks of life. This time, Mr. Wang Kemin, who succeeded the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, also declared solving the food problem as one of his policy guidelines upon taking office. In response to this fact, the government authorities had previously adopted two coping strategies: on the one hand, negotiating with various places to purchase food, and on the other hand, not allowing private storage of food and implementing official fixed prices.

Purchasing food is really a painstaking effort. Director Wang Yintai's efforts have been the most active, but he has not yet achieved final success. It is not easy to purchase from other places, so we want to find a way to use the existing grain storage and the production of aquatic land. The North China Material and Price Committee issued a notice to merchants and residents on May 5 to report the amount of grain stored, and advised merchants and residents who stored more than six months of consumption for their household to quickly report the type and quantity of grain stored. This measure was issued for this purpose. Later, it changed from "advising" to "ordering", and there was an order that those who failed to report would be confiscated and punished upon discovery. Then there were regulations that those who violated the order would be urgently punished, and finally a notice was issued that the report should be completed before June 20, and at the same time, a notice was issued to forcibly purchase the local production and stored grain at official fixed prices. The official fixed price is very low. The other three items of millet, sorghum, rice, and corn are also purchased at almost similar prices. On June 20, the official fixed prices for the two items of millet and sorghum were added, stating that they would be implemented from June 21. These measures have had a considerable impact on the decline in grain prices. In addition, there were several heavy rains in April and May, so the news that "a bumper harvest is expected" appeared in various newspapers, and in mid-June, food prices actually fell to the lowest price. On June 30, the newspapers also published the tentatively average retail price of food formulated by the Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau, which was used as a temporary official retail price. This official fixed price has just begun to be implemented. Committee Chairman Zhu Shen suddenly died of illness on July 2, and the food problem suffered another setback. Therefore, Mayor Liu Yushu described the measures taken by the government for the current phenomenon in an interview with reporters on the 18th of this month:

"During this period, those who have no overnight grain should be protected and maintained with all efforts, and all kinds of conveniences should be provided to prevent them from running out of food. I hope to advise those who have stored grain not to rush to buy it anymore, so that the extremely poor people can live... I hope that the sub-bureaus and district offices should investigate in many ways. Those who have stored grain should calculate it on a daily basis, and write the words 'no grain will be sold from a certain day to a certain day' on their household registration form and affix a seal to prevent them from purchasing it during the period. They must be allowed to speak when their food is about to run out." (July 19, Shishi Daily)

This method is a temporary measure. Now that Committee Chairman Kemin has flown back to Beijing on the 18th, we are waiting for his method to make Beijing's food prices tend to stabilize as soon as possible. (July 21)

### Authorities Pay Attention to Shanghai Market Prices Individually Defeat Manipulators and Hoarders All Citizens are Now Focusing on the Results

In order for Shanghai to become the starting point for solving wartime economic problems, the authorities will make every effort to promote the full implementation of the "Wartime Economic Program" in Shanghai, and will pay the closest attention to the recent increasing price panic. In terms of implementation agencies, the National Commercial Coordination Association, the Material Investigation Committee, and the Shanghai Office of the Material Control Review Committee will be the three-in-one axis. According to Shanghai News Agency reporters' inquiries from the financial circles yesterday, in principle, the countermeasures for the price problem should be fully responsible by the actual center, the Commercial Coordination Association, and its lower-level organizations, the Twenty-Two Trade Associations and the Fifty-odd Major Trade Associations. However, because of fear of being unable to do so, it has no choice but to maintain the closest contact and cooperation with the Material Investigation Committee and the Material Control Review Committee, so that control, investigation, and review are integrated into one. It is widely believed that future price countermeasures will be based on the principle of focusing on key points, that is, starting with the most important materials that are manipulated and hoarded, and implementing individual attacks. For example, the recent investigation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth by the Material Investigation Committee and the special attention of the police authorities to cloth merchants are all based on this intention. As for other materials, when the authorities deem it necessary to rectify them, they will also be handled in the same way. Speculative profiteers will never be tolerated.

### Li Haoju Elaborates on Postal Service Facilities and Revenue and Expenditure Situation Remains Unbalanced

The former Postmaster General of the Shanghai Postal Administration and Director of the Shanghai Office of the Directorate General of Posts, a Frenchman named Chapelin, has resigned and retired. There have been slight changes in the postal organization. In addition to the promotion of Assistant Wang Weisheng to Postmaster General, the central government has appointed Li Haoju as the Director of the Shanghai Office. In order to understand the latest postal situation, a reporter from the Guofeng News Agency visited Mr. Li, who provided the following information:

Postal Service Status

According to Mr. Li: I took office on the 8th of this month. The outside world may not fully understand the current postal situation. Regarding the organizational system, under the Construction Department (建股部), there is the Preparatory Office of the Directorate General of Posts, which has been established for two years, but the Directorate General has not been officially established and is managed by the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications. Currently, there are six postal districts: Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Shanghai. The jurisdiction of this office is not limited to the Shanghai district. All six districts mentioned above are under the management of this office. There have been no major changes to the structure of this office. Under the Director, there is also Deputy Director Mr. Takagi (Mr. Takagi is a former economic advisor to the National Government), and below them, there are three sections responsible for various personnel and business matters.

Revenue and Expenditure Situation

Regarding the revenue and expenditure situation this week, the balance is still uneven. Since the postal rates increased on June 1st, the monthly increase in revenue has been no more than 2.5 million yuan. Moreover, since that day, prices have risen sharply, so the expenses for rice subsidies and other expenses for employees are far above the increased revenue. The central government is coordinating a solution to this situation of income not covering expenses. The resumption of parcel delivery has now been implemented, but there are two points to note: (1) It must not violate the provisions of the commodity control regulations, and (2) The traffic situation in the parcel destination area must be considered.

Rice Rations for City Residents

The rice ration for city residents has been increased to 1.5 liters per person starting from the 21st distribution period. However, for the 19th and 20th periods, the ration is still set at 1 liter per person. The selling price has also been adjusted, increasing from 4.5 yuan to 6 yuan per liter.

### Shanghai's First Orphanage: A Tour of the Tushanwan Orphanage (II)

The orphanage has the longest history in this scenic area. It is said that during the Qing Dynasty, in the fifth year of Xianfeng (1855 AD), Father Xue Kongzhao, a Catholic gentleman, founded an orphanage in Loutang Town, Qingpu, which was later moved to Caijiawan in the western suburbs of Shanghai. In the tenth year of Xianfeng (1860 AD), the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's revolutionary army advanced towards the suburbs of Shanghai, and Qing soldiers went to battle. The Caijiawan Orphanage was completely destroyed in that war, and many orphans were killed. Even Father Ma, who was saving the orphans, was brutally murdered by the soldiers. A portion of the orphans who escaped danger took refuge in Dongjiadu in southern Shanghai. Four years later, in the third year of Tongzhi (1864 AD), they were moved from Dongjiadu to Tushanwan in the western suburbs of Shanghai. It has been eighty years since that year.

After the orphanage moved to Tushanwan, the environment was suitable, and the work of rescuing and educating orphans developed normally. It not only provided passive relief but also focused on active education and training. Therefore, workshops were added, on the one hand to train the orphans and teach them the necessary skills to make a living, and on the other hand so that the orphans could have work and support themselves even after they grew up and left the orphanage. Since the fifth year of Xianfeng, over the past eighty-eight years, the orphanage has taken in more than 5,500 orphans, nurturing and cultivating them from infancy to adulthood. It is said that besides serving in the orphanage's workshops, some of the orphans who came from the orphanage work in factories and stores in Shanghai, and many have even established their own factories and have flourishing businesses. Many have even gone to work in various places and have received praise from all sides. Zhang Chongren, who was appreciated by Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a centenarian, and gained considerable fame in the art world, was also an orphan who came from this orphanage.

Part-Work, Part-Study Education

One of the features of the Tushanwan Orphanage is the implementation of part-work, part-study education for the orphans.

Upon entering the main gate, there is a lawn. The ancient western-style building towering to the west is the "workshop and laboratory" called "Ciyun Elementary School." To the southwest is a grassy area that serves as a ball field, and further west is the Rong Garden, surrounded by trees, creating a quiet and elegant campus. The learning environment for the orphans can be said to be most suitable.

After the reorganization and restructuring of Ciyun Elementary School the year before last (1941), in terms of curriculum, there are four years of primary school, one year of advanced primary school, and two years of internship classes, adopting a single-track system of annual promotion and autumn semester start. The subjects in the four years of primary school are the same as in ordinary schools. A portion (40) of the orphans also attend Shishi Elementary School, leaving early and returning late, with the orphanage as their home. Tuition and boarding are paid by the orphanage. It is said that their grades are among the best, and they are the "promising" children of the orphanage.

After the orphans enter advanced primary school, in addition to regular subjects, they spend a certain number of hours each day in the orphanage's workshops, learning crafts. After graduating from advanced primary school, they enter the internship class. In the mornings and evenings, they continue to learn the basic knowledge of various subjects, such as civics, economics, history, geography, accounting, and foreign languages, so that they will have sufficient common knowledge and a moral foundation when they graduate in the future. The time outside of the mornings and evenings is spent as interns in the workshops, called apprentices, learning various crafts according to their temperament and skills, in order to prepare them for entering society after graduation as model workers with excellent scholarship and skills. The internship period is two years.

Graduation Ceremony of the Workers' Technical College. The graduation ceremony of the first graduating class of the mechanical engineering department of the Workers' Technical Night School, sponsored by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Bureau, was held at the Grand China Cinema at 9:00 AM on the 24th. The graduates of this class have completed three years of study in mechanical engineering. There were a total of eleven graduates. A short industrial film was shown at the end. The event concluded at 11:00 AM.

Fellow-Countrymen's Tutoring School. The Guangdong Fellow-Countrymen's Association in Shanghai is preparing to establish a tutoring school at its headquarters.

### Principles for Selection and Admission for Scholarship Aid by This Newspaper

Hoping for Guidance from All Sectors at Any Time Schedule of Examinations for Each Group to be Announced Tomorrow

The dates and locations of the scholarship examinations for the readers of this newspaper have been decided. However, due to the large number of applicants, the schedules for the primary school, junior high school, senior high school, and university groups will be arranged separately, and the schedules will be announced in the newspaper on the 27th. As for the selection criteria for the examination, they are listed below. We hope to receive guidance from all sectors. Yesterday, this newspaper received scholarship donations from all sectors, which we deeply appreciate. The list of donors will be announced tomorrow.

Selection Criteria

Regarding the selection criteria, this newspaper takes into account the original intention of the readers' donations, the supervision and teaching of all sectors, the assistance of educational pioneers, the instructions of the scholarship committee, and the experience of colleagues in handling scholarships in previous years. Before approving scholarships for this year, we would like to have an open discussion with all sectors. The capabilities of our colleagues are limited, and we are concerned that we may not be able to fully meet the ideal standard. Therefore, we sincerely hope that all sectors and the donors will provide enthusiastic guidance in order to further improve. (If you wish to provide feedback, please send your letters directly to the Scholarship Office of this newspaper.)

Screening Steps

The screening steps currently proposed by this newspaper: 1. School grades and conduct; 2. Physical strength; 3. Performance on the examination administered by this newspaper; 4. On-site investigation of family circumstances; 5. Completeness of the administration of the school. Based on the above steps: 1. Those who are from poor families, have lost their fathers or brothers, or are separated from their families, and who apply for scholarships; 2. Those who have excellent grades and conduct at school and perform well on the examination administered by this newspaper; 3. Those who are from poor families and usually work to support their families, have average grades, but have outstanding conduct; 4. Those who attend schools that are administered seriously and have excellent grades; 5. Those who study specialized subjects that are practical; 6. Those who are particularly intelligent and show special talent in major subjects and have been recognized by the school, will all be given priority for approval after taking the examination administered by this newspaper, and will be given preferential aid for tuition and miscellaneous fees. Based on these principles, those who: 1. have poor character; 2. have extremely poor grades; 3. are from families who can still afford to pay; 4. attend schools that do not grade strictly, have poor conduct, and fail the examination administered by this newspaper, and are not from very poor families, will not be approved in order to ensure the responsible allocation of donations. This newspaper hereby clarifies its starting point for the review, namely, adhering to the principle of treating everyone equally, maintaining a rigorous and careful attitude, and striving to approve scholarships for all applicants as the highest principle, and only making exceptions when absolutely necessary.

Scholarship Amount

As for the possibility that the funds held by this newspaper may be insufficient, the responsibility for raising funds will be borne by all sectors of society and by our colleagues. The approval itself will not be affected. If we can receive donations from all sectors in the coming days, it would be fortunate if the revenue and expenditure balance out by the time we do our accounting. Otherwise, after the approved number is determined, if there is a shortfall, we will announce it to the public and we are confident that the generosity of all sectors will gather large sums of money in the shortest possible time to complete this year's scholarship campaign.

Rural pawnshops may request the competent authorities to introduce financial institutions to provide low-interest loans and may receive subsidies from the government for their operating expenses and part or all of the costs of repairing or rebuilding houses. The central or local government may award medals to rural pawnshops with well-organized operations and developed businesses to encourage them. In areas where rural pawnshops and branch pawnshops have already been established, rural pawnshops may not be established repeatedly unless the competent authority deems it necessary due to special needs. They are responsible for the safe keeping of pawned items. If pawned items are damaged due to negligence of duty, compensation should be paid at the current value. If stolen goods, appropriated items, or lost items are mistakenly accepted, the local competent authority should be notified for verification. Business operations may not be suspended unless there are special reasons and approval is obtained from the competent authority.

### Shanghai Market Last Week

Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market The Black Market Eliminated and Prices Gradually Recovering

The financial, industrial, and commercial conditions in Shanghai last week gradually recovered. Except for foreign currency, which was still fluctuating due to secret activities by speculators and non-industry people, changes in the market conditions of other industries seemed to have decreased slightly, and public panic was also disappearing. However, due to the authorities' crackdown on the black market, strict prohibition of illegal transactions, and the tense investigation of stockpiled materials in various warehouses in the city by the Materials Investigation Committee, the metropolis had a situation of high prices with little market. Therefore, the market prices of public bonds, cotton yarn, cloth, and various grains were all sluggish. Due to the imminent resumption of business by the Securities Exchange, stockbrokers were actively buying and selling, and trading was slightly lively, and market prices were also trending upward. Other items such as gold ornaments, silver ingots, military tickets, call loan interest, and the official prices of rice flour and miscellaneous grains remained unchanged.
