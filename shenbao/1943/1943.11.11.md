### Emphasizing Facts, Offering Advice at the Economic Policy Liaison Conference

The Ministry of Industries yesterday commenced a three-day "Local Economic Policy Liaison Conference" in [location blank in original]. Attendees and discussants are economic officials from various provinces and municipalities in charge of local economics and related matters. The purpose of the conference, according to telegraphic reports, is to review the general situation of past local economic measures and to discuss matters related to the promotion of local economic measures in the future. In short, after a round of review and deliberation, it is hoped that economic measures will become more rational and realize the established national economic policy.

The economy of a country is like the blood of the human body. Blood must circulate for life to continue; the economy must be smooth for the national lifeline to survive. How to make the economy rational and smooth is not only to maintain the survival of the national lifeline, but also to seek the prosperity and strength of the nation. It is indeed the path that every country should strive to achieve diligently. The content of economic measures can be roughly divided into two parts: one is to determine economic policy, and the other is to implement economic policy. Determining economic policy is the responsibility of the highest economic authority of the country. Implementing economic policy is the responsibility of the economic authorities in various parts of the country, and it can also be said to be the common responsibility of all the people.

In our country, the body that determines economic policy is the National Economic Commission. In its first plenary meeting in February of this year, it has already determined the wartime economic policy outline. There are already guidelines for how to make the economy smooth. As for the implementation of economic policy, economic bureaus and other specialized agencies have been established in various provinces and cities. Judging from the goals of the economy and the implementing agencies, the scale can be said to be already in place. What remains is only the question of personnel and efforts in implementation. In reality, the determination of economic policies and the establishment of implementing agencies are certainly important, but the actual effectiveness of a smooth economy depends on whether the personnel are appropriate and the degree of effort. Because if the personnel are inappropriate and the efforts are insufficient, then the policies are no different from empty words, and the institutions are merely ornaments, which are not related to a smooth economy and a prosperous nation. Therefore, our overall view of the national economy emphasizes the perfection of policies and the strengthening of institutions, but the integrity of personnel and the diligence in implementation should not be ignored. Based on the above viewpoint, we, standing on the position of the people, have higher expectations for this conference held by the Ministry of Industries than for the previous meetings of the National Economic Commission. In particular, this conference regards the review of past facilities and the discussion of future liaison [blank in original] as equally important, which shows a practical style worthy of praise. We hope that the participating representatives will honestly report the difficulties in economic facilities and jointly discuss solutions. Achievements reported in the style of officialdom are largely unnecessary to list. Unrealistic proposals, rather than being empty and indecisive, should be saved time by not mentioning them. Here, we offer two suggestions for reference:

First, concerning the issue of increasing production, we certainly know that the issue has long been valued by the government, and according to the policy objectives, a promotion plan has been formulated and implemented step by step. However, what we are concerned with is the facts. We demand that the quantity of agricultural and industrial production indeed increase in the statistical figures, and we further demand that the supply of materials be smooth, prices be suppressed, and people's livelihoods be stabilized due to the increase in production. At the same time, increase the strength of external cooperation in the war.

The second is the issue of prices, which also seems to have long been valued and implemented by the authorities. However, similarly, we must see the facts. How to comprehensively limit prices and how to eliminate national accumulation should be achieved with consistent methods.

The scope of the economy is extremely broad, and it is certainly not possible for the Ministry of Industries to completely solve all problems within its powers. However, if the Ministry of Industries can fully exert its effectiveness in undertakings within its jurisdiction and set an example, then other relevant economic departments will naturally be invigorated. May the authorities of the Ministry of Industries and the gentlemen attending the conference work together to achieve this.

The contribution is truly great, and all the people are deeply grateful. In addition to gratitude, I wish you and all the soldiers good health."

### Announcement by the Japanese Headquarters: The Second Battle Result

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 10th that the results of the second naval and air battle off Bougainville Island are as follows: Sunk one battleship (i.e., the battleship reported earlier as heavily damaged); Damaged three large cruisers (heavily damaged), one cruiser or large destroyer; Shot down three aircraft. The Japanese army lost five aircraft due to self-explosion and failure to return. According to the combined results of the second naval and air battle off Bougainville Island, the following has been confirmed so far: Sunk four enemy battleships, two cruisers, three destroyers, and four transport ships. Six or more enemy large cruisers sunk (heavily damaged), four cruisers (or destroyers) and one large transport ship heavily damaged and on fire; Fifteen enemy aircraft shot down. The Japanese side damaged [illegible] aircraft, self-explosion and failure to return, a total of twenty.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to the combined results of the second naval and air battle off Bougainville Island announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 9th and 10th, the Japanese air force sank four enemy battleships, two cruisers, three destroyers, and four transport ships, and other ships sunk or destroyed totaled twenty-four. Fifteen enemy aircraft were shot down before and after, and five Japanese aircraft were also lost. A total of twenty were self-exploded and failed to return. On the 8th, Japanese naval aircraft launched a strong attack on enemy transport fleets and escort fleets near Torokina Point to the southern sea area of Bougainville Island. After several attacks, great results were achieved, as announced by the General Headquarters for the first time on the 9th. According to the report, the Japanese naval aircraft's attack on the enemy was very urgent. Enemy ships were either severely damaged, tilted, or set on fire. Enemy ships desperately fled to avoid the bombing of Japanese aircraft, but ultimately did not escape the target of Japanese aircraft. Japanese Commander Natomi first collided with an enemy ship, followed by three commanders who rammed into the fleet, establishing a glorious achievement and sacrificing heroically. Here, the Japanese naval aircraft team, from the commander down, all had the determination to kill the enemy and regard death as home, and implemented the pursuit battle with superb technology. This great traditional spirit of the Japanese naval aircraft is even more uplifting here.

### Admiral Yonai on the Great Victory: Expressing Thoughts and Encouraging National Efforts to Increase Aircraft Production

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - After hearing the news of the great victory in the second naval and air battle off Bougainville Island, former Prime Minister and Admiral of the Navy Mitsumasa Yonai talked about his thoughts as follows: The magnitude of this battle result is almost unbelievable. Now I can only marvel at the power of the Imperial Navy. The brave air force warriors, disregarding that their gasoline was exhausted, were determined to destroy the enemy and did not expect to return alive. Their fighting spirit of carrying out a forced attack is truly the soul of the Imperial Navy that repays the country with death. The expansion of the battle results is still worth looking forward to. I think that the people of the whole country will be exhausted and express their joy from the bottom of their hearts when they hear this news. The people can absolutely trust our navy, but I hope that the people will not be unsettled by the changes in the war, do not [illegible] by the [illegible], and each protect their duties. This is also the way for the people to repay this great victory. Because of our army's great victory this time, there must be a shaking inside the enemy's navy, and the trust of its people will also be lost. Judging from the organization of its fleet, this will also have a major impact on future operations. Previously, the enemy's counter-offensive operations were mainly based on aircraft carriers, then its aircraft carriers have also sunk or suffered electric damage. The so-called island-hopping operations can be said to be the enemy's only tactic, but now it has been defeated in one fell swoop, which is a fatal blow to the enemy. The enemy's miserable defeat this time, I think, may be due to a wrong understanding of our military strength, but we must never think that we have taken the enemy's life because of this. Therefore, in addition to celebrating, the people must also remember the warning of "Do not [illegible] in victory". I hope that the people will further work hard on the tasks in the rear, especially when the Great East Asia Conference has passed and the strategy for building East Asia has been established. If the people have a feeling that the war will end soon, then it is a great mistake. The Great East Asia Conference is a conference that has just embarked on the first historical meeting of the construction of East Asia. How to promote it still depends on future efforts. This great battle result is the same, it is only a stage before finally defeating Britain and the United States. Therefore, I hope that the people will not be overly excited. Looking at this battle result, the difference between their tactics and spirit can already be seen. The problem from now on is only the problem of quantity. Regarding this point, I also hope that the people will not lag behind the enemy and actively work hard on the production of aircraft.

### The 84th Japanese Ordinary Session of the Diet to Convene on the 24th of Next Month

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - In order to prepare for the affairs of the 84th Ordinary Session of the Diet, the Japanese government decided to proceed with the method of adjusting laws and the budget bill in the cabinet meetings on the 2nd and 4th. Regarding the Diet's policy, it was announced on the 10th that the 84th Ordinary Session of the Diet will be convened on December 24th.

Military Observers Discuss the Meaning of the Naval Battle

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to military observers here, the Japanese naval air force sank or heavily damaged a total of 29 enemy ships in the second naval and air battle off Bougainville Island, which is the largest battle result since the Pearl Harbor operation. According to the announcements by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 9th and 10th, it can be seen that the war in the South Pacific is fierce and the war situation is significant. The Great East Asia War, from the contention for bases to the stage of decisive naval battles, can also be proven here. In this naval battle, the loss of the enemy's main battleships reached four, which also shows that the number of enemy fleets is not small. The position of the main battleship in the navy is no different from the powerful city in the army, which is enough to determine the fate of the naval battle and is the foundation of naval power. Whether it is attack power or defense power, it cannot be compared with other ships. Although in this war, due to the development of military aircraft and changes in naval tactics, the status of battleships has been considered to be re-examined, but its position as the main force of the naval fleet has not changed slightly. In the Great East Asia War, during the Battle of Malaya, the British battleship Prince of Wales and the destroyer were sunk by Japanese aircraft, and the British East Asia fleet was reduced. Therefore, in the naval air battle off Bougainville Island, four American battleships were sunk at the same time, which should be the largest blow to the United States naval power since the start of the war. Cruisers, destroyers, etc. are smaller than battleships, but in today's naval and air battles, they are indispensable foundations. Five enemy American fleets were also broken and sunk in this battle, which shows the enemy's heavy losses. Therefore, this air battle is not only a great victory for the Japanese army, but also enough to show that the "army has a strategic posture that can defeat any counterattack or even attack by the enemy at any time." The Japanese army has already defeated the enemy's counter-offensive attempts, and the impact on its future can be said to be even greater. Since the Japanese army has completely defeated the enemy's strategic [illegible], the Japanese army has gained an advantageous position in the war. Therefore, the enemy can be attacked at any time, and the enemy can only suffer losses again. Therefore, the great battle results in the South Pacific and the advantageous strategic situation should be emphasized by all East Asians in order to complete the Great East Asia War.

Enemy Ship Crew Loss Figures [Illegible] People

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese naval air force, in a [illegible] period of only 14 days.

The total number of crew members on the sunk ships totaled 15,950 people, half of whom were rescued by nearby enemy ships, but at least the number of enemy soldiers killed reached about 7,975 people. The total number of personnel on board enemy ships bombed and sunk often reached 15,750 people. Moreover, this figure is calculated based on the minimum [illegible] standard, and the actual loss of enemy soldiers often far exceeds this figure. Also, the number of enemy aircraft shot down [illegible] 44 aircraft or more, and the number of passengers is at least more than a thousand, so the enemy [illegible] personnel [illegible] loss, the Northern Army is really far beyond expectations.

### Japanese Naval Torpedo Planes Build a Brilliant Victory: Pilots Show Superb Technology

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - Since the Pearl Harbor campaign, the Japanese naval torpedo aircraft team has repeatedly achieved brilliant victories in the naval and air battle off Bougainville Island.

The appropriate time to implement [illegible] warfare is thin? And dawn, using this time is the most important.

In naval warfare, the one who can kill the enemy is the torpedo [illegible] ship first, but the aerial of the three countries of Britain and the United States [illegible], began in Daisho 23 (Republic of China [1934]), [illegible] 356 shots, and it took 4 days to sink. However, the Japanese naval aircraft team sunk far stronger than the Bismarck, and [illegible] called the unsinkable Will Sing [illegible] King, it only took 20 minutes, this alone is enough to show that in Showa 23 (Republic of China 1617), I went with the late Admiral Yamamoto, who was still a colonel at the time, to [illegible] Ocean warships and destroyers are now reduced, and then the former main force [illegible] (bomber team in one fell swoop [illegible] the only remaining battleship group of the Japanese army. At the same time, it also introduces [illegible] dive bombers that are fiercely trained in the sky.

All and Yamaki said often: Indeed, indeed, but the belief in torpedoes has not been shaken in the slightest. [Illegible] is to organize fierce training for torpedo attacks. Now they probably know it well. Please take a look at all the naval battles in the world. [Illegible] is not the Imperial Navy's [illegible] strike team?

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in Central China states that Japanese forces, attacking the routed 66th and 79th Armies, advanced rapidly towards the Bashan Mountains. On the morning of the 6th, they forced a major battle against the main force of the Chongqing 66th Army in the area of Niejiache (22 kilometers southwest of Yidu) and Zhujiaqiao (25 kilometers south of Yidu), initiating a large-scale annihilation operation. Another Japanese unit encircled the main force of the routed 76th Army in the area of Taiqingshan, Heshangdong, and Xinmenshi (south of Xijia). Since the evening of the 8th, the fighting has been extremely fierce. These units, in coordination with Japanese forces south of the Yangtze River, infiltrated Fangjiang, the stronghold of the Chongqing 66th Army's 185th Division, at dusk on the 7th and completely occupied it.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in Central China, a certain unit of the Japanese army, after attacking Mojiawangjia Factory, Nuanshui Street, and Liujiachang, continued to fiercely pursue the routed Chongqing 79th Army, advancing rapidly towards the Bashan area.

Sun Lianzhong's Troops Repeatedly Collapse

Central China Frontline, 10th (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army launched its offensive in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the more than 40 divisions under Sun Lianzhong of the Chongqing Sixth War Area have actively attempted to restore their combat strength by undertaking replenishment preparations and strengthening their defenses. However, due to repeated defeats, their combat strength has become extremely weak and impossible to restore. Therefore, when the Japanese army initiated its offensive this time, the Chongqing 29th Army Group, the 44th Army, the 14th Army Group, the 79th Army, and the 66th Army, with a total force of 65,000 men, were on the verge of annihilation. Sun Lianzhong's attempts to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the anti-Axis forces' counter-offensive against Japan and the coordinated operations in Burma to launch an offensive in Central China have now become a pipe dream.

### Minister Arita: A Bright Future for Asian Nations - Reflections on the Greater East Asia Conference

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu recently met with a group of reporters to discuss his impressions of the Greater East Asia Conference, as follows: "The fact that the heads of state of various countries voluntarily participated in this conference, expressed their opinions passionately in the discussions, and successfully resolved various matters is the most profound impression I have. The Five Principles of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration can be described as an international policy that transcends ancient and modern, East and West. Based on these principles, we can know that a bright future will surely come to the countries of Greater East Asia. None of the Five Principles of the Declaration contains any self-serving, exclusive, or exclusionary nature. Each respects the other, and seeks harmony among the nations of East Asia. This has become the common spirit of all the representatives. The representatives of Greater East Asia all agree with these principles, and it is by no means just a slogan, but the faith of the Japanese people. The representatives must have deeply understood from Japan's words and deeds that the speeches of the Japanese Prime Minister and members of parliament in the Diet and other statements are completely consistent. Japan's Greater East Asia policy comes from the sincere heart of the nation. Furthermore, the participants of the conference all believe that (the Greater East Asia War) is not only a war for the survival of Japan, but also a war for the survival of the countries of Greater East Asia. This point is even stronger in other countries than in Japan, so they cannot but share life and death with Japan and cooperate to complete this great war. One representative said that in this Greater East Asia policy, he has already seen the bright future for himself. They said that this Greater East Asia War is a "war of liberation for Asia," or a "war of freedom for East Asia," or a "war of independence for Asia." If this war fails, not only will their independence not be guaranteed, but their suffering will be greater than before. All the representatives of Greater East Asia believe that the enemy's war aim is to oppress the nations of Greater East Asia and seize colonies. The war aim of Greater East Asia, however, is to implement a great principle that runs through ancient and modern, East and West. Therefore, with this spirit, the Greater East Asia War will surely be won. This conference opened with this kind of spirit, so its future is indeed worthy of anticipation. The Greater East Asia Policy is neither an exclusionary policy like the Monroe Doctrine, nor a hypocritical measure like the Atlantic Charter. The representatives of all countries believe that the Five Principles of Greater East Asia are the great principles for establishing world peace. I truly share this feeling, and in order to fully realize the achievements of this conference, we must all work hard and move forward together."

### Chongqing Promulgates New Conscription Law

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from Chongqing, the difficulty of replenishing troops in the Chongqing army is becoming increasingly serious. It is reported that the Chongqing Ministry of Military Affairs promulgated a new conscription law on October 25th as a countermeasure to actively replenish troops. According to the new conscription law, all young men aged 20 are subject to conscription. However, the implementing regulations further stipulate that, in order to respond to emergencies, the age of conscription will be lowered to 19 as a first step. If the number of recruits is still insufficient, a second measure will be implemented to raise the age of conscription to 25. It seems that Chongqing's intention is to conscript all non-disabled persons regardless of age. In addition, guerrilla units and miscellaneous troops will be reorganized in an effort to assemble the number of regular troops. At the same time, joint responsibility will be strengthened, and all soldiers in a unit where a deserter occurs will be severely punished in order to prevent desertion. However, it seems that Chongqing's desperate measures will ultimately fail.

### German Counteroffensive in Nevel, Fierce Fighting in the Entire Kyiv Area

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: The Soviet army has created a new center of effort north and northwest of Nevel, so the autumn battle on the Eastern Front is increasing in scale. The current fighting in the Nevel area is clearly related to the fighting in the Kyiv area, and the Soviet intent is obvious. The Soviets believe that it is of great importance to eliminate the threat to the development of their offensive caused by the interlocking of German forces in the central and northern sectors. During the battle for Kyiv, the Soviet army also launched intense offensives in the Nirol area. The German army was extremely resilient in both defense and counterattack. The German counteroffensive south of Nevel was victorious, thereby removing the threat to the west and north sides of the city and completely improving its positions in the area. Due to the marshy terrain, the positions of the enemy and friendly forces are so intertwined that it is difficult to discern their approximate lines. Although the Soviet army has continuously reinforced, it has made no significant progress west and northeast of Nevel, and is obstructed by the firm German iron wall, frequently suffering heavy losses and retreating. The German resistance is more tenacious than before, and the Soviet army must pay a great price. The Soviet army's efforts to push back the Germans to the west and south have failed, but it cannot yet be said that the Germans have suddenly changed the strategy they have adopted for this year's campaign. On Sunday, the Soviet army's attack on Crimea was still unsuccessful, and the German command has not abandoned this important Black Sea base.

### Chairman of the French Committee of National Liberation in North Africa, Giraud, Resigns Suddenly; de Gaulle Exercises Exclusive Power

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Algiers, Giraud, Chairman of the French Committee of National Liberation, suddenly resigned on the 9th. The committee has always had two chairmen, one being Giraud and the other being de Gaulle, who were mutually opposed. The reason for Giraud's resignation is still unclear.

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – Havas reports: General Giraud has resigned from his position as co-chairman of the French National Committee, but will remain as commander of the French army.

Lineup of the Reorganized French National Committee

Madrid, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Algiers, due to the resignation of General Giraud, the French Committee of National Liberation in North Africa had to be reorganized. The lineup after the reorganization is as follows: Chairman: General de Gaulle; State Councilors: General Catroux, Philip, and Tixier; Foreign Affairs: Massigli; Interior: d'Astier; Land Army and Aviation: Le Troguer; Navy: Jacquinot; Colonies: Pleven; Information: Bonne; Transport and Commerce: Merlier; Relief for Prisoners of War: Frenay; Labor and Social Welfare: Tixier; Education: Bydault; Production and Commerce: Diethelm. A communique issued yesterday emphasized that this reorganization will not affect General Giraud's position as Supreme Commander of the French rebel army. The reorganized committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting this morning.

### Churchill Acknowledges German Military Strength Remains Powerful; German Bombing is Very Effective

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to Havas, London dispatch 1: British Prime Minister Churchill, in a speech at the inauguration of the new Lord Mayor of London, Smith, warned the people not to be complacent, saying that the war in 1944 would be even greater than the Battle of Gettysburg, and British and American soldiers would have to make great sacrifices. Currently, many people mistakenly believe that the war is about to end, and the current environment does not allow for neglecting precautions. Germany currently has 400 divisions, and the danger has not diminished. If the Allied forces do not make any major strategic mistakes, the war in 1944 can be brought to an end. But in any case, the Allied forces must not base their strategy on the assumption that Germany is about to collapse. He went on to say that the air offensive against Germany is the greatest military effort by the Allied forces against Germany, and that the German bombing of Britain will also have a significant effect on the domestic front, and that the enemy air force may launch new forms of bombing at any time. On the political front, he hopes to meet with Roosevelt and Stalin in the future, and Foreign Secretary Eden will return from Cairo within the next week. Finally, he advocated for unifying domestic affairs, as political disputes are not appropriate at the moment.

### Situation on the Italian Front

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – On the 9th, the German military authorities announced the situation on the Italian front: "The battle on the Italian front is actually a war of attrition. German units are retreating to new defensive lines using organized delaying tactics. The specifics of these new defensive lines, which are the main line of German resistance, cannot be disclosed." It has been two weeks since the Italian front entered a state of attrition, and the current situation is as follows: 1. The British Eighth Army, which has the greatest numerical advantage, is currently engaged with the German left flank defense forces on the eastern front, and the fighting is approaching the Sangro River. 2. The second battlefield is in the upper reaches of the Calchaio River, namely the area from the bend of the river to the road of Venafro-Rotonda-Cassino and the Isernia area. Recently, the anti-Axis forces have mobilized a large force in that area in an attempt to break through, but they have been crushed by the German army. 3. The third battlefield is from Croche to the Tyrrhenian coast. Recently, the fighting in this area has intensified, but the general situation has not changed.

### Weapon Lend-Lease Act and the Ugly Disputes Between Britain and America

A Morning of American Congressional Criticism

Recently, five U.S. senators who inspected the front lines and returned home made speeches criticizing Britain, causing a great uproar in Anglo-American relations. British newspapers are currently rising to defend themselves against this criticism. One of the important issues is the controversy centered on the Weapon Lend-Lease Act. The Weapon Lend-Lease Act made the United States the de facto arsenal of the anti-Axis front, supplying the anti-Axis countries with military supplies, and stipulating what kind of reliable method of compensation. This is a major feature of the U.S. war policy in this war. From the time it was formulated, it encountered opposition in the U.S. Congress and was difficult to produce. The center of the opposition argument said: "What will Britain take, and what method will it use to compensate the United States as a price?" U.S. aid to Britain naturally did not take the method of war debts. From that point of view, the government's answer was also extremely ambiguous. The problem remained vague until the United States entered the war, and it remains so to this day.

The general British sentiment on this issue is roughly as follows:

"What is the Weapon Lend-Lease Act?" "An organization that takes things from the United States without paying."

"So: What does the United States get?"

"Isn't it the air base?"

The Application of the Lend-Lease Act

This time, the criticism of Britain by the five U.S. senators raised this issue again. The reason why it is particularly emphasized is that the Weapon Lend-Lease Act is the biggest weapon for the United States to carry out the war. At the same time, the most acute opposition between British and American interests is lurking here. Since the implementation of the Weapon Lend-Lease Act on March 11, 1941, until the end of June this year, the budget amount considered expendable in the Congress was 24.6 billion yuan, of which 12.9 billion yuan has been spent. After the extension of the law at the end of June, approximately 800 million to 1 billion yuan is spent every month from July to the present.

The number of countries using the Weapon Lend-Lease Act has gradually increased, and now exceeds 44 countries. Most of the materials in the Weapon Lend-Lease Act are of course transported to Britain and the Soviet Union. According to Roosevelt's announcement at the end of July this year, among the total output of 14 billion, 50% are military equipment, 21% are industrial products, 14% are food, and 15% are ships and their repair costs, and equipment improvement costs for factories producing Weapon Lend-Lease Act materials. However, the total exports to Britain at the end of June were about 4 billion yuan, and the total exports to the Soviet Union were about 2 billion yuan. Therefore, it can be seen that most of the above-mentioned weapons, industrial products, and food were transported to Britain and the Soviet Union. 1 billion yuan per month accounts for about 15% of the total U.S. military production. Speaking of various weapons separately, for every 100, 17 are bombers, 25 are fighter jets, 22 are light tanks, and 30 are heavy tanks, which are exported to the anti-Axis countries according to the Weapon Lend-Lease Act.

Britain and the United States Each Have Their Own Views　　The above is the actual application of the Weapon Lend-Lease Act seen from the United States. Britain, which has benefited the most from the lease, has received a total of more than 5 billion yuan of leased materials. What did Britain pay for this? It is absolutely certain that it is not cash, and 90% of the British people expected to provide air bases, but it did not happen. The United States, fearing domestic criticism, cited the following figures to defend Britain. From June last year to May this year, Britain supplied 1.36 million tons of military supplies and 2.17 million tons of materials to the U.S. military. The British side also began to defend themselves after the criticism of Britain by the U.S. senators became an issue. For example, the Daily Mail said: "If the United States says that, then we also have a say." Therefore, it detailed the British claims against the United States. According to this: "Until now, Britain does not require the shipping costs of British ships to transport U.S. troops, nor does it require domestic railway transportation costs. This is of course equivalent to the payable expenses for the materials lent by the Weapon Lend-Lease Act. Similarly, U.S. ships in British-owned ports around the world pay repair and mooring fees, as well as the telegrams, telephones, lights, food expenses, etc. used by the U.S. side, as well as the fees for 25,000 British citizens working for the U.S. military in the British mainland, none of which have been claimed from the United States. The food needed by the U.S. military stationed in Britain this year, at most, has reached 400 million pounds. Isn't this also a counter-payment to the United States?"

Britain also disguised the materials imported into the United States as domestic products and secretly transferred them to other countries, using them to expand its own power. The United States criticized this, and Britain responded by mentioning the following facts:

The milk transported to North Africa in November last year, isn't it really to buy the hearts of the natives to the Anglo-American landing forces? And although it was milk transported from the United States and distributed by the American Red Cross, it was actually imported into British reserves.

British Newspapers Strongly Refute

The Daily Mail used this argument to expose the inside story between the two countries, which has always been very secret, to refute the United States. The newspaper also listed various facts, such as: not only Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, last year supplied the MacArthur army with 235 million pounds of food: the number of tanks and aircraft supplied by Britain to the Soviet Union is equal to that of the United States, and Canada is the same as the United States. According to its own Weapon Lend-Lease Act, it supplies the Soviet Union and Australia with about 250 million gold pounds of materials, which is equivalent to twelve times what the United States supplies in terms of population ratio. And the conclusion says: No country has a precise standard that can determine the most contribution to the war. Cash, etc., is not the most suitable standard. Assuming that a British pilot drives a U.S.-made bomber worth 80,000 yuan, fighting with 4,000 yuan of domestic-made bombs, and flies to Berlin to bomb, then the British debt to the United States is 84,000 yuan. But if that pilot dies in battle, how much can we ask for?"

The above is just an example of the British newspapers' most hatred of the United States. This argument, although there are differences in degree, seems to be the atmosphere of support. The Weapon Lend-Lease Act was originally a method of assisting the anti-Axis countries that the United States came up with in the situation where it was impossible to think of a solution to the war debt problem of the previous war. In today's drastic changes in the war situation, it has reached its limit. The opposition of interests between Britain and the United States, which was always embellished in the past, is now inevitably and clearly exposed due to this problem. This is also in common with the phenomenon that various problems at the Moscow Three-Power Conference are about to explode at any time. (Translated by Xiang from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, October 28)

He published the following: "I am very interested in this visit. In terms of art, I am especially interested in arts and crafts. Personal spectrum can express cultural code ideas. For other departments, I have two points to think about: Many of the daily necessities on display are substitutes, such as chemical resins for water and iron. In small countries, it is said that the people are responding quickly to material and emergency authority models. Tools are used as decorations, and the utensils of porcelain are not separated from the group, but lack artistry. They should be harmonized with each other. For example, the folk utensils of the Japanese state are often made with righteousness. I hope that Chinese folk artists will follow suit."

### A Large Quantity of Coal Catty Will Be Shipped to Shanghai in the Short Term, and the Reduced Production of Coal Balls is Worth Noting

News Revealed by Foreign Huggers: The authorities in charge of this city are keenly aware that the shortage of coal catty is closely related to the revival of industry and commerce. Therefore, they are making great efforts to smooth out the source of coal catty. After active progress, it is heard that a large spring of coal catty has been wired to Wei Jiao, and it can be expected that it will be transferred to this place for sale within the teaching period. At that time, the authorities will still fairly assign each legitimate user to avoid being artificially inflated and illegally raising market prices.

Coal Distribution to Users Has Not Been Interrupted

Shanghai Reporters Zuo Zong learned that the number of fish and white coal catties stored in this city is more difficult than the small amount of shouting that was used two or three months ago, but all the existing stocks are still enough for the needs of the entire city for about two months. Therefore, the coal distribution to users has not been interrupted. However, the reason why the amount of this investment has gradually decreased is due to the obstruction of the tour, not because the product is less from Yingdi. Today, the authorities in charge of the ant transport meal have actively tried to change the maintenance. Because it is a large spring of coal, the transport Zhao Ping can be expected.

The Supply of Coal Beads Should Be Restored Immediately

The Pingling Coal Ball is a necessary fuel for the people and should not be cut off even for a day.

All coal ball manufacturers should be aware of the difficulties of the times and continue production to meet the needs of the citizens. However, because the supply of coal balls has not yet been fully restored, residents are looking for other secret fuel alternatives, resulting in soaring market prices for charcoal, firewood, and urban coal, which has a great impact on the city's expenses.

Economic Review

### Increased Production Requires Avoiding Bankruptcy First

Increased production requires avoiding bankruptcy first. This is a prerequisite for every sector of local products and foreign trade, especially for agricultural production. For thousands of years, China has relied on agriculture, and its agricultural productivity is as strong as the farmers. However, this most powerful productive force is also struggling at the lowest standard of living today. Speaking of the foundation of productive forces, as this newspaper previously commented, "Due to the impact of the ongoing war, our farmers are not only exhausted but also on the verge of collapse. Therefore, the production of agricultural products is also declining year by year." Therefore, revitalizing the impoverished rural areas is the key to increasing both industrial and agricultural production in China.

However, revitalizing China's rural areas, which encompass the "vast majority of the people," is by no means an easy task. On one hand, it requires the government to gather collective wisdom to develop detailed plans for rural revitalization. On the other hand, it also requires the people to pool their strength to implement detailed rural policies.

In recent years, rural loans have been much talked about. Since the Bank of Communications was ordered to handle agricultural loans, it has issued tens of millions of yuan in rural loans. Moreover, it is cooperating with the local banks in this city. The Zhejiang-Shanghai banking industry is also planning, under the supervision of the Central Government's business department and the guidance of the Central Reserve Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks, to establish an agricultural banking consortium in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, to facilitate the granting of rural loans. This shows that the need to avoid bankruptcy before increasing production has become a key point of public recognition.

### Central China to Establish Raw Hide Purchasing Company; Purchasing Cooperatives Already Established

Regarding the establishment of an organization to centrally purchase leather (raw hides) within the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, both Chinese and Japanese parties are actively preparing. According to this newspaper's reporter from the business community, this new centralized leather organization has been confirmed to be jointly operated by Chinese and Japanese parties, with a planned capital of ten million yuan, and is proposed to be named "Raw Hide Purchasing Company." It is expected to be formally established in the near future. However, the internal organizational system has not yet been finalized. Furthermore, according to information obtained by this reporter from leather merchants, the area with the highest leather production (mainly cattle hides) in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces of Central China is Bengbu, followed by Wuhu, and then Ningbo. The production volume in other areas is very small. The purchasing organization in Bengbu was established at the end of last month and is named "Bengbu Raw Hide Purchasing Cooperative." The similar cooperative in Wuhu will also be established soon. Furthermore, the purchasing cooperative in eastern Zhejiang has also been completed in Ningbo.

### Stock Exchange Regulations; Duties of the Supervisory Committee

Since the reopening of the Chinese Stock Exchange on the 8th, trading in the market has gradually returned to normal. Most brokers have installed telephones. Only a very small number of brokers have delayed the reopening date due to telephone installation problems. It is understood that the relevant authorities are deeply concerned about the reopening of the stock exchange, so the Supervisory Committee of the Stock Exchange was established early on, and the Organizational Rules of the Supervisory Committee were promulgated, with the aim of closely supervising all business operations of the stock exchange. The main points are summarized below: The Supervisory Committee may conduct random inspections of all account books and other documents related to the business operations of brokers in the exchange, to determine whether there are any violations of laws or regulations in their business activities. Brokers in the exchange must absolutely obey the orders or inquiries of the Supervisory Committee, and those who deliberately delay or refuse to comply will be reported to the relevant authorities by the Supervisory Committee for disciplinary action. If the Supervisory Committee discovers any falsification or illegal activities in the exchange's business accounts or business operations, it may immediately report the matter to the relevant financial authorities. The Supervisory Committee will submit a monthly work report to the Ministry of Finance by the 10th of each month, reporting the business operations of the exchange, the market conditions, and various related tables and records. Public officials are not allowed to participate in buying or selling on the exchange. Violators will be subject to disciplinary action for dereliction of duty.

### Free Movement of Leather Goods within Three Provinces

The Leather Industry Association previously reported that the transportation of leather goods by its affiliated associations along the way has been met with difficulties, and that the shipping companies, not knowing the truth, have refused to transport them, affecting business. The association then turned to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for assistance. According to this reporter's investigation, leather goods are major commodities, but according to the "Provisional Regulations on the Control of Wartime Material Movement," the import and export of goods within the Shanghai area does not require the approval of the Chamber of Commerce, and the free movement is allowed within the three provinces. The Chamber of Commerce has already instructed the governments of each province and city to order the police departments to notify all inspection stations in their respective jurisdictions, to facilitate the transportation of goods.

### Bank Joint Reserve Committee Stipulates Discount Rate for Public Bonds; Face Value to be Central Reserve Certificates

The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee, because the public treasury certificates used by the basic members of the committee were still in silver currency, due to practical needs, the committee distributed them to various banks for subscription. They were changed to Central Reserve Certificates at face value, and the number of certificates to be subscribed was determined by the committee. Guarantee deposits were required. The committee has already begun issuing them separately. Regarding the discount interest for public bonds, the standing committee of the committee has set it at eight jiao per thousand yuan per day, which is one jiao less than the interbank lending rate of five jiao per day.

### First District Economic Office Hosts Reporters

In addition to reporting the above matters at the meeting, the opinions of all parties will also be solicited on the economic issues, so as to adopt and implement the various economic decisions.

Industrial and Commercial Visit

### Wing On Real Estate Co., Ltd.

The latent real estate industry has been flourishing, and the turnover has been increasing. The most important reason for the prosperity of the real estate industry is that the price increase since the war has been the most frequent, and most investors are also paying attention to the security of real estate after the end of the war. This is a visit to Wing On Real Estate Company, a large-scale company in the industry. The details of the visit are as follows:

Wing On Real Estate Company was established on August 7, 1942, with the business scope of real estate investment, real estate mortgage, real estate leasing, real estate trading and mortgage agency, construction, design, construction supervision, and property valuation. The chairman of the board is Chen Renlan, and the supervisors are Zhu Bo Lai, Chou Tianxing, Jin Zongxu Cheng, Ye Fu Hai, Zhu Ru Tang, etc. The company's original capital was 1.5 million yuan, which was increased by 8.5 million yuan at the shareholders' extraordinary meeting on February 14 of this year, making the total capital of 10 million yuan. All of the investment has been made in real estate, and most of it is in immovable property. According to the detailed valuation of the construction experts, it has already exceeded the original amount of capital by 34 cents. The company's natural appreciation of assets is about 8-9 times. The business income for the current fiscal year is expected to be between 1.2 million yuan and 1.5 million yuan, which is a new profit in addition to the natural appreciation of the above-mentioned assets. As for the company's properties, in addition to the 24 mu of land at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Guangdong Road and Lailin Road, which are built with a large number of four-style houses, residences, and stockpiles, the Wing On Warehouse (i.e., the military expansion of the treasury) is one of the main assets, which can generate a surplus of about 500,000 yuan per year. The construction of the warehouse was completed in 1933. It is located at the corner of Geshu Xiao Road and Huimin Road (formerly Pei Ying'er Road), facing the Huangpu River, and can be reached from Yih Road (formerly Yih Road).

### The Decisive Battle and the Awakening of the Japanese People: A Dialogue between Tokutomi Sohō, Honda Tatatarō, and Tomita

Tokutomi: The China problem is often raised now. Mr. Honda has a wealth of knowledge on this issue. Regarding the situation in China, Mr. Mizutani served as a diplomat in China, from secretary to ambassador. He has personally experienced the recent history of China up to the present. So I would like to hear your high opinion. —— Recently, Chinese writers have often come to Japan, and Japanese writers have also gone to China, talking about the issue of Eastern unity in thought. It seems that many of the people who come from China are novelists and writers of new-style poetry, and the people who go from here are also mostly of this type. These people are not very clear about what is Eastern thought, and what is considered Eastern thought. Therefore, whether there is a so-called foundation for Eastern unity, upon careful examination, isn't that something beyond comprehension?

### The Necessity of Ideological Restoration

I would first like to give a major warning to our Chinese compatriots in spirit. In China, in any case, ideological restoration is most necessary today. China should return to the way of Confucius. Speaking of myself, I am very ashamed. I was born into a Confucian family. My father established himself in the world as a Confucian scholar, and I myself was also educated in the family tradition. Perhaps due to impetuosity, I was very disgusted with Confucianism when I was young. I only thought of the bad aspects of Confucianism. My first book was to ridicule Confucianism. It seems that in Meiji 17, I published a book "Free Morality and Confucianism", and I printed 300 copies of that book and gave it to people. That was to say that Confucianism was very useless. Generally speaking, it was an attack on Japanese Zhu Xi's philosophy. Since then, the times have changed, and sixty years have passed. During that period, I saw research on various Eastern things, and I also saw thinking on various things. I thought that Confucianism was something that did not suit Chinese life in China, but so-called Confucian scholars, whether good or bad, have dominated China for nearly five generations. If you say 9,000 years is too long, then let's say 4,000 years! In short, Confucianism not only applied to China, but also spread to Japan. The daily ethics and morals that Japanese people possess now are generally integrated with the spirit of Confucianism. If we talk about Eastern thought, then there is no political thought other than that. The most reliable way to carry forward the thoughts of China and Japan is to use Confucianism to carry it forward!

### The Essence of Confucianism

The spirit of Confucius, to borrow the words of Count Gotō Shimpei, is "the moralization of politics." If we can act accordingly, that is naturally very good. Confucianism has undergone more than two thousand years of experience since Confucius. Confucianism has been integrated with the character, customs, tastes, thoughts, and all aspects of life of Eastern people, and has become bone, blood, and flesh. Just as Japan has returned to Emperor Jimmu, the Chinese people cannot but return to the principles of Confucius. This is the most necessary thing. If China wants to take this opportunity to sincerely reform its thoughts, then it must explore here.

The so-called progress does not necessarily mean that new things are progress. Returning to good things from the past is also a kind of progress. Just like people in the past were very healthy, but today they are gradually weakening. If they can return to the same healthy body as before, it is also progress for the body. The situation is exactly the same. However, I think this requires a great effort to cheer up.

We are not saying that ideologically, we should completely adopt what Confucius said and what Song Zi wrote without changing a word. The spirit of Confucianism is order is a basic. Speaking of Eastern thought, order is the most necessary. That order is the thought of . The term "ritual" mentioned in Confucianism is order. And there is also philosophy in Confucianism. For example:

Heaven and earth are in their proper places, and all things are nourished.

When we read the Zhong Yong, there are many philosophical thoughts in it. From daily ethical thoughts to what humans should do, it is completely said. If the Chinese people do not return there, everything will be in vain. Mr. Honda probably also knows this very well: that Chinese ancestors, sages, and outstanding figures also know the affairs of China in great detail.

### Chinese People Don't Know About China

For example, Liang Qichao, Wang Guowei, etc., who are in the same era as us, know the affairs of China best. Today, the average Chinese politician does not know much about the affairs of China. They know neither history nor literature, and what they know about China is probably only a little knowledge of drama. They have nothing to give us in terms of knowledge about China. Not only that, but they mostly do not have the cultivation, or everything else, that they should receive from us. A Chinese person who studies a little about the national conditions is already considered very good. So I think that when it comes to ideological unity, shouldn't we start from this place?

As this gradually progresses, I think everyone will be able to respect and love each other. However, I don't understand what the thoughts of the so-called Chinese literati are like now.

### Grit Your Teeth and Build Victory

Honda: Twenty years ago, the phrase "The revolution has not yet succeeded" was not Sun Wen's last words. The revolution is still in progress. So at that time, the situation in China was just like the situation in the Meiji Era, when the People's Rights Movement was in full swing, to overthrow the clan cliques. At that time, the Freedom Party, led by Bo Tian, ​​put forward the natural human rights theory and the national covenant constitutional theory advocated by Voltaire and Rousseau. Chinese friends have performed all the phenomena of this transitional era. However, this is only after the completion of the Greater East Asia War, under the guidance of Japan, to regenerate into a new country, learning from our era of European and American dominance in the Meiji 20s and 30s. On national thought, China should also return to the Confucian spirit mentioned by Mr. Tokutomi and concretely express it in things. In this way, no matter how hard we want to endure, we should grit our teeth and build a glorious victory in the Greater East Asia War: (The end) (Xiang: From the Western Daily News on October 22nd)

### Christian Orphanage for Refugees; Education Expenses Will Soon Be Cut Off; Difficult to Maintain, Pity to Close

Our orphanage has been in operation for three years, specializing in providing education and care for poor, distressed children and street children. In their spare time, they learn agriculture, animal husbandry, tailoring, weaving, and other skills so that they can support themselves when they leave the orphanage. There are currently 102 children, both boys and girls. In the past few months, the cost of education and care has been 17,000 yuan per month, but there has been no specific funding. The required expenses all depend on the generous members of the Christian Church of Mud Pond, who personally raise monthly donations or temporary donations from enthusiastic people from all walks of life to help. Among them, the donations from several cotton industry tycoons were particularly large.

Recently, due to the government's promulgation of decrees to purchase cotton cloth and cotton yarn, the cotton industry has been greatly affected. Those who were able to enthusiastically donate and support our orphanage in the past are now unable to continue donating monthly. In addition, the cotton cloth prepared by our orphanage for making children's clothing has also been stockpiled, and it is not known when it can be moved. As autumn is approaching, if donations are not sustained, meals will inevitably be cut. If the stored cloth cannot be retrieved, then the children's autumn clothes, clothing, and bedding will also be without resources. If this is the case, then the original intention of our colleagues to set up the orphanage to take in the suffering children will be reversed, making them suffer from hunger and cold. If it is closed down and the children are dismissed, the previous efforts of those who have spent money and efforts will be in vain, which is not worth regretting. But the suffering children who originally had no home, who have received several years of education and their lives are on the right track, will lose education and care again. Regardless of whether it is for the individual, society, or the country, it is a great loss. Therefore, we appeal to enthusiastic volunteers to generously offer their compassion and donate funds to help; at the same time, we will find ways to help retrieve the cloth in time and rush to make autumn and winter clothing. Our orphanage will be very fortunate, and the hundred or so suffering children will be very fortunate. Shanghai Christian Orphanage for Refugees, Cao Lane A28, Columbia Road,
