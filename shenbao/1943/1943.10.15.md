### Discussion on Reorganizing National Education in Shanghai

The prosperity or decline of a nation, the rise or fall of its politics, all depend on the growth or decline of talent. Talent cannot be obtained without cultivation, and the method of cultivation lies in education. Therefore, all countries, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, that wish for their national fortunes to prosper, invariably attach importance to education, and especially to national education. This is because national education is the mother of all education. Since the 19th century, advanced countries around the world have successively promulgated compulsory education laws, stipulated the age at which children are forced to attend school, and improved the treatment of elementary school teachers, making it a lifelong career for them. All of these are characteristics of the importance attached to national education. Therefore, education can be popularized, talents emerge in large numbers, and the country prospers. Our country has never attached importance to education. Educational expenditures account for a very small proportion of the national and local annual expenditures, and whenever the government's finances are tight, it often suspends or reduces educational funding to make up for the shortfall in other military and political expenditures. As a result, the news of overdue salaries and teachers going on strike is often seen in newspapers. Even if salaries can be paid on time, teachers' salaries are generally very low, insufficient for supporting their families. Therefore, intelligent and talented people, except for those with great aspirations for sacrifice, mostly despise the education profession and do not pursue it. With such a state of education, how can the goal of cultivating talent be achieved? How can it be achieved?

Because public funding is stretched thin, public schools cannot be popularized, so private schools have emerged in response. Among them, there are certainly those who take nurturing talent as their mission, but the majority are purely commercial in nature. Whether the air and light in the school buildings are suitable for hygiene standards? Whether the teachers' knowledge and experience are adequate and pleasant? These are not the questions asked. Their sole purpose is to collect more tuition and spend less, to fill their own pockets. As for enrollment methods, they compete to be different and show off, using advertisements and leaflets as tools of attraction. As a result, parents who are blind to choice, few do not fall into their trap. The loss of fathers and brothers' money is still limited, but the waste of children's time is already regrettably unrecoverable. Therefore, those with good intentions all call these schools "study shops" and advocate that they should be banned if they are unsuccessful, so as not to mislead students. This is by no means an excessive measure. In recent years, the prices of all goods have been high, and it is difficult to make a living. Surely no one is not oppressed by the pressure of life. However, the hardship of life is probably no greater than that of elementary school teachers. Although the burden on students' parents is increasing daily, the treatment of elementary school teachers has not seen a proportionate improvement. We constantly hear the appeals of elementary school teachers, saying either "I can't even get enough to eat for three meals, what energy do I have to teach?" or "I spend all year educating other people's children, only to find that my own children are too poor to have the opportunity to be educated." Under these circumstances, it is absolutely impossible to expect elementary school teachers to serve with peace of mind. From a personal perspective, for the sake of our children's studies; from a broader perspective, for the future of the entire nation, we should all speak out loudly and eliminate this bad phenomenon with effective methods. Moreover, at the same time, there are many students who are at risk of dropping out of school at any time because they cannot afford tuition. We feel that the elimination of this phenomenon cannot be delayed any longer. Judging from the enthusiastic support of scholarships and grain assistance funds by people in the community in recent years, everyone recognizes the relationship between national education and the future of the country, and they also sympathize with the situation of elementary school teachers. We are now going a step further, hoping that national education in Shanghai can be fundamentally improved, and we believe that people in the community will also give it the same sympathy and support.

We are not saying that the situation of secondary and higher education in Shanghai is satisfactory, but we feel that reorganizing national education is the most urgent task, so we advocate that reorganizing education in Shanghai should start with reorganizing national education in Shanghai.

In the situation of countries around the world, receiving compulsory national education is both the obligation and the right of the people, so national schools in various countries are established by the state and are not charged. The financial situation of our country and the tax burden on the people are far from comparable to those of other countries, so it is inherently impossible to object to public schools charging tuition and allowing the establishment of private schools to supplement the public schools. However, in terms of the management of private schools, since there are laws and regulations to follow, they should be strictly enforced in accordance with the law, and should not be allowed to become empty words. And today, such bad phenomena occur, and it cannot be said that it is not the neglect of the competent education authorities. We now specifically excerpt the points related to school fees and teacher qualifications in the Elementary School Law and Elementary School Regulations as follows, for the review of the competent education authorities and the research of those who are enthusiastic about education issues:

Article 16 of the Elementary School Law stipulates that private elementary school tuition fees shall be no more than three yuan per person per semester for the primary level and no more than six yuan for the higher level.

Article 57 of the Revised Elementary School Regulations stipulates that, except in special circumstances where special approval is obtained from the competent education authorities, temporary donations for library buildings may be raised from the families of more affluent children, and no fees may be collected from children.

Article 56 of the Revised Elementary School Regulations stipulates that essential school supplies for elementary schools may be issued by the school or a consumer cooperative may be organized to sell them to children at very low prices.

Article 62 of the Revised Elementary School Regulations stipulates the qualifications of elementary school class teachers and specialized teachers. Article 63 stipulates that those who do not have the qualifications stipulated in the above article shall be subject to examination. Article 67 stipulates that qualified teachers shall apply to the competent education authorities for registration. Article 68 stipulates that elementary schools shall only hire teachers who have been registered and announced.

Judging from the above articles, it can be seen that the legal provisions are extremely complete, but the problem is that they have not been implemented. In the case of Shanghai, it was not surprising that this phenomenon occurred in the past when the concessions had not been taken back and the political orders were not unified. But now that the public offices in both districts one and eight have been established at the same time, and Chinese people are handling Chinese affairs, especially something that is extremely important to the country and the nation, it seems that it cannot be ignored any longer. Moreover, the financial situation in both districts one and eight is quite good. In fact, it is not absolutely impossible to increase educational expenditures a little. Regarding the reorganization work, we have only the following five points to suggest:

Request the public offices in both districts one and eight to establish more public complete elementary schools, carefully select teachers in accordance with the prescribed qualifications, and especially reduce tuition fees and set up more free places, as a model, and to benefit the poor.

Conduct registration of private elementary schools, strictly review the income and expenditure of each school, and publicly solicit cooperation from parents and teachers of each school to report tuition fees and treatment, and then, taking into account the general expenditure situation and the affordability of ordinary families, determine uniform tuition standards. (And absolutely prohibit the collection of any fees under false pretenses.) All insufficient funds shall be subsidized by the municipal authorities under the municipal expenditure item or by publicly raising educational donations.

Conduct registration of elementary school teachers (those who do not have the teacher qualifications stipulated in Article 62 of the Elementary School Regulations shall be allowed to register after passing the examination.) And stipulate that in the future, schools shall only hire teachers who have been registered and announced. During the transition period, incumbent teachers may be allowed to continue to serve, but those who fail the examination shall be ordered by the competent education authorities to establish an elementary school teacher training center, ordering them to enter the center for training, and re-test and examine them after a certain period of time. If they still fail to pass, they shall be resolutely dismissed from their duties in order to emphasize the students' studies.

Improve the treatment of elementary school teachers, stipulate the minimum salary standard, and establish elementary school teacher consumer cooperatives, conduct elementary school teacher disease insurance, and formulate special preferential measures for the admission of elementary school teachers' children, or provide subsidies, so that they can serve with peace of mind.

Establish schoolchild consumer cooperatives to supply school supplies at the lowest prices, and absolutely prohibit schools from forcing purchases and profiting from them.

As the saying goes, "The plan for one year is to plant grain, the plan for ten years is to plant trees, and the plan for a hundred years is to cultivate people." The lack of talent in our country has reached its peak today. The root of the problem is that we do not attach importance to education and cultivate talent, so we dig wells only when we are thirsty, and we are always happy that talent is difficult to find. If we do not act now, it will be too late to regret it. And cultivating talent should start with sound national education. Shanghai is rich in wealth and materials, educational funds are easy to raise, and the culture is relatively high, and it is easy to recruit excellent teachers, so we very much hope that Shanghai will be the starting point for sound national education, and then extend it to the whole country.

### Laurel, the First President of the Philippines, Was Inaugurated Yesterday Morning, and the City of Manila Was Filled with Jubilant Air

Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Republic of the Philippines was formally established on the 14th under the leadership of President Laurel. At 8:00 a.m. that morning, before the ceremony for the establishment of the Philippines, the Japanese government declared the withdrawal of military administration in the name of the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines. At 9:40 a.m., a solemn ceremony was held in front of the National Assembly Hall for the inauguration of the President of the Republic of the Philippines. Key figures from the Philippines, Mr. Murata, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Japan, Mr. Arisue (Army) and Mr. Yano (Navy), the Supreme Commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy in the Philippines, and representatives from various associations attended the ceremony. The square in front of the ceremonial site was crowded with people, reaching as many as 300,000. First, Executive Secretary Vargas stood up and announced that the military administration of the Great Japanese Empire had been abolished, and expressed his gratitude to Japan on behalf of the entire Philippine people. Then, amid the cheers of the people, Laurel, Chairman of the Independence Preparatory Committee, in a powerful tone, read out the Declaration of Independence, declaring independence to China and foreign countries, and that the Philippines would establish the Republic of the Philippines in order to create a world order of peace, freedom, and justice. At 9:50 a.m., General Aquino raised the flag, and at the same time, the Philippine national anthem was played, and the entire venue was filled with a jubilant atmosphere of celebrating the founding of the country. The capital Manila and temples throughout the Philippines echoed this, ringing their bells in unison to bless the completion of the independence of the Philippines. At 10:05 a.m., Executive Secretary Vargas announced the results of the election of the President. At 10:10 a.m., amid the sound of cannons, Laurel declared his inauguration as the first President of the Republic of the Philippines. Everyone stood up to pay their respects. Laurel then gave a speech, revealing his fervent determination and beliefs. Afterwards, Kuroda, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines, stood up and read a congratulatory message, representing the Japanese government's congratulations to the Republic of the Philippines. Finally, about 10,000 Philippine officials and civilians and people from the Axis countries in the Philippines held a congratulatory parade in front of the ceremonial site, which did not end until noon. The long-cherished wish of the Philippine people has now been realized, and a powerful member has been added to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The situation of the liberation of East Asia and the unity of the entire East Asia will be further strengthened.

### Mr. Laurel Announces the Mission of the Republic and Specifically Explains the Grand Plan for Nation Building

Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - After Laurel took office as President at 10:15 a.m. on the 14th, he immediately gave a speech, first explaining the significance of the founding of the Philippines and the mission of the Republic of the Philippines, and then gave a specific explanation of his grand plan for building a new Philippines. The main points of his speech are as follows:

Today is the day that the centuries-long struggle of our Philippine nation has finally achieved our

lofty ideals

Our salvation was obtained from this world's great turmoil. We will show the world our true sincerity to His Majesty the Emperor of the Great Japanese Empire, who enabled our nation to achieve its long-cherished wish. The guests from the Great Japanese Empire and other places who are present here are evidence of the traditional friendly relations and mutual understanding between the peoples of East Asia. We express our deepest gratitude to Their Excellencies the Supreme Commanders of the Army and Navy of the Great Japanese Empire, who have shown trust in the people of the Philippines in the past and present. Our Philippines has now become a free and independent country, so our immediate task is to maintain peace and order within our territory. In the future, if there are any unruly elements who hinder our important plans and threaten the existence of the Republic, we will regard them as public enemies of our people and take appropriate measures to deal with them. During the peacetime of the former Commonwealth government, the Philippines still had to import rice and other food from abroad. Now, due to the impact of the war, the shortage of food has become increasingly acute. However, this is not a difficult problem, because the production of our fertile land can supply three times the amount of materials needed by the entire population. In order to exchange materials with various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and implement economic cooperation with the countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, we will readjust the domestic

economic institutions

so as to fulfill the responsibility of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. In order to revive the national economy, we will adopt a sound and stable currency system, guarantee the sound circulation of capital, revitalize new industries, improve transportation facilities, improve road and port equipment, and shipbuilding. In order to adapt to the wartime economy, we will implement a rationing system for essential goods. We must also establish an agency to control prices, because even if we have obtained political freedom, if there is no smooth economy, it will still be nominal. Once the nation's self-sufficient economy is established, we must

attend to

the well-being of the poor and seek various relief measures. If the economy between the various social strata is not balanced, there will be no well-being for the entire population. Fortunately, our country has sufficient arable land, which can be said to be the foundation of our country's economic resources. We must distribute this land to the masses and provide them with material assistance in order to stabilize the economy. All our citizens must take on new responsibilities to change their moral conscience, and we must train them to be a united and dedicated nation. Our Constitution guarantees the maximum degree of freedom

needed to satisfy personal happiness

However, the new citizens must recognize their due obligations and have the spirit of sacrificing their own rights to fulfill their due obligations. Loyalty to obligations should first be exemplified to the people by soldiers and officials. Our education system must be refreshed with the Eastern spirit. The foundations of family and society must strengthen the authority of parents and restore the original status of women in order to make the Filipino family system upward and stable. The government is determined to encourage national language schools and national literature schools, or to strive for popularization and development by means of public documents and general ceremonies. Increasing the birth rate of Tagalogs is also what our country most hopes for. The above is the political aspect of the policies that I am implementing at the beginning of the founding of our Republic. This broad and important undertaking cannot be expected to be completed in a short period of time. Now, fierce battles continue to rage beyond our national borders. We must also remember that many of our country's resources have not yet been developed. Within the limits of our economic capacity, we must at least quickly complete the first stage of our grand plan. In order to achieve the

peace and prosperity

of the people, we must complete the government structure and simplify it in order to manage everything effectively. We must eliminate factional struggles. In the stage of assuming full responsibility for the country, I will not participate in any political parties, only for my only Republic. We should only have one party, the party of the people. I believe that the national flag, the constitution, the national anthem, and the president are the center of the people's unity. The national flag symbolizes the spirit of our warriors and represents the sovereignty of our territory. The national anthem is the business of our nation's hope, so it can be said to be the center of our being. The president is the leader of the people, the root of leadership, and also the center of the country. These four points can awaken the spirit and enthusiasm of all Philippine people. I believe that our people will unite to attack the challenges beyond the horizon. Let us no longer be afraid

with firm faith

Let us move straight forward. We will use

all our strength to dedicate ourselves

to this unprecedented great cause. The one drop of effort that we combine from each individual can become a channel of joint effort, like a torrent of rapid currents, raging and surging, which will turn any obstacle into powerlessness. Only in this way can our only purpose and common determination establish true, permanent, and immortal independence.

### Commander Kuroda's Congratulatory Message at the Founding Ceremony of the Philippines

Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - The congratulatory message from Commander Kuroda of the Japanese Army in the Philippines at the founding ceremony of the Republic of the Philippines is as follows: The independence of the Philippines is the long-cherished wish of the people of the Philippines. I do not know how many martyrs have sacrificed for this glory. Today, we are fortunate to meet the grand ceremony of independence. All the people of the Philippines are celebrating together, and even the martyrs who are sleeping underground should also be sincerely pleased. The patriotic blood of the martyrs in those years is still abundant in the bodies of the people of the Philippines. I firmly believe that the future of this country must be full of light. The founding of Burma the other day and the birth of the Republic of the Philippines today are both expressions of the spirit of morality. The great undertaking of Xingya is progressing day by day, and Japan's joy is beyond words. The Philippines, unfortunately, was trapped in the war due to the treacherous policies of the United States, and suffered a lot of blows in both people and property. However, the people of the Philippines finally obtained the honor of independence, so I am even more convinced that the people of the Philippines can establish various systems with their own hands, complete an independent country, and become a strong link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At this time when the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more fierce, Japan has the preparation and confidence to resolutely complete the operation. The independence and prosperity of the Philippines will be completely guaranteed by Japan's victory. Japan will spare no effort to cooperate, and hopes that all the people of the Philippines will firmly trust Japan and move forward bravely on the road to completing their heavy tasks.

A Speech Broadcast to the National People

Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - President Laurel of the Republic of the Philippines broadcast a speech to all the people of the Philippines at 7:30 p.m. on the 14th at his residence here, which meant: The independence of our country has been our wish ever since Magellan landed in our country more than four hundred years ago. The Philippines has been a territory of the United States for more than forty years, during which time we have made every effort to strive for independence. Although the Independence Act was passed by the United States Congress, it has not yet been realized. On December 2, 1941, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, after the Japanese army landed in the Philippines, it allowed our country to be independent, because the Japanese army's operation was not to fight with the Philippine people, its purpose was to liberate the various ethnic groups in East Asia. Now that the Japanese promise has been fulfilled, we have declared independence and established the Republic of the Philippines. The President of the Republic of the Philippines is deeply pleased that the Philippines has now been included among the three powers of the world. I still remember that at the beginning of this war, we blindly believed that the United States would allow us freedom, so we endured great sacrifices for the United States. However, the United States never abandoned its policy of oppression, and after the Japanese army landed in the Philippines, it allowed us independence, our past misunderstandings of Japan were completely dispelled. The United States has always claimed to care for the Philippines, we now ask the United States to recognize and respect the independence of the Philippines, and no longer allow the Philippine people to suffer disaster again, in other words, I and all the Philippine people ask the United States to fulfill its past promises, and not to harm the future of the Republic of the Philippines, so that we can freely build our country. I hereby declare that the new Republic of the Philippines is determined to respect the interests of all countries in the Philippines in accordance with international law, and is willing to contribute to the construction of a new world order based on peace, freedom, and morality.

Philippine Tagalog is Designated as the Official Language

Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - Because many different races in the Philippines live in different regions and use various different languages, there is no national language to speak of. Therefore, the Philippine government, which is eager for independence, has already started preparing for the work of unifying the national language before realizing complete independence. According to the languages currently used in the Philippines, there are 87 types, including English and Spanish. When Spain occupied the Philippines, it worked hard to popularize Spanish, and when the United States owned the Philippines, it used English, so English and Spanish are mostly spoken in urban areas and plains, but most residents still use the original languages of their race. As a result, no one language can be used throughout the Philippines. Today, the languages with the widest range of circulation in the Philippines are Bisaya and Tagalog. Bisayans and Tagalogs are more civilized races in the Philippines. The total number of Bisayans is about 7 million, accounting for the first in the population of the Philippines. However, most of the political center figures in the Philippines are Tagalogs, so the Philippines has recently decided to make Tagalog the official language of the Philippines, in order to unify the national language. From then on, due to the unification of languages in the Philippines, its solidarity on the national spirit must be more enthusiastic.

The Japanese Government Announces a List of Diplomatic Officials

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government, in order to operate the urgent Japan-Philippines relations, immediately established an embassy in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, on the same day, appointing Minister Plenipotentiary Shozo Murata as the first ambassador to the Philippines. At the same time, it also officially announced the lineup of the embassy in the Philippines and the personnel of the consulate general in Manila as follows: Shozo Murata was appointed as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of the Philippines, Senator Chio Morita of the Ministry of Greater East Asia was appointed as Counselor of the Embassy, ​​Military Administration Officer Ryu Akiyama and Hideo Fukushima were appointed as First Secretaries of the Embassy, ​​Affairs Officer Hideo Suye of the Ministry of Greater East Asia was appointed as Second Secretary of the Embassy, ​​and Secretary Suekichi Shioya of the Ministry of Greater East Asia was appointed as Consul General in Manila.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government appointed Colonel Naokata Utsunomiya of the Army on the 14th to serve concurrently as the military attaché of the Japanese embassy in the Philippines, and Major Kazuo Tajiri of the Army as the assistant to the military attaché of the Japanese embassy in the Philippines.

### Full Text of the Declaration of Independence

Central News Agency, Manila, 14th - The full text of the Philippine Declaration of Independence is as follows: The spirit of love for freedom is the traditional spirit of the Filipino people. The Filipinos have been ruled by Spain for three hundred years, followed by the United States for more than forty years. During this time, whether in peace or war, they have always struggled continuously to gain freedom. Many martyrs have strived arduously to achieve national liberation. Now, the Philippines, having lost its freedom for many years, has been able to recover it with the assistance of a powerful East Asian nation, which is a just and appropriate return in human history. The Great Japanese Empire, in order to complete this war and liberate the oppressed peoples of Greater East Asia, has eliminated Western forces in the Philippines. The Filipino people have organized the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee to draft a constitution for an independent country and to take necessary measures to build the Republic of the Philippines, in order to realize their long-cherished dream of freedom. We believe that this independence was obtained by the sacrifices of our elders and brothers on various battlefields. We are now independent and recognize independence as the right of all nations in the world, which should be allowed to strive for. We hereby praise our independence as being in accordance with the divine will to enable all nations to attain their proper place. The day we have been hoping for has arrived. We have leapt from the dark hell of a colony to the bright heaven. Here, we have restored the freedom we had more than four hundred years ago. We will not yield to any country. National honor is hereby restored. Due to the realization of freedom, we can utilize unlimited opportunities to strive to carry out the following tasks, free from any foreign interference, to govern our country independently: Develop resources and ensure self-sufficiency. Seek individual and national development without the constraints of political subordination and the persecution of racial discrimination. The thoughts and actions of our ancestors are the best achievements of human history. Follow this to promote spiritual intelligence. Return to the original posture of East Asia, restore the spirit of our ancestors, and build the country in accordance with the will of God and nature. Based on freedom, peace, and morality, the Republic, as part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, will contribute to the creation of a new world order. Strive to achieve the common prosperity of all nations and peoples of Greater East Asia and all mankind, and nurture an independent country as a source of happiness for the Filipino people, both now and in the future, and make it permanent. We pray that God and the spirits of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the motherland will bless us. We hereby declare to the world that we have now gained freedom and independence, and will no longer be subordinate to any foreign country. We have all the powers and rights of a free and independent nation, and we will dedicate all our resources, lives, and honor to defend our territory and preserve our independence. October 14, 1943. Jose P. Laurel, Chairman of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th - The Japanese government issued a statement at 7:30 PM today, as follows: The Philippines has fulfilled its long-cherished wish and declared independence on October 14.

The Philippines has been under foreign rule for more than four hundred years, and has continuously strived for independence. The United States agreed to grant independence for its own interests, not for genuine independence, which is known to the people of the Philippines. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the influence of the United States in the Philippines has been driven out. In less than two years since then, the people of the Philippines have achieved their long-cherished wish, and the root of the long-standing disaster in East Asia has also been eliminated. At the same time, the future of the construction of a new order is particularly promising. This is truly gratifying for Japan. Within the Greater East Asia region, the Republic of China, Thailand, and Burma are closely cooperating with Japan and jointly fighting to complete the war. Manchukuo is also exerting its total strength and cooperating with Japan with one heart and one mind. Now, with the birth of the new Philippines, all the countries and nations of Greater East Asia have fully developed their natural character, united as one, and strived for the common prosperity of Greater East Asia and the welfare of the world, which is truly gratifying. The Japanese government, in addition to sincerely congratulating the independence of the Philippines, hopes that all countries in Greater East Asia will support each other, rely on each other, respect each other's autonomy and independence, and work together to win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. To complete the construction of Greater East Asia and realize the great ideal of the prosperity of all nations, the Japanese government hereby clarifies its belief to China and foreign countries.

Weak Capacity of the US Air Force Stationed in Chongqing

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th - Recently, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has made extravagant claims of strengthening its aerial offensive, but in reality, its organizational capacity is quite weak, and its flying skills are also extremely poor. A traveler from Fujian recently said that at 4:00 PM on the 9th of this month, he witnessed several US planes stationed in Chongqing attacking forty kilometers east of Shantou. They used machine guns to strafe the lighthouse near the sea. Three other planes, due to the poor skills of the pilots, could not fly close to the land and circled around the lighthouse. Soon, the wings collided with the lighthouse, the fuselage caught fire and burned itself, and was forced to land on the beach. The pilots and the plane perished together. The US planes in Chongqing, with obvious targets under the sunlight, actually collided with the lighthouse, which shows that their skills are extremely poor. Most of the excellent pilots of the US Air Force in Chongqing have been lost in battles with Japanese planes. Most of the recent reinforcements are short-term training graduates with poor skills and especially lack experience. Therefore, the weakness of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is evident.

### Soviet Troops Attempt Landing on the Southern Coast of Crimea; Fierce Fighting in the Middle Reaches of the Dnieper River

Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th - The German Supreme Headquarters announced: On the Eastern Front, the enemy is still launching fierce attacks in the old focal points north of the Sea of Azov and on the Dnieper River, in an attempt to break through the German lines. The German army repelled the attacks in fierce fighting. At the same time, it filled in the depressions in the trenches and, in the battlefields of the Pripet River estuary and Gomel, the German army launched a counter-attack after repelling the enemy's offensive and expanded the position.

Situation on the Southern Italian Front

Situation on the Southern Italian Front: British and American forces launched a fierce attack yesterday with a large army on Volturno and northwest of Benevento in the river area.

German aircraft dropped bombs on the Gulf of Naples and hit an enemy main ship.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th - Huitong News Agency: Although the enemy forces are extremely active in various parts of southern Italy and are launching battles, there is no major change in the battle situation. It is impossible to know whether the German command will fight them with a large army, or withdraw further back with a strategy of delaying resistance. The main force of the enemy is now targeting the highway connecting Apennine Central and Vienna. In order to implement this plan, the British Eighth Army is now advancing in two routes towards the east and north of Monte Tel Saint Nio Mountain, but the above two routes have been destroyed and are being bombarded by German artillery, so the British army's advance is difficult and they are suffering heavy losses.

### Ba Regime Declares War; Berlin Does Not Take It Seriously

Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th - The German press unanimously pointed out that the declaration of war on Germany by the Badoglio government has no importance either in terms of military operations or politics. "The Berlin Financial News" stated, "On the orders of the pitiful Italian king. This prisoner of McNamara has once again made a publicity stunt, and the challenge to Germany has no military significance whatsoever."

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 14th - Huitong News Agency, Washington: The White House announced yesterday afternoon that Badoglio had notified General Eisenhower that Italy had declared war on Germany. The news was immediately notified to Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 14th - Washington: The US Department of the Army announced yesterday that the status of Italian prisoners of war in the United States will not be immediately changed due to the Badoglio regime's declaration of war on Germany.

### The Anglo-Soviet Rivalry in the West

When German forces were pressing the Soviet army in the direction of Moscow or the Caucasus in the past year or two, Stalin, when meeting with Churchill, or the British Foreign Secretary Eden, or Roosevelt's envoys, the British and Americans used the German-Soviet military boundary line of the autumn of 1939 as the limit of Soviet power in Europe, strongly urging the Soviet Union to revise part of its borders and make Poland and Finland independent.  They also hoped that the Soviet Union would be a guarantor of West Asia. For a time, it was said that the political work of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union was quite active, but now, the attitude of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union has changed by itself.  On the other hand, compared to the extensive operations of the Soviet army, the Anglo-American operations in Sicily and Southern Italy are far behind in terms of the forces used, the region, and the scale of operations.  The Soviet Union alone confronts two hundred divisions of the German army on the Eastern Front. Therefore, the Soviet Union uses this as a reason to first assert that the Soviet Union should have the greatest say in border issues, and put forward various demands.  This can be said to be a matter of course.  It is said that the most important thing in the previous talks between Roosevelt and Churchill was to decide what attitude Britain and the United States should take towards the demands of the Soviet Union. It is said that the demands put forward by the Soviet Union are as follows:

Soviet Demands

Mediterranean Issue: The Soviet Union demanded that Soviet representatives participate in the Anglo-American committee and was successful. On the Mediterranean issue, Britain and the United States thought that Stalin would appoint Maisky as a member of the committee, but Stalin appointed his confidant, Gusev, as a member, because it is said that Stalin thought that Maisky was too deeply influenced by the British side. From this one incident, it can be seen how deeply the Soviet Union cares about the Mediterranean.

Balkan Issue: The Soviet Union's position on the Balkans is that no matter how the borders of the Balkan countries change, the Balkans cannot but be guided by the Soviet Union. In this regard, the Soviet Union is making various preparations, and what is most noteworthy is that the famous Southeast European expert, Mr. Rentov, has been appointed as the director of the Balkan Department in the Soviet Foreign Affairs People's Committee.

Turkish Issue: The Soviet Union's plan for Turkey is to hope to conclude a special contract on the use of the Dardanelles Strait. The Soviet Union seems to believe that it has the right to use the Dardanelles Strait without restriction. Especially with this ability to participate in the Mediterranean Committee, the Soviet Union not only created a position where it can directly care about the Mediterranean, but on the other hand, as mentioned above, the goal of the Soviet Union's Balkan strategy is to find a way out to the Adriatic Sea. Therefore, the Soviet Union's plan to obtain the right to use the Dardanelles Strait is a manifestation of its efforts to connect with the Mediterranean Sea and the Adriatic Sea.

Middle East Issue: The Soviet Union has once again asked Britain and the United States to decide on the sphere of influence in Iran, and at the same time hopes to merge southeastern Iran, especially the area bordering Soviet Turkestan. This issue is probably the most difficult one for Britain to handle?

What the Soviet Union plans is to bring the countries around India, such as Iran, Afghanistan, and the interior of China, into its own sphere of influence, and to consolidate its political base.

Other Issues: Everyone knows that between 1930 and 1935, the Soviet government and the Third International were very concerned about the Arab regions such as Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia, but they remained silent due to domestic political issues. However, recently, the Soviet Union's concern for this area seems to have been revived. The Soviet Ambassador to the Turkish capital, Mr. Vinogradov, is very active, and is in contact with influential figures in many countries. The Soviet Union also wants to raise the issue of the Mosul oil fields. The recent increase in troops by the Soviet Union south of Lake Urmia in northern Iraq, in the area bordering Turkey and Iraq, is enough to explain this fact in practice. From the above, it can be seen that the direction of the Soviet Union's political advancement is first pointing to the west of the Soviet Union. Soviet diplomacy is occupying a position ahead of Britain and the United States. How will Britain and the United States escape this sharp edge? Regarding this point, if the recent data is briefly explained, it is roughly as follows:

Recent Developments

On the Mediterranean issue, the Soviet Union's participation in the mixed committee, no matter what the result, is of great importance, because the British and American sides believe that they should be quite vigilant about the Soviet Union sending important figures.

Regarding the Balkan issue, Britain and the United States want to form a political group with Britain as the main body by leading the Balkans away from the name of alliance with Germany. However, the Soviet Union's plan for a Balkan Federation emphasizes Bulgaria, while Britain plans to have Turkey and Romania play important roles. Turkey itself also hopes for a strong Romania as a barrier in the north.

Regarding the Turkish issue, there is the following fact. That is, military equipment is being strengthened, military roads are being completed, and airfields are being built, starting from the eastern part of Turkey, especially the area around Erzurum, and the Soviet border, by British engineers. This fact was unprecedented and is quite valued.

Regarding the Middle East issue, the British army's strengthening of military equipment in the Mosul region of Iraq and the Soviet Union's increase in troops in northern Iran began almost simultaneously. On the other hand, except for northern Iran, which is occupied by the Soviet army, the entire Iran is under the control of the US military, and the port of Basra in the Persian Gulf is also under the management of Americans. The activities of all ships are also supervised by Americans. The British side has left all management in this area to the United States, and is dedicated to securing Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Palestine.

This is the wisdom of the British side. It is probably because it is worried that the Iranian issue will cause conflict with the Soviet Union, so it has deployed the US military in advance, and wants to involve the United States if the dispute between the Soviet Union and Britain becomes public.

In short, following the progress of the Eastern Front, Britain and the United States, fearing the increase in Soviet diplomatic pressure, first sought to ease this pressure, and in form, did not hesitate to use humble words and courtesy. (From the Western Asahi Shimbun, October 7)

### Decisive Battle Posture and the Japanese Navy - Speech by Colonel Matsushima, Head of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China

From September 28th to 30th, the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan of the National Government convened a national conference of senior military and political officials. The conference lasted three days. The Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army, the Chief of Staff, the Supreme Economic Advisor, the Supreme Military Advisor, and experts from the Army and Navy successively gave speeches, providing very detailed analysis of the world war situation, the East Asian war situation, and the Great East Asia War's beliefs. Colonel Matsushima, Head of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China, gave a speech on the second day of the conference (September 29th), entitled "Decisive Battle Capability and the Japanese Navy." The following is a transcript of the speech:

A New Look for East Asia

Japan, shouldering the mission of construction, launched the sacred war to destroy Britain and the United States. Since the launch of the war, it has been one year and ten months. During this time, with the enthusiastic assistance of the Chinese people, the three routes of land, sea, and air have achieved victories, and to destroy the powerful enemies of Britain and the United States, strategically necessary points in the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and mainland have all been brought under our control. Outside, we are destroying bandits and rebels, and inside, we are emphasizing construction, reforming the economy and culture. East Asia has a new look. Burma has declared independence, and the independence of the Philippines is not far off. Within China, which has long been bound by Britain, the United States, and other countries since their invasion, the implementation of measures such as the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the management of enemy property has brought about a new look. In order to restore China to its former peaceful state, we are moving forward. This needs no further elaboration. The reason we can have today is thanks to the sacred achievements, and at the same time, it is due to the devotion of Your Excellencies in the National Government and the dedication of all officials to the country. I am sincerely grateful.

During this time, the axis of the Japanese military's actions, since the battles of Hawaii and Malaya at the beginning of the war, has been to strive to obtain control of the sea and air in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, which are its main goals. At the same time, in cooperation with the elite army, we have annihilated the British, American, and Dutch land, sea, and air forces entrenched in the islands, the Malay Peninsula, the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In less than half a year after the start of the war, this goal was achieved. From the Bay of Bengal in the west to the northern edge of Australia in the south, from the Solomon Islands in the east to the Aleutian Islands in the north, the area controlled, calculated with Osaka in Japan as the center, actually reaches six thousand. Not only that, the activities of the Japanese fleet extend to the Bay of Diego Suarez in Madagascar, or Sydney in Australia, from the American coast to the Atlantic Ocean. Looking back at the operations in various aspects during this period, since the Washington Conference, we have painstakingly trained our naval strength under the ratio of power, and everywhere it has achieved unprecedented results. We are singing victory songs. In this vast theater of war, witnessing the unprecedented large-scale naval operations in history, we cannot help but have various feelings.

The Activity of Aircraft

First: The elimination of aircraft in this war and the increase in their position in naval warfare. Originally, the main goal was to control the entire economy and make the enemy's intentions waver when confronting the enemy's main force. Before the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, in cases where the goal was to decide the outcome in one battle, the focus was on the effect of the giant guns of the main battle fleet, and the effects of the large guns of the other support units were used as auxiliary forces for the activities of this main force. Aircraft could also be considered as part of its auxiliary force, but in the naval battles of Hawaii and Malaya, aircraft exerted tremendous power. This kind of example changed the traditional tactical thinking, and it is deeply felt that the entire current operation is centered on aircraft.

Regarding naval air warfare, the air units active in naval air warfare are composed of base air units (aircraft operating from a land-based center), shipboard aircraft (aircraft operating from aircraft carriers), and embarked aircraft (aircraft carried on cruisers and larger ships). As for its types, it is composed of multiple types, including carrier-based, seaborne, and flying machines, each with various missions such as attack, reconnaissance, and combat.

Especially at sea, the vastness of its operational surface and the unpredictability of weather changes mean that takeoffs and landings are subject to certain limitations. Various difficulties must be overcome to cope with its mission, and it must have special discipline, takeoff and landing methods, and tactics. Therefore, considerable time and effort are required for training.

In naval battles, we have demonstrated the performance of the latest modern aircraft and the essence of training cultivated over many years in surprise attacks on moored ships, attacks on sailing fleets in the naval battle of Malaya, and mutual attacks of aircraft carriers in the Coral Sea and Midway.

Misjudging Japanese Strength

The American senior officials initially believed that Japanese aircraft were two or three years behind Europe and the United States in terms of technology. Even the aircraft of the previous generation were completely outdated. Moreover, the aviation industry was completely dependent on the United States. Without American assistance, the Japanese aviation industry could not exist. In terms of the number of aircraft, it was estimated that there were about 1,500 aircraft, or even as low as 500 aircraft.

Its misjudgment of Japanese air power ultimately benefited Japan. At the beginning of the war, our side achieved brilliant air combat results, sending the enemy's arrogance from heaven to hell, forcing them to make major reforms in their naval and air power.

The great range of our naval aircraft led the British and American commanders to make strategic errors of moths flying into the fire. Since the naval battle of Malaya, they have repeatedly encountered hard blows. Also, the accuracy of Japanese torpedo attacks and bombing has brought about a major change in the world of pure warfare.

The British and Russian sides also believed that aircraft could not sink battleships, but the Japanese navy achieved great success with aircraft at the beginning of the war. The so-called excellent British and American latest fighter planes also could not be compared with the superior range and driving performance of Japanese naval aircraft. The Japanese navy often achieved a ratio of one to ten in battles, causing those who heard of it to be stunned.

Since the start of the war, in many air battles between the two sides, the enemy's air power has often exceeded ours. In some cases, there have been as many as ten times as many, but the results achieved by the Japanese side have often been several to ten times greater than those of the enemy. These results are all publicized accurately according to our channels. Sometimes, in confused battles, it is also explained that those whose observations cannot be verified have not yet been.

However, the British and American reports only know to conceal their own damage, as well as the loss of aircraft and personnel, and try to mislead others, engaging in counter-propaganda. The damage to Japanese aircraft is often reported to be several times or more than ten times higher than the actual number, and even the number of aircraft dispatched exceeds the number of aircraft actually participating in combat. Observing the air combat statistics in the Solomon Islands direction, the enemy's damage is at least four to six times greater than ours, and sometimes even more.

The United States is Shameless

The U.S. Navy has long set "decisive air control" as the fundamental principle of operations, engaging in the reorganization of troops. However, the real sense of the necessity of air warfare came only three years ago, in June of the 29th year of the Republic of China, when the German army broke through the Maginot Line. Immediately, they worked hard to mass-produce aircraft and train air force personnel. The second awakening was the result of the naval battles of Hawaii and Malaya.

Since then, they have tried to increase their air power, recruiting aviation technology experts from across the country, ordering them to research the maximum production capacity. The result is that in the current goal of air force preparation, in terms of production, it is said that last year was 60,000 votes, and this year is 125,000 aircraft. In terms of training, the Navy trains 30,000 people per year, and the Army trains 120,000 people per year. From this, it can be seen that the result is to increase the Navy to 25,000 aircraft and the Army to 70,000 aircraft (the original plan was 35,000 aircraft).

They shamelessly claim that American aircraft will first cover the skies of the western Pacific, obtain thorough air control, and then promote the joint operations of the army, navy, and air force to achieve the final goal. However, due to the necessary materials, this production volume cannot proceed ideally. At most, it is actually 70%. Among the soldiers, there are certainly those who are of excellent quality, but once they are personally involved in the battlefield, they are no match for the outstanding Japanese air warriors overflowing with the spirit of serving the country with loyalty. This is a fact that is proven in daily combat. (Continued on page 4)

Comments from the Economic World

### Feelings on the Disappearance of Flies and Beggars in the Former Capital

Of the travelogues written by the 18 members of the Beijing-Shanghai journalist delegation who went north to inspect, the two passages that most inspire us are the records of the flies and beggars in the former capital: Regarding flies: "After the full mobilization of all levels of Ping City and their simultaneous efforts, ...flies have completely disappeared from the city. All large and small restaurants, hotels, and food shops will be closed for three to five days if a fly is seen, and residents will be fined. The enforcement of the law is strict and does not allow any leniency, thus creating the miraculous achievement of a city without flies." Regarding beggars: "Because of epidemic prevention in Beiping, it has not only become a fly-free city, but also all the poor beggars, because their clothes are tattered and they may spread germs, have been taken in by groups. Therefore, walking through the nine cities, we have never heard the miserable sound of wailing for food."

Therefore, the fact that epidemic prevention in the former capital has been able to achieve the disappearance of flies and beggars shows that as long as the government and the people can cooperate sincerely, all good municipal administration can achieve results. Therefore, we cannot help but ask: When can the "flies" and beggars of Shanghai be completely eliminated? The "flies" here are abstract, because the people of Shanghai who pursue exorbitant profits all day long are like flies attached to things. If they are not squeezed out and eliminated, they will inevitably become rampant and uncontrollable. Therefore, to clear the Shanghai market, it is necessary to eliminate the "flies" in the Shanghai market and make them completely disappear. As for the beggars in Shanghai, not only have they not been eliminated, but they have become arrogant, because they can arbitrarily beg in the main streets, as if there is no one else around. Is this not arrogant enough? Objectively speaking, this is a social and economic issue. Subjectively speaking, this is a citizen welfare issue. Regardless of whether it is a social economy or citizen welfare, both "flies" and "beggars" should be regarded as a stain on the economic Shanghai, and there should be a thorough cleansing.

### Evaluation Committee of Various Industries Re-evaluates Price Limits - Appropriately Reducing to Ease the Burden on Citizens

Recently, the prices of all commodities have been declining. This is because the authorities have strictly investigated hoarding, leading to a downward trend, and hoarders have been lowering prices to get rid of their stocks, which is another reason for the drop in prices. The Evaluation Committee of Various Industries believes that the price limits set in the past should be appropriately reduced so that people's livelihood can be thoroughly stabilized. Therefore, in recent days, various industry associations have been re-evaluating the price limits of various commodities in their respective industries, so as to reduce the burden on citizens while allowing merchants to obtain legitimate profits. Various industry associations have also recently, in view of the fact that some merchants have long neglected the industry rules of the association and sometimes act in a superficially compliant but actually disobedient manner, specially revised several industry rules and ordered all merchants to strictly abide by them without changing.

Newly Revised Industry Rules

The main ones are: Those who specialize in wholesale of commodities are limited to wholesale existing goods to local retail merchants; they must refuse to wholesale to people outside the industry and merchants outside the industry. There must be no illegal short selling in various industry markets. All dutiable goods transactions are limited to merchants in the respective industries. All factories, companies, and businesses must join the association. Non-members of the association shall not engage in the buying and selling of various items. If the price is to be changed due to cost reasons, the association should forward the request to the authorities for approval. Only after approval can the association notify the change; otherwise, it will be regarded as an illegal price increase and punished according to law. Retailers should mark the price of each item sold and must issue a sales invoice. If there is a shortage of goods, they must not take advantage of the situation to hoard and raise prices, change grades, or engage in any other improper behavior. All items that have been evaluated and price-limited must be responsible according to the evaluated price limit, regardless of whether they are wholesalers or retailers, and must not deliberately violate it.

### Financial Inspection Offices Established in Bengbu and Ningbo

After the Central Reserve Bank's General Affairs Office for Financial Inspection completed the inspection and correction of the business operations of financial institutions (including banks, money shops, and trust companies) in the local financial area, it continued to promote the financial inspection work in various cities in the interior. In addition to the establishment of branch offices in cities such as Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Hankou, which are carrying out inspection work in accordance with the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions, the planned Bengbu and Ningbo branch offices are said to have been organized and established, and the inspection task is progressing smoothly. It is said that branch offices in other regions are also being planned and gradually set up, so as to ensure that the financial institutions of the country are under the control of the Ministry of Finance and follow the correct path to thoroughly stabilize finance.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the Chinese stocks were unpredictable, first leveling off and then expanding machinery capital, then turning down. Ultimately, some stock prices turned from falling to rising. Because the weak ground had stabilized and the selling subsided, the yarn gang, Guangdong gang, and others suddenly rose together in the afternoon, with Wing On Company as the investment target, suddenly driving up the price. Other stocks also followed upwards. The morale of all parties, which had just been tired, was re-excited, and transactions were brisk. The following is a record of the stock situation in various industries.

Department Stores: Wing On Company fell in the morning, but suddenly rebounded at noon. In the afternoon, the buying was strong, with the highest being the final transaction price, rising one level compared to the previous day. Sincere Company entered the pass and returned in the afternoon, also showing a rise. China National Products Wharf was leveled after a slight rise in the morning. China Underwear was slightly lower after the market, and both Sincere and Wing On Department Stores ended up weakened.

Textiles: Da Sheng Factories 1, 2, and 3 were raised by buyers. Wing On Textiles returned to level after fatigue, with the fluctuations getting narrower. Yuanfeng, Fuchang, and Rongfeng Textiles all fell slightly. Tianlun was the only one that rose, with the price being high. The weaving stocks such as Da Zhonghua remained flat. Zuifu Socks opened at the original price, and the prospect was slightly lower.

New Medicines: Xin Ya Hua Factory slightly decreased and then returned in the afternoon. Zhongfa was leveled, Wuzhou was slightly lower, and Zhongxi, Zhongying, Xinyi, and Xinxing were all flat.

Industry: Da Zhonghua Firecrackers was the weakest. Huacheng and Nanyang Tobacco Companies had few transactions and the market was tired. Jiu'an Industry also showed a significant decline. Daqin Huashi returned to level after expanding. Xin Ya Jianye had small fluctuations. Datongying was the only one to rise. Guohua Investment had quite active transactions, and both Guohua and China Investments saw a small rise. Kangyuan Canned Food and Meilin Canned Food both showed a decline. Sanyou and Cixi Taihou's Empty Court Industry also showed a decline.

Culture: Zhonghua Bookstore had transactions outside the pass. Commercial Press and World Book Company were both firm. Yongxiang Printing and Standard Paper Products were average.

Real Estate: Xin Yi was the flattest. Lianhua and Yongxing both showed a decline.

Public Utilities: Zhabei Water and Electricity returned to the pass. Huashang Electric and Xinyi Machinery were both flat.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds: Yesterday, the market still tended to be weak and tired, hovering around. The rise the day before did not have the strength to continue to pull up. It was heard that the yarn gang bulls were gradually coming out, so the market was temporary and difficult to improve. Yesterday, Bingli's initial price was raised, which attracted sellers, and they immediately became weak again. This is because the supply exceeded the demand and returned to small. The other two types, B and D, were unattended. The E type was higher than four, and it was still hovering uncertainly.

Daily Necessities: Soap and matches were suspended due to the announcement by the First and Eighth District Offices that inventory registration would begin from today, resulting in a halt to transactions between buyers and sellers, and prices also fell sharply. Cigarettes are rising steadily, because inventories are exhausted and prices have soared. The future trend still needs to be seen as high.

Interbank Lending Rate: The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association was not changed yesterday morning. It is still listed as two jiao.

Medicinal Materials: It is still peaceful here, because customers are selling. Only retail sales are being made in this street, and transactions are light. The market is not very colorful.

Grains: It was still soft as before yesterday, because the autumn harvest of crops was abundant, and farmers' accounts often had suspicious and difficult diseases. The rice and grain were at low prices again, and the oil and grain lacked wholesale buyers.

### News Briefs

The Shanghai Limin Bank and the Bank of Communications Head Office are jointly launching rural loans to promote agricultural finance in the interior. The allocation and lending methods for these funds were officially signed yesterday in a contract and will be implemented immediately. These loans will be provided to individual farmers, production mutual aid societies, or rural granaries. Baoshan, Ding, Kunshan, Tai, and Pinghu five counties are provisionally designated as loan areas, and expansion will gradually occur.

Due to business development, the local China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Company has increased its capital to 1.65 million yuan and submitted it for registration and approval. The company is scheduled to issue new stocks from today.

Young Aviation Personnel

In our Japan, thanks to the resources of the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere and the manpower of the Republic of China, we are steadily making progress in aircraft and various weapons and materials. The frontline military strength is no less than that of any country, and the spirit and technology of our aviation personnel enable each to be as effective as ten.

The Navy has long paid attention to young aviation soldiers, selecting youngsters and giving them long-term, appropriate training. The results have been proven by the facts since the Hawaii and Malaya naval battles. The leadership of American aviation personnel is mostly drawn from students of universities and specialized schools. In the Japanese Navy, middle-level officers have been recruited from a young age and trained rigorously under a glorious tradition, so everything related to aviation has become second nature.

These pure-hearted and loyal young men of 21 or 22 years of age have often been the leaders of various units since the Hawaii and Malaya naval battles, taking the lead and disregarding their own safety. Their bravery is enough to move gods and spirits.

Our Japan is currently manufacturing a large number of aircraft and cultivating a large number of air force personnel. Last time, 30,000 university and specialized school students and 70,000 middle school students applied. Their spirit of passionate and courageous enlistment is truly moving. Many of them even bit their fingers and wrote their applications in blood.

Furthermore, to explain this system, officers are dispatched from the air corps and other areas to various schools. When the issue of the treatment of flight trainee graduates is explained, all the students unanimously say that they are willing to rush to the front lines to kill the enemy immediately and that there is no need to consider future treatment. From this, we can see a glimpse of their spirit of serving the country. With such loyal soldiers and excellent aircraft, no matter how stubbornly the enemy persists, the only result will be consumption. The Solomon Islands and a corner of New Guinea will eventually become their graveyards.

Effective Naval Operations

Next, I will briefly elaborate on other aspects of the Navy that promote effective operations in cooperation with air combat.

The activity of naval vessels can also be said to be a manifestation of the Navy's many years of training. In particular, since the Washington Conference, we have strived to train cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and other new types of ships. In past battles on various fronts, we have repeatedly performed miraculous feats. These ships have always worked closely with naval aircraft, attacking enemy air transport ships or destroying and occupying important enemy locations, while protecting our own transport ships and engaging in various other important offensive and defensive tasks.

In the past battles of the Philippines, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies, and more recently in the fierce battles in the Solomon Islands, the so-called rapid units of our cruisers and destroyers have fully demonstrated the strength honed over many years. Whether fighting in daylight, dusk, darkness, or dawn, they can penetrate deep into enemy formations that are several times more numerous and achieve miraculous feats. Their fierce attacks make the enemy feel cold in their hearts and livers, and they achieve surprising victories, like the wonderful plans of Sun Tzu.

They often unfold earth-shattering scenes in silence, killing large enemy fleets and leaving them in disarray. These super-powered vessels, in the quiet of the night, form neat formations, searching for the enemy at super speeds of 30 or 40 nautical miles per hour, speeding through wild winds and waves, avoiding enemy searchlight beams, braving enemy concentrated artillery fire, approaching within striking distance, and launching torpedoes, instantly burying enemy giant ships at the bottom of the sea. These facts have been countless in the Java Sea naval battle and several naval battles near the Solomon Islands. In the enemy's destructive night battles and our protective night battles, these ships have displayed tactics unexpected by the enemy, facing danger and carrying forward traditional virtues to complete their missions. Secondly, our submarines, at the beginning of the war, when attacking Hawaii, sank the world-famous enemy aircraft carrier Lexington and inflicted significant damage on other enemy ships and supply lines.

The achievements of the submarine warriors who endured hardships deep under the sea to complete their missions are particularly commendable. As Inoue Kikunori, a lieutenant commander, stated in a report published on September 25, he and the submarine crew of our ally Germany penetrated deep into the enemy's encirclement, advanced to Attu Island, and Chicagof Harbor, endured fierce enemy attacks day and night, never wavered, and launched three successive attacks, finally sinking or destroying three of the enemy's main forces and important ships. However, Lieutenant Commander Inoue and all the crew members died bravely and did not return alive.

In addition to the above, all kinds of ships have exerted their full spiritual strength on their respective missions. We must study the facts of controlling the sea and air in the Pacific Ocean in this important situation.

Already Entered the Decisive Battle Phase

Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the enemy countries of Britain and the United States have gradually shattered their dreams of war against Japan. The defeats at the beginning of the war have caused their morale to wane. The current war situation has entered the decisive battle phase. The United States' attempts to attack Japan have three strategies: first, an air war launched from the northern Aleutian Islands; second, an air war launched from the southern Solomon Islands; and the current strategy is an attack launched from the central region.

The enemy's offensive from the north, due to our withdrawal from our base in the Aleutian Islands, seems to have given the enemy a strategic advantage for a time. However, the Aleutian Islands have heavy fog in summer and severe cold and strong winds in winter, so it is difficult to find a suitable opportunity to attack with today's aircraft capabilities. Japan's northern defenses are as solid as a rock, with complete ships and a consolidated base, like a golden city and a soup pool.

The southern attack route is the Solomon Islands and New Guinea area, which is currently filled with the smell of gunpowder.

The enemy's achievements in the past year have only been the 300-mile area around the Solomon Islands that we obtained after a strategic retreat, while the enemy's sacrifices have been great. If the families of American soldiers and sailors knew the truth, to what extent would they be horrified? The United States' precious resources and lives are being buried in these coral islands and dense forests plagued by miasma. Their so-called "attacking here and attacking there" actions are clearly slow to progress, and the magnitude of the sacrifices is astonishing. The United States relies on its wealth and wastes it astonishingly. The rate of waste of human lives is even higher than that of materials. Do the American people know this? Their operations have no other meaning than to achieve the selfishness of the Anglo-Saxon race. No matter how long they continue the war, they will continue to waste people's lives and resources, and the distance to achieving their war aims is still far.

Concealing the Facts of Failure

They have also worked hard to deceive their people, so they never allow aviation personnel assigned to the war zone to meet personnel who have previously fought in the workplace, so that they can conceal the facts of failure. They do not provide any kind of information about the truth of the war, and they deal with it vaguely.

They do not know the strength of our Japanese air corps and base airmen, so in the initial battles, they were brave to the point of fighting two, three, or several times, but their morale gradually declined, and they were eventually invaded by miasma and war terror in the dense forests, and they ended up like disabled people. Our brave warriors, who regard death as returning home for the construction of Greater East Asia, even if they fight to the last drop of blood, still shout "Long live the Emperor" and calmly meet their deaths. In their spirit, there is a world of difference from the enemy. As for the ratio of damage, as mentioned earlier, they are heavy and we are light, which is not a problem.

If the enemy forgets all of Japan's military strength and enters our air circle and combat circle, the results they will encounter are proven by the facts.

President Roosevelt recently overestimated his country's air power again and wanted to forget his own suffering from defeat. This can be regarded as a pitiable psychological state.

The American air force in Chongqing treats the Chongqing air force as slaves, ordering them around at will. For a time, they launched air guerrilla warfare in the South China, Hong Kong, Guangdong, and upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Central China, but once our Japanese army air corps was dispatched, they were all defeated one by one. Their so-called forward bases and military facilities were severely damaged, and their fantasies of launching air raids on Japan from these bases were shattered. However, there is danger at any time and place in war. Even the slightest movement of an enemy plane can sometimes succeed, so in order to implement the great righteousness of living and dying together, it is hoped that the Chinese side will have full preparations for air defense and other equipment to intercept enemy planes.

Bluffing and Deceiving People

Next, regarding their attack on Japan from the central region, there are very few air bases in this area, so aircraft carriers must be active. However, the United States has lost excellent carriers one after another since the beginning of the naval war, and it no longer has its original strength. Roosevelt said in a recent broadcast that seven new aircraft carriers of the 25,000-ton class have been sent to the front lines. It is common practice for military strategists to conceal their own intentions and actions in war, but Roosevelt publicly announced his actions to others, which is clearly a bluff and deceptive propaganda.

Actions in the central Pacific region, since the Hawaii naval battle, have clearly been uneven, enough to put the US Navy in danger of being completely annihilated.

The so-called surprise attack force centered on aircraft carriers must be equipped with considerable strong battleships or large cruisers and escort ships such as cruisers and destroyers. The formation of the aircraft carrier group or wheel formation that the United States has produced after years of research is quite difficult today.

If they form an aircraft carrier group with a small number of cruisers or destroyers, it would be our wish that they approach our country unarmed and throw themselves into our net. In short, it would be extremely dangerous for them and extremely fortunate for us to come within our air control sphere or fleet action sphere and engage in a fleet decisive battle. Originally, the tradition of the Imperial Navy is that it does not want them to come, but it sets up an ambush to wait for them to come, so the plan to advance and control the sea or retreat and annihilate the enemy has long been calculated. From the commander-in-chief to the soldiers, everyone is determined to win and is prepared to annihilate the enemy.

Today, in this vast battlefield, all the strategic points that we need are under our control, and the principle of "no fortress is not strong, no place is not fortified" is followed in the defense. It is also unknown whether a certain part of the enemy will set up within our defense circle for a certain period of time, but this is a temporary phenomenon. Strategically, it can capture the enemy in a certain location, and operational actions can produce favorable results.

Regarding their boast that the battle in Burma is about to begin, considerable clouds have already gathered today, but the results will be proven by the facts. There is no need to express opinions for the time being.

The Surrender of the Italian Fleet

On September 8, the Italian Badoglio regime surrendered, which was an unprecedented shameful surrender in world history. As a result, a part of the Italian fleet fell into the hands of the British Navy. It is reported that there are a total of seven battleships, sixteen cruisers, thirteen destroyers, and fourteen submarines.

In terms of the number of ships alone, the British Navy has gained this strength, which is extremely favorable in future operations, but the fact is definitely not so. How do we know it is useless? Because the Italian crew members have had no fighting spirit from the beginning, and they will not be able to send them to the battlefield in the future. However, it is not so simple and feasible to replace them with British and American personnel.

Everything is highly mechanized. Naval vessels have different styles of machinery, and it is not easy for novices to drive them. Even learning a language cannot be completely remembered in a short period of time, let alone warships with complex machinery. Moreover, one must operate these weapons and machinery while fighting, so one must first have a considerable long period of training. This is completely different from students in teenage schools who can immediately play a role in air defense work.

What is even more difficult is that the sizes of cannons and other weapons are completely different from those produced by Britain and the United States. Apart from the ammunition currently loaded, it is too late to replenish them temporarily.

The replenishment of this weaponry and ammunition depot has almost all been confiscated by Germany. Now, re-sketching the drawings and producing them according to the dimensions, can the productivity of Britain and the United States be competent for this?

It is believed that this fleet will soon be buried in a corner of the Mediterranean Sea.

To take a step back, even if this fleet is considered to increase its strength and the British fleet deploys considerable strength to the Indian Ocean, it can only become a weakness on one side strategically and is not worth caring about.

Fighting power must be fully developed after the energy of people and materials is fully harmonized. The mere existence of materials has no meaning.

In short, the Italian fleet claimed to be out of fuel, unable to move, and surrendered, but there was no lack of fuel to drive them back to the enemy's port. This situation made countless patriotic heroes after Kaiser cry in the ground. If their peace is successful, then what will Badoglio and others use as a criterion to educate the people in the future? We have unlimited sympathy for the future of their country. The spirit of the East Asian people is always to fight to the end for justice. Without justice, even if their arrows are broken and their bodies are shattered, they must fight bravely to the end.

Must Achieve Final Victory

We know from the Chinese history we learned in the Eighteen Histories that the place where blood is shed can make future generations upright. Wen Tianxiang's Song of Righteousness has created countless righteous and heroic people in China, which Japan still passes down. At the time of the Sino-Japanese War, Ding Ruchang, the famous admiral who commanded the Beiyang Fleet of North China, if his last tragic situation were known to today's Badoglio and others, even if they were as shameless as they are, they would be ashamed of the unfavorable European situation for the Axis powers. We also acknowledge and firmly believe that we will endure some difficulties and the German people in shifts and the Italian people under the Mussolini regime will surely achieve great results in the future.

The progress and retreat of war is like the rise and fall of the tide. I don't know how many times there will be progress and retreat in an instant. As long as we hold on to the last line, we will be able to win the crown of victory.

If we unfold the map of Greater East Asia and observe it, we are even more convinced that the dawn of Greater East Asia is already in sight. The sincere cooperation between Japan and the Republic of China is essential for the permanent peace of East Asia. At present, the south of Burma has been restored, and the independence of the Philippines is not far away. The bells of dawn have rung past the clouds, and we are convinced that it will be able to complete the peace of the entire East Asia.

If the United States and Britain run rampant in East Asia for one day, the East Asian people will be regarded as slaves for one day, extracting our blood and sweat. They even prohibit Chinese people from entering parks in China. We must awaken as soon as possible. If we miss today, the good opportunity will not come again. We must not engage in the foolish act of brothers fighting each other and causing the fisherman to profit.

If the solid unity between China and Japan can be completed, and the economic and cultural exchange with the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere can be successful, then our 400 million East Asian people can achieve permanent and unchangeable happiness, and the Pure Land of Bliss described by Sakyamuni can then appear.

We must fight to the end against all external forces that hinder the construction of this Land of Bliss.

This construction can form the cornerstone of East Asia's historical cornerstone for thousands of years to come. For the sake of our children and grandchildren, it is a great cause that must be completed. (The End)
