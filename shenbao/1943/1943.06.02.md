### On the Urgent Relief of North China - Fourth Discourse

Regarding the urgent relief of North China, we have repeatedly and earnestly appealed, not fearing to speak exhaustively. The core of our hope lies in the idea of "treating disaster relief as fighting a fire." Besides offering various suggestions concerning official relief, charitable relief, the establishment of relief organizations, the selection of relief personnel, the formulation of relief methods, and the collection of relief funds and materials, there is a particular need for agility and a swift undertaking of tasks, so that the suffering of our compatriots in the disaster area can be alleviated as soon as possible.

We have repeatedly received the outpouring of the highest human compassion from our readers, who have contributed money and materials, continuously and enthusiastically. In the past half-month alone, this newspaper has collected over 300,000 yuan on behalf of the effort. As for the organization responsible for overall urgent relief, it has already been established in Nanjing. In this city, the relevant authorities have also completed preparations, and the "Shanghai All-Circles Urgent Relief Association for North China" will be formally established today. Now that there is an urgent relief organization responsible for overall management, it should bring into play and utilize concentrated efforts to handle everything. We still hope that this organization can act with speed and decisiveness, meeting the ardent expectations of society. We would like to offer our views again for reference:

First, for this urgent relief effort, whether leaders, workers, or donors, all should take "serving to rescue the compatriots in the disaster area of North China" as their sole objective. At the same time, they should clearly recognize the "heavy responsibility" and the "urgency of the situation," and make redoubled efforts. Under this spirit, whether it is official relief or charitable relief, there should be sincere cooperation and concerted efforts. We must understand that the establishment of organizations is for disaster relief; the fundraising and donations are for disaster relief; the efforts to connect and coordinate are for disaster relief; and the raising of voices in appeal is also for disaster relief. Although the forms of service may be different, the goal is the same. Disaster relief work only involves obligations, never rights; it should only benefit the disaster victims, and there should be no public or private distinctions. Criticize oneself as one criticizes others, and trust others as one trusts oneself. Those in charge should be sincere and work hard in their respective tasks; those not in charge should strictly supervise and encourage their spirit, and hold them accountable for their effectiveness. Those in charge have responsibilities, and those not directly in charge also have responsibilities. In short, "alleviating the suffering of the disaster victims as soon as possible" is when we can consider our responsibilities fulfilled and our hearts at peace.

Second, urgent relief should be urgent, and the methods and techniques for extinguishing sparks cannot be adapted to a raging fire. If it is not easy to quickly collect huge sums of relief funds, then one should negotiate with national banks to obtain loans, which will be repaid with the donated funds raised in the future, or issue bonds to make up for the shortfall. Here, we will reiterate the suggestions made by Mr. Lin Kanghou and Mr. Zhang Yipeng in the editorial of this newspaper on May 20 regarding borrowing from the Central Reserve Bank and issuing disaster relief public bonds. As for the principles of relief, the article "From North China Disaster Relief to the Prerequisites for Disaster Relief" by Mr. Zhang Yipeng in the weekly commentary of this newspaper on May 23 is also worth consulting.

Third, the procurement and transportation of relief supplies require the full assistance of the authorities of friendly nations stationed in China. We hope that in addition to the negotiations by the responsible authorities, the authorities of friendly nations can spontaneously show the highest compassion.

Economic expert Mr. Kurimoto Toraji from a friendly nation published an article in the Continental News a few days ago entitled "Thoroughly Relieving the Famine in North China," and the Continental News also published an editorial entitled "The Obligation of Neighboring Countries" (both can be found on page 4 of today's newspaper), both expressing sympathy. Although Japan is currently devoting all its strength to war purposes and does not have much surplus capacity to actually help Chinese disaster victims, it will still do its best. We are grateful for this expression of sympathy. We recall the past examples of mutual assistance in times of disaster between China and Japan. For example, on September 1, 1923, when a major earthquake occurred in Japan, the Chinese Beijing government convened a special cabinet meeting on September 3, established the "Japan Disaster Relief Association," and allocated 200,000 yuan to help with the relief efforts. Overseas Chinese in Japan allocated another 100,000 yuan for relief and lifted the ban on rice exports; Guangdong established the "Disaster Relief Association," with Wu Chaoshu and Liao Zhongkai as chairman and vice-chairman; Shanghai established the "National Relief Association for Japanese Disaster Relief," donated 120,000 yuan worth of relief supplies, and dispatched the Xinming Wheel to transport rice for relief; Tianjin established the "Relief Comrades Association"; the Northeast also donated 500,000 yuan worth of relief supplies, and Zhang Yuting donated 100,000 yuan himself. Others such as Duan Qirui personally donated 100,000 yuan, Cao Kun 40,000 yuan, and Xu Shichang, Cao Rulin, and others also made donations. People across the country enthusiastically donated, and the fervent situation is still vividly remembered. Moreover, we remember that at that time, there were rifts in the relationship between China and Japan, but the Chinese people were still able to help others in need and enthusiastically provide assistance, never reducing their enthusiasm for disaster relief due to diplomatic relations. This attitude is the embodiment of the spirit of peace and universal love of the Chinese nation. In July 1931, China suffered severe flooding, and the disaster was extremely serious. The Japanese Emperor also allocated 100,000 Japanese yen, which was a powerful contribution to our disaster relief and post-disaster efforts. This sincere friendship in disaster relief and helping neighbors, and the highest compassion for all people under heaven, are virtues shared by both the Chinese and Japanese nations. Moreover, now that China and Japan are closely cooperating for common survival, our compatriots in North China are encountering such a miserable situation. Although we cannot force others to do what is difficult, we hope that friendly nations will not force others to do what is difficult, we hope that friendly nations will provide full convenience to the authorities stationed in China in terms of transporting relief supplies and relaxing the control of relief materials. We believe that we will surely receive sympathy and assistance.

Finally, what we should particularly report is Mr. Pan Sanxing's generous donation of a large sum of money. Mr. Pan delivered a donation of 50,000 yuan last night to purchase 50 boxes of cigars from Mr. Yuan Ludeng for charitable purposes, but he did not take the cigars for himself. Instead, he is willing to sell them again piecemeal for charitable purposes, and donate all the proceeds. Mr. Pan was not satisfied, and he also offered a diamond ring (weighing five carats) and a jade offering vase for charitable sale, with the proceeds to be donated. According to experts, the minimum price for the former is 160,000 yuan, and the latter is 10,000 yuan. He entrusted this newspaper to handle the charitable sale. We express our deep gratitude to Mr. Pan for his generosity in donating both money and goods. At the same time, we hope that wealthy people in Shanghai will follow suit and jointly participate in this charitable cause, strengthening the relief funds so that this urgent relief work in North China can be successfully completed through multifaceted efforts. This will not only save thousands of lives from suffering, but also fully demonstrate the spirit of universal love and the power of unity of our Chinese nation. We cannot but express our hope for this.

At the same time, we thank Mr. Yoshida from a friendly nation for generously donating 1,000 yuan, and Mr. Mizushima for generously donating 300 yuan, setting an example for people from friendly nations.

### Establishing a True Decisive Battle System: Japan to Convene Extraordinary Diet; Cabinet Approves Guidelines for Enterprise Consolidation; Extraordinary Diet Scheduled for Mid-Next Month

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – In order to cope with the current phase of continuous decisive battles and to establish a true decisive battle system with national unity, the Japanese government has decided to convene the 82nd Extraordinary Diet on the 15th of next month. It is currently drafting urgent bills and budget proposals to be submitted to the Diet. Regarding the central issue of this Extraordinary Diet, namely the problem of enterprise consolidation, the Planning Board has been working actively with the relevant authorities, including the Army, Navy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Ministry of Health and Welfare, to formulate a plan. This plan was formally decided upon after being submitted for discussion at the regular cabinet meeting on the 1st. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, the Information Bureau announced the main points of the guidelines for strengthening war efforts and consolidating enterprises, as well as a statement by Planning Board President Suzuki on the matter. The fundamental principles for strengthening war capabilities and consolidating enterprises are: (1) to actively accelerate the war capabilities of those that have not yet been strengthened, and (2) to further consolidate and strengthen important industrial sectors to a high degree. Therefore, after this enterprise consolidation, Japan's direct enhancement of war capabilities, centered on the five major key industries of coal, iron, light metals, aircraft, and ships, can be quickly realized.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government held a regular cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 AM on the 1st. Prime Minister Tojo and all cabinet members were present. First, Planning Board President Suzuki explained in detail the basic guidelines for strengthening war capabilities and consolidating enterprises. After the cabinet members exchanged views, they were approved. Subsequently, Prime Minister Tojo explained the policy of establishing a decisive battle posture. After the cabinet members exchanged views, they decided not to hold the general election of prefectural assembly members this autumn as a preliminary step, and decided to submit the relevant bills to the 82nd Extraordinary Diet before adjourning. Prime Minister Tojo also stated at the meeting that the implementation of establishing a decisive battle posture is an urgent task and proposed that all activities not directly related to strengthening war capabilities be canceled. This proposal was unanimously approved by all cabinet members. The gist of Prime Minister Tojo's proposal is as follows: Because the current situation is extremely important, all citizens of the country should concentrate all their time and effort on producing military supplies, increasing food production, and strengthening transportation. Therefore, the national labor mobilization posture should be strengthened to double the effort in order to utilize all the remaining strength of all levels of the people to enhance war capabilities. Therefore, all public and private activities not directly related to strengthening war capabilities should be reduced. The general election of prefectural assembly members is scheduled for the autumn of this year, but it seems inappropriate for the people to waste their time and effort on elections during this critical period of striving to increase food production. Therefore, the government has decided not to hold the election of prefectural assembly members this autumn.

### Colonel Yamazaki's Posthumous Deeds

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese General Headquarters announced that Colonel Yamazaki Yasuyo led 2,000 of his men in a bloody battle with the American army on Attu Island for two weeks and died heroically, our reporter specially interviewed Lieutenant Colonel Shibusawa, a managing director of the China Broadcasting Association and a classmate of Colonel Yamazaki at the military academy. He revealed the following about Colonel Yamazaki's life: I and Colonel Yamazaki were classmates in the 25th class of the military academy. I recall that Colonel Yamazaki was a fourteen or fifteen-year-old boy at the time. He transferred from Nagoya Youth School to Tokyo Central Youth School (now the preparatory course of the military academy), and our feelings as classmates were very close. After graduating from the military academy, we also met or exchanged letters from time to time. Later, due to the September 18th Incident, we separated. But I was very saddened to hear the announcement from the General Headquarters that Colonel Yamazaki had died heroically. Colonel Yamazaki was bold and had a spirit of perseverance in his youth school days. He got along well with his classmates and was highly respected. Whenever there was a dispute among classmates, it would stop as soon as Mr. Yamazaki arrived. Also, in Nagoya Youth School, he contracted severe sunstroke due to swimming. After being treated by doctors, he vowed that he would dedicate his life to his duties. In addition, Colonel Yamazaki received Spartan training from Lieutenant Colonel Tachibana, the principal of Nagoya Youth School, and martial artist Major General Habu Saburo, and was nurtured by the traditional spirit of Lieutenant Isogai and others during his time at Tokyo Central Youth School. Therefore, Colonel Yamazaki became the unparalleled and heroic assault soldier in the history of world warfare. There are many people who have died heroically, but Colonel Yamazaki is unique in that he has no desire for fame, but completes his tasks with a sense of responsibility. Therefore, Colonel Yamazaki's spirit can inspire his subordinates, wounded soldiers, and 2,000 soldiers to fulfill the great righteousness of heroic death for the country. His English name will be forever remembered by future generations.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Director of Army Press of the Japanese General Headquarters, Tani Hagi, spoke on the 1st of June about the last battle of the Japanese garrison on Attu Island: Combining enemy information, the Japanese army stationed on Attu Island will, as they have resolved, storm into the enemy group's horses near the Masagal Valley on the night of May 29, causing the enemy to flee.

### Navy Soul (7) - Soul

— Toyoshiro Fukuda

When the Japanese Navy was fighting a great naval battle, Vice Admiral Hwobo of the defeated enemy surrendered to our warships and said, "Today is a battle, so I'm wearing these clothes stained with coal, which is really impolite, please forgive me!"

Soiling oneself because of battle is a selfish idea, but for the ancient warriors of our navy, it was the spirit of wearing prepared, high-quality, clean clothes and wanting to be decorated one last time. Comparing the two, there is a world of difference, so it can be seen from this point that who would win.

The day after our navy won a great victory, they started their usual combat exercises as usual. This is truly the natural daily way, the samadhi of an enlightened person.

Tradition is growing. Both the trainer and the trained believe that daily training is war, so those who have achieved countless brilliant victories since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War are only paying the price.

I thought of being on a ship crossing the equator when I heard a lot about the fighting spirit of our seamen. Last January, after occupying Balikpapan, the oil capital of South Borneo, enemy planes attacked our transport ships and escort ships day and night. The enemy blindly bombed the transport ship that retreated to Kijang, and magnificent water columns were bombed all around the hull, and the surface of the water was swept by machine guns like rain. And our boats breathed fiercely and fired into the air, chasing the fleeing enemy aircraft reluctantly. Just as a cat chases a mouse, the will to fight of a boat chasing a bomber - a heroic and inviolable spirit - could not help but remind me of the hawk of our navy chasing Prince Wales, who fled at the sight of a shadow, near the coast of Malai, so I smiled knowingly.

If we think of the unwavering and rigorous constant. All the oceans on the radiation from this place - the majesty of our navy - do not allow us to be negligent for even a moment.

The soldiers on the ship are still soldiers, the warship is still a warship, only the warship flag is the epitome of the country. To see the fighting spirit gathered on this flag. The gunners who fight, the engineers who manage the interior of the warship, everyone, whether in the front or the rear, has an iron will to win. The entire Japan in battle must be like a warship. (Tao: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)

### Australia's War Expenditure Exceeds £1 Billion: Financial Difficulties, Malignant Inflation, Only Tax Increase to Make Up the Budget

Lisbon, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch:

The London Financial News of May 27th published an article entitled "Australia in the War," which stated that according to the Australian Treasury in Canberra, by the end of this fiscal year, Australia's military expenditure in the current war will exceed £1,084,000,000, of which £450,000,000 was raised by issuing bonds, £350,000,000 was obtained from taxes, and the rest was borrowed from banks.

Lisbon, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch:

Due to the abnormal development of military industries and the severe shortage of civilian supplies in Australia, malignant inflation has become even more profound, and its impact on the war is profound and significant. According to British newspapers, Australia's total expenditure in the fiscal year 1942-43 was £652 million, of which war expenditure accounted for £540 million, a considerable increase compared to the £320 million in the fiscal year 1941-42. Australia's main source of revenue is taxes. Although a tax increase was implemented from February of this year, the total tax revenue was only £260 million. The remaining £390 million had to be made up by issuing public bonds and absorbing idle funds. In addition, the shortage of materials and the increase in people's purchasing power are natural phenomena. This is one of the reasons for promoting inflation in Australia. From January of last year to January of this year, the amount of banknotes issued by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in one year was £126.1 million, an increase of £42.9 million compared to last year. The expansion of its paper money is twice the increase in the amount in circulation in previous years, which is clearly a sign of inflation. The Australian government, in view of this, has started to control prices, but has not yet implemented a material rationing system. Australia's wartime expenditure is £672 million, of which £262 million is planned to be raised by taxes, and £260 million is made up by issuing public bonds and borrowing from banks. The remaining £150 million is planned to be raised by other methods. As for its wartime national savings, in 1942 it was only £31.2 million, so the Australian authorities, in their poverty, are planning to implement a large tax increase again. The purpose of the tax increase is to raise the income tax rates for high-income and middle-income groups, but it is feared that this alone will still be difficult to achieve its intended purpose, and it will have to raise the tax rate for low-income groups. However, the current tax rate in Australia is the highest among the British Empire's self-governing territories, so it has been met with fierce opposition from all sides. Therefore, the Australian government seems to have to stop increasing taxes again. In short, Australia is currently in an extremely difficult situation, and its wartime finances can be said to have reached the end of the road.

### After the End of the North African War, Aerial Bombardment Becomes More Intense, Italy Bears the Brunt and Takes Active Defense Measures, Germany Warns Britain That the Time is Ripe to Take Revenge

Stockholm, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: Since the end of the Tunisian campaign, a fierce aerial battle has unfolded on the European front. The anti-Axis forces, in order to disrupt the rear of Italy, are indiscriminately bombing cultural facilities such as hospitals, churches, and schools. The world is outraged by this brutal behavior of the anti-Axis forces, and the unity of the Italian home front is becoming even more solid. The "Katiersborg Post" also pointed out on the 31st that their blind targeting of Italy has only made the Italian people's will to fight more激昂. The indiscriminate bombing of innocent Italian citizens and precious works of art by the anti-Axis air force will also be protested by the art world around the world, it said. In addition, the Italian Air Force and ground artillery are also actively defending against the anti-Axis air force's bombings. On the island of Pantelleria alone, 57 enemy aircraft have been shot down since May 1st. In addition, Italian fighter planes shot down 66 enemy aircraft and 76 enemy aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft guns in the past week. In the past two or three days, the anti-Axis air force has not bombed German territory, but on the 29th and 30th, the German air force shot down 13 enemy aircraft (including bombers) in the Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, on the 30th, they bombed the southeastern coast of the British mainland, accurately bombing enemy harbors and military facilities from low altitude. The German Air Force's long-range bomber squadron is active on the southwest coast of Portugal. After two direct hits on a British 5,000-ton freighter, all German aircraft safely returned to base.

Rome, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: Local evening newspapers yesterday published photos on the cover, showing that the Church of St. Peter and Paul in Livorno had been destroyed by a recent Anglo-American air raid. The church was almost completely destroyed, with only the altar remaining intact.

Stockholm, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: German News Agency reports that the German warning to Britain and the United States that retaliation would be taken when the time was ripe for the bombing of civilians has caused a strong reaction in Britain. Although qualified personnel in the British military and political circles said that the strength of the British and American air forces was sufficient to defend British soil, the general public still had lingering fears about the effects of the German air raids in the winter of 1940. In particular, London believes that once the German air force receives orders, it will immediately launch a planned offensive against Britain and inflict a major blow on Britain. London never underestimates the recent warnings repeatedly issued by Germany, that is, Germany's response to the British bombing will be a large-scale retaliation. The general public knows that the German air force has recently been deliberately conserving its strength, and its strength has obviously increased. The public believes that this move is not only for defense purposes. The issue of large-scale retaliation by German aircraft is becoming increasingly important in Britain, and the anxiety of the British people about this matter is even greater than the submarine war.

Berlin, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: The German General Command announced at noon on the 31st that the German rapid bomber squadrons attacked the southern and southeastern coasts of England on the 30th, bombing the enemy's important military facilities.

### De Gaulle and Giraud Continue Important Meetings, Decide to Establish a Nine-Member Committee as the Core of Unified Governance

Lisbon, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from Algiers, the "Central Executive Committee" of the French separatists held a meeting in Algiers yesterday afternoon. It is said that De Gaulle declared at the meeting that anyone with a tendency to cooperate with the Axis powers must not participate in the committee, because this would hinder relations with Britain and the United States. The current members of the committee are: De Gaulle, his Foreign Affairs Commissioner Massigli, Interior and Labor Commissioner Philip, Giraud, Monnet, and General Georges, who has just arrived in Algiers. It is believed that Jadot will also take a seat on the committee, and several more members will be elected within 24 hours. Yesterday's meeting lasted almost three hours, but the details are not known, but it was announced that Giraud and De Gaulle had agreed to send a joint representative to Washington to discuss the issue of French prisoners of war. At the same time, London is extremely concerned about the meeting between Giraud and De Gaulle. According to the London Times, the British authorities will not interfere for the time being.

Lisbon, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from Algiers, the French separatists held a meeting in Algiers on the 31st and decided to establish a nine-member committee as the core of unified governance. In addition to De Gaulle, Giraud, and Jadot, seven others, two more will be elected, and the election can be completed in about a day or two.

Amsterdam, 31st - Central News Agency dispatch: German News Agency reports that General Giraud has appointed General Georges and General Monat as representatives to participate in the newly established Central Executive Committee.

Lisbon, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: The Havas Agency reported last night from Tangier that before the leader of the North African rebels, Giraud, began negotiations with De Gaulle, he had consulted with the Soviet Foreign Ministry's representative in Algiers, Nikitin, on Sunday. However, the communique issued afterwards did not declare the nature of the meeting. Political figures in Tangier believe that Giraud has asked the Soviet representative to restrain the communists in Algiers, because they have fiercely attacked Giraud in the past few weeks and have shown pro-De Gaulle colors.

### Britain and the United States Release the Air of Invading Europe, the Axis Powers are Fully Prepared

Rome, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: According to the Stefani Agency, the Italian newspaper said that since the anti-Axis side announced the date of invading Europe, the Axis powers are closely watching the changes in the situation and will never be caught unprepared and attacked. Moreover, in terms of the situation, the anti-Axis supreme command will never announce the exact date of the attack on Europe to the public, so we must not regard the air released by the anti-Axis side as reliable. From another point of view, Stalin's attitude is unpredictable, and the Eastern Front is unusually lonely. Before the offensive, he is waiting for Britain and the United States to fulfill their promises. The facts in the future will prove that every soldier of the Axis powers is fully prepared to deal with any environment.

### Stilwell Discusses Military Affairs in Britain

Stockholm, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: General Stilwell, Commander-in-Chief of the US Army in India and China, will continue the military discussions that Prime Minister Churchill began in Washington, D.C. Yesterday afternoon, the US Army Headquarters in Europe announced that after General Stilwell arrived in Britain, he immediately consulted with Lieutenant General Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief of the US Army in Britain, and the Commander of the US Air Force. Afterwards, he held extremely secret talks with British military leaders. It is reported that after Stilwell concludes his mission in Britain, he will set off to return to Chongqing.

Lisbon, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: According to news from London, Gu Weijun, Ambassador to Britain stationed in Chongqing, returned to London from Washington yesterday. Because he had not returned to China for ten years, he left London in October last year to return to Chongqing. Gu was also in London when Roosevelt and Churchill held a meeting in Washington, D.C.

### Carrying a Reply from Stalin, Davies Returns to Washington, It is Reported that Roosevelt Plans to Send Benes to the Soviet Union to Explain the US Attitude Towards the Soviet Union

Ankara, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Soviet Union, Davies, returned to the United States today, carrying a reply from Stalin to Roosevelt. Davies returned from Moscow via Alaska.

Stockholm, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: Reuters announced that the news that President Roosevelt sent a leader of a certain government-in-exile in London to Moscow on a special mission was the main topic of discussion in London political circles last night. London believes that former Czech President Benes is the most suitable candidate for this trip. When British Prime Minister Churchill visited the United States, Roosevelt and Churchill hoped to give Benes some important work. This important work is to send Benes to the Soviet Union to mediate the discord between the Soviet Union and the governments-in-exile in London, and to eliminate the doubts of the small countries in Europe about the Soviet Union. This will help Britain and the United States to wage war against Europe. London political circles also believe that Benes will discuss with the Soviet government guarantees regarding the US recognition of certain Soviet demands. Reuters confirmed this yesterday and said that Roosevelt will send a representative from a neutral party to Moscow to explain the US attitude towards the Soviet Union.

### British Giant Ships Leave Gibraltar

Madrid, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: According to Havas Agency news from Algeciras, there are no giant British ships in Gibraltar at present. Three aircraft carriers, three battleships, and several destroyers have left for the Mediterranean and Atlantic directions yesterday morning. On Monday morning, there were one cruiser and four destroyers docked in the port.

### Turkish President to Deliver Speech Regularly

Istanbul, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: German News Agency reports that Turkish President Ismet will deliver a speech on the general situation at the People's Party Congress to be held on June 8th.

### Alexandria: French Ships Succumb to Britain, Still Unable to Be Used by Britain

Lisbon, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: According to news from London, the British naval authorities have not yet announced how the French fleet in Alexandria, which has already succumbed to British pressure, will be used in the future. British military circles have mentioned the difficulty of making this French ship join the British Navy, because this French ship had been partially disarmed in accordance with the Franco-German Armistice Agreement, and it will take a considerable amount of time before it can be used again.

### Brazil Burns Excess Coffee, Enough to Supply the World for Three Years

Buenos Aires, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: The Brazilian representative participating in the Hot Springs Food Conference explained at the conference the situation that his country could not handle the overproduction of coffee, saying that Brazil had burned 75 million bags of coffee in the middle of last year. This is because countries use tariff barriers to prevent coffee imports, and the ratio is so high that it is truly staggering, sometimes reaching a thousand times the original coffee price. Therefore, Brazilian coffee cannot be exported, so it has to be burned. At this moment, it is intended to ask the governments of various countries to adopt a reasonable trade policy in order to save the situation. It is reported that the 75 million bags of coffee burned by Brazil last year are enough to supply the world for three years.

### A GlimMER OF HOPE FOR RESOLVING THE SINO-JAPANESE INCIDENT

— Toshisuke Yoshida

(1) Professor Fumio Kotake, who has researched China at the Toa Dobun Shoin for twenty years, was honored by the school authorities on May 26th. On that day, he gave a profound speech at the press conference, focusing on the core of the Sino-Japanese problem, which has been the center of attention recently. The full text is reprinted below:

"The foundation of Japan's planning is loyalty and righteousness, while the bond that constitutes Chinese society is trust and integrity. Zilu in the Analects mentioned that there are three ways to win the hearts of the people: trust and integrity are the best policy, financial resources are the middle policy, and military force is the worst policy. Britain and the United States have failed to win over China with the middle policy. If Japan tries to win the hearts of the Chinese people by force, it can be said to be the worst policy. Unfortunately, China's perception of Japan is that it does not trust Japan. The fundamental solution to China's problems lies in restoring lost trust. Since our country has declared the abolition of extraterritoriality and the unconditional return of enemy property, it must be thoroughly implemented. No sacrifice should be spared. This is the last chance for Sino-Japanese cooperation. Once trust and integrity are established, all issues between China and Japan can be resolved." (Mainland New Daily, May 27th)

As Professor Kotake said, most Japanese know that "using force to win the hearts of the Chinese people is the worst policy towards China"; however, most Chinese people today deeply believe that Japan "intends to use force to win the hearts of the Chinese people." This is the focus of the Sino-Japanese problem. If most Chinese people today understand that Japan has no intention of "using force to win the hearts of the Chinese people," the Sino-Japanese Incident would have been resolved long ago. Conversely, if Japan fails to make the Chinese people understand this point, even if Japan "thoroughly implements" "the abolition of extraterritoriality and the unconditional return of enemy property," the Sino-Japanese problem will not be satisfactorily resolved. Of course, the reason for resolutely abolishing extraterritoriality and unconditionally returning enemy property is to correct the misunderstanding of the Chinese people that Japan wants to resolve China by force, but this is by no means "the last chance." On the contrary, if we can make the Chinese people understand that Japan has no ambition to "resolve China by force," this will be the ultimate success of the policy towards China.

(2) After Japan "changes its policy," the most important task is to concretely prove to the Chinese people that Japan does not intend to seize China by force. Just as the Chinese people and Professor Kotake both admit that "China's perception of Japan is that it does not trust Japan," they are completely wary of every move of the Japanese. Of course, simply chanting high-sounding slogans such as "Sino-Japanese friendship," "same script, same race," and "coexistence and co-prosperity" will only increase suspicion. The only way to explain to the Chinese people is to openly and publicly review the current objective situation of China and Japan, in order to point out the inevitable path of mutual cooperation between the two countries.

Then, what is the current objective situation of China and Japan in Greater East Asia? Let's put aside the international situation for the moment. Within the Greater East Asia region, Japan has almost grasped its entire economic lifeline and entire strategic key points. The mission of the Japanese army is not to expand the occupied areas, but to ensure those already occupied. The particularly important issue is the development of the economy of the Greater East Asia region, in order to cultivate a war power that is absolutely invincible to the productive power of Britain and the United States. Although the Japanese authorities are not afraid of the productive power of Britain and the United States, they never underestimate it. For the East Asian economic development necessary to counter the productive power of Britain and the United States, the most important thing for Japan is manpower. Japan has technology, materials, and organizational power, but what it lacks most is manpower. However, the acquisition of manpower is by no means an insurmountable obstacle, because more than half of the world's people live in Asia. In particular, the most populous country in the world is China. In short, the question is whether this huge manpower can be mobilized. The knowledge level of Chinese and Japanese people is roughly the same. If they are given appropriate technical education, these tens of millions of people can immediately be used in any sector of modern industry. However, the fact that they are unwilling to assist Japan is true not only in terms of production, but also in all other aspects, with only differences in degree. However, as long as the Chinese people believe that Japan "intends to conquer the hearts of the Chinese people by force," they will never be willing to cooperate with Japan. For this reason, if Japan wants the Chinese people to bear the burden of the Greater East Asia War, the method of "resolving China by force" will inevitably fail. If there are still Japanese people today who "intend to win the hearts of the Chinese people by force," it can be considered that they intend to obstruct Japan from carrying out the war against Britain and the United States. Although human beings create objective facts through their behavior, once objective facts are formed, those objective facts in turn dominate human behavior. The Greater East Asia War is an objective existence independent of the will of the belligerent countries, and has already constituted an irresistible force. Unilateral human will has no place in it. The objective situation that has developed in the course of this Greater East Asia War has prompted Japan to feel the need for the sincere cooperation of the Chinese people. However, the method of "winning the hearts of the Chinese people by force" has become a necessary condition for Japan to not be able to carry out the Greater East Asia War. Thus, the Chinese people's long-standing fear of Japan can be completely satisfactorily resolved based on this international situation. If, on the contrary, based on this international situation, the conclusion is reached that they must be able to join hands with Britain and the United States and try to obstruct Japan from building Greater East Asia, then such people are influenced by some preconceived notions.

(3) The preconceived notions truly held by a part of the Chinese people were laid by a series of unfortunate incidents such as the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, and the August 13th Incident. This concept is very deeply rooted. If anyone slightly violates their concept, the intensity of their anger is such that they often bring out three generations of ancestors to curse endlessly. Because I published an essay in the Shen Bao, I was scolded by readers. Someone said, "You don't look at the reality of Sino-Japanese relations, but only discuss ideal Sino-Japanese relations, which objectively protects Japan's position since the September 18th Incident." Others said, "Isn't the current Japanese targetting the third type of pro-Japanese faction? Since you protect the existing Sino-Japanese cooperation, then you are protecting the second type of pro-Japanese faction." Now, I'm sorry to the reader that I don't have time to answer them one by one, but I only have one counter-question, that is, if we only circle around the issue of who owns the two provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, what kind of rational peace solution can there be between Germany and France?" If we only settle old scores and talk about past facts, the result is that the only way to solve the problem is to resort to force. If we discuss the Sino-Japanese problem from this standpoint, then the conclusion will be: it is better for us to resort to other more appropriate methods than to resort to articles for discussion, so the two major ethnic groups will not stop fighting until they are both destroyed. If not, and we want to obtain some kind of rational peace solution (such as not wanting the cultures of China and Japan to perish like the Aztec culture), then we should not look for it in historical hatred, but in the necessity arising from the status quo. Moreover, if we do not simply study the continuous unfortunate incidents from the September 18th Incident to today itself, then we must examine it in the international situation in which it occurred. Most Japanese people believe in what former Prime Minister Konoe said: "The Sino-Japanese dispute is an abnormal East Asian civil strife that occurred under the heavy pressure of the old world system. To resolve it, there is hope only by swiftly and decisively cutting off the contradictions built on the foundation of the old world order." Therefore, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the heavy pressure of overthrowing the old British and American system created the objective situation for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute today.

When a nation with strong development power encounters obstacles to its development, it is bound to erupt in some way if it cannot adjust its development power. Those who deny the inevitability of this eruption also deny the development power of that nation. The world creates the inevitability of Japan's eruption on the one hand, and criticizes this eruption on the other hand. This is as unreasonable as a husband criticizing his wife, "Prices are so high, why do you want to have children?" It would be strange if China had the same development potential as Japan, and there was no conflict between China and Japan. Regarding the cause of the conflict between China and Japan, if we do not think about its inevitability with each other, but only say "I am long" and "you are short" and attack each other's behavior, then the conflict between China and Japan can never be resolved. As long as the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan are in the same stage of development, I call those who believe that this struggle will never end as the Sino-Japanese permanent struggle theorists. In fact, most of those who refute me unconsciously fall into the standpoint of this "Sino-Japanese permanent struggle theorist."

At the same time, Japanese who only recognize the development of the Japanese nation and deny the development of the Chinese nation also unconsciously fall into the standpoint of the "Sino-Japanese permanent struggle theorist." These two standpoints are both standpoints that hinder the resolution of the Sino-Japanese Incident. On the contrary, if we jointly recognize the development of the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan, and then estimate how to adjust this development, how not to make this narrow nationalism development of the two countries oppose each other, and guide it to external development, we can discover a reasonable and peaceful solution to the Sino-Japanese Incident.

Due to the new "January 28th Incident" in East Asia, Japan has overthrown the power of external forces that instigated the development forces of the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan to conflict with each other. Now, the development forces of the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan can develop outwards hand in hand. In the Colosseum in Rome, African and Syrian prisoners captured by the Romans fought each other for the Roman citizens to enjoy. The Chinese and Japanese people, because they are colored people, have been boycotted by Australia and expelled by the United States, and they have been fighting each other endlessly in the confines of East Asia. This scene is exactly the same as the fight in the Roman Colosseum for the enjoyment of Britain and the United States. The Africans and Syrians who fought in the Colosseum hated each other and killed each other to the last person, thus satisfying the eyes of the Roman citizens. If the people of China and Japan kill each other to the last person because of mutual hatred, those who are as happy as the Roman citizens will of course be Britain and the United States. The new objective situation formed by the Greater East Asia War has destroyed the Colosseum surrounding the people of China and Japan. Now is the time for the people of China and Japan to demand that the visitors pay a considerable admission fee. May 29, 32nd year (Translated by Rong)

### THE CHINA UNITED PUBLISHING COMPANY - GRAND OPENING YESTERDAY - COMPLETION OF A UNIFIED INSTITUTION - PUBLISHING REVIVAL EXPECTED

The China United Publishing Co., Ltd., jointly prepared by Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, World Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, and Datong Book Company, has been ready since its preparation began. A tea party was held at the Hua Mao Hotel on the 8th floor yesterday (1st) at 3:30 PM to entertain people from all walks of life. In addition to Cao Bingyan, the manager of the company, and Bao Qinglin, Wu Shutong, Lu Gaoyi, Zhang Xichen, Jiang Xiling, and Jiang Junyi, the managers of the Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, World Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, and Datong Book Company, respectively, government officials and guests attending the meeting included Zhao Zunyue, Secretary-General representing Mayor Chen, Zhao Runfeng, Secretary representing Minister Li of the Ministry of Education, Feng Wei, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department, Lin Tong'an, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, and guests Zhao Zhengping, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Huang Jingwan, Shen Ziliang, Shen Zhong'an, Ku Jiancheng, Zhao Puxianqing, and Gu Yueran. On the Japanese side, guests included Okazaki, General Affairs Minister representing Minister Tajiri of the Embassy's Shanghai Affairs Office, Consul Iwai, Consul Tanaka, Minister Saji, Chief Kikuchi of the News Inspection Office of the Public Works Department, Ban Jin Changichiro, Toshisuke Yoshida, President Yada of Toa Dobun Shoin University, President Yamamoto Sanehiko of Nippon Kaizo Sha, President Izumitsu of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, and Sakata Takeo of the Distribution Company, totaling more than 200 people. The tea party started at 3:30 PM, and Wu Shutong first chaired the meeting and gave an opening speech.

Wu Shutong's Opening Speech

In brief, he said: "Shanghai is the center of culture in the country. In recent years, due to various reasons, the atmosphere in the cultural circles has been very quiet, and the decline of the publishing industry has been particularly significant. Under the urging of public opinion and the expectations of all parties, we have the organization of this company. Therefore, although this company is a purely commercial institution, the scope of funding belongs to the publishing industry, which is slightly different from general commercial institutions, and is a cultural commercial institution. Since the outbreak of the war, the disaster of war has inevitably caused temporary damage and cessation to cultural and educational undertakings. The southeastern coastal area is centered on Shanghai. In the past five or six years, the losses in culture and education, whether tangible or intangible, have been great, without further ado. If it is not repaired urgently, it will be delayed day by day, and recovery will be more difficult, and its impact on the national livelihood will be profound and heavy. We believe that the revitalization of culture is important in peacetime, and its importance is even greater in wartime. It is necessary to increase military strength to seek the revival of the publishing industry, and to contribute to cultural education, to slightly make up for the shortcomings after the trauma of cultural undertakings, to directly serve the readers and the masses, and indirectly serve the country and the nation," and so on.

Speech by the Mayor's Representative

In brief, he said: "Shanghai has been affected by the war since the incident, and has declined slightly. But we do not abandon the cultural publishing industry because of the war. Cultural undertakings in wartime have different methods from peacetime. Due to wartime resources and talent relations, new methods must be used to operate in order to make the publishing industry develop. The opening of the China United Publishing Company today can be said to be a powerful organization that is suitable for the times and under the wartime system. In the future, the publishing industry in this city will definitely be able to revitalize and achieve greater progress," and so on.

Speech by the Representative of Minister Li

In brief, he said: "The relationship between the Ministry of Education and the publishing industry is very close. The Ministry of Education has the mission of developing culture in national administration, and the publishing industry has the function of promoting culture in group undertakings. The Ministry believes that if we want to develop Chinese culture, we must first make the publishing industry have a sound organization and smooth progress. Therefore, the Ministry's past and future attitude is consistent in doing its best to promote and support its development for the publishing industry. I take this opportunity to participate in this grand opening ceremony to respectfully wish the company's business and Chinese culture a prosperous future and reach a bright and splendid state," and so on.

Speech by Minister Okazaki

Speech by General Affairs Minister Okazaki representing Minister Tajiri: "Today, the establishment of the China United Publishing Company, in the eyes of the Japanese, the most gratifying is Minister Tajiri, but he was unable to participate due to public affairs in Tokyo. The publishing industry is not culture itself, but without the publishing industry, culture cannot develop. Therefore, the publishing industry is important for cultural relations. The Japanese admire the 5,000-year-old cultural development of China the most. All students entering middle school must learn Chinese, so studying ancient Chinese culture is the most common and enthusiastic phenomenon in Japan, which is even more important than learning European and American culture. However, few people pay attention to modern Chinese culture. From a personal point of view, the relationship between China and Japan is close, and we should study it enthusiastically. If Chinese and Japanese cultures can communicate, we can talk about the new combination of the two countries. The exchanges between the people of China and Japan have already begun. Although there are occasional setbacks, the relationship between the two countries is closer than that of any other country, which is self-evident. Sun Yat-sen's legacy has already understood that the unity of the East Asian nation is the most urgent and necessary. Now, the major book companies in China have formed the China United Publishing Company, which has great hope for the promotion of Chinese new culture in the future, and it is indeed worthy of congratulations. I especially hope that your company will not only promote the inherent culture of China, but also introduce more Japanese culture."

Speech by Director Feng

In the past six months, there have been two major events in Shanghai's cultural circles. One is the establishment of the New United Association a few months ago, and the other is the establishment of the National United Publishing Company today. Zeng Jun New United was established when he said that the establishment of the News United Association had launched a huge bomb against Britain and the United States. Now that your company has been established, it is shipping a large amount of food from Nanyang. Regardless of Chinese and Japanese people, they are eagerly anticipating spiritual food. Now that your company has been established, it cannot obtain a large amount of rice and coal, because material food and spiritual food are equally important. In the future, spiritual food can be resolved, so the benevolence is very important. The cultural development of each place can show the cultural progress of that place. Under the rule of the National Government, the cultural work in the peaceful areas is being vigorously revived. The establishment of your company this time is the result of your hard work, and you have also received great help from the great country. The hard work you have gained will surely be promoted and developed. I sincerely wish your company a prosperous future.

Speech by Wen Lantting

In brief, he said: "During the recent war period, the cultural trend in China has inevitably declined and stagnated. Due to the poor economic situation, most people have been oppressed by the sharp rise in prices. They are struggling in hunger and cold and cannot enjoy a pure cultural life. If we want to get rid of this bad environment of material domination, on the one hand, the people must have their own awareness and self-understanding, and on the other hand, there must be an institution engaged in cultural undertakings that strives to advocate and promote. The establishment of the China United Publishing Company is to meet this need. I deeply hope that all colleagues of the China United Publishing Company can clearly recognize this point," and so on.

Speech by President Yamamoto of Nippon Kaizo Sha

The nation's material is feared to be hoarded, but the more culture is hoarded, the better. The current war does not only rely on weapons. Political culture is equally important. He also stated that due to transportation relations in Japan, the publishing industry is restricted by paper, and the length of the book is reduced. He hopes that the Chinese publishing industry will use paper in practice and make more cultural propaganda that is beneficial to East Asia, and so on.

### Clearing Villages Transferred to City Government

Since the National Government started the Clearing Villages campaign, the area has gradually expanded, and the tasks have become increasingly complex. The original Clearing Villages Committee was no longer adequate to meet the needs. Therefore, it was resolved at the 15th Supreme National Defense Conference on the 20th of last month to abolish the original Clearing Villages Committee. All Clearing Villages affairs will be transferred to a new organization established by the Executive Yuan to lead and handle. At the same time, the National Government issued an order to abolish the Clearing Villages Committee, and all Clearing Villages affairs in various provinces and cities will be the responsibility of the respective provincial and municipal governments to ensure clear systems and unified institutions to increase effectiveness. After Mayor Chen received the order, he discussed with senior personnel under his command the matter of ending the Shanghai Clearing Villages Branch and establishing the Shanghai Special Municipality Clearing Villages Affairs Bureau under the City Government. It is now heard that the bureau is reorganized from the Shanghai Clearing Villages Branch, and there will be no significant changes in internal organization and personnel to continue to promote the Clearing Villages work. Preparations are currently underway, and the formal establishment will be announced soon.

### Two Young Men Die Unnatural Deaths

Watching a Ball Game Leads to Murder: Yi and Ren Meng Youcai, 32 years old this year, ran a second-hand goods business in Shanghai. He lived with his wife, Ms. Ru, at 156 Rue Amiral Courbet. At 3 PM on the 26th of last month, he went to the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge to watch a member ball game. Unexpectedly, a young man named Liang Chun accused him of stealing a car velvet coat and reported it to the association staff. He was detained in the staff room on the third floor. When they planned to report him to the police, Meng, in desperation, jumped out of the window to escape, resulting in a broken left arm and left leg. The police station was notified and sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died the next day. The body was taken to the coroner's office. It is now learned that the deceased's wife, because her husband died tragically and unnaturally, has hired a lawyer to negotiate.

Classmate Stabbed to Death: Jin Weigang, a local, was 16 years old and studied at Yucaigong School on Shanhai Pass Road. He had a classmate, Jiang Xingyuan, who had previously lived in Jin's home for a period of time, and their relationship was excellent. Yesterday morning, Jiang Xingyuan suddenly broke into Jin's house, took out a sharp blade, and stabbed Jin in the head, chest, and back three times. Family members arrived and reported to the police, who arrested the murderer. Jin Weigang died from his serious injuries. The police station is investigating the reason for the murder.

Yesterday's newspaper was sent out at 7:00 PM sharp.

### Thoroughly Relieving the Disaster in North China

— Kurimoto Inji

On the 17th, 19th, and 20th of last month, the Shen Bao published three editorials, loudly appealing for the urgent relief of North China. Titled "Pleading for the People of North China," "Reiterating the Appeal for the Disaster in North China," and "North China Relief Cannot Be Delayed," these lengthy articles, totaling several thousand words, spared no details in explaining the dire situation. Due to years of drought, the provinces of Shandong and Henan have suffered poor harvests, especially the great famine of last year, causing unspeakable suffering to the people. The articles described the pressing circumstances and the severity of the suffering in a very tragic and moving way, strongly emphasizing the urgency and the need for immediate relief. I have also received reports from my company's overseas staff, learning about the tragic situation of the people in North China due to last year's great famine. It is said that in some places, displaced people, unable to find food, have exhausted the grass roots and tree bark, even devouring them to temporarily alleviate their hunger. What a tragic and heartbreaking message this is.

The urgency of relieving the disaster victims is not only felt by the Shen Bao, but who in all of China is not anxious? Everyone hopes that this urgent relief effort will be launched even faster than the ambulances in Shanghai. Who does not have a warm love for their compatriots? Not only are the Chinese people like this, but the people of neighboring Japan should also participate in this urgent relief effort. Unfortunately, my country is currently dedicating its national strength to defeating Britain and the United States, so although it has unlimited sympathy for this disaster in China, it cannot directly provide relief. This is the unfortunate reality. Therefore, I, a Japanese resident in China, while fulfilling my duties in serving the home front, cannot but offer my prayers to the disaster victims of our friendly neighbor, China. Although China is known for its vast land and abundant resources, when considering China's population and its production, it is not necessarily possible to affirm the abundance of resources. Although China is vast, there are natural and man-made disasters large and small every year. Among the large and small disasters suffered throughout the year, some could have been prevented by human effort beforehand. However, considering China's current intellect and social organization, it is probably not easy to do so. Therefore, from a more passive perspective, one should consider establishing a permanent relief agency, and this kind of facility is also a political topic for a new China. The annual harvests have been poor, and last year's disaster was particularly severe. Therefore, this is not today's disaster, but there were signs of today's famine half a year ago or even earlier. However, due to the lack of a relief agency, today's tragedy has been created. Now that things have come to this point, loudly appealing for disaster relief, even if the words are not false, I am afraid that the result will still be far from effective.

In past years, when disasters, both natural and man-made, occurred in Central and North China, the people mostly found ways to dredge the urgent relief supplies needed, taking emergency measures. Although disasters could not be completely avoided, most of them could be saved in advance. However, the current economic situation under wartime has impeded the free exchange of goods between North and Central China due to its uncertainty. This is an unavoidable situation, but restrictions on currency circulation and the movement of goods, especially the difficulty of food exchange, have undoubtedly exacerbated the extent of the disaster. It is undeniable that dredging food to North China and promoting relief efforts together will surely make this relief effort more effective.

However, China is vast, and one cannot say for sure where disasters will occur in a year. Although today's emergency in North China has been saved, one cannot guarantee that disasters will not occur elsewhere tomorrow. Having thought of the drought in North China, one should also consider the floods in Central China in advance. Therefore, taking advantage of this drought in North China, the Nanjing Central Government must study irrigation and flood control measures to the extent that human resources can reach, and actively prevent disasters. On the one hand, a permanent relief agency should be established, with large-scale fundraising, and at the same time, relief bonds or relief lottery tickets should be issued, using various methods to ensure sufficient relief funds so that they can be readily allocated in case of an emergency. From the perspective of China's current national situation, this is an appropriate method and worthy of promotion. Here, let me say something else. In the past, China often had official and private fundraising events, but very few of the relief efforts actually benefited the true victims. Most of them were pocketed halfway through, silently and quietly. How regrettable this is. Thinking of danger in times of peace, so I think of this situation, and I hope that this point will not be seen again today. Accumulating grain to prevent famine is also a necessary mentality for stable living. (Yunpeng: Translated from the May 31st edition of the Mainland New Daily)

### Obligations of Neighboring People

Recently, the citizens of Shanghai have been loudly appealing for urgent relief for the disaster in North China, which is worth noting. The Nanjing National Government has also taken the lead and adopted active countermeasures. At this time and place, how can we Japanese residents in China sit idly by and watch the tragic suffering of our neighbors?

...We are now fighting with everything we have for the survival of our motherland. Even the smallest material and strength cannot be overlooked and must be mobilized to achieve the war's objectives. With this in mind, should we just say a few nice words to the countless disaster victims in North China and not think of any concrete relief measures? No, absolutely not. We must find a way to help. We are not paupers without any means. We should contribute what we can.

!...The famine in North China is not a new problem. The province with the most severe famine, Henan, still has some areas under Chongqing's jurisdiction. Therefore, Chongqing has long been preparing for a relief campaign, and it is said that the United States is also launching a similar campaign. In fact, the United States does not have pity or humanitarianism in mind but is using this as a way to win over Chongqing, which is not a relief effort at all.

...Chongqing and the United States have already done this kind of work, but as long as we do this kind of relief work with sincerity, it doesn't matter who does it first or last. It's not too late to start now. The actual amount of relief supplies is not the only issue. The real starting point is to treat the suffering of the disaster victims as our own suffering, and we must also bear in mind that their lives today determine their fate tomorrow.

...The Chinese citizens of Shanghai are greatly concerned about this issue. This is naturally human nature, but seeing the difficulties of today's living environment in Shanghai, they are willing to raise funds and collect materials to help their compatriots, which reveals a very deep meaning. Originally, Shanghainese were accused of being cold-blooded people who had lost their nationality, but now, this enthusiastic relief campaign, willing to endure hardship themselves to help others, is a sincere expression of protest against this accusation. We should also strive to work together in a life-and-death relationship! (Yunpeng: Translated from the May 30th edition of the Mainland New Daily editorial)

### Economic News: Translated Report on the Recent Work Goals of the Business Coordination Committee

Since its transfer to the Executive Yuan on May 20th, the Business Coordination Committee has been actively promoting the organization of lower-level institutions, which is scheduled to be completed around June 15th. It has also established professional committees for various material supreme control departments. Some have been established, and others are still in preparation. The foundation for the future development of work has also been established, and it will surely be able to conduct healthy activities in the future. The recent work goals of the committee are generally as follows:

(1) Policy on Establishing Associations: The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Food have decided to establish 22 associations, but whether the Business Coordination Committee, after its transfer to the Executive Yuan, will inherit the previously decided policy is currently undecided and under study. However, the result may be to establish some important associations first.

(2) Guidance and Compilation of Professional Committees: Professional committees have been decided to establish the Flour and Wheat Committee, the Sugar Industry Committee, the Cotton Industry Committee, and the Oil and Grain Committee. The first two have already been established, and the latter two will also be established soon. It is also heard that the Board of Directors and Supervisors also have this intention, believing that, when necessary, in addition to the above-mentioned professional committees, some other professional committees may also be established, but the details have not yet been fully decided. Professional committees should be guided and supervised by the Board of Directors. Their members are also appointed and dismissed by the Board of Directors and Supervisors. For example, the chairman of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee is also planned to be held by Jiang Shangda, a director of the Business Coordination Committee, which shows that there is no separation between the Board of Directors and Supervisors and the Professional Committees.

(3) Election of Directors and Supervisors: Since the Business Coordination Committee is an autonomous organization, its directors and supervisors are naturally elected by the people. However, the election should first expand and establish the trade associations and their alliances as autonomous organizations and then select representatives from the lower-level institutions to decide. Now that the lower-level institutions have not yet been fully established, there is no way to elect directors and supervisors.

Some people believe that the figures on the Board of Directors and Supervisors are only representatives of the Shanghai financial community and lack a national character. However, the leaders of the Shanghai financial community are also the controllers of the local financial community. Therefore, it is possible to integrate the characteristics of Shanghai representatives and the characteristics of local representatives. This point is not a major problem.

(4) Establishment of Planning and Research Institutions: In order to comprehensively develop the work of the Business Coordination Committee, some people within the committee also advocate establishing a comprehensive planning and research institution directly under the Business Coordination Committee. Although this opinion is quite strong, it has not yet been fully concretized. It is believed that with the progress of the military organization work, an authoritative institution will be established to expand the work goals of solely seeking the interests of the Chinese and Japanese business communities and further take on the important task of planning and controlling the economy.

### Interbank Exchange Balance Transfer in Cash Taken Over by Central Reserve Bank Yesterday; Head Office Overdrafts Still Handled by Silver Union Preparatory Committee

The Central Reserve Bank yesterday took over the interbank exchange balance transfer matters of the note exchange of the Commerce Bank Industry United Preparatory Committee. Cash overdrafts of the committee will be handled by the Central Reserve Bank. Head office overdrafts will continue to be handled, but this is already a tight squeeze. It has been learned that the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has discussed the transfer of cash interbank exchange balances with the Bank Industry United Preparatory Committee and the Bankers Association, and opinions have long been agreed. Therefore, it was decided to implement it starting on June 1st. It is reported that various banks previously had considerable deposits with the Silver Union Preparatory Committee. Now all the cash deposit portions have been deposited with the Central Reserve Bank, and the head office deposits are still deposited with the Silver Union Preparatory Committee. Therefore, it is appropriate for the Central Reserve Bank to take over the transfer of the cash note exchange balance portion of the interbank exchange. As for the transfer of the remittance balance portion, due to technical reasons, it will probably still be handled by the Silver Union Preparatory Committee. The relevant parties are actively studying the above specific measures.

### 51 Trade Associations to Be Completed by Early This Month

The sponsors of major commodity trade associations designated by the Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau number 49. Among them, 32 trade associations that have been established in compliance with the deadline. The remaining trade associations are actively preparing for organization. Yesterday (1st), the Economic Bureau designated the sponsors of the last two trade associations: (1) Fabric Factory Trade Association Sponsors: Pan Xuyi, Xu Yangnan, Bao Gengsheng, Shi Shaojun, Sun Xilin, Que Pingqin, Tang Daozhang, Wen Changfa, Convener Pan Xusheng. (2) Machine Factory Trade Association Sponsors: Zheng Liangbin, Ya Fang, Chuan Shouying, Yang Shouyu, Shi Naixiu, Wang Wengao, Convener Zheng Liangbin. According to the reporter's inquiry to the responsible department of the Economic Bureau, the bureau has ordered that the 19 major commodity trade associations whose sponsors have been designated but have not yet completed organization must all be organized and established by the 10th of this month.

### Bankers Association to Discuss Underwriting Food Warehouse Vouchers

In order to meet the needs of the financial community, the Central Reserve Bank has specially promoted the transfer of the type A grain vouchers it has underwritten to banks, money houses, trust companies, and private individuals. A few days ago, Qian Daqian, deputy governor of the Central Reserve Bank, convened responsible persons from the Shanghai silver and money industries to explain the significance of this transfer and underwriting of type A grain vouchers. As a result, all the silver and money houses expressed their approval. As for the allocation of the amount of grain vouchers that each silver and money house will underwrite, it is heard that the Bankers Association will convene a standing committee meeting on Wednesday, the 3rd of this week, to discuss and decide.

### Central Savings Society Establishes Branches in Wuxi and Other Places

Since the Central Savings Society was relieved of military management on February 15th of this year and the National Government's Ministry of Finance entrusted the Central Reserve Bank to raise funds, inherit the management, and continue operations, its business has increased significantly compared to before. Now, in order to encourage people from all over the country to save, the society has decided to restore the business of its branches in various places before the incident and formally establish branches in Wuxi, Suzhou, Changshu, Yangzhou, Jiaxing, Taixian, Jiaohu, Bengbu, Wujiang, and nine other places. The branches and agencies in various places that are currently actively preparing include Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Kunshan, Changzhou, Jiading, Taicang, Hankou, Jiujiang, Anqing, Dangtu, Jiangyin, Hangzhou, Xiashi, Tongxiang, Jiashan, Songjiang, Huzhou, Pinghu, Ningbo, Rufou, Jiancheng, Funing, Liuhe, Pudong, and twenty-eight other places, which will be ready in the shortest possible time and announce their opening.

### Shanghai West Chamber of Commerce Office Actively Promotes Industrial and Commercial Surveys

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce West Shanghai Office has largely completed the industrial and commercial survey work in the area. It is learned that the office is now actively conducting industrial and commercial surveys in the Xujiahui and Zhoujiaqiao districts and is currently preparing to establish (1) a business group, (2) a factory group, and (3) a financial group to engage in liaison with various industries, thereby promoting business. Once approved by the General Chamber of Commerce, it will be established.

### Regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Materials Control Bureau: Methods for Transporting Yarn and Cloth to Outside the Concession; Must Be Stamped by the West Shanghai District Office

The transport of cotton yarn and cloth in this city must go to the yarn and cloth section of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Materials Control Bureau to obtain a transport permit before transport is allowed. However, this transport permit is only limited to the Public Concession and the French Concession and is not valid outside the two concession areas, making it difficult for textile factories opened in West Shanghai and other places outside the concession to transport the yarn and cloth stored in the concession area to outside the concession. It was learned yesterday that the bureau has already stipulated that all yarn and cloth goods, such as applications for moving out of the concession or into the concession from outside the concession, must be stamped by the West Shanghai District Office before they can be used. The address of the West Shanghai District Office is at the intersection of Avenue Haig and Avenue du Colonel Fieschi.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds: This morning, the unofficial market for unified government bonds was slightly firmer, and market fluctuations were also minor. Type A, Type B, Type C, Type D, and Type E were all flat, and transactions were light.

Gold and Silver: This morning, the price of gold jewelry at various gold shops in the city was still exchanged at the limited price. The price of internal and external transactions rose slightly, but fell back at noon, rising tens of yuan compared to yesterday. Transactions were not strong. The transaction price of decorated silver was slightly higher at the border.

Yarn and Cloth: Cotton yarn was flat and weak due to tight money, with some people wanting to sell, but buyers had no interest. The cotton cloth market continued the previous day's rise, showing a rising trend. The trend was still firm after the initial opening, but the market sentiment became slightly tired due to more selling. As a result, it closed slightly higher. Longtou silk was fine and the trend was quite good. Sijunzi serge and White Cat calico both rose slightly.

### Trends in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were firm first and then weak, ultimately showing little change from the previous day. This was because the fifth lunar month had just passed, the approaching Dragon Boat Festival, and the tightness of money, making it difficult for investors to muster strength. The mood of all parties was confused. Nanyang Tobacco Company continued to advance rapidly under the search of buyers, continuing the rising momentum of the past two days. Great China Matches fell by a little over one yuan. The transaction volume of New Pharmaceuticals was the highest among all stocks. Sino-French Pharmacy fell slightly. New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory was stable. Sin Yee was firm. In the department store industry, Sincere still stood at the border, Wing On was slightly lower, and Chinese Goods fell by nearly one yuan. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile rose slightly, Meiya Silk Factory fell slightly, Innerwear returned slightly, and Jingfu Shirts and Socks continued to rise steadily in the buying trend. Small-cap textile stocks such as Zhenzhong Weaving and Dyeing, Great Light, Xinfeng, and Xinfu were all firm. The market price of the public utilities industry was weak. The market price of Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Merchants Gas was declining steadily. In the cultural industry, China Bookstore broke into the border. Buyers of Commercial Press rose and became active again, with a good momentum. Tongyi Trust's supply and demand were evenly matched. Jiuan Industrial and Xinyi Real Estate fell. Zhongxing Wood Industry had people searching for it. All other stocks were flat.

### Dynamics of Various Trade Unions

Silk Industry

The Silk Industry Trade Union Federation was established on the 31st of last month, passing the charter and stipulating that all trade unions belonging to the cocoon industry, silk factory industry, silk shop industry, silk weaving factory industry, and silk and satin shop industry should join the federation as members. Qi Naqi from the Business Coordination Committee delivered a speech at the meeting that day. Cai Shengbai, Shen Huachen, Xu Xingbin, Jiang Chengbo, Tong Xinbo, Niu Zhizi, Qian Fenghao, Huang Jiwen, Cao Minglie, Zhang Zhongxian, Zheng Xinquan, Wang Huanan, Xu Niansheng, Wang Wuquan, and Wang Outing were elected as directors, and Shen Lianfang, Cao Shao臣, Hua Shaochun, Zhang Runshan, Wang Mingjiu, Tao Shunan, and Cai Liangyou were elected as supervisors. The Board of Directors held a meeting that day and elected Cai Shengbai as the chairman, and Shen Huachen, Xu Xingbin, Jiang Chengbo, Niu Zhizi, and Tong Xinbo as managing directors.

Seasoning Industry

The Shanghai Seasoning Industry Trade Union has completed its preparations and is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the YMCA on Minitini Road at 3 PM on June 4th to discuss and approve the charter and elect the first Board of Directors and Supervisors.

### Last Tenderness

— Lin Ying

Calling out: Three years of separation, I never thought you would change to such an extent. A passionate and lively young man, fallen into such a pessimistic, passive, gloomy, and depressed state, and finally succumbing to the demon of illness. Feverish flushes, coughing up blood, tossing and turning in bed, abandoning all hope. Alas! The grind of life, the oppression of economics, is so cruel!

I have not yet seen you once, but I can imagine your pale face and thin body. From your handwriting, from your words, I have already depicted your recent image. The photo from the academic ceremony is still hanging on the wall. You are standing in the center, with those full cheeks and bright eyes, which can't help but make me feel sad and hurt again.

I don't have the courage to encourage you, and I don't want to comfort you with false words. I also have no power to help you. You may blame me, hate me, why a close friend is so indifferent. Yes, this is my sin. Passionate friendship can no longer warm your cold heart. I sympathize with you, infinitely sympathize, but what good is it to you? You are a victim. A victim of this unreasonable social organization, this unsuitable education system. I curse, I want to overthrow, I plan to transform, but... That's why I say I don't have the courage to encourage you, I don't want to comfort you with false words, and I have no power to help you.

You use alcohol to stimulate your nerves, and you want to jump into the river to end your miserable life. You have gone to the end, and perhaps there is no way to save you. On Sunday, I will definitely come to see you. When I see your face, I will cry bitterly to you. I had the most hope for you, but the most hopeful person is now gone. How can it not be heartbreaking? However, even in despair, I still hold hope, hoping that many young people who are following in your footsteps and are walking on your path can be saved. Alas! You have sacrificed, I will heartlessly say one sentence, you will soon leave this world. At that time, I will lay your body across the entrance of the road you are walking, as a warning monument. On the one hand, let those who are still approaching take a deep awakening; on the other hand, let those who lead the way deeply realize that there is a need to change direction. In this way, you should be willing, right! Goodbye. Ji Shang.

### Getting Vaccinated

— Bai Li

The weather is getting hotter, and vaccinations have already begun. Generally, those who consider themselves "upper class" seem to find it very troublesome. They think this is applied to the "lower class," and it is a superfluous matter for the "upper class." However, the authorities stipulate that they must search every household, and if there is no vaccination certificate, they will be forced to get vaccinated and will not be allowed to pass on the road. Therefore, they "plan ahead" and try to get "one." They think that only in this way are they worthy of being called the "upper class" and worthy of "face." In fact, this is exactly showing their lack of common sense.

It must be known that getting vaccinated is not a matter of "showing off," but is related to public health. It is a task within the scope of public health. Although, on the surface, whether you get vaccinated or not has nothing to do with others, in fact, if you avoid it and I avoid it, then the "epidemic" will definitely not be "prevented," and the result will be an outbreak, and the harm will not only be to individuals. Last summer's terrible outbreak of plague must still be fresh in our memories! Therefore, I hope that the above-mentioned clever methods of evasion will not happen again in the future. Getting vaccinated is the real "planning ahead"! I hope everyone will go and get vaccinated as soon as possible, especially hoping that the principals, teachers, factories, and store managers of schools, senior combatants, and the heads of each household will take the lead in getting vaccinated as an example for students, employees, and children.

### Anecdotes of the Japanese Navy (7)

— Oshita Udaer

(IX) The Joy of Rest

People in the modern world often complain about unbearable busyness and overwhelming lack of time, but in naval schools or on warships, no one is heard saying such things.

However, this busyness is even more intense during combat, but there are exceptions. During this combat, there are two types of people who, due to having no opportunity to be heroic, obtain free time and retire. They retire from the bridge to the officers' room, completely different from other crew members who are doing their duties as if crazy.

One is the chief medical officer.

The sound of naval guns booms, raising water columns more than ten feet high. A fierce battle is in progress. At this time, the chief medical officer retires due to being free, which indicates that there are very few injured comrades. So this retirement is actually very welcome.

The second is the artillery officer of the aircraft carrier.

The aircraft carrier launches aircraft from its deck to attack the enemy at a great distance. From its performance point of view, if the aircraft carrier's actions are appropriate and effective, then the artillery officer is useless. If it directly fires on enemy ships or is attacked by enemy aircraft, then the artillery officer will be extremely busy. However, this is not a good phenomenon. Usually, the artillery officer is very idle, stroking the gun barrel, waiting for friendly aircraft to return successfully.

In addition to the chief medical officer and the artillery officer of the aircraft carrier, it is also good if the aircraft maintenance personnel, etc., have free time during combat. Before the aircraft departs, the maintenance personnel adjust the engine. It is rare not to be busy with repairs. The maintenance personnel are different from the chief medical officer. Even if there are no repairs, there are still various tasks. If there is no damage or breakage due to being hit by enemy bullets, thus requiring no repairs, isn't this obviously a welcome phenomenon?

(X) The Habit of Darkness

During blackout exercises for air defense training, clothing is finished in the dark. It is very difficult to monitor the weather within the jurisdiction. I wrote a letter to a certain second-class maintenance petty officer I knew, saying in the letter:

"But it will eventually become a habit. After getting used to it, even in the dark, you can do quite a lot of things. So I often have to do that."

Details are unknown, but it probably happened at a certain air base. Not limited to naval aircraft, but also army aircraft! The aircraft returning from attacking the enemy are considerably damaged in order to "break through the barrage like a rainstorm." Therefore, they must be repaired day and night, but the enemy also targets the base for bombing, so night must be very careful. In complete blackouts, maintenance personnel often grope in the dark, engaged in repairs, not neglecting or omitting a single screw or nail. Thinking that these aircraft are used to attack the enemy, even in that darkness, they concentrate and complete the perfect repair immediately. (Note: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)

### Going to War (5)

— Written by Navy Reporter Hamaoto Hiroshi

9.  Seven-Boat Tactics

The captain leaned on the railing of the flag deck connecting to the bridge and continued to speak.

"Speaking of the examples of the Solomon Sea battle. You may know that surprise attacks are simply our navy's forte. At that time, the seven boats hidden to stab the enemy's throat were the torpedo units. Braving the hail of bullets, passing through the angry waves and turbulent seas, charging towards the enemy's main force, giving the enemy a fatal blow, were our torpedo units. But our boats never thought of defense. Therefore, the suicidal tactics must be carried out with the belief that one shot will definitely hit. This is the spirit of the Japanese traditional chivalrous person."

In this respect, the captain, the torpedo unit, and Shimizu Ketsuya linked together.

"Since I was a child, I have liked the life of a chivalrous person. The so-called spirit of a chivalrous person is by no means the frivolous thing that the world spreads. It must be a life of self-restraint and thorough selflessness. We also apply this spirit in our tactics. Selfless tactics--do you understand?"

"This is really hard to understand."

"When it gets dark, you will know, because we will definitely encounter the enemy." The captain made an appointment with him like this.

"But I learned one more thing from senior Shimizu." The captain continued to say,

"Senior Shimizu once said that if one's own sword is pierced by the enemy, one should take a short sword and stab forward. Do you know? If one's own firing range is very short, then one must charge forward to shoot. But when charging forward, do not show one's own weakness. While oppressing the enemy, charge forward. For this, you need faith and skill. Fortunately, my crew members have all had sufficient training. To apply this, you need the spirit of the commander. Do you understand?"

This is what everyone would think is right. However, whether it can be used in a real battle is what Edokoro felt uneasy about in his heart.

"You will know tomorrow. If you have made up your mind, everything will be no problem." The captain said "tomorrow" again.

That "tomorrow's" sky had not a single cloud since morning, only the northwest monsoon was whistling.

Since departing from the base port, the "Kurogane" has been constantly guarding against the enemy and escorting two transport ships.

The so-called escort is not a surprise attack with seven boats, nor a naval battle with hulls rubbing against each other. Dragging merchant ships, one must drive away planes and repel submarines while completing the mission. This is a truly dry and impossible operation, and it is also a difficult operation.

The boat continued to advance southward and had entered the enemy's air raid circle in the afternoon.

The artillery officer, who was going into battle for the first time, stood on the lookout platform above the awning. There were two lookouts on the left and right, holding binoculars, guarding in all directions.

The iron plate gradually heated up. The two eyes placed on the binoculars ached like needles.

Around 2:00 PM, a small island with coconut trees was seen on the starboard side. It seemed uninhabited.

Around 2:30 PM, the lookout on the bridge confirmed that it was a distant shadow of an enemy aircraft and immediately notified the lookout on the awning.

The lookout on the awning reported through binoculars: "Six B-17 aircraft are flying towards our boat in formation."

10.  The Battle

The enemy aircraft approached in the blink of an eye and lowered their altitude, separating into three groups on the left and right. A signalman ran onto the awning and used signal flags to order the merchant ships following behind to prepare to meet the enemy. The boat immediately went at full speed, and while tilting, rushed around the merchant ships. The waves and spray passing over the sides rose all the way to the awning.

The enemy aircraft lowered themselves over the fleet and dropped bombs.

"The three planes on the left have dropped bombs." Someone shouted loudly from the bridge. Black pillars of water suddenly rose between the merchant ships, and then fell down in piles.

The other three aircraft suddenly lowered and approached the boat's sky. The captain frequently ordered to turn the rudder, but did not issue an order to fire.

The shadow of the enemy aircraft suddenly passed over the sky with a roar, and the captain ordered to turn the rudder to chase the aircraft.

Edokoro was a little confused. So he asked through the voice tube: "Captain, should we fire?"

Suddenly, the window of the sky opened, and the captain's face was revealed.

"Wait a minute," the captain said with a smile.

Edokoro followed the shadow of the enemy aircraft and walked behind. Suddenly, there was someone standing at the entrance of the engine room. He had spiral leggings wrapped from knee to ankle, a steel helmet on his head, and aimed his rifle at the sky. This was the vice-chief engineer, Komasei.

"Fool!"

The captain laughed loudly into the voice tube towards the upper deck. Komasei looked up at the bridge and didn't hear what was said.

Due to Komasei's strange behavior, the atmosphere on the bridge suddenly wavered, and immediately returned to the original tension.

Three enemy aircraft flew down towards the head of the boat. It wasn't that the enemy aircraft flew over, but that the boat was heading towards the enemy aircraft.

"Fire!"

This was the captain's voice. Edokoro then ordered: "Start firing!"

The turrets immediately spat out all at once. Machine guns also continued to fire incessantly. The entire boat shook violently due to the reaction.

One enemy aircraft suddenly spewed white smoke near the side, and soon turned into a large flame. The fire quickly expanded and became a fireball, but it fell to the sea surface unexpectedly slowly.

At that time, the boat was already 500 meters away from the crash site. The dazzling flames trembled on the sea surface, gradually turning into black smoke, which was torn into thin lines by the wind.

In the sky, two parachutes swayed. Those must have been the enemy pilots who escaped from the aircraft.

"Artillery officer! Look! That guy is hanging down."

Looking in the direction pointed by the lookout, one of the two aircraft that had flown past in the opposite direction of the boat had black smoke hanging on its tail and was slowly descending. Soon it touched the sea surface.

A signalman ran up, beckoning to the merchant ships that had already left far away.

"Captain! Let's recover the guys who parachuted down!"

Edokoro asked the captain this way. The captain showed his face again from the skylight, and said vigorously: "We have to hurry. Don't deal with these idiots, let the sand sharks entertain them!" Answering as if reciting lines. On the bridge, the voices of the officers became lively.

Edokoro also became excited, and imitated the captain's tone and said, "Let the sand sharks entertain them!"

The "Kurogane" sailed ahead, followed closely by two merchant ships. As if nothing had happened, they continued to head south. (Translated by Tao from Asahi Shimbun. The End)

### Senior Welfare Forum (2)

(2) Mr. Ding Fubao expressed his opinions on the nutritional health of the elderly: Everyone hopes to live a long life. To achieve this goal is not difficult. The most important thing is to change the common misconceptions. Some people think that opening windows will cause colds and coughs; that eating meat and fish can make the body strong. In fact, these are very wrong. Opening windows can freshen the indoor air. After forming a habit, not only will you not catch a cold or cough, but your body will become stronger. Eating meat, such as beef, mutton, pork, crabs, and shrimp, can sometimes cause poisoning or raise blood pressure and harden blood vessels, which can shorten life. We often see some old people in the countryside who don't eat much fish or meat on weekdays, yet they enjoy long lives. This shows that a vegetarian diet is indeed beneficial. German leader Hitler and Indian saint Gandhi both advocated vegetarianism. Vegetables should not be cooked too thoroughly, as the vitamins will disappear. One should not eat too much, as eating too much is not only useless but harmful. The three meals a day may as well be changed to two meals. Fruits are of great value in terms of dietary hygiene, but apples and bananas are very expensive, so carrots and tomatoes can be used as substitutes, but they must be eaten raw. People with good teeth can chew them, and those with bad teeth can juice them and drink them. To live a long life, in addition to reforming the diet, a kind of meditation method is also very effective. Meditation can concentrate the mind on one point, which is what is said in our ancient books as "concentrating the spirit on the mysterious aperture." The effect is to double the mental energy for work and prolong life. Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang and I have both had long-term experience with meditation, and we deeply feel that meditation can indeed help a person's health and longevity. We dare to introduce it to people from all walks of life.

(3) Mr. Xu Zhuodai spoke in a humorous tone. Speaking of the "Elderly Sutra," I am sixty years old this year, but I don't know I'm old, and I don't admit I'm old. Most of my friends are young people, and only a few are old people. I feel like I am still young and do not know that old age is coming. Eight years ago, by chance, I bought a book called "Disease-Free Living After Forty," written by a Japanese medical doctor. After reading this book, I deeply felt that it is not easy to be an old person, and one must have common sense. For the past eight years, I have done what is mentioned in the book that I could do. This book is currently being translated, and the future title will be "Elderly Sutra."

The first section of this book says, why do people age? It mainly says that human aging is entirely due to the process of metabolism. The second section says that the so-called immortality and rejuvenation in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, are all fantasies of powerful emperors. In fact, they are all unattainable. The third section says that according to the latest scientific theories, with the help of endocrine glands (hormones), it is possible to maintain a certain degree of youth. The fourth section says that people over forty should pay attention to points such as (1) taking a nap after lunch every day to conserve energy, even five minutes is good, it is of great benefit to the body. (2) Often make friends with young men and women. (3) When you see white hair on your head, this is a natural physiological phenomenon, which is irrelevant and does not need to be worried about. (4) Pay attention to maintaining normal blood pressure and blood vessels, and do not allow blood pressure to rise or blood vessels to harden. (5) Food and drink must be kept normal and not excessive. In addition, there are also things about sexual life and so on.
