### How the French Concession Police Should Handle the Zhang Case

Yesterday, in our short commentary (supplemented today on page three), from the perspectives of "law" and "humanity," we pointed out the responsibility of the French Concession Police in the Zhang case. Feeling that we had not fully expressed our views, we further clarify our opinions as follows:

Before discussing the Zhang case, let us first state our position and attitude. First, when judging matters, we must recognize the fundamentals and secondary aspects and make rational and objective judgments. Once this judgment is made, we must emphasize firmness and not be swayed or coerced into changing it. We believe that the responsible parties in the Zhang case are a few of the French and Chinese detectives within the French Concession Police who caused the incident. It is neither the responsibility of the entire French Concession Police nor even the French Concession authorities. If the French Concession authorities do not severely punish the perpetrators according to the law but intentionally protect subordinates who have broken the law, then this responsibility will shift from the perpetrators to the French Concession Police. Therefore, we recognize this key point and await the measures taken by the French Concession Police. Second, the core of the Zhang case is entirely a legal issue and should be resolved reasonably based on the law. It is absolutely not a diplomatic issue involving Sino-French friendship. Similarly, the French Concession and the French Concession Police authorities should also recognize this. They must understand that the public's anger is not directed at the concession and the police authorities but rather at the abuse of punishment by the perpetrators in the Zhang case.

What we deeply regret about the Zhang case is the abuse of authority by the perpetrators. The arrogance and contempt for Chinese people shown by the French detective who caused the incident is the root cause of the incident. Although he cannot represent the attitude of all French officers in the French Concession Police, generally speaking, most of them have this prejudice. Therefore, we solemnly tell our French friends that despising Chinese people is the same as despising the French themselves. Cruel and inhumane methods of punishment are no longer used by modern civilized nations. We cannot stand idly by when Chinese people have been crippled or killed by torture in the past. We further hope that the French Concession Police will thoroughly reform their methods of punishment in the future so that the Zhang case and thousands of unnamed Zhang cases will not be repeated in the future.

Unfortunately, among the perpetrators who contributed to the Zhang case, there were also some ignorant and uneducated Chinese people. These accomplices who abuse their power are even more despised by the nation. We hope that Chinese people serving in the French Concession Police will remember: do not exceed the scope of your authority, and in the future, serve the citizens faithfully.

Regarding the aftermath of the Zhang case, it should be resolved according to the law. In our short commentary yesterday, we already gave our sincere advice to the French Concession Police authorities, so we will not repeat it.

Perhaps some people will ask, why did this Zhang case cause such serious public outrage? This question is worth raising. We believe that this outrage stems from the usual disharmony between the French Concession Police and the citizens, especially those who have personally experienced unfair treatment by the police. However, it is merely vented through the Zhang case. We hope that the French Concession Police authorities will take the Zhang case as a turning point, strictly discipline their subordinates, and cooperate harmoniously with the citizens in all matters. Then, it will be very easy to turn the public's negative feelings into positive ones.

Yesterday, we received numerous letters from readers expressing sympathy and condolences to the family of the Zhang case. Furthermore, we have received generous donations of five thousand yuan from the Shanghai Special Municipal Warehouse and Stacking Industry Association and four hundred yuan from outraged citizens for the family of the Zhang case, entrusted to us for forwarding. We express our infinite respect for the readers' purely humanitarian sympathy.

### Further Discussion on the Way to National Prosperity

Our newspaper has previously published two articles on the way to national prosperity, which have been followed by numerous letters from readers for discussion, which is very encouraging. Mr. Yoshida Toyu has kindly written a special article to elaborate on this (see the original article featured in today's newspaper), focusing on establishing a "new morality" based on the characteristics and practical needs of Chinese society, providing insights that others have not seen and expressing ideas that others have not spoken, which is truly admirable. We still need to further discuss this issue.

Gu Tinglin said: "The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every individual." This means that national affairs cannot be left solely to the government authorities but must be jointly shouldered by every patriotic citizen. Because no matter how wise the government authorities may be, their eyes and ears are limited, and their thoughts may not be comprehensive. Therefore, the people must contribute their strength, and the government must value the strength of the people. Only when the government and the people work together to implement good national policies and decrees can the nation turn from danger to safety and from decline to prosperity. Moreover, the facts of Chinese history clearly record that the dynasty or ruler who wins the hearts of the people will inevitably experience prosperity in the nation's fortunes at that time. Therefore, we repeatedly emphasize that the people must be concerned about politics, and at the same time, the government should respect public opinion as a prerequisite for the rise and fall of the nation. This is the first reason.

As for the political movements of the past few decades, historians will have their own conclusions on their merits and demerits, which we do not need to argue. Mr. Yoshida pointed out that the "New Youth Movement" was "only eager to destroy the old morality and did not establish a new morality to replace it," which can be said to be the most insightful observation. We believe that the crises in our country's politics over the past few decades are threefold: first, the vast majority of the people are indifferent to national affairs; second, the high-sounding rhetoric of those who are enthusiastic about politics only consists of negative criticisms and lacks positive suggestions; and third, the authorities are eager for quick success and instant benefits, concealing their faults and embellishing their errors, only liking to hear flattering words and not having the magnanimity to accept criticism. In response to these three major dangers, we advocate arousing the people's concern for politics, and the first step is to establish sound public opinion. The solution is to establish a people's opinion agency, on the one hand, to establish a close and painful relationship between the people and the government, and on the other hand, to guide those who are enthusiastic about politics towards the path of actively saving the country and the people. However, the most important thing is still the government authorities. On the negative side, they must have the magnanimity to adopt public opinion and the demeanor of a great politician who is not afraid of criticism; on the other hand, they must be consistent in their words and deeds, practice the morality of new politics, regard the world as the common good, and demonstrate a fresh start with the people. That is the starting point for the nation to rise from decline to prosperity. This is the second reason.

The seriousness of the current situation need not be repeated; the current opportunity for the nation to revive itself must not be missed. However, we have repeatedly pointed out that the Chinese people have not only never had the opportunity to speak but have also never been allowed to participate in politics. Therefore, the responsibility for the rise and fall of dynasties throughout history rests entirely with the rulers of each dynasty. Today's rulers of China undoubtedly bear the historical responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation. However, the international environment and the evolution of the war do not allow us to be complacent and procrastinate. The future of the "new morality" and the new national movement will determine the future of the nation and the people. Standing in the position of the public opinion circle and in the position of loving the country and loving the government, we believe that the authorities need to conduct in-depth research on the way to national prosperity.

Contents of Prime Minister Tojo's Speech

Manila, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) After Japanese Prime Minister Tojo arrived here on the 5th with his entourage, he attended a conference held by people from all walks of life in Manila on the morning of the 6th to thank Japan for allowing independence and delivered a speech on the spot, explaining Japan's determination to achieve final victory and reiterating Japan's determination to allow the Philippines to become independent, encouraging the Filipino people to value patriotism and strive to build a new Philippines. The Filipino people were deeply moved after listening. It is an unprecedented event in world history for the Prime Minister of a country to visit occupied territories and appeal directly to the people. The main points of Prime Minister Tojo's speech are recorded as follows: "Gentlemen, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to attend this conference of thanks today during the Greater East Asia War and to hear the famous and straightforward words of Chief Executive Vargas. This war is a great campaign for the construction of Greater East Asia by the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia based on true morality. Now, our imperial army and navy have conquered and secured all the important places in Greater East Asia, and they are preparing to thoroughly destroy the enemy, and I am convinced that the empire will defeat Britain and the United States and make them unable to invade East Asia. Today, all the allied nations and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia have united as one, and 1 billion ethnic groups have truly become one, striving for final victory and building a new Greater East Asia. As far as India is concerned, the Indian people are also our comrades, and they will soon unite with us. As for Germany, Italy, and other allied countries in Europe, they are also moving forward with the common goal of building a new world order, and they are closely cooperating with us, preparing to launch a large-scale offensive in the near future. Gentlemen, the United States has been wearing a mask of justice for many years, engaging in meticulous aggression against the Philippines, causing the Philippines to suffer. I am deeply indignant about this. Gentlemen, the time has truly come for the Filipino people to rise up. You should thoroughly eliminate the erroneous Americanism and cultivate the tough and enterprising spirit that is the source of national revival, and restore the original face of our Greater East Asian nations. I also hope that you will devote yourselves to the construction of a new Philippines with full patriotic enthusiasm. Our Japanese Empire has already provided great assistance to the construction of the Philippines, and it will continue to do so in the future, so your future is truly limitless and full of light. I have previously stated once again on behalf of the imperial government at the 81st session of the Imperial Diet that "when the Philippines sincerely cooperates with the Empire and achieves practical results, the Empire will make it independent as soon as possible." Coming here this time and witnessing your efforts to build a new Philippines and your enthusiasm for cooperating with the Empire, I am deeply gratified, and my belief that I have previously declared the permission for Philippine independence has become even stronger. I sincerely hope that you will take advantage of the enthusiasm you have shown today and continue to actively assist the Empire in completing the Greater East Asia War, so that the 8 million people of the Philippines can obtain the honor of independence as soon as possible and seek its realization."

Banquet Extends Deep Encouragement

Manila, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo hosted a banquet on the night of the 6th to entertain Philippine Chief Executive Vargas and other dignitaries of the Philippine government, and delivered a speech on the spot as follows: Although my visit here this time is very short, I am deeply moved and pay the utmost respect to Chief Executive Vargas and everyone else for your spirit of unanimously cooperating under the guidance of the commander of the military commander to devote all your efforts to implementing the war and building a new Philippines, and to the general public for their tireless work and active progress. I have had frequent and frank discussions with the military and political authorities in recent days, and I have learned that Chief Executive Vargas and everyone else have a firm determination and enthusiastic belief, and I believe that the various policies of the Philippines will improve steadily in the future, and I am truly happy to congratulate everyone. This morning, at the Philippine People's Thanksgiving Conference, I explained that Japan and the allied nations of Greater East Asia and Europe are becoming more and more united, and I have revealed Japan's belief in victory. Japan has now declared that it will destroy the United States and Britain, so that they dare not invade East Asia again. I take this opportunity to tell the Filipino people that the sooner one more Filipino trusts Japan, the sooner the period of the Philippines for the Filipino people can be realized. I hope that Chief Executive Vargas and everyone else who are present today will especially understand and remember this point and cooperate even more, and I have deep hopes for this.

Manila, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) Philippine Chief Executive Vargas delivered a reply at the banquet of Prime Minister Tojo tonight, saying that he was deeply grateful for the honor given to the Filipino people by Prime Minister Tojo's visit to the Philippines. When the flames of war were raging in the Philippines in January of Showa 17 (1942), Prime Minister Tojo had declared in the Japanese Diet that Japan was willing to assist the Philippines in its independence. The Filipino people witnessed this news and their determination to cooperate with Japan with all their strength was strengthened, so that they could complete their centuries-old desire. Prime Minister Tojo's visit to the Philippines has created one of the most glorious pages in Philippine history. Now, 18 million Filipino people have united with the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia to cooperate in building a new order in Greater East Asia, so as to achieve a glorious common goal. The realization of this new order will not only make all Asian nations more prosperous, but also give all mankind infinite light and endless well-being.

Prime Minister's Visit of Great Significance

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) Political figures here have recently commented on the significance of Prime Minister Tojo's visit to the Philippines, saying that Prime Minister Tojo had previously visited China and Manchuria, and this time he visited the Philippines to inspect the actual situation in the Philippines and the sincerity of Philippine officials and people in assisting Japan. At this time, it is when the declaration that our country made at the 79th and 81st sessions of the Diet will be put into practice, so its significance is even more profound. Regarding the matter of Tojo's Diet statement, the Japanese Military Administration Department in the Philippines has proposed three conditions for the implementation of Philippine independence, namely (1) the Filipino people should assist Japan more to restore law and order; (2) the economic structure should be reorganized to establish self-sufficiency; (3) the East Asian spirit should be restored, etc. The Philippines has also been able to unite as one, and they are all assisting Japan with the qualifications of a member of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere? Relying on the Japanese army and eliminating the past erroneous concept of relying on the United States, they have been preparing for independence step by step. The United States had previously set July 4, 1946, as the date for allowing the Philippines to become independent, as a tool for aggression and exploitation, which was actually an empty check, which cannot be compared with Japan's permission for independence. The Filipino people will definitely deeply recognize Japan's sincerity because of the Prime Minister's visit. The US President has not personally visited the Philippines to discuss the possibility of Philippine independence. It can be seen from this whether he is sincere in allowing the Philippines to become independent. The Prime Minister's visit to the Philippines contains the meaning of visiting the entire South, and it also tells the world that Japan is uniting with the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia for the purpose of defending East Asia and seeking world peace, and is marching forward courageously on the road to striving for final victory.

### Minister Aoki Publishes Impressions of Visiting Java

Jakarta, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) The Java Military Administration Department announced on the 6th that Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki flew to Jakarta at 10:30 AM on the 2nd. He immediately visited the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Force at the Military Administration Department, listened to the report on the military administration situation by Military Administrator Okazaki, and inspected the Bogor Botanical Garden, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, and other places. After completing his affairs, he flew to a certain place by plane on the 6th. Surabaya, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki arrived safely in Surabaya at noon on the 4th. In the afternoon, he visited the commander of a certain naval unit and Governor Anoka, and inspected the shipbuilding operations at the Port of Surabaya after its restoration. At 10:00 AM on the 5th, he took a plane to Malang and stayed in Solo on the same day. He left Malang on the morning of the 6th for his destination.

Jakarta, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki talked about his impressions of visiting various parts of Java when he met with a group of reporters here on the 3rd of this month, saying that the first thing he felt after arriving in Java was to witness the full cooperation of the aborigines in the military administration. The most important element in the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is the cooperation and cooperation of ethnic groups, and this point is no longer a problem. I am very pleased with the mutually cooperative system that has been established in Java. As for the construction of Java's industry, it has also been progressing smoothly due to the close cooperation between the military administration and the aborigines. Java Island is an important base in the South in the Greater East Asia War, and I hope that it will continue to make full use of its natural position and economic strength based on its position and mission. As for future industrial construction, I think it should be carried out in accordance with the grand vision of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and actively adapting to the local situation. At present, reducing Java's dependence on Japan is not only necessary for the Japanese industry, but also most necessary in Java, so it is necessary to vigorously revitalize Java's industry as much as possible. The materials needed will be supplied by Japan, and the relocation of Japanese domestic factories to Java is also being studied. I am very impressed that the people of Java are able to endure hardship and work diligently. Consideration should be given to making use of manpower. Finally, I hope that everyone will fully recognize why Japan has the power to destroy the United States and Britain. This is because the Japanese people have tried their best to reduce their consumption and turn to the military, so Japan has confidence in strengthening its basic industries and national defense. Java Island has begun to implement a formal economy since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and its purpose is also to concentrate all its efforts on strengthening its combat capabilities. I hope that everyone will be able to devote all their efforts to strengthening their combat capabilities in addition to living within the minimum necessary life, so as to complete the Greater East Asia War and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

### Newly Appointed Ambassador to Japan, Cai Pei, Speaks Before Departure

Nanjing, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: Our newly appointed Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Cai Pei, is scheduled to depart from Pukou by train at 4:00 PM on the 7th to take up his new post in Japan. As he is about to leave the country, Mr. Cai has issued the following statement: "I am deeply honored and inspired to be appointed as the Ambassador to Japan. In the future, I will devote my utmost efforts to my duties, hoping to further strengthen the friendly relations between China and Japan, in order to fulfill the ardent expectations of the elders in my motherland. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage. Especially after China's participation in the war, Japan immediately declared the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the return of concession territories under exclusive control, the recognition of the recovery of public concessions, and the transfer of material control, etc., and has gradually implemented them, which is of great help to China's independence and autonomy. All other new policies towards China are based on equality and mutual benefit, and are intended for the future of both China and Japan, which is gratifying. Therefore, after I take office, I will fully express my determination to participate in the war and my enthusiasm for the construction of a new East Asia, so that Sino-Japanese relations will become closer. As I am about to leave the country, I have much to say. The people expect me to further strengthen the friendly relations between China and Japan after I arrive in Japan. I also expect the people to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War and make further progress, so as to help complete the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as soon as possible."

He is scheduled to return to his post by train on the 7th.

### Japanese Army Seizes Large Quantities of Military Supplies and Provisions in "Chongqing Third Military District"

Tokyo, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from a certain place along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, when the Japanese army fiercely attacked Chongqing (Third Military District), in addition to making every effort to search for hidden Chongqing soldiers, they also intercepted a large number of military supplies, provisions, etc. hidden by the Chongqing army. Before the operation, the Chongqing army had already accumulated a large amount of provisions. In addition, the Chongqing army's base areas in the western Hebei region, the vanguard strongholds of the Fourth Military District, and the Third Military District all had a large number of ordnance factories, landmine manufacturing factories, and ammunition depots. Through this operation by the Japanese army, the facilities for storing provisions and ordnance have been completely destroyed. On the 1st alone, the number of ordnance factories destroyed by the Japanese army reached more than eighteen. The total amount of rice intercepted by the Japanese army near Beidabei reached tens of thousands of kilograms. From this, it can be seen how harsh the Chongqing Third Military District was in the past three years. In addition, a large amount of hidden steel, oil, paper, etc. were discovered in various places, all of which were intercepted by the Japanese army. After losing this large amount of provisions and military supplies, it is inevitable that the Chongqing army will not be able to re-establish (the Third Military District).

War Results of the Japanese Army in the Taihang Mountains: Nanjing, 6th Central News Agency Lei: Since the Japanese army launched the Taihang Mountain operation on April 20th, it has continued its attacks. Since the beginning of the operation until May 3rd, the war results that have been verified are as follows: (including those already announced) 5,757 corpses of the Chongqing army, 9,683 prisoners, 4,871 rifles seized by the Japanese army, 294 light machine guns, 40 heavy machine guns, 16 mortars, and 66 mountain guns.

It is reported that the committee held its first meeting of all members yesterday, chaired by Director Chen Qun. Many important cases were decided.

### Lu Shiliang, a Bandit and Communist in Rugao, Surrenders

Nantong, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: Since the launch of the Clear Countryside campaign, there has been great turmoil within the bandits and communists, and their lower-level cadres have all felt that resistance is not a good plan, and many have shown a tendency towards peace. It is necessary to know that Lu Shiliang, the pseudo-director of the Matang Southwest Township established by the bandits and communists in Rugao, led his troops to surrender to our army and has already begun to assist in clearing the countryside.

### Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Continues to Receive Envoys from Various Countries

Tokyo, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu received the envoys from Sweden, Spain, Denmark, Afghanistan, and Switzerland stationed in Japan on the 6th, and will continue to receive the envoys from Portugal, Hungary, and Bulgaria tomorrow. On the 7th, he will receive the chargés d'affaires from various countries, including the Republic of China, Turkey, Argentina, and Romania.

Tokyo, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu has successively received ambassadors from six countries and envoys from nine countries stationed in Japan since the 4th of this month. It is rare for the Japanese Foreign Minister to receive envoys from various countries separately and hold long talks, so it has attracted much attention from all parties. According to opinions from diplomatic circles here, it is believed that Foreign Minister Shigemitsu intends to first establish close ties with the envoys of various countries stationed in Japan in order to create a more friendly atmosphere. Therefore, this is actually a solid foundation for Shigemitsu's diplomacy. When Foreign Minister Shigemitsu first took office, he first clarified his diplomatic policy, saying that the national general power policy can be reflected in the diplomatic aspect, and naturally determine its outline. Therefore, the fundamental policy of imperial diplomacy should be developed with the goal of completing the construction of Greater East Asia and the new world order of the Axis powers. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu particularly values the consistency of diplomatic policy, so he also pays special attention to avoiding giving the impression of non-consistency in diplomacy on the surface. At a time when Japan has established an absolute advantage over its enemies in all aspects, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu is also meeting with envoys from various countries with a calm attitude, re-examining the actual relationship between Japan and various countries. The Japanese people are also unanimously supporting their government's diplomatic policy. All these facts are unprecedented, so Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's prudent approach is also a diplomatic war in the forceful promotion of the total war, in order to prepare for a state of calmness to seize opportunities.

### Britain and the United States Sign a Naval Agreement in Ottawa

Berlin, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: A naval correspondent for the Overseas News Agency declares: The naval agreement recently signed by Britain and the United States in Ottawa, Canada, has the characteristics of a secret treaty, but some very noteworthy points are already known to the public, which has a significant indication of the relationship between the two countries. The most important clause of this agreement undoubtedly places the responsibility of maintaining the supply route across the Atlantic Ocean on Britain and Canada. First, because all the important supplies needed by the British motherland are transported along this route; second, because the sea area it passes through is the most dangerous area in the world; therefore, the meaning of this agreement clause is equivalent to stipulating that Britain must protect one-third of its own merchant ships. If we consider the number of merchant ships sunk by German submarines, it can be predicted that by the end of 1943, the number of ships sunk by the anti-Axis powers this year will probably be no less than six million tons, of which the United States will only account for a small part. It is undeniable that the number of merchant ships that British and Canadian shipyards can build during this period will not exceed 600,000 tons. The continuous reduction of British ship tonnage has rapidly lost its position as a world-powerful commercial nation. At this point, we may inevitably raise a question, since American merchant ships have not suffered major blows, why not take on the responsibility of transporting and protecting these goods in addition to supplying food and ammunition. According to common sense, a fair partnership method must be that the stronger bears the most difficult work, and the weaker bears the minor responsibility. However, the motive for the United States' conclusion of the Ottawa Agreement with Britain this time is not for this reason, because according to the provisions of this agreement, what the United States undertakes is the non-dangerous South Pacific routes. This agreement also confirms the concerns that Britain has long felt are not without reason, that is, the United States will tend to sacrifice British commercial interests for its own economic desires.

### Chilean Merchant Ships Ceded to Britain and the United States

Aijing, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: Stefani News Agency reports that the Axis submarine war has been surprisingly active recently, and British and American merchant ships have suffered huge losses. The newly built ships are far from enough to meet the needs. Therefore, Washington and London are pressuring South American countries to cede all their transport ships. For example, Chile has been forced to cede its three best merchant ships, and Britain will also take over a huge Chilean floating dock and send it to Australia for use. However, Chilean representative Smithton dared to protest and has requested President Rios to suspend such sales that are detrimental to Chile's general economy.

### Leaders of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union Reportedly to Hold a Meeting; Roosevelt Sends Special Envoy to Moscow

Argentine Capital, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: The local "Nation Daily" predicted yesterday that President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, and Stalin will hold consultations, and said that the location of the meeting will be decided entirely by Stalin alone. Semi-official sources in Washington believe that President Roosevelt wants to discuss military issues with Stalin as the main focus.

Stockholm, Sweden, 6th Central News Agency dispatch, according to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, it is reported that President Roosevelt's special envoy, Davis, departed from the United States on the 5th and flew to Moscow. Apart from a summit meeting between the leaders of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, there is no other way for the anti-Axis countries to resolve the Soviet-Polish dispute.

Lisbon, 6th Central News Agency dispatch from London, according to a news article, the successor to the Governor-General of India, Linlithgow, is scheduled to be a member of the British wartime cabinet, and the British cabinet will implement a partial reorganization within the month.

### Axis Forces in Tunisia Determined to Defend Coastal Fortresses; British and American Forces Advance in a Fan Shape Along Three Routes; Taibuba Will Become the Center of Future Battles

Berlin, 6th Central News Agency dispatch. A military correspondent for the Overseas News Agency says that on Tuesday, only local battles took place on the northwestern front of Tunisia. After capturing Matil, the anti-Axis forces sent reconnaissance teams to explore and advance towards the new positions of the German and Italian forces. The future intentions of the anti-Axis forces are still difficult to understand. The French colonial forces now located in the isthmus between the Mediterranean Sea and the northwest coast of Lake Akel have been reinforced by American forces. However, it is still questionable whether this fact alone can judge whether the British and American sides are determined to take concentrated action along the coast to capture Bize. In the more southern region, the vanguard of the American Second Army advanced in a fan shape along three routes from Matil: the first route advanced northeast, attacking the ferry village between Lake Akel and Bize; the second route advanced east, aiming at Jebel Kegibota, because both highways from Tunis to Bize are under its control; the third route advanced southeast, targeting Taibuba. It is still difficult to judge where the anti-Axis command will concentrate its main offensive. If its purpose is to split the German and Italian front into two, it will have to capture Jebel Kegibota, because it is not only a strong defensive position, but also its location is within the range of the outer fortress line of the Bize battery. The anti-Axis forces will naturally need considerable force to attack the area. The American army has indeed obtained considerable reinforcements from General Anderson, but it is still questionable whether the British and American forces concentrated in the Matil area have sufficient strength for a three-pronged attack. As mentioned above, it is difficult to predict how the decision of the American Supreme Commander will be, but judging from the situation, it seems more convenient to choose the route to attack Taibuba, because there is a possibility of cooperating with the central route of the British First Army. On Tuesday, the British First Army repeatedly launched fierce attacks on the German positions northeast of Mejez el-Bab, and some places were once attacked, but were repelled after a German counterattack. The pressure exerted by the anti-Axis forces in the area suggests that the war may continue to intensify. It is also possible that the area around Taibuba will occupy an important position in future battles. On the other hand, there is nothing important to report on the front line, except for the fact that the French rebel attack on Peng Dufas was repelled, and the artillery fire activity of the anti-Axis forces on the southern line was more intense, which is worth mentioning.

### Mussolini's Speech: Deeply Believes That Final Victory Will Be Won

Rome, 6th Central News Agency dispatch, according to Stefani News Agency: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini made a brief speech on the balcony of the Venice Palace yesterday, reiterating Italy's firm determination to fight to the end in order to win the final victory, and said that Italians will return to Africa. The newly appointed Secretary of the Fascist Party, Siscochai, held a reception at the Venice Palace, which was attended by senior party leaders from various provinces. The masses then gathered in front of the palace, shouting for the Prime Minister to appear. When the Prime Minister appeared on the balcony, they immediately asked the Prime Minister to speak. The Prime Minister immediately agreed. During the speech, the masses repeatedly cheered. The Prime Minister declared: "Your voices seem to be filled with indestructible faith and supreme confidence. Faith in Fascism, trust in the sacrifices in these difficult times, will surely achieve final victory, if God is fair, and Italy is eternal. Nine years ago, I spoke on this balcony about the completion of the African expedition and the establishment of the Italian Empire. This development has not ended, but it is only a moment of rest. I know that thousands of Italians feel infinite pain for the so-called African diseases. We only have one way to cure it, that is to return. We will return. At present, what is absolutely necessary is to respect the wartime contempt for cowards and the shooting of traitors, regardless of which class or race they belong to. This is not only my personal opinion, I think you and the entire Italy must have the same opinion."

### Major General Kai William Succeeds as Commander of American Forces in Europe

Lisbon, 6th Central News Agency dispatch, according to British capital news, London officially announced yesterday that after the death of Lieutenant General Antru, commander-in-chief of the American forces in Europe, in a plane crash in Iceland, the vacancy has been temporarily filled by Major General Kai William, because Kai has the highest qualifications.

Lisbon, 6th Central News Agency dispatch from London, the US European Expeditionary Force Command issued a statement on the 4th stating that Lieutenant General Andrew, commander of the US forces in Europe, died in a plane crash in Iceland on the 3rd. It was supplemented on the 5th that Major General Port, chief of staff of the army, also died at the same time as Lieutenant General Andrew.

### German Forces Improve Positions in the Eastern Front Kupensk Area; German Long-Range Guns Bombing Leningrad

Berlin, 6th Central News Agency dispatch According to qualified sources yesterday, after the Soviet army suffered heavy losses in attacking the German positions in the Kupensk bridgehead in the past few days, it has temporarily eased its attacks. On the morning of May 4, the German army had withdrawn from the town of Krimskaya. The Soviet army did not discover the German army's withdrawal preparations, so the German army's withdrawal from the town and its northern and southern adjacent areas was not hindered by the enemy army. The withdrawn position is deeply embedded eastward, forming a prominent area, which is extremely unfavorable for defense. Therefore, it was decided to withdraw the new German position west of Krimskaya, which is extremely favorable for defense, because it is protected by towering mountains behind it. According to a military correspondent for the Overseas News Agency, the withdrawal from Krimskaya is of no importance militarily, and strategically, the Soviet army has not gained any benefit, because the town is located on the plain, and the new German position is on the mountain slope west of the town. At the same time, the German front has also been greatly shortened, so the German army's strength must also be greatly increased. If the German army adds its reserves to the battle, it will not be difficult to defend the town and recapture the position southeast of the town that the Soviet army gained on Monday. However, the German army did not do this, because this move would not be worth the loss and would violate the German army's saving of strength in preparation for a more important operation. According to the current situation, the German army's ability to smoothly maintain the Kupensk bridgehead can also guarantee that although the battle has now eased, the Soviet army's offensive may continue.

### German Planes Bombard British Industrial Center in Broad Daylight

Lisbon, 6th Central News Agency dispatch The city of Reading, west of London, was bombed by German planes yesterday in broad daylight, causing considerable casualties. Reading has a population of 100,000 and is a center for machinery and textile industries.

### British Planes Attack Four German Units; Thirty-Six Shot Down

Berlin, 6th Central News Agency dispatch The German authorities announced on the 5th that 36 British planes were shot down by German anti-aircraft artillery and fighter squadrons during the air raid on western Germany on the 3rd. In addition, five anti-Axis aircraft were shot down off the coasts of France and Belgium, and two British aircraft were shot down off the coast of Norway.

### Mexican Military Exercises

Aijing, 6th Central News Agency dispatch According to Mexican news, the Mexican army, including infantry and artillery, held exercises yesterday in the Pabla area. Many anti-Axis officers and the Argentine Military Commission attended the inspection. It is estimated that more than 3,000 people participated in the exercises.

### American Military Authorities Take Over Italian Colonies

Rome, 6th Central News Agency dispatch, according to Asmara via Istanbul news, the Italian Chief of Staff of Eritrea has been detained by the American side, and it is said that the Italian colony has now been taken over by the American military authorities.

### The Way to National Prosperity and Decline

— Yoshida Toyu

The recent editorials of the Shen Bao have discussed China's "Way to National Prosperity and Decline" twice in succession. The conclusion stated: "Every public official in government institutions, from the highest leader to the lower-level cadres, should be a role model for the people of the whole country and establish a clean and upright political atmosphere." A certain Japanese person, upon reading this editorial, said that such abstract, moralistic arguments ultimately cannot solve the difficulties faced by the Nanjing government. In the Doctrine of the Mean, there is a saying: "The Way is not far from man. If one cultivates a Way that is far from man, it cannot be regarded as the Way." I believe that only by implementing this morally clear proposal that everyone understands can we truly find China's way to national prosperity and decline. Before explaining the rationale behind this, it is necessary to first discuss China's unique characteristics.

As everyone knows, in Europe, the state (government) and the church are separate institutions. The church is responsible for the morality of the people, while the state (government) is responsible for maintaining social order. In China, however, the state shoulders responsibilities in both areas. In Europe, the source of morality is God; in China, the source of morality is the state. More specifically, it is the actions of public officials, from the highest leader to the lower-level cadres. In China, Buddhism has never been allowed to manage the morality of the living, and now, it can only manage the citizen certificates of the dead. Confucianism has long been buried in the dust, and now, it is only used by extravagant people to quote their favorite passages. Even during the prosperous times of Buddhism and Confucianism in China, very few people sacrificed their lives for the Way, but many, like Wen Tianxiang, sacrificed themselves for the state. Therefore, in China, if the people lose respect for the state's highest leader, the nation's morality inevitably declines rapidly. The saying "what is above, the below will follow" is meant to indicate this relationship in terms of morality. And the "above" here refers to the nation's highest leader and the officials below him. To become an official in China, one must pass three rigorous examinations on classics and ancient poetry. Only after passing these tests and becoming a "xiucai" (licentiate), "juren" (recommended man), and "jinshi" (presented scholar) are they allowed to be granted an official position. Even if this examination system seems ridiculous, it is a very meaningful system considering China's unique characteristic that officials are the source of the nation's morality. Because in order to pass these examinations, one must be well-versed in countless ancient books. During this period, officials personally receive moral and cultural education. Therefore, relying on this examination system, Chinese scholar-officials have long been the pillars of Chinese national morality. Even though scholar-officials are seen as ridiculous in today's revolutionary China, we cannot deny their contribution to maintaining national morality through their education and morality.

The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing Dynasty's regime, and at the same time, the scholar-officials who guided the Qing Dynasty's national morality were also expelled from the government. As a result, China's national morality inevitably experienced a terrifying state of anarchy. A new morality to replace the old morality has not yet been established. Therefore, although the old morality has lost its pillar, its palace has not yet collapsed. It remains an empty house. The New Youth Movement in 1915 first began the work of demolishing this great palace of morality. Their attitude was explained in the "New Youth's Defense Against Accusations," published in 1919:

"What they accuse this magazine of is nothing more than destroying Confucianism, destroying ritual, destroying national essence, destroying chastity, destroying old ethics (loyalty, filial piety, and chastity), destroying old art (Chinese opera), destroying old teachings (ghosts and gods), destroying old literature, and destroying old politics (privilege and autocracy). This magazine and its colleagues certainly admit to these accusations. However, tracing back to the source, the colleagues of this magazine are originally innocent. Only because they support Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science did they commit these heinous crimes. To support Mr. Democracy, one must oppose Confucianism, ritual, chastity, old ethics, and old politics. To support Mr. Science, one must oppose national essence and old literature."

From this, we can see that the New Youth Movement was only eager to destroy the old morality and did not touch on the construction of a replacement new morality. Therefore, that movement not only failed to completely destroy the palace left by the old morality, but even it itself did not complete the conceptual diagram of a new national morality. As a result, what invaded this empty house was the culture that Goethe called "Anglo-Saxon Contagion," imported from the British and Americans in Shanghai. In "The Story of a Chinese Oxford Movement" by Ku Hung-Ming, published in 1912, it is said:

"The foreigners in Shanghai are delighted that the new China under Yuan Shikai has cut off its queues and adopted European culture. These misguided people do not understand at all that the culture adopted by the new China is by no means European civilization, but only the European civilization of Shanghai - that is, the culture of Anglo-Saxon disease that Goethe spoke of. The disease of genuine European civilization is now developing in China." (See page 22 of the original book)

How appropriate this is for modern Shanghai, no, China, the reader can see and hear for themselves, without me having to repeat it. At this time and in this place, there is plenty of Anglo-Saxon culture, but it is no longer its original face, but rather a degenerate Anglo-American culture made in Shanghai. This culture is neither the religion that manages morality nor the state that manages social order. All that exists is the morality of money and the social order of money. The possessor of money is the determinant of morality, and thus the ruler, it is the world of Soong Tzu-wen and Kong Xiangxi. How they made their fortunes today, I will not say much here. Behind their wealth, I don't know how many bankrupt people are waiting to die on the streets, and I don't know how many good farmers have been stripped of their land for usurious loans. Yet, they are the so-called model gentlemen of this society, striding proudly. Such gentlemen have not yet disappeared recently. Two or three years ago, they were still "bums" on the streets, but in a short time, they have accumulated tens of millions of assets. Among them, there are even those who have no idea what their proper business is. Yet, people are not surprised by the source of their wealth, but rather treat them as "rich masters" and treat them with the courtesy of new gentlemen. In this kind of morality, gambling is considered a "noble entertainment," and gambling venues naturally become gentlemen's clubs. Under wartime economics, ordinary families are saving electricity, and streetlights have been turned off from around 8:00 PM, and factories have been forced to shorten their work due to saving electricity. However, these clubs are able to keep their magnificent lights on all night and "operate all night." In this kind of morality, people in society dare not blame even if people with social status compete to hoard goods, opium addicts become high officials, and drowsily hear cases. This is the reality of "Anglo-Saxon Contagion". Confucius once said, "Free and without shame". Shanghai, no, China's morality today, is truly what is called free and shameless morality.

The current task of the Nanjing government today lies in driving this decadent culture out of China and building the Three Principles of the People morality that Mr. Sun Yat-sen wanted to implement but could not. The driving force for this movement in China is neither Confucianism nor Buddhism, but rather the actions of all members of government institutions from the highest leader downwards. Just as scholar-officials were the supporters of the old morality, new officials must also become the pillars of the new morality. Every official cannot but possess the passion to "be a role model for the people of the whole country and establish a clean and upright political atmosphere." However, in fact, it cannot be asserted that there are no government officials who absolutely do not commit "Anglo-Saxon Contagion". For this reason, the New National Movement initiated by Chairman Wang has great significance. Chairman Wang defined the New National Movement in his "Letter to the People of the Nation" issued on the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital:

"For a hundred years, our compatriots have been oppressed by British and American politics, militarily invaded, and economically exploited. These are all tangible. However, cultural anesthesia has made our compatriots unknowingly forget themselves in their thinking. These intangible poisons are more harmful than the tangible ones, many times over. To defeat the forces of Britain and America, we must first clear the British and American thoughts in each person's mind. This is the first priority of our engagement in the Greater East Asia War and the first move of the total war. How can we eliminate them? To defeat others, we must first build ourselves. The New National Movement is the way to build ourselves."

Chairman Wang's movement of self-construction that he speaks of here must be the revolution against Anglo-Saxon culture, i.e., Shanghai culture, and also the moral construction movement of China's inherent culture, especially the new China.

Chairman Wang said: "The anesthesia of Anglo-Saxon culture is an intangible poison, many times more harmful than the tangible ones," which is a profound statement. However, I would like to offer a suggestion here: the New National Movement should first begin with the elimination of tangible poisons. Hoarding, opium smoking, and gambling are all products of Anglo-Saxon culture. If the New National Movement first eliminates these "tangible poisons," the subsequent development will be much easier. If the "tangible poisons" cannot be solved, then solving the "intangible poisons" will be many times more difficult. However, as a practical matter, even the solution of these tangible poisons is facing many difficulties before the New National Movement. To overcome these difficulties, relying solely on the efforts of the government is not enough. The intellectual class of the people must first respond and assist the government. If government officials each have the belief in being a role model for the people, and are not succumbed by difficulties, and eliminate the poisons in society one by one, then the intellectual class in the peaceful areas, even if unwilling, will automatically come to support the government.

If the intellectual class on the Chongqing side sees that the accumulated evils of China are being eliminated one by one by the New National Movement, they will also come to participate in the peace camp! This victory of the new morality is precisely the foundation for overall peace. (May 3. Translated by: Xiang)

### The Unjust Death of Young Zhang Jinhai: The Authorities Pay Great Attention; Minister Luo of the Ministry of Judicial Administration Comes to Shanghai to Monitor the Development

Zhang Jinhai and Peng Shuanglong, apprentices at the Cheng Ji Shirt and Socks Factory in the Lafayette Department Store in the French Concession, were arrested on the 28th of last month. Zhang Jinhai died on the 30th due to severe injuries from torture, and Peng Shuanglong was seriously injured. Regarding this case, this newspaper will record the developments as follows: It was found that Zhang Jinhai's body was sent to the morgue on Talas Road at 4:00 PM on the 1st, claiming he died of illness, and was reported to the Second Special District Court for examination. In addition to the French Concession Police representative Sanderli and his assistant physician Zhao Kaishu, the chief prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, Mr. Shen Wenjie, after receiving the report, suspected that according to precedent, non-noble Chinese were not allowed to be moved to the Talas Road morgue for examination. Therefore, he personally led the examination team, along with forensic doctors Wang Guoan and Guan Shouhua, to rush to the morgue to perform an autopsy. The examination's determination of the cause of death is as follows:

Determination of Death Due to Severe Injuries: It was found that the deceased Zhang Jinhai was 19 years old, originally from Zhenjiang, a businessman, measured 64 inches in height, 14 inches in shoulder width, and 7.5 inches in chest height.

External Examination: Pale yellow complexion, good nutrition throughout the body, foam flowing from the mouth, and a small amount of liquid flowing from the nostrils. Swelling of the scalp on the left head, about two inches in circumference. Dark purple discoloration of the skin in the left temporal region, with a subcutaneous bleeding spot, about three centimeters in circumference. Dark purple discoloration of the skin on the front side of the left chest ribs, with five subcutaneous bleeding spots: four the size of a double corner coin, and one the size of a silver dollar. Two red indentations on the back of the left wrist joint, each the size of a soybean. Mild swelling on the backs of both hands, with no other injuries or abnormalities in other parts.

Internal Examination: Head Cavity Examination: The head was cut open and peeled off in the standard manner, and subcutaneous bleeding spots of varying sizes were seen on the left head and left temporal region, consistent with what was seen externally. No fractures or breaks in the skull. No bleeding or other injuries to the brain. Chest and Abdominal Cavity Examination: The skin of the chest and abdomen was cut along the midline. No abnormalities in the chest organs, and no bleeding. However, subcutaneous bleeding in the left anterior chest rib area was obvious and extensive, with bleeding spots from the second rib to the eighth rib. When the ribs were sawn, there were also bleeding spots on the pleura on the left side of the anterior chest, also from the second rib to the eighth rib. A large amount of purple-red blood was stored in the abdominal cavity, a clear sign of internal organ bleeding. The liver was found to have ruptured, with a large amount of clotted blood. No abnormalities in the other organs.

Examination Explanation: The wounds on the head and left temporal region were caused by blunt force. These two wounds are difficult to recognize as having a direct relationship to the cause of death. The wounds on the left anterior chest rib area were also caused by blunt force. The rupture of the spleen in the abdominal cavity can be determined from the internal and external injuries of the chest ribs, i.e., bleeding spots. The wounds on the left wrist joint and the swelling on the backs of both hands appear to be caused by tight pressure from ropes, shackles, etc., but are not fatal. Therefore, it is determined that the body died due to external blunt force to the chest ribs, leading to a rupture of the spleen and bleeding from the spleen.

The Second Special Court Lodges a Serious Protest: Since the examination's conclusion of Zhang Jinhai's death was due to injuries sustained before death, Chen Bingjun, the president of the Second Special District Court, and Shen Wenjie, the chief prosecutor, immediately lodged a serious oral protest with the French Concession authorities to maintain legal rights and protect the legal interests of citizens, demanding that the French suspect Miret be punished according to the law. They also immediately sent the Chinese detective Zhu Songcheng and others who participated in the torture and forced confession to the court for strict punishment according to the law.

Minister Luo Makes a Special Trip to Shanghai: Since the Zhang case occurred, Luo Junqiang, the Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, learned of it and paid great attention to it. He made a special trip from Beijing to Shanghai to closely monitor the development of the case. The Second Special Court also submitted the examination's conclusion of the body and the process of negotiation to Minister Luo for review, and requested instructions on appropriate measures.

Complaint: The case has already been filed with the Second Special Court by the family of the deceased, Wang Shi. The original text of their appeal is recorded below:

Complainant: Zhang Yuanji

Defendants: Ms. Li, Guo Shiyuan, Feng Yusheng, Zhu Songcheng, Translator Li, West Detective No. 23, Wang Shu, Miret

Accusation of Framing the Innocent, Embezzling Lost Items, Torture, and Murder: Seeking Justice for Crimes of Lawlessness. I, the complainant's only son, Jinhai, is an adopted son, newly working at the Cheng Ji Shirt and Socks Factory at No. 292 Cai Shi Road. The rules are extremely strict, and he has never committed a crime. On the afternoon of April 28, the first defendant, Ms. Li, purchased goods worth over 100 yuan from the staff Kang Wanqing. The next morning, she came and asked if a laundry voucher had been lost here during the purchase of goods yesterday. The store manager, Zhang Yuebo, personally searched carefully but did not find it and told her the truth before she left. Not long after, the first defendant, together with the owner of the Yihua Laundry Shop, the second defendant Guo Shiyuan, the staff member, the third defendant Feng Jinsheng, and the Chinese detective, the fourth defendant Zhu Songcheng, swarmed into the store with a threatening presence. Feng Jinsheng arbitrarily pointed out that the apprentice Peng Shuanglong seemed to have taken the ticket to pick up the clothes. Therefore, the fourth defendant arrested Peng and took him to the police station, where the Chinese detective and the fifth defendant, Translator Li, beat him severely with sticks to force a confession. Then, he was imprisoned in another room, where the sixth defendant, West Detective No. 23, inflicted severe torture. Peng, unable to endure it, falsely confessed that the complainant's son, Jinhai (had picked up a piece of paper from the ground, whether it was this one or not, he did not know), and so on. As a result, the detective Zhu Songcheng arrested the complainant's son, Jinhai, and took him to the police station. The defendants, Zhu Songcheng, West Detective No. 23, and Translator Li, and three others, took turns inflicting severe torture and repeated beatings. At this time, the second defendant, Guo Shiyuan, said to the above four defendants (He is an old hand; you must make him confess.) Then, he used French to instigate the eighth defendant, West Detective Miret, to drag him into another small room. Then, the above four detectives (i.e., Zhu, Li, outside person No. 23) jointly tortured him with cruel methods. When he was on the verge of death, West Detective Miret personally committed an inhumane and extremely cruel act. At this time, the store manager Zhang Yuebo was waiting in the outer room, and at first, he could still hear the tragic cries and screams, intermittently. After a few minutes, there was no sound at all. He only heard the detectives whispering privately, saying (The Zhang guy is already finished.) At this time, the store manager Yuebo still did not understand the full extent of what had happened. Then, the detective and Guo Shiyuan said to Zhang Yuebo (You can go back for now; we'll take him to the public court tomorrow.) How could he know that the next day, the complainant's son, Jinhai, had already been tortured to death by Miret and five others through torture. In addition to the fact that the body has already been presented to your court's prosecutor's office for examination, stating that all ribs from the second to the eighth rib were severely injured, and the temples and skull were also severely injured, and the abdomen was filled with dirty blood, and the spleen inside the abdomen was completely broken, etc., the death certificate is filled out and attached to the file. It is suspected that Ms. Li already had doubts about my lost laundry voucher. How could the first defendant, Ms. Li, and the second defendant, Feng Jinsheng, fabricate claims out of thin air, frame the innocent for embezzlement, and instigate detectives to force a confession? From the beginning, they had a bad motive, and the result ultimately caused a tragedy. Although they did not directly kill, they fabricated facts and allowed detectives to torture and force confessions to subject others to criminal penalties, which is a crime under Article 169 of the Criminal Law. Decisive investigation agencies must have a legal basis for detaining and interrogating people. If there is suspicion of a crime, they should also be transferred to the court for trial within 24 hours. Returning to the point, even if Jinhai's embezzlement of lost items is true, the penalty would only be a fine. Now, the detectives Miret, Zhu Songcheng, Wang Shu, Translator Li, and West Detective No. 23, etc., clearly knew that it was a very minor case, but they spared no effort in taking turns using inhumane torture, even when he was on the verge of death, they still did not stop, fully demonstrating that their initial purpose had already spawned the intention to kill, ultimately leading to the complainant's son dying tragically due to being unable to withstand the torture. As for Miret, the main culprit who kicked Jinhai to death with the final kick, they have each separately committed the same laws, Articles 125, 30, and 271. The crime of dereliction of duty and helping to kill should be severely punished. Furthermore, the defendant Guo Shiyuan was the one who instigated West Detective Miret and others to severely torture the complainant's son to death on the spot, committing the crime of instigating murder under Articles 29 and 271 of the same law, and should be severely punished. In short, the above-mentioned detectives bear the heavy responsibility of guarding the local security. Under this bright sky and clear daylight, they dare to rely on the relationship of the concession to torture innocent civilians illegally, running rampant without regard for the law, and being shrouded in darkness. If they are not immediately arrested and punished according to the maximum penalties of the above articles, not only will the injustice sink to the bottom of the sea, making it impossible to ever redress the wrong, but it is also feared that similar cases will occur in the future, and people's lives will not be guaranteed. Therefore, this complaint is filed, and I earnestly request your court to review and approve the investigation, and to punish the defendants with the appropriate punishment to uphold the national law. This is truly a debt of gratitude. Respectfully submitted to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special District Court of Shanghai.

French Court Resumes Investigation and Interrogation: After the French Consulate General's Police Superintendent requested it, due to the tragic death of Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at the Lafayette Cheng Ji Socks and Shirt Factory, within the French Police Department, the Consul's Court President has been ordered to conduct a detailed investigation. All personnel who can testify have been suspended from work. It is heard that the French Consul's Court summoned the injured apprentice Peng Shuanglong from Guangci Hospital for questioning yesterday.

Group Meeting: The Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League China General Association has scheduled a temporary meeting of various groups for 1:00 PM today to discuss the steps to take for negotiation regarding the tragic death of Zhang Jinhai. It is heard that the participating groups will include the Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association, the China Hongmen United Association, the Shanghai Xingya Association, the East Asia Anti-Communist League, the Zhenjiang Fellow Association, and the China National Anti-British and Anti-American Association, among other groups. It is also heard that further discussions will be made, including (1) punishing the murderers, (2) compensating the family of the deceased, (3) requesting the French Concession Police to guarantee that the same incident will not occur again in the future, and (4) sending telegrams to the National Government, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, urging serious negotiations to value human life. Furthermore, the China National Anti-British and Anti-American Association specially telegraphed all sectors of the country yesterday for support to show justice and redress the great injustice. The Municipal Farmers' Association also issued a declaration.

The Shanghai Municipal Warehouse and Wharf Industry Association wrote a letter stating: "Having read your newspaper's 'Publication of Zhang Yuanji's son, Zhang Jinhai, suffering unjust treatment and dying innocently,' we are deeply saddened, even though we are not relatives or friends with Mr. Zhang. Outraged, and to express human sympathy, we have specially collected 5,000 yuan for the Zhang Jinhai's funeral expenses and Zhang Yuanji's support funds, and send it to your newspaper office to forward it on their behalf. We also ask you to appeal to all sectors to show sympathy and uphold justice."

Also, indignant citizens wrote a letter stating that they automatically donated and collected 400 Central Reserve Certificates and sent them to this newspaper to collect and transfer them to help Zhang's family. Also, Mr. Yang Zhongshu and Mr. Lin Zhimu, moved by righteous indignation, jointly donated 100 yuan. It has been verified that the above funds are currently temporarily stored in the newspaper office, awaiting transfer.

### Second Phase: Purchasing Oil with Housing Donation Tickets Begins Today; Four Ounces Per Person at Five Yuan and One Dime; The Method is Exactly the Same as the First Phase

The second phase of purchasing oil based on housing donation tickets per capita in this city is still approved by the food oil wholesale office to allocate 500 tons by the military allocation authorities, and the office has completed all the procedures. Starting today (7th), the public concession will purchase oil at designated oil stores from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily with winter housing donation tickets and household head's citizen certificates, the French concession will purchase oil with January and February housing donation tickets and household head's identity cards, and the western Shanghai Zhabei district will purchase oil with household registration certificates and household head's residence certificates. The method is exactly the same as the previous phase.

Oil Sales Deadline is the 17th: As for the quantity, it is still four ounces per person, but the selling price must be calculated according to the new price of 20 yuan and 4 cents per catty, with four ounces of edible oil costing 5 yuan and 1 dime. At the same time, the allocation of this edible oil by the office is calculated according to the number of people surveyed by the Baojia authorities. Therefore, citizens can purchase the amount they are entitled to at the designated retail oil stores within the time limit without having to rush and cause chaos. Furthermore, each retail oil store must sell as much as possible in accordance with the regulations and must not refuse on any pretext or deduct the quantity. Otherwise, citizens can report it, and the office will cancel the retail rights and report it to the police authorities for investigation according to the law. The deadline for oil sales is the 17th of this month.

Procedures for the Nanshi Area Not Yet Completed: The Nanshi area has not been allocated for sale at the same time as the two concessions because the procedures have not yet been fully completed, and it will be delayed for a few days until the 10th of this month. The quantity and price are the same as the two concessions.

### This Month's Rationed Sugar Sales to Begin on the 11th

Following the establishment of the Shanghai District Sugar Industry Association, the allocation of sugar in this city will continue to be handled by the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office. All Category A and B retailers have also been required to join the association and remain responsible for sales. The allocation for this month's rationed sugar sales is currently being processed by the office, with the official start date set for the 11th of this month. Retail sugar stores must complete payment and collection procedures upon receiving notification from the office to ensure timely implementation. The quantity remains at four taels per person, priced at 2.35 yuan. Packaging costs will be charged separately for packaged sugar.

Special Allocations to be Processed Continuously　Furthermore, special sugar allocations required for various businesses are being continuously reviewed and processed by the office. However, due to the large number of accounts, a gradual allocation approach is being adopted. Allocations will be made as reviews are completed. Stores receiving notification from the office must complete payment and collection within the specified deadline. Resale is strictly prohibited; otherwise, allocations will be suspended.

### The Rationed Grain System is Now Firmly Established

Since the implementation of the rationed grain system in this city, it has greatly benefited the people's food supply. Recent rumors circulating in the market suggesting that authorities would discontinue the rationed grain system due to the decline in black market rice prices are absolutely false. The authorities have firmly established the rationed grain system and there is no possibility of it being discontinued midway.

Allocations Will Be Increased as Much as Possible　The authorities will increase the rationed grain allocations as much as possible, emphasizing allocations for the general population. To ensure equitable distribution, the Rice and Grain Affairs Office has reduced the extra grain allocation from two sheng to one sheng per period, starting this period. Additionally, the flour allocated to noodle product businesses will be discontinued and reallocated to the general population to increase the flour allocation as much as possible.

Household Grain Sales in West Shanghai to Begin Today　The 12th phase of household rice allocation in the West Shanghai district, totaling 4,500 bags, has been distributed by the West Shanghai District Public Rice Sales Office. Sales are scheduled to begin today. It is reported that due to the offsetting of leftover rice from the previous period, each person can purchase two sheng of whole rice, totaling six yuan.

Commentary

### The Responsibility of the French Concession Police in the Wrongful Death of Zhang Jinhai

For several days, newspapers have carried notices from lawyers Shao Bao-san and Gu Ru-wen, representing Mr. Zhang Yuan-ji, appealing for an investigation. The facts are as follows: A 19-year-old youth from Zhenjiang, Zhang Jinhai, unfortunately died from torture inflicted by several detectives of the French Concession Police due to a baseless accusation. This case has shaken the entire Shanghai society, shocked every citizen, and evoked a resonance of human justice.

First, from a legal perspective, even if Zhang Jinhai had committed a crime, the French Concession Police should have transferred him to the court within 24 hours after questioning for public prosecution and legal proceedings. However, the French Concession Police did not transfer him to the court but instead resorted to torture, leading to his tragic death. The responsibility for this naturally falls on the personnel of the French Concession Police involved.

Second, from a humanitarian perspective, at most, Zhang Jinhai's crime was "falsely claiming a coat." Why resort to severe torture? Based on common sense, a 19-year-old youth is in the prime of development, physically strong. Death from torture undoubtedly indicates extremely cruel and inhumane punishment.

The French Concession Police is a law enforcement agency, and the use of punishment is the responsibility of law enforcement personnel. Now that law enforcement personnel have abused their power and become law-breaking personnel, the French Concession Police, to maintain the dignity of the entire law enforcement agency, must promptly bring the law-breaking personnel to justice, openly admit their mistake, and apologize to society. At the same time, they should properly handle the aftermath for the wrongfully deceased and provide generous compensation to the innocent. This is the wise and appropriate action for the French Concession Police. If they protect their subordinates who break the law and disregard human justice, they will inevitably face unfortunate consequences. The French Concession Police authorities are urged to carefully consider the path of right and wrong.

We sincerely hope that the police authorities will caution their subordinates, improve their methods of punishment, and remember the ancient Chinese saying: "If you don't want others to know, don't do it." We offer this to all members of the French Concession Police, hoping they will carefully consider it. (Supplement)

### Japanese Army Press Department Hosts Reporters to Discuss the Situation of the U.S.-China Air Force in Chongqing

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai hosted a regular meeting of the Chinese press corps of this city. A Japanese spokesperson discussed the current situation of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing and the Chongqing army, stating that although the U.S. and Chongqing forces may attempt to stir up trouble, they will absolutely find it difficult to realize their dream of attacking Japan.

U.S.-China Air Force　The Japanese spokesperson first stated that one of the main goals of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing is to attempt to stir up trouble against Japan, planning to take action in the Taiwan and Kyushu areas. In the current situation, they are preparing to strengthen their forward bases in Quzhou, Guilin, Lingling, and Hengyang. Therefore, Japanese aircraft attacked Lingling and Yunnanyi on April 25, 26, and 27, destroying more than 40 enemy aircraft. Although we are confident that the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing will find it difficult to retaliate after our victory, we must also be meticulously prepared. The recent visit of the commander of the U.S. forces in Chongqing, Stilwell, and the commander of the U.S. 14th Air Force, Chennault, to the United States to meet with Roosevelt is aimed at strengthening their strength in Chongqing and formulating their battle plans. However, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing not only has not made any progress to date but also faces the threat of Japanese air strikes at any time. The spokesperson then continued to discuss the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing.

Deadlock Difficult to Resolve　To verify the U.S.-China Air Force’s unrealistic attempt to stir up trouble, they will inevitably cooperate with the Chongqing Air Force. However, the U.S. and Chongqing sides have divergent opinions, and this deadlock is difficult to break, making it even harder to unite for joint operations against Japan. At the same time, Japan's air defense preparations, air defense training, and air force production are rapidly progressing. Furthermore, the production of the newest fighters is increasing, and their power is greater. All of this demonstrates that we have sufficient strength. Therefore, the U.S. attempt will be difficult to realize, and any rash actions may lead to complete destruction. As such, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing can only engage in empty propaganda, making it difficult to unleash its full potential. Recently, the Chongqing climate has provided a good opportunity for the Japanese Air Force to launch air strikes, and more aggressive attacks are expected in the future, while the Chongqing side is still unaware that the crisis is imminent.

Strength of the Chongqing Army　Finally, the spokesperson discussed the strength of the Chongqing army. Because the Chongqing army has not been able to expand, they are currently focusing on strengthening their own combat capabilities. It is foreseeable that the Japanese army will eventually occupy the inland areas, so they must prepare and replenish their military supplies. The majority of Chongqing's military supplies rely on foreign sources, imported through the Yunnan-Burma Road. However, due to transportation difficulties, ammunition and all military supplies are difficult to obtain as desired. Furthermore, the internal and external routes have been cut off, and the inconvenience of internal transportation is exacerbated by the threat of Japanese air strikes, resulting in demoralized troops on the front lines. Even if they are strengthened, it will be difficult to achieve effective results. Therefore, it is difficult for the U.S. and Chongqing Air Forces to launch an offensive against Japan.

### Fourth Round of Cigarette Distribution to Increase Amount; Progressive New System of Proportional Distribution to be Announced; Unrestricted Price Cigarette Prices

To fully distribute cigarettes and maintain order in the market, the Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association is implementing an increased allocation for the fourth round of distribution. Previously, a four-tier system of A, B, C, and D was used, with distribution ratios of 1:2:3:4. This has now been changed to a new system of 1:2:4:8. For example, the value of a D card allocation is 2,500 yuan, a C card is 5,000 yuan, a B card is 10,000 yuan, and an A card is 20,000 yuan. The distributed goods include products from the military-managed Yuanchang Tobacco Company, the Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco Company, and Chinese-owned Huacheng, Nanyang, Dadong, and Fuxin factories. Starting from the 5th, wholesalers and retailers were notified to make payments and collect goods from the designated distribution points and Datonghang, with the intention of completing everything by the 15th. As for the products of other cigarette factories that were not included in the initially announced price limits, the association has submitted a request to the authorities for approval, and the price limits will be announced soon. Regarding the registration of wholesalers in the suburbs of Shanghai, it has been completed and distribution will be implemented. Distribution in other areas of Huazhong has already begun, and cigarette prices are completely uniform, so the practice of reselling for profit will inevitably be curbed. As for the enforcement of cigarette price limits, the association has dispatched inspectors to conduct thorough inspections to absolutely prohibit hoarding, reselling, and refusal to sell, and other illegal activities.

### Zheng Wuchang Teacher-Student Painting Exhibition - Selected Items for Charity to Support Education

The renowned painter Zheng Wuchang, with his superb calligraphy, will hold a joint teacher-student painting and calligraphy exhibition with his twenty-one students, including Jiang Xiaoyou and Lou Yongfen, starting today (the 7th) at the Daxin Bookstore Gallery. A total of 156 works will be exhibited. In addition to each person selecting a masterpiece for charitable sale to support education, the rest are not for sale and are only for exhibition purposes. Furthermore, the items for charitable sale can be re-ordered to increase the funds for education as much as possible. Mr. Zheng does not shy away from the hard work and is willing to wield his brush for the poor students, and his enthusiasm is commendable.

### Brief News

Deadline for Income Tax Payment　The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Ministry of Finance's Income Tax Department announced that some businesses still have not paid the Category 1 profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the years 1940 and 1941. To rectify tax collection, the bureau has set a deadline of the end of this month for all outstanding income tax amounts to be declared and paid.

Shanghai-Guangdong Remittances Resume　The Shanghai Postal Administration has resumed remittances between Shanghai and various war-affected areas in Guangdong Province. However, the Postal Administration will scrutinize whether or not it is for legitimate expenditure. The limit for each remittance is 50 yuan. The procedure is extremely simple. The Shanghai Postal Administration is currently in negotiations with the Hangzhou Zhejiang Postal Administration to resume remittances to various areas in eastern Zhejiang, such as Xiaoshan, Ningbo, Zhenhai, Yuyao, and Cixi.

Economic Commentary

### Price-Controlled Cigarettes

"Nowhere to be seen are price-controlled cigarettes!" This is practically the reality that every citizen of Shanghai hears and sees today. In recent days, because the fourth round of cigarette allocation is here, this column has received many articles from the public concerning the elimination of the cigarette black market. Although due to limited space, it's not possible to reveal them for now, the public's opinion on price-controlled cigarettes has allowed us to gather a great consensus.

As everyone says, the style of squeezing rice and sugar from a few months ago has now turned into squeezing cigarettes. However, the worst phenomenon in the entire price-controlled cigarette market is not "squeezing cigarettes," but "hiding" them. The origin of cigarettes is very obvious, but the whereabouts are unclear—because price-controlled cigarettes have all gone into the black market. As a result, price-controlled cigarettes have merely become warehouses for the cigarette black market. This is certainly something that the allocation authorities did not anticipate.

Regarding countermeasures to eliminate the cigarette black market, many opinions have been contributed from various parties. For example, some advocate that, in terms of allocation, the Baojia system should be used to implement cigarette distribution on a per capita basis, similar to the methods of distributing rice, sugar, and oil. Some advocate that, in terms of investigation, a more stringent organization should be implemented, similar to the plainclothes ticket inspectors recently dispatched by the tram company. Some advocate that, in terms of penalties, in addition to permanently stopping distribution, the person in charge of the cigarette retail store should be handed over to the competent authorities for investigation and punishment, similar to the punishment suffered by the owners of two cigarette stores in western Shanghai some time ago. Some advocate that, in terms of reporting, the public should be given full authority to report and accuse to the distribution association or nearby government offices, and to cooperate with newspapers for public announcement, just as is done with the suppression of speculation and hoarding.

These methods are obviously reasonable in principle. However, action speaks louder than words. How these methods—or other equally effective methods—are implemented and when they are implemented is the responsibility of the cigarette allocation authorities, and not something that the consuming public can do.

### Strict Management of Bank and Money Shop Operations; Regulations on the Use of Deposit Funds; Implementation of Inspections on the Business Status of Various Banks and Money Shops

To strictly manage the operations of various banks and money shops, the Ministry of Finance, in addition to ordering the payment of required reserves for fixed and current deposits, is having the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank implement inspections of the assets, liabilities, and business status of various banks and money shops, and has stipulated: (1) When financial institutions accept collateral due to the settlement of debts, regardless of whether it is movable property (excluding securities) or immovable property, it should be disposed of within one year. (2) Those who have been engaged in businesses outside the scope of laws and regulations before the implementation of the Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions should terminate such businesses within one year after the implementation of the detailed rules of the Measures.

Regulations on the Use of Deposit Funds　As for banks and money shops engaging in savings business, the regulations on the use of savings funds are: (1) The chattel mortgage loans to rural cooperatives and loans secured by agricultural products shall not be less than one-fifth of the total deposits. (2) Loans secured by immovable property with continuous and reliable income shall not exceed one-fifth of their total deposits. (3) Loans secured by time deposit certificates or accounts of other banks shall not exceed one-fifteenth of their total deposits. (4) The purchase of bills of exchange accepted by other banks shall not exceed one-twentieth of their total deposits. (5) The deposit in other banks shall not exceed one-fifteenth of their total deposits. (6) The purchase of government bonds and loans secured by marketable securities shall not exceed one-tenth of the total paid-up capital and public reserve.

### Central Reserve Bank Advisor Kimura - Speaks to Newspaper Reporters - On the Issue of Enriching the Content of the Central Reserve Bank

To clarify the contents of the Central Reserve Bank’s efforts to seek improvement, so that the people can have a deeper understanding, Mr. Kimura Zota, advisor of the Central Reserve Bank, held a discussion with Chinese newspaper reporters at 3:00 PM on the 5th on the third floor of the bank’s Shanghai branch, hoping that all sectors would cooperate to complete the mission of the national economy. Excerpts of the main points are as follows: Briefly stated, banks are of great importance to the people’s livelihood and bear very important responsibilities. Because the Central Reserve Bank is a government bank, its relationship to people’s livelihood is even more important. Now, in order to stabilize the currency, the Central Reserve Bank must be strengthened, so that the public has a deep belief in the Central Reserve Bank. The key points for strengthening the Central Reserve Bank are: (1) To ensure that the reserve for the issuance of banknotes is sufficient. (2) To make loans cautiously. Rumors that the Central Reserve Bank has no reserve are completely wrong. The Central Reserve Bank has long determined that there is sufficient reserve for the issuance of banknotes. The Central Reserve Bank’s lending target is absolutely not banks. Even for banks, loans can only be issued after a thorough review. Recently, prices have risen sharply, and most people do not recognize the current situation, believing that it is caused by the issuance of currency. In fact, the current price increase is due to the scarcity of materials themselves. Therefore, in order to suppress prices, it is necessary to start by enriching the source of materials. To enrich the content of the Central Reserve Bank, the cooperation of all parties is necessary, and the understanding of the public is necessary in order to promote currency stability.

### After General Registration of Major Goods, Owners Can Still Buy, Sell, and Move Them, But Must Fill Out and Submit a Goods Movement Report

In order to handle the regulations on the production, storage, movement, and distribution of materials, and in order to implement the wartime economic policies and the task of guiding and supervising the material control, the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau is holding the General Registration of Major Goods in Shanghai Special City. The items include cotton, lump coal, coal briquettes, cigarette paper and other items stipulated in the list of major commodity categories and items promulgated by the Executive Yuan, and the twelve categories of materials stipulated in the new Articles on the Restriction of Wartime Material Movement: (1) various automobiles and their parts, (2) gasoline and petroleum products for automobiles, (3) various machinery, (4) telecommunications equipment and materials (including parts and batteries), (5) metals (including silver yuan raw materials and non-ferrous metals) and their products, (6) medicines (referring to medical and industrial uses, excluding Chinese medicine) and dyes, (7) rubber (including old rubber) and products, (8) cotton yarn and cloth and their products, (9) candles (including raw materials), (10) matches, (11) soap, (12) sugar. In order to restrict these major items, regardless of whether they are members of various trade associations, they must all apply to the bureau for registration. Those who store the above-listed major items and conceal them or report less than they actually have will be severely punished once verified. The registration period was originally from April 5 to April 30. Now, because the various trade associations are in the process of adjusting their organizations, the members have not been able to complete the registration procedures on schedule. The requests of the various trade associations have been approved to extend the registration period by ten days, from May 1 to May 10. Now that the deadline is only a few days away, the number of businesses and companies that are declaring registration through trade associations, or private businesses that are directly applying to the Economic Bureau for registration of their stored goods, has been quite enthusiastic in recent days. It is understood that after the general registration of major goods, the goods stored by various companies, businesses, or private individuals who have registered with the bureau can be freely bought, sold, and moved. Holders of goods can obtain a Goods Movement Report from the bureau for sale or purchase of goods, and submit it with detailed information. The items listed in the Goods Movement Report include: (1) Mover (business name, manager's or owner's name, business address or owner's address, telephone number), (2) Moved items (registration number, item category, item name, trademark or brand name, item quantity and value), (3) Moving location (address of moving in and name of consignee, address of moving out and name of consignor), (4) Reason for moving (purpose of moving out and purpose of use, purpose of moving in and purpose of use), (5) Moving date. The report is submitted to the Municipal Economic Bureau for approval, and a Goods Movement Report Receipt is issued to facilitate movement.

### Factories Resuming Operations One After Another; Smoke Coal Usage Increases Sharply

With the assistance of the authorities, factories in the city are now resuming production in sequence, and the situation is very good. The required raw materials are also being fully obtained. According to news from the coal industry yesterday, the use of smoke coal seems to be increasing sharply because factories in various industries have started production. Fortunately, this fuel is allocated by the authorities on a regular basis, so there is no fear of shortage. The market price is also low, which greatly benefits the manufacturing cost. At the same time, the authorities are actively purchasing the smoke coal needed by various factories in order to transport it to Shanghai for storage in large quantities.

### Attention to Material Conservation; Japanese Embassy Establishes Committee to Be Responsible for Wartime Key Resources

In order to seek conservation of key resources and use materials only when necessary, the Japanese mainland has set wartime standards for important materials and unified the complex types of resources.

### Aspiration Chapter

— Striving for Glory

An ancient saying goes, "Poverty diminishes one's aspirations." This saying indeed has profound meaning. Being poor is not necessarily a lifelong condition, therefore it should not be a source of shame, much less humiliation. Some people, born into wealthy families, often look down on others, treating the lives of the poor as if they were ants. Then there are those who fawn over their superiors and bully those below them, even though they themselves are just as destitute in spirit. Even apes know to sympathize with their own kind, so why should humans be any different? Who knows if a poor person, as long as their aspirations remain high, and their life's ambitions are yet to be realized, will endure humiliation, always keeping it firmly in mind. Once the situation changes dramatically, it often makes those haughty people feel ashamed and find no place to hide. Eventually, people will respect and praise them.

However, if a person is both poor and lacking in aspirations, then they will be poor for life. Their life is a dead life. In other words, they might as well not have come to Earth to suffer. Because their experience is only darkness and pain, their life will never see the light of day and will be rejected by humanity. It can be said that they are superfluous in the world, and they should quickly find a way to return to the path of death.

Therefore, setting aspirations is a key principle of life and the driving force for success. A person must set aspirations, and the reason for this lies in this principle.

### Miscellaneous Notes from Shanghai (3)

— Hashimoto Kansetsu

In light of the frequency of Japan's interactions with foreign countries in ancient times, it can be known that the scope of China's interactions with foreign countries in ancient history was even more extensive. I once said that in the late Han Dynasty in China, foreign culture had already been introduced. Weren't the displaced people already immersed in foreign culture in even more ancient times? In the Meiji era, Mount Oe described Shuten-dōji as a person mixed with Russian blood. Legend has it that he liked to drink blood. In fact, the so-called blood drinking was probably wine! These statements cannot be dismissed with a laugh. Even in terms of geographical relationships, it is quite appropriate. The reason I say this is not to endorse Mount Oe's statement. For example, the story of the Peach Blossom Spring in Wuling is about people from the so-called Western Asia who were driven out by the tyrannical Qin and fled. This is not necessarily a far-fetched legend. I can't recite Tao Yuanming's "Peach Blossom Spring" now, but I only remember the words "the clothing of men and women was all like that of outsiders, with yellow hair hanging down." The so-called "yellow hair hanging down" is not just a description of unkempt hair, but can also be interpreted as yellow hair. In the excavations of the Six Dynasties and Tang Dynasties, people often find clay figurines with yellow hair.

The appearance of the people of Hunan, even today, is different from that of ordinary Chinese people. They have high noses, large eyes, and a fierce temperament. In ancient times, they lived in fertile land and were fond of bravery and fighting. (I forgot to mention above; people say that Li Taibai was from Longxi, but recently some people say that he was a Xianbei, that is, a Siberian.) Geographically speaking, going down the Yangtze River from Sichuan Province, Taoyuan (in Hunan Province, near Changde) is a suitable place to settle down. At the end of last year, the three-thousand-year-old record of the Peach Blossom Spring dream may have been blown away all at once. I can conclude that the Sino-Asian people, with the Republic of China as the embryo, had precedents for the creation of new culture two thousand years ago. I think this is definitely not an unreasonable question.

The fourth year after the Chinese Incident, the Greater East Asia War broke out. The Chinese people's feelings towards the Japanese people have been refreshed, which is truly gratifying. The prevalence of the Japanese language craze is even more deeply felt in the South. I think Japanese will soon become the Greater East Asian language and become popular in various places. Especially in China, the similarity of the characters is one of the reasons for the convenience. Another reason can be said to be due to utilitarian thinking, such as being able to quickly obtain a job if one understands Japanese. In trains and restaurants, although Japanese is not yet very popular, the meaning can probably be conveyed. However, I feel that the kind of sentiment I liked when I came to China seems to be gradually decreasing. Seeing the blue clothes of the farmers engaged in farming in the rape flowers outside the window from the train, I immediately thought of the completely Chinese flavor.

I asked Mr. Qian, who was traveling with me, "What happened to so many water buffalo? Why didn't I see any?" Mr. Qian replied, "They have all been eaten." When I got home and talked about this, the women all laughed. "The joke on the radio said that water buffalo have a watery smell." I also thought that maybe it wouldn't be like this. However, this is not a joke. In Shanghai, new restaurants and the like are springing up like mushrooms after a rain, much more than before, employing beautiful and lively waitresses, and every one is very lively. On the other hand, there seems to be a great lack of resources. Miss Zhou Lianxia has a poem about Shanghai describing this situation.

Describing the scene of waiting in the street for a long time to buy rice, this poem is now quite loved by some poets in Shanghai. There are also one or two poems that will be published in the weekly Asahi, which I will omit here. Everywhere, from the mouths of knowledgeable people, one can often hear remarks of understanding Japan and trusting Japan. This is a very gratifying phenomenon.

"Everyone is very tired. We will arrive at XX soon."

This is what the Chinese conductor in the train said. Among them, there are also waitresses whose Japanese is more accurate than mine. (April 10th) (Sho: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun on April 23rd)

### ### Sympathy

— Shilin

Sympathy is the feeling that arises when the pain of others is reflected in one's own heart as reality. We believe that all the isolation, conflict, and harm in human society can be remedied with sympathy. There are many people in the world who cannot understand the pain of others, and there are even people who oppose it and take pleasure in the pain of others. Only because of this, the world is full of disasters. Small family disputes, large social unrest, and racial hatred are all caused by a lack of sympathy. Confucius' so-called "benevolence," Sakyamuni's so-called "compassion," and Jesus's so-called "universal love," which one is not based on sympathy?

All those who have sympathy can forgive others. Theft, in the eyes of stubborn moralists, is originally something that can be deeply hated; but there are also reasons for theft, perhaps due to poverty, perhaps due to lack of education, perhaps due to heredity and companionship, or perhaps due to the instability of the entire society. If we examine the reasons why he became a thief, we feel that although theft is evil, there is really a place for compassion and sympathy, and we cannot simply use shallow moral views to blindly hate it deeply. However, forgiving others is the passive aspect of sympathy, and sympathy also has an active aspect. Those who have sympathy can not only forgive the evils of the world, but also create merit and eliminate the evils of the world. Because they sympathize with the poor status of women and laborers, they want to advocate social reform; because they sympathize with the suffering of ignorant villagers, they want to work hard to promote popular education. Sympathy can not only love everyone, but also hate people's sympathy. Confucius said in his later years: "Only the benevolent can love people and hate people." Like those speculators who hoard and drive up prices, endangering the stability of people's livelihoods. In order to eradicate this poison, society must have a style of breaking through personal relationships, and the government must have a spirit of righteousness to destroy relatives, severely punish treacherous and stubborn people, and warn the public. Because those who are rich in sympathy originally envisioned "the greatest happiness for the greatest number"! These can be said to be manifestations of active sympathy.

Our country's people have always been bound by the concept of family, and as a result, the scope of sympathy has been limited. Outside the family, there is a lack of ability to combine and know morality. In our country, besides the family and relatives who have close ties with the family, all others are the so-called "outsiders." Among these people who are "outsiders" to each other, there is of course no social unity to speak of, and the scope of sympathy must be greatly expanded!

### On Habit

— Bu Jian

"Habit" seems to be the most common custom, and therefore, it is often the most easily ignored and despised by most people. It not only has good and bad distinctions, but also has a positive significance, which can directly affect the success or failure of a person's life and career.

Gambling, visiting prostitutes, alcoholism, addiction to smoking... are bad habits: they can tempt people to tend to be depressed, downcast, decadent, degenerate... not only harm people, ruin families, damage health, but also break human relationships and bury their future. That is already known to everyone.

Conversely, good habits are also an excellent condition for success and career achievement, such as getting up early, regulating diet, and regular bowel movements... it is beneficial to health. Good reading and diligent study can increase knowledge and actively promote careers. Cautious speech and harmony can make extensive friendships and deepen affection...

But regardless of whether it is a good or bad habit, its formation is by no means accidental, and there are reasons for it; nor is it a temporary bad habit, mostly caused by greed for temporary fun and licentiousness, unconsciously. Interest and hobbies are certainly a reason for good habits, but most of them are still consciously cultivated. Therefore, every time one first learns, one often feels infinite difficulty and pain, but over time it becomes natural—habitual. At that time

### Desire

— Zhang Yunfu

Desire and life have a close relationship. As long as a person is born, desire follows, so there will never be a person in the world who has no desire at all. Because if a person wants to live, he must have various material needs such as food and clothing. With these material needs, he has to change his mind and use his brain. Whether it is a dying old man or the cry of a baby just out of the womb; according to the research results of psychologists, it is also a manifestation of desire, not to mention the poor people who have various material worries, even those big merchants who have made a fortune after hoarding and speculating, still turn the idea of ​​money, and even those monks who think they are pure-hearted and desireless also have the delusion of enjoying happiness in heaven. So, in a thousand words, in short, a person is finished when he dies, but if he does not die, he will eventually be entangled by various desires.

Human desires vary depending on each person's different environment. But these infinite desires often produce adverse consequences.

Although desire can cause various evils, it also has various benefits on the other hand. If human beings had no desires, they could not progress. Only with desire can one overcome all difficult encounters.

### Devil

— Xu Zheng Yang

It wears the new mask of charity and the old clothes of morality; and often shakes its head and sighs:

"Alas! Alas! The world is deteriorating, and people's hearts are not what they used to be!"

So, many people kneel down, worship it, bless it, and praise it...

After that, it took off its mask, took off its clothes, grabbed many people who knelt down to it, stepped on them, pulled out their tendons, peeled their skin, sucked their blood, and chewed their flesh. Many people groaned until they turned into many skulls.

He finally put on his clothes and mask again; and drew a mourning "face of compassion" on the mask, and then looked at these skulls and sighed with pity.

"Alas, alas! Alas, how painful!"

So, many skulls knelt down, worshiped him, blessed him, praised him, and thanked him...
