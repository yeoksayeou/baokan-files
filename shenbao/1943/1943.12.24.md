### Expectations of the Rice Control Committee

As the end of the year approaches, businesses are, as usual, settling accounts, and the circulation of money becomes tight. Logically, goods should be sold off to raise cash, and prices should fall. However, recently, prices have instead risen, and the rising trend is sharp, similar to previous fluctuations. Upon investigation, we believe that this price increase is stimulated by the rise in rice and coal prices, because rice and coal are the most essential of basic necessities. We cannot live a day without rice and coal. The price of rice and coal increases, and then all prices and wages follow suit, which is not without reason.

We base our argument on the aforementioned reasons for the rise in prices, and believe that the focus of suppressing prices should be on rice and coal. The Municipal Price Review Committee held a meeting yesterday to plan emergency countermeasures, and we will provide our opinions and contribute our reference for implementation. Today, we will first discuss the issue of rice, and then express our views again, in order to arouse the sense of responsibility of the authorities.

Shanghai is a metropolis that does not produce rice itself. Its five million people rely entirely on the surrounding rural areas and rice-producing regions. No matter how insufficient the rice ration is, no matter how difficult the transportation is, it is rare to see people starving to death among the five million population. Observers often say that this is thanks to the continuous supply of smuggled black market rice. We advocate eliminating smuggling and eradicating the black market. If the source is cut off, wouldn't the citizens of Shanghai starve to death? Actually, that is not the case. We advocate eliminating smuggling and replacing it with public transportation; we advocate eradicating the black market and replacing it with official prices. By reducing the exploitation of smuggling and the black market, both producers and consumers can benefit. This task should be fully undertaken by the Rice Control Committee.

The duties prescribed for the Rice Control Committee are procurement, preparation for transportation, and distribution. Objectively speaking, it is insufficient to talk about the entire meaning of "control" and to complete the mission of "control" without these three duties. To be honest, rice control is a major event that affects the common interests of the people. It is definitely not an ordinary government agency that goes through the motions. It is an autonomous organization entrusted by the government to the people to handle. If it fails, it will not only fail to answer to the government and the public, but also fail to address the future of the people's autonomy. Therefore, once it accepts the task, it must assume absolute responsibility.

Currently, all five million citizens of Shanghai can obtain rice, which fully proves that the problem does not lie in the difficulty of rice supply and transportation. Furthermore, the household rice in Shanghai can be fully rationed. The current insufficient rationing and rampant black market are due to the failure of the Rice Control Committee to fulfill its responsibilities. After the rice from smuggling and the black market is passed through the Rice Control Committee and becomes publicly transported and officially priced rice, wouldn't it be enough for rationing?

Recently, we have received reports from various sources that there have been instances of fraud in the issuance of procurement certificates by the Rice Control Committee, and intentional delays in payments to legitimate procurement merchants, which has caused complaints. Considering the past malpractices in grain administration and the current attempt to illegally profit from the disparity between official and black market prices, we cannot help but take a reserved attitude and urge the authorities of the Rice Control Committee to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter impartially.

The Cotton Management Office of the National Commercial Control Committee recently investigated and punished its staff for malpractice. We request that the facts of the punishment be announced to the public, so that those who disregard the law will know what to fear. At the same time, we hope that the Rice Control Committee will be awed by the arduousness of its responsibility, strictly admonish its staff, and abide by the law. For those who neglect their duties, there should be no leniency. Punish one as a warning to a hundred, and preserve the face of the people's autonomous organization. We expressed our trust in Director Yuan's past history when the Rice Control Committee was first established, and repeatedly offered serious and law-abiding suggestions on personnel issues in order to promote attention. Now, unfortunately, there have been complaints from the outside world, so the authorities should not have any intentions of shielding them and should handle the matter impartially. If they know about it and protect them, or keep it secret and do not publicize it, then they will not only be encouraging malpractice, but also be responsible for it. At the same time, we believe that all members of the Rice Control Committee should be jointly responsible. On the one hand, the committee must do its utmost to procure, store, transport, and distribute rice at the highest efficiency, so that smuggling disappears, the black market is eliminated, and everyone has at least enough food.

### The 84th Session of the Japanese Diet Decides to Convene Today; The Government Will Submit Bills Such as Tax Increases

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The 84th ordinary session of the Japanese Diet will be held on the 24th. The Japanese government has decided to submit 26 bills, including a tax increase bill, to this session of the Diet. The Diet is also actively cooperating with the government to strive for the completion of the war. Therefore, this session of the Diet is a session of certain victory for the government and the people as one. The House of Peers has begun preliminary review of the bills from the 22nd, and the House of Representatives has also begun preliminary review of the preparatory bills at the same time. A Diet consultation was held on the 21st to determine the operating policies of the Diet. On the 23rd, a general meeting of Diet members was held, and President Abe designated the members and the degree and direction of attendance at this ordinary session of the Diet. According to this ordinary session of the Japanese Diet, it is an excellent meeting for the government and the people to gather ideas and opinions on measures such as increasing the production of military supplies, especially aircraft, and ensuring food supply. The Prime Minister's policy speech in the Diet and the budget general meeting or other questions will be conducted based on this basic policy. Therefore, the 84th session of the Diet will definitely make a great contribution to the strong promotion of wartime administration.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - President Abe of the Great Japan Assistance Association delivered a speech at the Assistance Association representative meeting hall at 2:00 PM on the 22nd, stating that this 84th session of the Japanese Diet is a major meeting to effectively handle the administration and prepare for the Greater East Asia decisive battle system. The gist of his speech is as follows: The mission of this session of the Diet is to quickly prepare the Greater East Asia decisive battle system, enhance Japan's war power to crush the enemy's counterattacks, start the path to certain victory, and complete the great task of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In the current stage of the war, enhancing war power is the most urgent task. In terms of military supplies, increasing the production of aircraft is the most important. Ensuring the vitality of the people's lives is important. In modern warfare, the air force has occupied the most important position. This can be clearly understood from the battle results achieved by our army in the Battle of Guadalcanal and the Battle of the Aleutian Islands. Therefore, we must do our utmost to increase the production of aircraft and cultivate technical personnel. Also, for the people's food problem, we must ensure self-sufficiency. Therefore, we should cooperate with the government to promote various efforts to enrich it. Since the beginning of the war, the government has first laid the foundation for a strategically certain victory in the first year, and in the second year, it has completed the political assistance ground for certain victory in the entire Greater East Asia region. The previous ordinary sessions and temporary sessions have effectively implemented these measures, so that they have achieved results. Today, our country's wartime system has been slightly prepared in terms of its scale. In short, the government and the people should exert their full power to achieve satisfactory results. The bills that the government will submit to the Diet are all necessary under the current war situation. Therefore, when we deliberate on these bills in the Diet, if we think about their benefits to the war situation, we cannot but deeply feel the importance of our responsibility. However, under the current situation, the speedy implementation of the administration is necessary. Therefore, the deliberation in the Diet is also the same. The government should truly clarify the situation of the current situation and frankly express its aspirations to seek the heartfelt cooperation of the Diet, and the Diet should also understand the current urgent situation and quickly deliberate to promote the implementation of the government's decisive battle measures.

### The Japanese Government Strengthens Military Power to Cope with the Decisive Battle in Greater East Asia; The Conscription Age for Mainland Residents is Lowered by One Year

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 3:30 PM on the 23rd that the Japanese government will lower the conscription age for mainland residents in 1944 in order to adapt to various current decisions.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - In order to actively enrich the war power of the Japanese army and cope with the final decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government decided to lower the conscription age for mainland residents by one year. All able-bodied men who turn 20 in 1944 will also undergo conscription medical examinations. The imperial order "Temporary Special Cases for Conscription Age" and the Army Ministry ordinance "Special Cases for Conscription Affairs in 1944" will be promulgated in the official gazette on the 24th and will be implemented on the same date. The conscription age in various countries around the world is earlier than Japan. For example, in Britain and the United States, it starts at the age of 18, and the Soviet Union has already called up 16-year-old teenagers for use on the front line. Only Japan canceled the postponement of conscription medical examinations for those residing abroad on September 30 this year, stopped the postponement of student conscription on October 2, and extended the military service age to 45 on November 1. Since the establishment of the Japanese army, it has always adhered to the traditional conscription age of 20. This measure proves that Japan has sufficient manpower and is also to meet the needs of the future war situation. Recently, the number of Japanese able-bodied men who have not reached the conscription age but voluntarily become active soldiers has increased three times compared to before the Sino-Japanese Incident. Therefore, this age reduction measure is actually to adapt to the patriotic enthusiasm of young people during wartime. As for this amendment, although it is based on the changes in the war situation and aims to increase the war power of the Japanese army, it has also been deeply considered in relation to production warfare, which has a significant relationship to comprehensive warfare, and the people's lives. The conscription medical examination this time will be carried out simultaneously in various parts of the country half a month earlier than usual, because those who are 19 and 20 years old will be subject to gun entry management at the same time. This will have a great impact on the important production sector and other aspects. Therefore, careful consideration has been given to this matter. Generally, those who are 20 years old will enter the camp two or three months earlier than usual. After they complete their training in the camp, those who are 19 years old will be allowed to enter the camp. Therefore, in essence, although it is said that the conscription age has been lowered by one year, the age of able-bodied men entering the camp will be advanced by several months. In addition, for workers in the production sector who have a direct and significant relationship with the completion of the war, a special measure is currently being considered, and it is planned to delay the entry of general entrants for a certain period of time within the scope that does not hinder military affairs.

### Japan's Aircraft Production Will Increase Greatly Next Year; Lieutenant General Endo Describes the Outline of the Plan

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Endo, Director-General of the Aviation Weapons Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions, explained the outline of the production plan for the coming year at the local governor's meeting on the 22nd, saying: The Greater East Asia war situation has now entered the decisive battle stage, and the enemy's stubborn counterattacks are becoming increasingly fierce, and a major attrition war is currently unfolding. In terms of the characteristics of modern warfare, both the enemy and ourselves use aircraft as the main body of the decisive battle. Now, our entire country is engaged in aircraft production, and we must not be complacent in the slightest. Mass production of aircraft in the shortest possible time is the supreme requirement for our country to carry out the war. The production plan for the coming year is based on the country's general requirements and aims to fully exert air power. Therefore, its production volume must be several times higher than this year.

### The Temporary Local Governor's Meeting Ends Successfully

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Temporary Local Governor's Meeting was held in a tense atmosphere on the 22nd and was completed. Although the meeting period was only one day, it has achieved results. In the morning, Prime Minister Tojo gave instructions and the ministers related to military production gave explanations. The meeting continued from 1:30 PM, with local governors expressing their opinions and raising questions. Prime Minister Tojo and the ministers related to various ministries answered questions frankly on issues such as enhancing war power, producing wood, increasing efficiency, adjusting labor, utilizing female labor supply and production of food, various production facilities and welfare facilities, the relationship between mobilized idle machinery general factories and district power factories, coordinating the connections between various manufacturing agencies and official offices, and requisitioning labor. The meeting took a temporary break at 4:00 PM. It continued at 4:10 PM, with Major General Sato, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry, explaining in detail the relationship between national mobilization and military mobilization and the actual situation in various countries. Then, Minister of Health and Welfare Koizumi explained the manpower problem, stating that Japan has a great advantage over foreign countries. Then, Prime Minister Tojo elaborated on his feelings and encouraged the governors. Finally, Governor of Tokyo Odate gave a speech on behalf of the national local governors, stating that they would make further efforts in the future. The meeting ended successfully at 6:20 PM.

### To Suppress Prices, It is Necessary to First Promote the Exchange of Goods; A Conversation with Dr. Kimura, Consultant of the Bank of China

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Stabilizing people's livelihood and revitalizing the economy require the reasonable suppression of goods. To solve this important wartime problem, strong countermeasures should be implemented from both goods and currency aspects. According to the opinion of Dr. Kimura Masutaro, Consultant of the Central Reserve Bank, the first key point for China to suppress prices at present is to promote the exchange of goods. At the same time, it is hoped that the private sector will recognize the situation and actively cooperate. The main points of Dr. Kimura's conversation are recorded as follows: The so-called currency inflation is a phenomenon caused by the expansion of credit and the imbalance of goods supply during wartime, which hinders the expansion of productivity. However, judging from the actual situation in Central China, it cannot be considered that there is an excess of currency. Therefore, the reason for the high prices is not, as generally said, due to the impact of currency inflation, but due to goods relations and psychological effects. The fact that goods are biased towards one side and cannot be smoothly exchanged naturally creates expensive and cheap prices. At the same time, the currency also expands accordingly. This reversal of cause and effect can be said to be a characteristic of Central China's prices. In the area where the Central Reserve Bank notes are currently circulating, the amount of currency circulating before the incident was about 700 million yuan. Compared with this time, although the current prices have risen sharply, the amount of issuance of reserve notes is still small. From this point of view, the composition of prices in Central China cannot be said to be due to currency inflation. As for how to solve the current price problem, it is our important mission. Therefore, maintaining the mutual connection between goods and currency and implementing strong policies are fundamental strategies. From the currency aspect, recovering currency and controlling finance to restrict lending methods belong to the extreme aspects of price countermeasures. If Japan combines political and economic forces into one and strongly promotes the recovery of funds, then the issuance of national bonds and public bonds and the increase in savings can be expected to succeed. But the situation in China is not like this. From the perspective of goods relations, when external input is becoming increasingly difficult, the first thing to do is to promote the smooth exchange of goods, while stimulating production. If production is revitalized, the currency will naturally increase, and the recovery of funds can be promoted with goods instead of gold. This can stabilize the economy and promote procurement. On the one hand, it can recover currency, and promoting procurement can promote production. This price problem is constructed in this consistent connection and must be comprehensively promoted. Its results can be expected, but regarding this point, in addition to the political power of the country, it cannot be completed without the strong cooperation of the private sector. The Central Reserve Bank previously handled bill discounting to circulate funds in order to cooperate with the commercial association's procurement of goods. The effect has three points: the first is to determine the use of funds and prevent improper behaviors such as hoarding and speculation; the second is to promote the recovery of funds; and the third is to promote the turnover of funds. However, this kind of work only undertakes a part of the price countermeasures. In short, to promote the exchange of goods and use currency countermeasures is the key to price countermeasures. The business policy of the Reserve Bank will also be implemented in this direction in the future.

### "World Situation and the Greater East Asia War" Speech by President Amano of the Japan Information Bureau

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The monthly general mobilization meeting of the Japan Youth Corps was held simultaneously nationwide on the 22nd. In the Tokyo area, the wartime youth meeting was held at the Public Hall in the Peninsula District. President Amano of the Japan Information Bureau gave a speech at the meeting titled "World Situation and the Greater East Asia War." The following is a summary of his main points:

On December 7, Showa 16 (1941), the world faced a critical juncture. Japan, Germany, and Italy aimed to liberate the various ethnic groups of the world from the aggression and

exploitation of the United States and Great Britain

and enable them to obtain what they deserve, thereby completing a new world order. The policies of Great Britain and the United States sought to monopolize the world and dominate it. To suppress the rise of Japan and Germany in academia and research, they used all sorts of

schemes, and they prepared for war in anticipation of any eventuality. During the negotiations between Japan and the United States the year before, the United States attempted to exert economic pressure to force Japan to submit, but it was clear that Japan would not be restrained. The war ultimatum was issued three days later, on the 29th, when the U.S. Secretary of State

informed the British Ambassador Halifax, stating, "The relationship between the United States and Japan has ended in diplomatic terms, and the current situation has been entrusted to the army and navy authorities." After sending this ultimatum to Japan, the U.S. government simultaneously

ordered its military authorities to prepare for battle.

The attack on Pearl Harbor was by no means a Japanese sneak attack but entirely due to the negligence of those responsible for defending Hawaii. When the European war broke out, Germany won successive victories, sweeping across Europe and North Africa. Recently, the anti-Axis powers have launched a counteroffensive, and Great Britain and the United States have loudly proclaimed that Germany is about to collapse. However, there have been no major changes on the Eastern Front in Germany. On the Italian front, although the Anglo-American forces initially gained some momentum, they have since been unable to make further progress. Furthermore, in the Balkans, Germany preemptively occupied the islands of

Leros and Samos to prepare for an Anglo-American attack from the eastern Mediterranean. Germany has also fortified the Atlantic coast up to the northern coast of Norway, so even if the enemy attempts to establish a second front, they will repeat the retreat at Dunkirk. Therefore, British Prime Minister Churchill stated in a speech on November 10 that Great Britain and the United States will have to make even greater sacrifices in 1944. In the East Asian

theater, Great Britain and the United States have repeatedly called out that

they will launch a counteroffensive or offensive against the Japanese mainland from the southwestern Pacific, the South Pacific, Burma, and mainland China. They have already begun their counteroffensive from the Solomon Islands and the Gilbert Islands. However, after six naval and air battles off Bougainville Island and four naval and air battles in the Gilbert Islands, the enemy has suffered a severe blow, causing Roosevelt and Knox to be unable to realize the boastful words they had made before the Bougainville Island operation. Currently, the domestic atmosphere in both Great Britain and the United States is filled with voices opposing the current authorities. Roosevelt is striving to win another election as president next year, so he is trying hard to secure war achievements to consolidate his position. Churchill is doing the same, using war achievements to establish his political standing. However, the independence struggle in British

India and the racial problems of blacks in the United States have gradually surfaced. In addition, Great Britain and the United States have suffered excessive manpower losses in this war. Those killed by the Japanese army alone have reached approximately 400,000. Although the British and American authorities have tried their best to cover this up, the people's anxiety and wavering sentiment is increasing daily. Coupled with general unfavorable economic and social phenomena, the people of both countries feel an increasing

weariness of war.

Furthermore, the increasing interference of the United States in British colonies has deepened the friction between Great Britain and the United States, and the relationship between Great Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly complex and subtle. Observing the increasingly firm unity of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia and the gradual progress of the construction of Greater East Asia, Great Britain and the United States are quite worried and are eager to realize their ambitions before the foundation of this Greater East Asia construction is consolidated. Therefore, they are waging both war and propaganda. The Cairo and Tehran talks are one example of this, but this action will ultimately fail. Even the general opinions within Great Britain and the United States are greatly criticizing this. Looking at North Africa and the Italian mainland, in North Africa, Great Britain and the United States variably changed the Lavish government's vice-chairman, Daqi, to make him rebel, and used this to shake the French army. However, after it was done, they still

assassinated him. Furthermore, Patrie is no longer regarded as an opponent by Great Britain and the United States, only as a traitor. He has already stepped into his destined fate. Great Britain and the United States are willing to resort to any means to achieve their goals, not hesitating to trample on humanity, such as using air raids to destroy cities and kill innocent civilians, trying to make their enemy people succumb to terror and surrender. This is one example. Also, the number of Japanese hospital ships sunk by Great Britain and the United States has reached twelve. This is all due to Great Britain and the United States disregarding international law and

justice and humanity.

Such atrocities cannot be tolerated by God or man, and we must thoroughly punish them. In the United States, due to the prolonged war, the nation's anxiety about the future of the war is deepening, and Great Britain and the United States really do not know why they are fighting. This war is actually an unjust war

launched by Great Britain and the United States to conquer the world. Therefore, Roosevelt has no just cause for the war. He seems to have considered the name "war for survival," but because this war is not a legitimate war, it is difficult to reconcile name and reality. When Britain began its war against Germany, it claimed that this war was fought to uphold the existence of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other small countries in Eastern Europe. However, to this day, its attitude towards these small countries is ambiguous. In the past, Great Britain and the United States used the Atlantic Charter to advocate the principle of not expanding territory and the principle of national self-determination. However, to this day, Great Britain and the United States have disregarded the rights of the small countries in Europe and attempted to expand their territory, completely contradicting their initial claims. Great Britain and the United States

at the beginning of the war

had eagerly tried to conceal their ambitions for a long time, but their ambitions were finally exposed. At the Cairo Conference, Great Britain and the United States expressed their intention to seize Japanese territory, reduce Japan to a third-rate country, and enslave the Aryan nations. I still remember that thirty years ago, signs reading "Chinese and dogs not allowed" were written at the entrances of the customs clubs in Beijing and Tianjin and Shanghai parks. Great Britain and the United States are imposing such attitudes on Japan and China and trying to turn East Asia into a land of slaves. On the contrary, Japan's war aim is to prevent Great Britain and the United States from invading the countries of Greater East Asia, ensure the stability of Greater East Asia, and further maintain world peace. In other words, it is to liberate the nations of Greater East Asia from the shackles of Great Britain and the United States and jointly build a just world. Therefore, the various countries and nations of Greater East Asia have unanimously risen up, determined to complete the war together with Japan and strive to build the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. The previous Greater East Asia Conference and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration are expressions of this spirit. The Greater East Asia Declaration and the great charter for the construction of Greater East Asia are rebuilding the pyramid of the world. Our Greater East Asian nations, in order to realize this

great declaration,

must strive to win this war. Your participation in the Greater East Asia Youth Corps general mobilization movement, working hand in hand with China and Manchuria towards the goals of the war, and aiming to build a Greater East Asia based on morality, can be said to be a noble mission. I hope that you will work harder to achieve this great mission.

### German Forces on Eastern Front Attack in Three Routes in the South, Fierce Battles Also Occurring in Central Area

Switzerland and Keijo (Seoul), 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Last night, the Moscow Information Bureau's final announcement acknowledged that German forces were attacking along three routes on the Eastern Front.

It revealed that yesterday, in the Chiroping southwestern area within the Kirovograd southern Korsten district, German forces attacked with infantry and tanks, and the Red Army fought hard to respond. Last night, a British correspondent reported from Moscow, with content similar to Soviet intelligence, saying that between Kirovograd and Krivoy Rog, German forces were attempting to wedge-shaped troops to defend the Red Army's defensive lines. The intense attack from the southeast of Kirovograd, in the bend of the Dnieper River, with German forces diverting large numbers of tanks and infantry from other areas to reinforce. It also claimed that on the southern end of the Belarusian line, German forces

advanced west of Chiroping to increase their counter-offensive pressure. By the German military's targeting of attacks in the more southern areas, it appears that their plan is to force the Red Army, distributed along the entire front line, to retreat towards the Dnieper River.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The naval reporter Torus stated: For weeks, there have been no practical changes in the southern war situation on the Eastern Front, other than the increased pressure from the German forces. In the central part of the Eastern Front, Soviet forces have dispatched reinforcements to the Navol Vitebsk area to assist in the battle, and the Soviet offensive has entered a new stage. From the end of October to the middle of December, the situation there was quiet. After careful preparation, a large-scale offensive is now underway. This offensive, using elite troops, may be a prelude to the Soviet's winter offensive. There is little doubt that the Soviet forces will attack in that area. Currently, the Soviet pressure is concentrated on the Vitebsk area. The Soviet forces are launching a frontal attack on the German positions from the east and are conducting a flanking maneuver from the north, and fierce battles are currently underway. The Soviet forces deeply penetrated the German positions with superior forces the day before yesterday. The German counteroffensive recaptured part of the lost territory. The Soviet forces failed to break through the German defenses. The total army on the Eastern Front has been quite successful. German forces attacked between

Kirov and Raichisa, destroying a Soviet division, and a gap in the German lines has been filled. In the Tito-Khei area, the German vanguard has made some progress, but the fierce Soviet counterattack has been repelled. German forces in the Dnieper River bend are attacking southeast of Kirovograd and have made some progress. The war situation in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River is unchanged. The Soviet offensive against the German bridgehead in Nikopol has not yet succeeded. The situation in Korsun is quiet, but the Soviet elite forces are concentrated there, and they are likely to cross the river on the ice.

Moscow, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Soviet Information Bureau announced on the 22nd that Soviet forces had completely occupied the Kherson bridgehead.

### Japanese Planes Launch Large-Scale Attack on Kunming Airfield, Destroying 40 Chongqing Planes

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 23rd that the Imperial Army Air Force, with a combined formation of fighter-bombers, launched a fierce surprise attack on the Kunming Airfield on the afternoon of December 22, sweeping away the stubborn obstruction of about 40 Chongqing fighters. Bombing Chongqing planes on the ground resulted in the following confirmed results: 26 fighters shot down (8 unconfirmed), 6 large planes destroyed, and 8 small planes destroyed, totaling 40 planes. Four of our planes were self-destroyed or did not return to base.

A certain base on the China front, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to the Japanese Army Air Corps, they attacked Kunming, Yunnan, the Chongqing military base, on the 18th and 19th, and then launched a third strong attack on the Kunming airfield, the largest stronghold in the southwestern region of Chongqing, on the afternoon of the 22nd. It seemed that the Chongqing side had already detected the Japanese planes' attack, so when the planes arrived over Kunming that day, about 40 fighters, such as Chongqing's P49, P150, and P38 types, were already engaged in combat. The Japanese planes immediately engaged them in aerial combat. As a result, 26 of them were shot down, and the Chongqing planes parked on the ground were fiercely bombed, including six large ones and eight small ones, which were set on fire. In this battle, a total of 40 enemy planes were shot down and destroyed. The American air force stationed in Chongqing had previously incorporated the Chongqing air force into its own, so about half of those shot down this time were old-fashioned planes of the Chongqing air force. According to reports, Chongqing has about 300 to 400 aircraft on the front line, but 84 were lost in the Changde campaign. When Japanese planes attacked Kunming, Yunnan, on the 18th and 19th, another 32 were shot down and destroyed by Japanese planes. Now another 40 have been destroyed by Japanese planes. Therefore, in the short period since the beginning of November, Chongqing has lost most of its front-line aircraft. Furthermore, in the battle on the 22nd, the Chongqing side had fighters in the air on alert 20 minutes before the Japanese planes arrived over Kunming, waiting to intercept the Japanese planes, but the Japanese planes finally broke through their alert line and dared to launch a strong attack, achieving great results, which proves the superiority of the Japanese planes' combat spirit and combat technology.

### War Results of Japanese Army in Hunan-Hubei Operations

Hankou, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from a certain base on the Central China front, the Japanese army has captured a large amount of war booty in the Hunan-Hubei operations. It is said that in the battle to capture Changde, 10,000 several thousand people, including the commander of Chongqing's 57th Division, were annihilated. In this battle, countless mountain artillery pieces, mortars, and light and heavy machine guns were captured. In addition, in an attack south of Changde, the Japanese army crushed the Chongqing army's 3rd Far Expeditionary Army, which was reinforcing Changde, and again captured a large amount of war booty. A portion of this, totaling dozens of ships, arrived in a certain place on the 21st. After being unloaded, it piled up like a mountain, causing the local residents to be stunned, which proves the greatness of the war results obtained by the Japanese army this time.

### Power of Japanese Army on Yuan River Front

Hankou, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from a certain base on the Central China front, the activities of the Japanese Army Air Force were extremely significant in this operation. All fronts were under the Japanese air superiority. When the battle to capture the Yuan River defense line gradually intensified, the US Air Force cooperated with the Chongqing army and gradually entered the Japanese medical preparation network, launching guerrilla-style activities. However, after the Japanese planes repeatedly bombed their bases and launched air battles over the battlefield, the US Air Force was frightened, so the Japanese army units were invincible with the cooperation of the Japanese Air Force. Currently, the enemy army is extremely afraid of the Japanese army's attacks. When Japanese planes appear over the battlefield, enemy planes immediately flee at the sight of them. In particular, the battle to capture the Yuan River Fortress Line and the annihilation battle near Changde for the first time demonstrated the power of the integration of land and air forces. Later, on the western front, the airborne troops cooperated to suppress the enemy forces surrounded by the Japanese army in the Basha Mountain range, bombing and defeating them.

### Youth Corps Launches Anti-Drug Movement

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - This time, the students of universities and middle schools in the capital, in light of the fact that some unrepentant people in the country are still indulging in sensual pleasures and drug dens under this total war system, spurred by a sense of justice, have automatically launched an anti-drug movement, carrying out righteous appeals with disciplined actions. Since the launch of this movement, it has won the unanimous sympathy of all sectors of the public. At the same time, students from all over the country have also risen up in response, launching anti-smoking, gambling, and dancing propaganda, with an exciting and enthusiastic atmosphere. The General Headquarters of the China Youth Corps and the local provincial and municipal corps headquarters believe that this student-initiated persuasion movement is very meaningful and are actively guiding it, ensuring that this movement unfolds concrete anti-drug work in compliance with government laws and regulations and in obedience to group discipline.

### Price Assessment Council Holds Emergency Meeting Yesterday, All Industries Must Sell at Originally Set Price Limits

Central News Agency Report - The Shanghai Special Municipal Government recently found that commodity prices in the city were soaring. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the retail prices of various businesses and shops had long been legally restricted. Unexpectedly, recently, the general merchants and people have disobeyed the law and secretly raised the price limits without authorization. If this situation is not promptly curbed, it will have a significant impact on people's livelihoods and public security. To suppress and stabilize prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government specially ordered the Shanghai Special Municipal Price Assessment Committee to convene a temporary emergency committee meeting in the Municipal Economic Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 23rd) to discuss overall countermeasures to suppress and stabilize prices. The members attending the meeting included Municipal Government Representative Pan Da, First Police Bureau Deputy Director Su Chengde (represented by Section Chief Zhang), First District Economic Section Chief Feng You, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Yuan Ludeng, Business Unification Association Representative Yu Langxi, Municipal Food Bureau Director Ji Hua (represented by Section Chief Wang), Commodity Inspection Bureau Director Mai Jingming, and Central Market Director Tao Wenzhai. The meeting was chaired by the Municipal Economic Bureau Director Xu Tianshen, who reported on the recent rise in prices. Various committee representatives exchanged discussions on countermeasures to suppress and stabilize prices. The result was a decision to emphasize enforcement action in this effort to suppress and stabilize prices. The retail prices of various businesses and shops must comply with the originally set price limits. If there are any violations of the law or exceed the price limits, they will be severely punished once discovered. At the same time, it was decided to continue to convene a small group meeting this afternoon (the 24th) to discuss and study detailed rules for suppressing and stabilizing prices. As soon as the steps are determined, strict measures to suppress and stabilize prices will be implemented. It is reported that the small group meeting designated the Business Unification Association, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and representatives from the Central Market to be responsible for holding it.

### Winter Vacation Approaches, Fundraising for Scholarships, Sixth Session Begins Preparation, Hoping Readers Will Donate and Give Guidance

Ms. Gu Ying Suggests a Christmas Charity Dance

The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship has been held for five sessions, and thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of old friends, many impoverished students have been able to continue their studies. The staff of this newspaper are deeply pleased to be able to participate in this meaningful work. Now that winter vacation is approaching again, preparations for the sixth scholarship session will begin immediately. The staff are very willing to continue their efforts to enhance this communication work, deeply hoping that readers will continue to display the highest compassion and donate generously. However, as prices are currently rising, the expenses for this session will be even greater than the previous session. The staff hopes that all old students who received assistance in the previous session will continue to receive assistance and that new students will be added. Therefore, the burden on readers will inevitably increase, and expectations of readers' enthusiasm are even more profound. At the beginning of this preparation and launch, we happened to receive a letter from Ms. Gu Ying, advocating a "Christmas Charity Dance to Help Scholarships." Ms. Gu Ying is now a Shen Bao reader, but in the past, she was a student who received a scholarship. It is commendable to remember the source of the water. There are no boundaries to professions, but sobriety in drunkenness is most valued. We hope that the dancers will respond enthusiastically and promote this extremely meaningful work. The following is a transcript of Ms. Gu Ying's letter: "I am a dancer who is looked down upon by society. I am forced by life to support a family of eight, so I use my waist and feet to earn a living. I used to be a student who received a scholarship and worked as a Girl Scout. Time flies, and another Christmas season has arrived. I want to launch an individual "Christmas Charity Dance." I will hold a tea dance at the Great Eastern Dance Hall from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Christmas Eve. Half of the dance money earned during the day and night will be used for the Shen Bao Scholarship. I want to throw a brick to attract jade, hoping that all the red sisters in the dance world will sympathize with me and participate in this extremely meaningful and valuable event. Please do your best to help me, so that my small good intentions can create a big good deed. Respectfully, Gu Ying, a dancer."

### Guangtian, Head of Intelligence, Analyzes European and American Situation, Dissects Base Thoughts of Britain and America

Central News Agency Dispatch: Regarding South African Federal Prime Minister Smuts' speech on "New Europe Theory" delivered at the British branch of the British Empire Parliamentary Association, advocating that a trinity of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union be formed after the war, Guangtian, head of the Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy's intelligence department, gave a speech at the regular press conference yesterday (23rd) afternoon at 3 p.m., analyzing the European and American situation. Details are as follows:

Base Thoughts of Britain and America

Head Guangtian first said: Regarding the content of Smuts' New Europe Theory, it is enough to see the base thoughts of Britain and America. Guangtian then analyzed Smuts' New Europe Theory, stating that after the anti-Axis powers defeat the Axis, the world's sphere of influence can be divided into communism centered on the Soviet Union and capitalism centered on Britain and America. Thus, the world situation will be based on these two ideologies as the scope, and righteous countries will disappear, and there will be no independent countries. This idea is not only present in Britain alone, but also in many anti-Axis countries around the world. American Walter Lippmann has also made similar remarks, and US Vice President Wallace also has the same idea, saying that after the end of World War II, a third world war will inevitably occur, its target being the conflict arising from friction between communism centered on the Soviet Union and capitalism centered on Britain and America. Observing Vice President Wallace's remarks, there is no democracy, and the existence of small countries is denied. Smuts' New Europe Theory states that after World War II, the situation will be the same, with no intention of recognizing the existence of small countries, and no intention of hoping for the independence of any country. This is what Britain and America seek. Therefore, everyone should pay special attention to the trinity claim made by Smuts in his New Europe Theory, namely Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. From the perspective of the world war situation, if Britain loses in World War II, it will be completely destroyed. Even if it wins, it will be absorbed by the United States. Thus is Britain's fate. According to Smuts, who is British, the crux of Britain is specifically emphasized in the essay. The so-called trinity of nations means that after this world war, Britain will not be able to exist. Even if it is possible to establish, it will be a binary, the existence of the United States and the Soviet Union. Guangtian then made a detailed analysis of the existence and trends of the United States after the war.

American Economic Exploitation

Regarding the post-war trends of the United States, we can observe specific facts. The change that occurred in Bolivia, South America, on the 20th of this month is enough to prove the situation in the United States. The Bolivian National Military and progressive elements expressed dissatisfaction with the government and used force to overthrow the government and establish a new government. According to the published platform, in order to awaken the attention of the world's people, Bolivia's domestic resources should be expanded, and Bolivia's people's livelihood should be enriched and utilized. Therefore, what we should pay special attention to is that according to Bolivia's domestic economic strength, the platform published in Bolivia has already declared its determination to eliminate American economic exploitation. Originally, the current industries are tin, copper, and tungsten minerals, and the country is based on mineral production. However, Bolivia's mineral production has always been developed by American capital, especially since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, when the United States lost the Malayan tin market and could only rely on Bolivia's tin mines, American economic exploitation became even more severe. The second point to note is that the policy announced by the new Bolivian government declared that its foreign policy had not changed, especially its relationship with the United States. In this situation, there is no lack of contradiction. An examination of the relationship between the United States and South America shows that the United States has always held a hegemonic advantage in political and economic terms, and boasted that South America and other countries cannot separate from the United States or oppose the United States. However, in reality, South American countries do not want to be exploited and oppressed by the United States. Anti-American sentiment is quite prevalent among the people of South America, and they often attempt to break away from the United States and seek independence. The intensity of this ideological movement has recently begun to unfold.

Intense Anti-American Sentiment

Then, examples of anti-American facts among the people of South America were given as follows: During the summer of this year, US Vice President Wallace traveled to South America and encountered many unexpected instances of dissatisfaction while giving speeches in various public relations events. At that time, South American people shouted slogans such as "Down with Dollar Diplomacy," and Wallace had no choice but to return unhappily. Thus, the anti-American sentiment of the South American people can be seen to be increasingly intense. The South American countries known for being anti-American are Argentina first, followed by Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, and Chile. Argentina has maintained neutrality until now. Secondly, although on the surface it is involved in the anti-Axis side, its anti-American sentiment is quite intense. The other South American countries are largely the same. Currently, the war situation is protracted, so American economic exploitation of South America is becoming increasingly severe, and American aid to South America is gradually shrinking. Therefore, the desire of South American countries to break away from the United States is increasing day by day. This is what I can assert. This kind of fact is not only prevalent in Central and South American countries, but anti-imperialism is also intense in countries such as Iraq and India. Therefore, Smuts' New Europe Theory, which advocates reducing small countries, and the American dream of controlling the world will be opposed by countries around the world and will ultimately fail. This fact is something we can observe. In addition, the United States' contempt for the countries of Greater East Asia and the desire of Britain and America to control Greater East Asia will be shattered by Japan's use of force, until their dreams fail.

### Commendation of 100,000 Yuan for Police Officer Luo Junqiang, Who Died in the Gong Wutai Incident, and 310,000 Yuan from Zhang Shankun

Central News Agency Dispatch: Regarding the incident in which police officers died near Gong Wutai in the Eighth District on the 19th of this month, it is now known that Luo Junqiang, concurrently Education Director of the Central Police School, believes that regardless of who is to blame for this conflict, he is deeply saddened by the unity of all involved. After the incident, he, together with Neng Jiandong, Deputy Commander of the Tax Police Corps, repeatedly contacted Mayor Chen and Deputy Director Su of the First Police Bureau, openly and honestly discussing everything. Yesterday, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Tax Police Corps, he donated 100,000 national currency to the families of the deceased police officers. It is also reported that Education Director Luo, together with Deputy Director Su, went to Guangci Hospital and Renji Hospital yesterday morning to express condolences to the injured. Furthermore, Zhang Shankun, the owner of Gong Wutai, expressed deep regret for the incident, which was caused by his stage, and donated 310,000 national currency to the families of the deceased police officers, sending the letter to the funeral committee for forwarding.

Economic Commentary

### After the New Price Limit on Coal Balls

Recently, prices of all goods in this city have been soaring, with the situation for fuel being the most serious, causing residents throughout the city to feel that the future is bleak. Now, the economic authorities in this city have adjusted the price limit for coal balls, with the price delivered to users being 1,260 national currency per ton. All coal ball compositions must use a coal seam of 50% as the standard. In this way, coal balls will now have an officially set price and quality standard. However, historical facts tell us that setting an official price is one thing, whether or not it is difficult to purchase is another, and whether or not the quality meets the standard is another. Due to the second and third points, especially the second point, problems arise, making the price limit equivalent to a mere formality, and the black market becomes rampant as a result. Since the black market has become the only source of daily fuel, there is even more hoarding behavior of having materials but not producing, having goods but not selling, so it is no wonder that the result is so dire.

What we hope for after the new price limit on coal balls is: In terms of implementing rationing, all coal ball merchants throughout the city must be ordered to only sell at the new price limit and are not allowed to engage in any illegal transactions at the same time. In that case, coal ball prices can naturally be included in the scope of the official price. In terms of unblocking sources, it is necessary to actively engage in increasing the production of coal mines in various regions at the same time, such as the Mantou Mountain Coal Mine Company recently mentioned by the Ministry of Industry when receiving Chinese and foreign reporters. After January of next year, 100 to 150 tons of coal can be produced daily. The Anhui Lieshan Coal Mine Company and the Xinjiang Changxing Coal Mine Company have rich reserves and have now prepared development plans to prepare for implementation. This is the basic work to solve the fuel panic.

### Strengthen Control of Hemp, Formulate Movement Measures

The government considers hemp and its products to be important materials that are closely related to military needs and people's livelihood. In order to strengthen control, it has established a Joint Association of the Hemp Industry and, in accordance with Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations for the Prohibition of Wartime Materials Movement, it has formulated temporary measures to prohibit the movement of hemp and hemp products in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai.

### 118 New Banks in Five Years

The financial industry in Shanghai has been abnormally prosperous in recent years, with new financial institutions springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain. In order to stabilize finance and prevent illegal merchants from disrupting finance, the National Government's Ministry of Finance recently announced measures to implement management. Since then, the organizations of financial institutions in this city have become increasingly sound. According to a reporter's investigation, the Shanghai Special City Banking Association currently has a total of 170 member banks, including 52 commercial savings banks, 34 banks self-established by various industries, and 84 ordinary banks that accept deposits and make loans. From before the incident to 1938, there were 52 old banks, and 118 new ones have been established in the past five years.

### Business Certificates in the Eighth District, Apply for Processing

The Economic Office of the Eighth District Public Office has been implementing registration of various industries and commerce and issuing business certificates since January 1, 1944. At the same time, the classification business license method stipulated by the former French Concession Public Works Bureau was abolished. It is now known that the application form is issued separately by the Economic Office, which sends staff to each household to verify the number. After receiving the application form, the applicant must fill it out clearly within the specified date (the deadline is printed on the application form), and bring the old certificate to the Economic Office of the Eighth District Public Office at No. 80 Madang Road to cancel the old certificate and process the application, so as to avoid crowding.

### Cotton Fluff Industry Association, Discussing Raw Material Issues

There are approximately 350 cotton fluff businesses in the city. The new price limit has been approved by the Economic Office of the First District Public Office and has been implemented since the 15th of this month. Yesterday it was learned that the raw materials required by the industry every day cannot be allocated and are purchased on the black market, resulting in a sharp increase in costs. The industry association, in view of the fact that the severe winter has arrived and the citizens need goods frequently, and that if operations are suspended due to the lack of raw materials, it will inevitably cause unrest among the citizens, has decided to convene an emergency meeting of the standing directors at the club on Gekelu Road at 3:00 p.m. today to discuss countermeasures.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Call Loan Rate: Yesterday morning, the bankers' association's call loan rate was 2.2 fen, an increase of 2 fen. The money supply continues to tighten.

Grain: Yesterday was slightly stable, probably because prices were high, and buyers have gradually declined. It is also reported that the relevant authorities will try their best to prevent excessive price increases, so sellers were more willing to sell. The price of early japonica rice all fell slightly, and oil grains also decreased slightly.

Rayon: Yesterday, the upward trend stopped, and the market turned negative, mainly due to the tightening money supply, and some small investors sold. The price gradually declined. The last price of 120-count rayon at Tianqiao was 69.5, a slight decrease compared to before.

Industrial Raw Materials: Yesterday, there was still hope for price increases, but trading was not active. The selling price of white wax was 21,000, and vaseline was 13,000. The prices of pine resin and spindle oil were similar to before, both around 40,000.

### Brief News

The buildings were sturdy, the style was elegant, and each house had sanitary facilities. The purchase price was quite low.

### Stock Exchange Closed in the Afternoon, Chinese Stocks Hovered

By around 11:00, the selling pressure eased, and prices became more stable. The market paused for a few minutes at 11:50. A temporary meeting was held, and it was decided that because tomorrow is a holiday for money changers, the market would be closed in the afternoon to facilitate trading.

### A Hospital on Luoyang Road, Shanghai Nanyang Hospital Visit

Benevolence, Skill, and Good Deeds

The medical business is a social undertaking, with saving lives as the highest goal. Although it is not as ideal as it could be in today's society, every true doctor, nurse, and medical entrepreneur must use benevolence and skill to save the public as their most sublime ideal, and must not haggle over monetary rewards or business profits. Here, Doctor Gu mentioned a recent news story about the hospital. He said that one month ago, one night, an emergency patient named Zhang Longwen was sent in. After diagnosis by the resident chief physician, it was determined that he had TB-related enteritis, an obstruction, as well as lung disease and tuberculous peritonitis. In reality, the patient was too poor and kept delaying treatment, which caused him to fall into such a serious state. Only then did he scrape together some money and come to the hospital for treatment. Although the disease was not completely hopeless, treatment was very difficult and he would definitely need to be hospitalized. However, the patient did not have sufficient means. What about relief? Where is this kind of funding in this era? Hospitalization and treatment for this kind of disease would easily cost ten thousand or even tens of thousands of yuan! However, if he was rejected, wouldn't that be the same as rejecting his last chance of survival? Moreover, after investigation, this Mr. Zhang had a glorious history. He had fallen from the upper class to his present poverty for the sake of the nation and society! Moreover, he was only in his thirties and had a great future. From the perspective of justice and human sentiment, how could we sit idly by and watch such a person who was poor for the nation and society die without lending a hand? From the perspective of the country and society, we must give him full assistance. Therefore, the authorities of Nanyang Hospital decided to first save him from danger, regardless of his ability to pay. If the third-class ward was full, he would be sent to the second-class ward. If the second-class ward was also full, he would be sent to the first-class ward. Major and minor surgeries were performed to remove the diseased intestine and treat the other attached illnesses. After more than a month, his life was finally saved, and he could move freely. Medical, surgical, ward, and food expenses were not counted, and the cost of special drugs alone was more than ten thousand yuan! However, since the patient was indeed unable to pay, no guarantee was required, and he was allowed to return with joy, waiting to do more beneficial things for the country and society in the future.

Of course, helping the poor and sick is the duty of hospitals and doctors. However, due to the limited resources of private hospitals, some consideration must be given to the scope of assistance. Doctor Gu talked about their attitude towards poor patients. First, all patients who come to the hospital for treatment, regardless of their poverty or not, are treated equally in terms of diagnosis, medication, and all necessary treatment procedures. However, if the medication is too expensive, some of the cost must still be recovered.

Mr. Fang's story of the three brave human bombs was not about the Shanghai Incident.

"What I want to talk about are the three brave human bombs from 334 years ago. That is, the events of October of the third year of the Keicho era..."

The students' mouths, which had already been opened, were stunned and could not be closed for a moment. It was as if they thought they were going to have candy, but instead they got some dry snacks.

"You all know about Toyotomi Hideyoshi's expedition to Korea, right? Such a large-scale expedition to the continent was the first time before the Meiji era—130,000 troops. The magnificence of the Taiko can be imagined. This war, although said to be an expedition to Korea, was actually against the Ming Dynasty. Since ancient times, wars have always had people working behind the scenes. The current incident is also like this. What is most hateful are these things that are supporting them from behind..."

Although he was an English teacher, Mr. Ogata was a true local, a very generous person. However, he was an amateur when it came to debate, and the more intense his emotions, the more unsystematic his remarks became...

"The 130,000 Japanese troops soon swept through the eight provinces of Gyeongsang-do. In this battle, the soldiers of our Saga Domain also participated. The 17th lord of the domain, Yoshihiro, stood independently at the front and engaged in battles like a god of war. It seems the world only says that Kato Kiyomasa was the one fighting, but that's just what storytellers and opera singers have created. How brave our Nabeshima troops were is clearly recorded in the enemy's documents. If there wasn't one Ishizaki, none of the pirates could have survived, the Ming people recorded. Ishizaki was Lord Utatsu's nickname.

Yoshihiro trampled over the Jeolla and Gyeongsang provinces and formed a base in Sacheon. The Taiko ordered the construction of a castle there to be used as an advance base. This is the so-called Sacheon Castle. The Ming Dynasty's 200,000 troops attacked there. At that time, Yoshihiro only had 5,000 loyal subordinates—one-fortieth of the strength—to resist the Ming army alone. This alone shows how incomparably brave the Saga soldiers were."

Local pride had already become commonplace in Saga, so the teacher who spoke and the students who listened did not find it strange.

"The Ming army, advancing like clouds, saw that the Shimazu line of defense was tight, and loaded gunpowder under the castle, thinking of burning the castle in one fell swoop. Gunpowder was already being used at that time. Not only that, but in the Tenbun era, wars using guns had already begun in Tanegashima.

As a result, our army really had no way to go. If it was a charging battle, we would still have confidence, but in front of gunpowder, swordsmanship was useless. While all the soldiers were gritting their teeth in hatred, a loud explosion suddenly came from behind the enemy camp's fortifications. For some reason, the gunpowder magazine, which the enemy relied on for their lives, caught fire. This time, it was the opposite, the enemy was being burned by the fire and was in chaos. Yoshihiro then announced the occurrence of the incident. The army, pouring out from the castle gates like a tide, killed every enemy they saw. The defeat suddenly turned into a victory!"

### New Year's Card Money, Change to Help Winter Clothing

The New Year is coming soon, and everyone is busy sending New Year's cards. The children in our class were also preparing to buy New Year's cards to send to our teachers. However, after the teacher explained to us the true meaning and waste of sending New Year's cards, and said that many compatriots are suffering from not having clothes to wear because of the cold weather, we were moved. Now, we are willing to donate this 140 yuan of money for buying New Year's cards to those poor children who have no left clothes to wear, in order to do our little bit of sympathy. All students of Grade 4, Minzhi Elementary School.
