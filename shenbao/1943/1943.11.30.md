### On the Development of the Japanese Newspaper Industry

— Chen Binhe

"The pen of justice and the sword of righteousness fight together for the motherland and East Asia!" This is the fundamental stance of the Japanese newspaper industry today.

Japanese journalists have been sacrificing and striving tirelessly for years, and they have been doing so in unified solidarity. For the sake of the progress of the newspaper industry, it is necessary for us to study Japan and learn from the Japanese newspaper industry.

The history of the Japanese newspaper industry is a mirror reflecting Japan's transition from the Meiji Restoration to its era of strength, and this mirror is forever inseparable from Japan's Restoration and its path to strength.

Japan's modern newspapers emerged as early as the second year of Bunkyu (1862), before the Meiji era. The first was the "Batavia Shimbun," a translation of Dutch newspapers from Java, published by the Western bookseller Binya Heishiro. As for original Japanese newspapers, the earliest included the "Daijokan Nisshi" (Kyoto), the initial official gazette of the Meiji government in February of the first year of Meiji (1868), and the "Chugai Shimbun" (Edo), sponsored by Bakufu retainer Yanagawa Shunsan and others. Consulting Japanese history from that time, it can be seen that Japanese newspapers were born when domestic unrest reached its peak and the Restoration movement was launched nationwide. From then on, the Japanese newspaper industry gradually struggled for Restoration and civilization under the common demand of the nation and its people. Among the most famous early newspapers were the "Yokohama Mainichi Shimbun," Japan's first daily newspaper, born in Yokohama in December of the third year of Meiji (the predecessor of the "Tokyo Mainichi"), the "Shimbun Zasshi," which emerged in May of the fifth year of Meiji, and the "Tokyo Nichinichi," "Nisshin Shinji-shi," and "Yubin Hochi" which also emerged in the fifth year of Meiji. These five newspapers were known as the five major newspapers of early Japan. Initially, they all had the character of newspapers serving the government, until later, due to the debate over the invasion of Korea, national opinion split, and Councillors Saigo Takamori, Itagaki Taisuke, and others jointly resigned, joining forces with the press to urge the government. The newspapers then developed abnormally, leading to the so-called "era of speech terror." By the time of the political upheaval in the fourteenth year of Meiji, except for the "Jiji Shinpo," most Japanese newspapers had become organs of various large and small political parties. For example, the "Choya Shimbun," "Jiyu Shimbun," and "Rikken Seito Shimbun" belonged to the Liberal Party faction, the "Yubin Hochi Shimbun" and "Tokyo Yokohama Mainichi Shimbun" belonged to the Progressive Party faction, and the "Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun," "Meiji Nippo," "Toyo Shinpo," and "Daito Nippo" belonged to the Imperial Party faction. Later, when internal disagreements arose within each party, they even issued their own "small newspapers" as their mouthpieces, a situation that also occurred in our country in the early years of the Republic of China. However, it can also be seen that Japanese newspapers in their early stages grew up in an environment of struggle. After the promulgation of the Japanese Constitution, each newspaper did not relax its responsibility in the slightest, not fearing power, not being tempted by profit, acting as a mouthpiece for the people, offering advice to the government, and the government absolutely respected the position of public opinion. Therefore, the Japanese newspaper industry developed rapidly. In the past twenty years or so, the following trends have been proven: first, nationalism and democracy, and the respect for freedom of speech, have become the traditions of the Tokyo press. Every newspaper fights for its political views, although the views may differ, they all consider the welfare of the people as the top priority, and are therefore deeply respected by the government and the public; second, the spirit of non-profit, whether government-run or privately-run, they all strive to run newspapers for the benefit of the country and the people, and not for profit.

Statement Released

This month, the 30th, marks the first month after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and also the third anniversary of the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. It is extremely significant that Chairman Wang personally came to Shanghai at this time to inspect public sentiment and give instructions to the youth. Before returning to the capital, the Chairman released a statement, which is respectfully recorded below: "After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty on the 30th of last month, I issued a document explaining the process from the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations to the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. I also solemnly instructed everyone on the efforts that should be made in the future. Yesterday, I gave a speech to the Shanghai youth, reiterating this point. In short, we should be responsible for the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in the current era, and increase our ability to bear the burdens so as to achieve its implementation. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty stipulates the highest principles of mutual respect for independence and autonomy between the two countries, and the pursuit of coexistence and co-prosperity, which is a crystallization of the spirit of Eastern morality, and differs from the Western utilitarian concept of calculating gains and losses and weighing rights and obligations. Just as within a family, fathers, sons, brothers, and husbands each do their best to manage the family affairs in an orderly manner and to prosper the family business, with a spirit of love and affection between countries, each does what is proper, without regard to the superiority or inferiority of knowledge, or the length or shortness of talent and strength, and there is no reward to speak of. Greater East Asia is like a family, and China and Japan are both in this family, sharing weal and woe, and living and dying together, which is extremely natural and extremely proper. Only by being close to each other can we believe in each other, and only by believing in each other can we be close to each other. The spirit of morality is not empty talk, but practice. We must deeply understand this meaning, practice it with our bodies, and then we can understand the true meaning of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty." "As for the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, it is the basis for harmonious relations between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, the cornerstone for establishing an axis on the East Asian continent, and the basis for the unity and cooperation of various countries in Greater East Asia. Now, we have further advanced with the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and our spiritual will is completely the same. The basic principles of mutual dependence, mutual assistance, coexistence, and co-prosperity among the countries of East Asia have become even clearer, and the scope of the co-prosperity sphere has been further expanded. From now on, we should, on the one hand, base ourselves on the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, and on the other hand, adhere to the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, to seek the strengthening of the East Asian axis, to plan for the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and the realization of the construction of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is also what we should deeply understand, embody, and strive to practice today regarding the meaning of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration."

### Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration Commemorates its Third Anniversary Today – Officials from the Three Countries Issue Statements

Foreign Minister Chu

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Today (the 30th) is the third anniversary of the issuance of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. Foreign Minister Chu of the National Government has issued the following statement: On November 30th, the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration was issued, and from then on, the axis of East Asia was established, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere rapidly unfolded. Today, as we commemorate the third anniversary of the Joint Declaration, our sincere excitement cannot be fully expressed in words.

The East Asian nations were originally a single entity, and China, Japan, and Manchukuo are the backbone of the East Asian nations. Every East Asian nation bears the mission of leading East Asia to prosperity. China, Japan, and Manchukuo must be sincerely united, constantly encourage each other, and strive to be worthy of this great mission. The Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration states that the three countries hope to respect each other's inherent characteristics, to cooperate closely under the common ideal of building a new order in East Asia based on morality, and to form an axis of permanent peace in East Asia. It also hopes to use this as a core to contribute to the peace of the entire world. This is a principle that is as natural and righteous as the laws of heaven and earth, and will not perish for ten thousand generations. The path that China, Japan, and Manchukuo should take has been clearly shown here.

The revival of East Asia can only be achieved through the close cooperation and industrious construction of the East Asian nations. At the same time, the aggression of Britain and the United States must be eliminated. For centuries, Britain and the United States have wantonly invaded East Asia. The reason why our East Asian nations have not been able to unite closely in the past to strive for construction is due to the instigation and aggression of Britain and the United States. Fortunately, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia have been eliminated, and the nations of Greater East Asia have been able to advance towards the path of building a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the glory of victory in the Greater East Asia War.

Our ally Japan has been enthusiastically supporting the countries and nations of East Asia. After our country joined the war on January 9th of this year, our ally Japan immediately implemented a new policy towards China, and our country was able to recover the concessions, abolish extraterritorial rights, and achieve the independence and autonomy that it had long desired. Recently, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was concluded, becoming one of the most glorious pages in the history of Sino-Japanese diplomacy. Furthermore, Burma and the Philippines have already become independent, and India has also established a provisional government. Most recently, China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, the Philippines, and Burma held the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo, and issued the Greater East Asia Declaration, establishing a grand plan for the construction of Greater East Asia that has never been seen in history, and setting a standard for the future for ten thousand years.

When we look back at the glorious development of Greater East Asia over the past three years, it is closely and inextricably linked to the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. In the future, the completion of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere still depends on the joint efforts of the war capabilities of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, the axis of East Asia. This is what we should strive to do all the more, in addition to being deeply gratified by commemorating the three-nation Joint Declaration today.

Ambassador Tani

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Ambassador Tani of Japan to China, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the issuance of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration on the 30th, issued a statement on the 29th, saying that the significance of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration is extremely profound. China, Japan, and Manchukuo have, by means of this declaration, made it clear that they respect each other's sovereignty and territory, and maintain friendly relations based on the spirit of equality and mutual benefit. At the same time, the Republic of China recognizes Manchukuo, and the relations between China and Manchukuo are thus established. Most recently, with the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the foundation for building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been completely established. The Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration is a major cornerstone for the construction of Greater East Asia. In addition, the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations, which was concluded at the same time as the issuance of this declaration by China and Japan, has now been cancelled due to the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. However, this declaration remains valid. The Greater East Asia War is now becoming more and more intense, and China, Japan, and Manchukuo are relying on each other and helping each other in order to strive for the completion of this war, which has given the world a new understanding of the meaning and mission of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration.

Ambassador Lu

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Three years have passed since China, Japan, and Manchukuo jointly issued a declaration. Ambassador Lu Ronghuan of Manchukuo to China has issued the following statement of feelings:

Over the past three years, although our East Asia has encountered earth-shattering changes, we have always maintained a strong attitude, carried through to the end, put into practice our common ideals, and achieved great results. The Greater East Asia Declaration, which was announced previously in Tokyo, is sufficient to prove a major advancement of this common ideal. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration has enabled China, Manchukuo, and the nations of Greater East Asia to restore their original posture, and has also become the first declaration to establish the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and is truly a declaration of epoch-making importance in the diplomatic history of East Asia.

At this time, we welcome this commemorative day with profound significance, and cannot help but feel boundless emotion. At present, the situation in East Asia is such that, due to the loyal and courageous fighting of the Japanese army and navy, and the promotion of majestic political power, all the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia have been eliminated, and a system of certain victory and invincibility has been established.

### Minister Lin's Speech Commemorates the Third Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – This month, the 30th, marks the first month after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and also the third anniversary of the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department has issued the following statement:

This month, the 30th, marks the first month after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and also the third anniversary of the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. In another week, the most glorious second year of the Greater East Asia War will begin. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration are not only developments that mark an era in Sino-Japanese relations, but also in the history of East Asia and the history of the world. In his instructions and speech to the youth groups of various universities and high schools in Shanghai, the Chairman has given clear instructions. When we look back at the progress of the current situation, we should know that without the establishment of the Basic Treaty of Relations three years ago, the efforts of both China and Japan over the past three years, and their joint cooperation, could not have been started. Without the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, the foundation of the East Asian axis could not have been established. Without the Greater East Asia War, the evil forces that have been invading East Asia for a century could not have been eliminated, and the opportunity for East Asian nations to achieve independence and autonomy could not have been obtained. Without the Alliance Treaty and the Joint Declaration, the new era in which East Asian countries support each other, help each other, coexist, and co-prosper could not have been marked with a milestone.

Looking at the overall situation, militarily, our side has already established a foundation of certain victory and invincibility, which need not be discussed in detail. Even in terms of political strategy, the three-power conference or four-power conference of the British, American, and Soviet sides is nothing more than competing for their conflicting interests in the "re-division of the world." Due to economic contradictions, political disagreements arise, which then affect strategic imbalances. Even if their so-called "balance of power" policy achieves temporary "equilibrium," any division plan of the re-division of the world by the aggressors will never be accepted by nations seeking self-preservation and coexistence, and especially not by our East Asian nations.

Since the issuance of the Alliance Treaty and the Joint Declaration, the national public's understanding of the future of the country and East Asia has certainly been renewed, but how to grasp the development of this current situation and promote the future depends on the people of the whole country, especially the youth public, working together with all their might to overcome difficulties together.

The Chairman has announced to us: "The direction of light has gone from hesitant and distant to firm, from vague to clear." Before today, in the process of full of wounds, we relied on comrades and compatriots to deeply reflect and raise a deep sense of responsibility in order to overcome difficulties and make progress. After today, as the bright future approaches, we should firmly believe in promoting peace and unity, and strive for a decisive victory, with deeper reflection and greater responsibility. We do not need to ask how difficult the path is. We only need to ask how hard we have worked, and how much progress we have made through our efforts. If we work hard, we will definitely make progress! If we make progress, we should work even harder. This was the case in the past, and it should be even more so in the future. The Chairman's poem says: "Mountains and rivers are beautiful again, not without a plan, and a common loyalty will not let the heart be disheartened." Let my young people and my compatriots think deeply about this.

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to front-line news, Major General Smith, commander of the US Second Marine Division, recently discussed the valiant fighting of the Japanese army in the Gilbert Islands, saying that the Japanese army's heroic resistance in the Gilbert Islands, was unprecedented, was truly rare. The number of American deaths was enormous, and we were only able to secure a bridgehead. Such a battle is truly something that I have never seen in my life. The major general has participated in jungle warfare in the Pacific before, and his words are sincere.

Japanese Soldiers Brave and Valiant American Officers Amazed

Argentine Journalist

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – In order to cover up its repeated defeats on Bougainville Island, the US military has launched an amphibious operation from the Gilbert Islands, using all its naval and air power. However, the Japanese garrison is brave and skilled in combat, which makes the American people feel the difficulty of fighting against Japan. Lieutenant Colonel James Roosevelt, son of President Roosevelt, recently returned to Hawaii from the Makin front. On the 27th, he met with a group of reporters and spoke of the Japanese soldiers' fighting spirit, saying that when the Japanese soldiers on Makin Island saw that they were outnumbered, four officers, dressed in formal military uniforms and wearing medals, led hundreds of soldiers to attack the American positions, fighting to the last man. Their spirit is truly admirable. Lieutenant Colonel Carlson, who also participated in the Guadalcanal campaign, also praised the Japanese soldiers' courage on the 27th, saying: I participated in the Guadalcanal campaign, and was shocked by the fierce fighting, but compared to the landing operation on Tarawa Island, it pales in comparison. The Japanese Marine Corps held Tarawa Island, which is only two and a half miles long and eight hundred yards wide, and resisted heroically to the end. Although they were outnumbered, the seriously wounded soldiers all died heroically, and the remaining soldiers still held their ground. When the American Navy landed one battalion on the north side of the main island of the Tarawa Island atoll, the Japanese army was not alarmed, but calmly responded to the battle, without any sign of surrender or retreat.

### US Army Suffers Heavy Casualties in Landing on Betio Island German Newspapers Praise Japanese Navy's Achievements

Argentine Journalist

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – The US military suffered heavy casualties when it launched a landing operation on Betio Island (the main island surrounding Tarawa Island). Major General Smith, commander of the US Second Marine Division, called this battle an unprecedented fierce battle. According to news from the front lines from American special correspondents: Mines were laid all over Betio Island, and barbed wire crisscrossed everywhere. Machine guns were densely lined up on the coast like serrated teeth. When the navy approached the coast, bullets rained down. In addition, the Japanese army hid in boats parked in the lagoon and fired from behind. It was difficult for the US fleet to concentrate artillery fire from the sea to launch a fierce attack, but the Japanese army held its ground, using machine guns and mortars to counterattack, causing heavy casualties to the American troops who gradually landed after crossing the lagoon. Furthermore, according to a report on the 29th by Mr. Johnstone, who represented various American newspapers and news agencies to participate in this American landing operation: It was truly an unusual miracle that the US military was able to land on Tarawa Island. Although the exact figures of the US military's losses have not yet been determined, this battle was truly an unprecedented bloody tragedy in American military history. The number of deaths is generally considered to be very large. Japanese machine gun nests are scattered all over the coast, one every five feet. In addition, large cannons are placed every twenty-five yards at locations five fortifications behind. Barbed wire surrounds the coast a few feet away. Up to now, bodies are still lying all over the place at the landing point of the US military, making passage extremely difficult. The Japanese army also fired fiercely with cannons with a caliber of seventy-seven millimeters, causing all the landing boats to be destroyed. The naval units then rushed towards the coast through the water, but were swept by Japanese machine guns. At this point, they had to crawl around the barbed wire while attacking. More than one hundred American naval soldiers died while cutting a section of barbed wire.

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced that the Japanese Navy had achieved great results in the Gilbert Islands. When the news came, the German people expressed their deep welcome. In addition to publishing the war results with large headlines, various evening newspapers praised the Japanese Navy's bravery.

A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 29th: Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry read out Minister Aoki's instructions at the Japanese diplomatic and consular conference in China, which opened on the 29th. The main points are as follows: The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty have already been concluded and announced by the relevant countries of Greater East Asia and by China and Japan. There is no need to elaborate on the content of these declarations and treaties. In order to realize these two major missions, it is not enough to simply announce the declarations and treaties. These two major missions can only be given their true value after concrete efforts are made to implement them. You are all the backbone of promoting national policy, and you should abandon petty personal interests, make concerted efforts from a broad perspective, and complete our mission. The current situation is entering a decisive phase, and our country is proceeding with our courageous and noble ideals in both political and military aspects, as well as in national policy. Most importantly, all working comrades should promote and encourage a sense of responsibility and make even greater efforts. In addition to working hard to implement concrete policies towards China, adjust established facts, abolish extraterritorial rights, and fulfill the established policies of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, working comrades should also cooperate with the National Government to strengthen its political power, or fully cooperate with China in various aspects such as production of food and commodity prices. At the same time, in order to expand the results of new policies towards China, the fundamental spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty should be given top priority. Without distinguishing between public and private matters, this spirit should be infused into the lives of overseas Chinese in China, so that Sino-Japanese cooperation can be steadily realized. In particular, the production increase movement to promote combat power through Sino-Japanese cooperation is most important, and I deeply hope that everyone will provide more cooperation to ensure thorough success.

### Instructions from Ambassador Tani

A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 29th: Japanese Ambassador to China Tani gave instructions at the diplomatic and consular conference on the morning of the 29th. The main points are as follows:

Two years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The war is becoming more and more intense, and our gains are also increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to unite the total national strength to meet the needs. Therefore, we must first reform the embassy structure to simplify affairs. This is the direction of gradual improvement in the future. The concept of total national strength arising from the center of humanity is most important. In order to win the war, everyone should understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War, rise up with a sense of mission and patriotic enthusiasm, and engage in [unclear].

Recalling the past war, our country's soldiers fought bravely and have gradually achieved their goals. At the same time, after the implementation of the new policies towards China, Sino-Japanese relations have made new leaps forward. With the conclusion of this alliance treaty between China and Japan, and then with the expression of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the meaning and mission of the Greater East Asia War are gradually being implemented. Regarding the issue of China's construction, the Japanese side should provide full cooperation, and I hope that everyone will work hard on this.

At the same time, because the actions of the residents are the actions of the Japanese nation, in view of the meaning and mission of the Greater East Asia War, the residents should not neglect their self-awareness. I hope that the residents will pay attention to self-love in the stage of implementing Japanese policy.

### The Bright Direction - Chairman Wang's Speech to Major Middle and Youth Groups in Shanghai

The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty signed on October 30th and the Greater East Asia Declaration expressed on November 6th are undoubtedly epoch-making facts. Now, I will explain the meaning of this:

Everyone is young. The young people in general are dissatisfied with the current situation of the country and society. Especially in this era of survival crisis, the mood of young people exceeds the word "dissatisfaction" by thousands of times.

Analysis of Dissatisfaction

Now, let's analyze these dissatisfied moods first. Let's remove the mood of dissatisfaction with the country and society due to the oppression of one's own life. Then, what remains is purely dissatisfaction with the current state of the country and society. This analysis is important. The former has selfish motives, while the latter is purely for the public good.

Then, let's analyze the dissatisfaction with the current state of the country and society. Let's first remove the [unclear] mood. Then, what remains is purely dissatisfaction arising from concern and love. This analysis is even more important. Contempt is fundamentally looking down on one's own country and society. As for being too sad and loving too deeply, and sighing and hating that one's own country and society are not as good as others, this is precisely loyalty to the country and society.

If there is a kind of dissatisfaction in the hearts of young people with their own country and society, and this dissatisfaction arises from public service and loyalty, then this dissatisfaction should be said to be needed by the country and society. Because of dissatisfaction, we seek progress. Because we seek progress, we are willing to work hard. If we identify a bright direction and move forward, we will be able to approach the light. The psychology of dissatisfaction is turned into a psychology of seeking progress. However, it is unknown when success will come, but progress is the process of success. Of course, there are many obstacles and many twists and turns in this process, but if the direction is not wrong, then in this process, every young person can endure difficulties, overcome difficulties, and continue to progress until success.

From this point of view, what young people need is a bright direction. With a bright direction, the mental strength of young people has a purpose. From dissatisfaction to hard work, from progress to success.

Where is the epoch-making significance that I just mentioned? In the past few decades, the so-called bright direction has gone from hesitation to firmness, from vagueness to clarity.

Why do I say this?

Direction Before and After the Founding of the Republic

Before the founding of the Republic, the direction that young people identified was ethnic [unclear]. At that time, young people in general were both pained by the perilous international situation, the partition of powers imminent, and pained by the corruption of the previous government. Due to this kind of dissatisfaction, they unknowingly focused their mental strength on ethnic [unclear]. Although some elements of civil rights and people's livelihood were also incorporated at that time, they were very thin, far less than the strong ethnic [unclear]. The main purpose of ethnic [unclear] at that time was to achieve equality among all ethnic groups within the country internally, and to achieve independence and autonomy of the Chinese nation externally. The Revolution of 1911 achieved equality among ethnic groups within the country in terms of political status, but externally, there were many obstacles and the goal could not be achieved. Looking back now, the ethnic [unclear] at that time really ignored an electric [unclear] factor. Ethnic [unclear] should take pan-Asianism as its core. China itself wants to achieve independence and autonomy, and at the same time, many ethnic groups in Asia also want to achieve independence and autonomy. With pan-Asianism, mutual unity and joint cooperation, the strength is more abundant, and the common enemies of British and American imperialism, who suppress and plunder the Asian nations and prevent them from achieving independence and autonomy, can be defeated. However, at that time, this point was ignored, and there was no unity with other ethnic groups in Asia, and even friction and conflict with each other. In this way, not only was the strength dispersed, but even the British and American imperialists took advantage of it to sow discord and make them go down the path of mutual slaughter. As a result, the goal of independence and autonomy became farther and farther away. As for this kind of responsibility, whether China is alone or shares it, it cannot but be admitted.

International Communism

The above is the fact before and after the founding of the Republic. As for the period around the tenth year of the Republic, the situation changed again. Young people in general, seeing that ethnic [unclear] could not achieve its purpose, believed that this direction was wrong. As a result, there was an attempt to find another direction. As a result, internationalism and communism took its place. Although the two doctrines are different, they have one thing in common, which is to oppose ethnic [unclear]. Internationalism believes that ethnic [unclear] is too narrow, and we should focus on the whole world and all mankind. Communism believes that ethnic [unclear] is unnecessary, and we should talk about class. As a result of the prevalence of these two doctrines, ethnic [unclear] was almost suffocated. Internationalists have a major [unclear]. He talked about the world, which seemed to be bigger than Asianism, bigger than the ethnic [unclear] of a country. In fact, he forgot whose world this is. Since the end of the last [unclear] war, world hegemony has been in the hands of Britain and the United States. Except for the Soviet Union, which was immersed in experimenting with communism, and Japan, which was immersed in preparations, temporarily silenced, there were only two trends in the world. One is: to follow Britain and the United States and slightly share the rest, such as France, etc. The second is: to be reduced to the status of a semi-colony and unable to extricate itself. Most of the countries that have failed to achieve independence and autonomy and the nations that have lost their freedom are. May I ask, in such a situation, what is the so-called world? Internationalists ignore this point, and as a result, they become the diaspora of pan-Asianism and ethnic [unclear], and at the same time become the proponents of British and American imperialism. As for the major [unclear] of communists, in only recognizing class and not recognizing the nation and nationality, the special struggles between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party since the fourteenth and fifteenth years of the Republic are precisely on this point. The Kuomintang believes that in the current economic situation, the industry has not yet developed, and the class opposition is not significant. Although the national wealth is uneven, compared internationally, it can be called small [unclear], which can be solved by developing national capital and implementing planned economy, without talking about class struggle. The Communist Party is not like this. They forcibly divide this uneven small poverty into countless classes, inciting one class to fight against other classes. As a result, the national self-destruction of the empty prison is created. Not only is the [unclear] of the country and the vitality of the nation destroyed, but under the concept of class, ethnic [unclear] and pan-Asianism are also abandoned. What is most regrettable is that Mao Zedong said in Chongqing in the past few years that Chinese society is in the shape of an olive core, with two small ends and a large middle. The so-called two small ends are that there is no large bourgeoisie at the top and no proletariat [unclear] at the bottom. The so-called large middle is that there are the most people in small and medium-sized industries. China should unite these small and medium-sized industrialists to fight for survival today. This is exactly what is called "Why bother in the first place?" If you had known this earlier, why bother causing national self-destruction of the empty prison and ruining the country to this point?

Despising the Nation and Nationality

Internationalists and communists have one thing in common, which is despising their own country and nationality. Internationalists admire the prosperity of Britain and the United States. Comparing China, they feel that everything is not as good as others. As a result, they despise their own country and nationality. Even their own ancestors are said to be "deeply guilty and harmed their descendants." In this way, all patriotism has been eradicated, and ethnic [unclear] has no attachment [unclear]. However, one's own country and nationality can be despised, but one's own personal position must be high. As a result, one unknowingly goes towards individualism. Since everything is good in Britain and the United States, it is natural that all personal enjoyment is good in Britain and the United States. Therefore, there are many foreign houses in the Shanghai Concession, and the daily life [unclear] is considered [unclear]. As for public undertakings and national defense incidents, no one asks. On the contrary, [unclear] in Japanese cities, the people seen still live in short wooden [unclear], and the food is still light [unclear], but public undertakings, especially national defense undertakings, are extremely developed. This is a very clear example. Although the behavior of communists is the opposite of that of internationalists, because they have the concept of despising their own country and nationality, they feel that everything in their own country and nationality is not good, and they will never have any nostalgia and will never cherish them. Therefore, they are bent on destruction, as far as possible. In short, if the internationalists and communists gain power, then ethnic [unclear] will be reversed, and the core pan-Asianism of ethnic [unclear] will also be impossible to mention. Because China is not as good as Britain and the United States, the entire Asia is not as good as Britain and the United States.

China is in the list of contempt, and Asia is also in the list of contempt. This is a natural conclusion. Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi discussed the entire national liberation: "This is trying to find perfume from the dung heap." That's right, Hu Shi boasted that he could find a little perfume from the [unclear] heap. Chen Duxiu thought that perfume did not have to be found from the dung heap. The two people had different opinions, but the starting point of regarding Chinese culture as an industry heap was really different. Since one's own country and nationality are the same as the dung heap, then why love him? (To be continued)

### Second Police Bureau to Relocate to Original Site

Since the Second Police Bureau moved from the city center area to the Jia [unclear] in the city, the house there is the original site of the former Zhan [unclear] Middle School. The house is too [unclear] and narrow. It was originally a temporary [unclear] plan, so it is often not worth it in handling affairs. It is now [unclear] that the horse will be at the [unclear] of next month, relocating to the previous office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau on Lai Road, [unclear] that the [unclear] State Armed Police Force stationed there will be [unclear] into the previous local First [unclear] Court.

### Restriction on Power Supply Measures Starting from December 1st - Supply Stopped After Exceeding Limit Twice

Calculating the Average Limit on Usage

Except for important [unclear] companies, the monthly electricity consumption of ordinary [unclear] families and shops will be restricted, reducing it by 30%. In the past 12 months, the consumption of each household will be averaged to limit its usage.

[unclear] Consumption exceeds 10% or less, collect three times the ordinary electricity bill. [unclear] Consumption exceeds 10% or more, and 20% or less, calculate six times. [unclear] Consumption exceeds 20% or more, calculate 20 times according to the ordinary electricity bill. [unclear] Users who exceed the usage limit more than twice in a row will have their power supply stopped.

Gas Supply Also Reduced

Regarding the gas part, the supply to commercial firms will be reduced by 30%, factories by 25%, hospitals by 10%, ordinary households by 20%, and factories that manufacture pharmaceuticals and major goods will be allowed to reduce by 10%. However, for households that use gas for water heaters, it will be reduced by 30%. The calculation method will be based on the annual average calculation from January to March of this year to limit the usage. If this limit is exceeded twice, it will be calculated ten times and a fee will be charged.

Economic Circles

### Commentary: Increased Production of Cotton

The day before the establishment of the Cotton Control Committee, we discussed industrial and economic policies, believing that how to increase the production of food and how to increase the production of cotton, so that the people's clothing and food during the war would not be a problem, is the most urgent, most important, and most worthy of research, discussion, and implementation today. The next day (November 27), at the inaugural meeting of the Cotton Control Committee, Allied Minister Tajiri of Japan also said, "In terms of materials in Central China, cotton and rice are the most important... I hope that the Cotton Control Committee will pay attention to how to increase production in the future."

The increased production of cotton, as Minister Su of Industry said on behalf of Executive Yuan President Wang that day, can both help the Greater East Asia War and benefit the country and the people. Because cotton is one of China's main agricultural products and an important material for industrial raw materials, its importance to people's livelihood is self-evident. Even if the government buys cotton yarn and cloth for distribution, if it cannot continue to work hard to manufacture cotton yarn and cloth, then the future of yarn and cloth distribution is bleak. Therefore, the increased production of cotton is the basic problem to implement the yarn and cloth distribution plan.

To seek increased cotton production, the most preliminary problem is to encourage its production and reproduction, and the most effective methods are: raise the price of buying cotton, so that farmers will be happy to engage in cotton production in the future; certify that the purchase funds truly enter the hands of farmers who produce cotton, so that their capital for reproduction is not lacking; and distribute cotton products from cities to farmers at low prices as much as possible, so that they can directly understand the meaning of increased cotton production and the close relationship between cotton and farmers. Based on the above three methods—all of which are parallel and not contradictory—the hope of increased cotton production is almost no problem. It is well known that the power of the Cotton Control Committee is by no means weak and that it can achieve the goal of increased production based on this policy.

### Municipal Public Works Bureau Formulates Measures for Charging Rickshaw Fares

Central News Agency reports that since the popularity of three-wheeled rickshaws in the city, various rental rickshaw companies have been established, and business is booming. The prices have all been approved by the authorities, and all rickshaw pullers' tips have also been included. However, in fact, rickshaw pullers often overcharge customers for tips. Although the bureau has repeatedly prohibited this, this bad habit has not been eradicated. In view of this, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has specially formulated measures for three-wheeled business rickshaws to charge fares and three types of rickshaw tickets, A, B, and C, and ordered all rickshaw companies to implement them uniformly starting next month, in order to effectively crack down on rickshaw pullers' extra demands. The measures are as follows:

Measures for Shanghai Special Municipality Three-Wheeled Business Human-Powered Rickshaws to Charge Fares and Tips: All three-wheeled business companies and all drivers shall abide by these measures when collecting fares. All companies shall prepare the following three types of tickets. Type A (the style is to be determined separately) consists of five or ten tickets per booklet. Passengers can directly obtain them from the companies. Each ticket is for thirty minutes. The fares and tips for double military personnel are clearly stated. If passengers travel to their destination and do not exceed the time on the ticket, they are not allowed to give any more money, and drivers are not allowed to demand any more tips. Type B (the style is to be determined separately) is for vehicles hired by passengers by telephone from the company. The driver will bring the fare and tips collection. Passengers should note the time of boarding and arrival, and should explain the time to the driver. The driver will write down the time and how much to charge, and give the first copy to the passenger for receipt, and the second copy to the company for settlement. If there are overcharges or extortion, passengers can report directly to the company. After receiving the passenger's report, the company shall not only double the amount of the extra extortion, but also punish the driver according to the military. Type C (the style is to be determined separately) is for when passengers pay the driver with Type A tickets, but the time exceeds the limit of the ticket. The driver will still bring and collect the fare and tips for the excess time. The driver should also write down how much the time has been exceeded and how much to charge, and still give the first copy to the passenger for receipt, and the second copy to the company for settlement. Passengers who go to the company to take a ride should first purchase a Type A ticket and hand it to the driver upon arrival. If the time is exceeded, they will collect it with a Type C ticket. If passengers pay the driver to collect the fare and tips, and the driver does not give a Type C ticket or a Type B ticket, the passenger may refuse to pay. If the company protects the driver and is found by the bureau, in addition to being fined, the license will also be revoked.

### Various Problems in the Second Stage of the Commercial Control Committee's Work

Insufficient Cooperation from Businesspeople

The second problem is that the Commercial Control Committee, which is supposed to be supported by businesspeople, is responsible for the movement of goods and the approval of removals, the collection, and the allocation of goods. However, some people in the business community have the wrong idea that a free economy will reappear, and they do not fully assist this policy, thus becoming a cause of speculation and hoarding. This is against the national capital and the assurance of production increase, and they specialize in collecting materials and turning them into "accumulated capital," which is completely contrary to the purpose. In order to break this situation, the Commercial Control Committee seems to reform its internal mechanisms internally and strengthen its ties with the national government externally. The reorganization of the Commercial Control Committee into the Executive Yuan means that it indirectly shifts non-cooperative capital into a cooperative direction, such as the forced collection of cotton yarn and cloth.

Relationship with Various Authorities

The reorganization of the Commercial Control Committee into the Executive Yuan is only a partial countermeasure. If the Commercial Control Committee can fully function, how should it proceed and how should it be resolved? This is today's theme. Regarding this point, the opinions of the powerful are as follows: 1. It seems that there is a tendency for the implementation of all material control operations by an autonomous-character agency to proceed smoothly. 2. Establish a system in which national capital guides national capital through the Commercial Control Committee. 3. Economic measures lack comprehensive planning.

### General Discussion (Continued from the Previous Page)

Third, a tendency toward impartiality and non-partisanship gradually emerged within the tradition of party-based journalism, and gained unanimous support and affection from the public. This occurred after the first Diet session in Meiji 23 (1890). Along with the high tide of the democratic constitutional movement, the once so-called "major newspaper" party organs saw a sharp decline in their reputation. Newspapers such as *Jiji Shinpō*, *Asahi Shimbun*, *Nihon Shimbun*, and *Kokumin Shimbun*, which were impartial and non-partisan, gained the trust of the entire country and gradually became a new trend in Japanese newspapers. Fourth, there was a tendency towards national essence-ism, that is, anti-Westernization. The aforementioned *Nihon Shimbun* and *Kokumin Shimbun* newspapers began to create two major emerging forces, advocating internally to preserve traditional virtues and create a uniquely Japanese culture, and externally to assert national rights, so that all of Asia could gain independence from white domination. It can be said to be the ideological origin of the Greater East Asia War.

The Russo-Japanese War led to further development of Japanese newspapers, just as this war laid the foundation for Japan's position as a first-class world power. The most noteworthy trend in the Japanese press during this era was the improvement in management and technology. Due to the development of the war, the dispatch of war correspondents and the reporting of war news began to meet the demands of the people across the country. Furthermore, due to wartime military secrets and communication difficulties, technological and management competition unfolded. Since the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese newspaper industry began to become a capitalist enterprise, began internal corporate organization, began to pay attention to advertising and distribution, and began to focus on improving equipment and editing skills. At the same time, evening editions and local editions also began to develop widely. More noteworthy was the development of communications enterprises. From then on, the Japanese newspaper industry established its important position in the world newspaper industry.

However, when did Japanese newspapers further take on the historical mission of the nation? Undoubtedly, it was from the era of World War I to World War II. After the outbreak of the First European War, Japanese news organizations advanced with the war, and the Japanese newspaper industry also developed with the prosperity of the economic world. At that time, news became the center of competition in the press, and people from all walks of life across the country paid close attention to it, because the movements of the European War had the closest relationship with the development of the Japanese economy and even national power. After the First European War, Japanese public opinion organs advanced simultaneously with open diplomacy. Taking the Paris Peace Conference as an example, the chief plenipotentiary representative of Japan at that time was Elder Kinmochi Saionji, as well as ambassadors stationed in Britain, France, Italy, and other countries. The special correspondents dispatched by major newspapers and the commissioned special correspondents from local newspapers numbered as many as fifty! They contacted the conference representatives and domestic public opinion to support the country's diplomacy! Later, such as the First International Labor Conference, the Washington Conference, and the Disarmament Conference, they all cooperated with diplomacy, demonstrating the power of Japanese public opinion, and展开 (zhǎn kāi -展开)展開熱烈 (rè liè -熱烈)的 (de -的)競賽 (jìng sài -競賽)熱烈的 competition with newspaper operators from Britain and the United States. In August 1927, the League of Nations convened the "International Conference of News Experts," and Japanese representatives were particularly active, striving to pass their proposals and consolidate the position of the Japanese newspaper industry in the world.

In the past ten years, the Japanese newspaper industry has entered a new era, which can generally be said to be the early stage of the controlled era. The main thing during this period was the birth of the "News Agency." Since the Japanese newspaper industry established its international position, it has since展开 (zhǎn kāi -展開)國際 (guó jì -國際)的 (de -的)活動 (huó dòng -活動)展開ed international activities. Japan's international news had always been dominated by Reuters. At this point, it sought to break free. The first step was to sign a contract with Reuters in 1922 to maintain Japan's autonomy in international news. Later, the International News Agency further strengthened its autonomy, and its president, Iwanaga Yanosuke, personally went to Moscow to negotiate with the Soviet state-run Rosta News Agency (now TASS News Agency) and successfully established an equal communication contract. He then went to London and New York to meet with Melville Stone, the founder of the Associated Press, to learn about its history, organization, and operation for the purpose of emulation in his own country. After returning to China, he consulted with the executives of major newspapers such as *Asahi*, *Mainichi*, *Chugai*, *Hochi*, *Kokumin*, and *Jiji Shinpō* to eliminate unnecessary competition and form a powerful news front. After continuous efforts, in January 1926, the International News Agency and the eight major newspapers, *Hochi*, *Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun*, *Tokyo Asahi Shimbun*, *Chugai*, *Kokumin*, *Jiji Shinpō*, *Osaka Asahi Shimbun*, and *Osaka Mainichi Shimbun*, emulated the organizational structure of the American Associated Press and established the "Japan Small Newspaper Union." In October 1931, it merged "Rengo" and "Dentsu" to establish Japan's first national representative news agency, "Corporate Juridical Person Domei News Agency."

When we review the history of the development of newspapers in Japan over the past fifty years, we can at least recognize the following points: First, the Japanese newspaper industry is closely related to the strength and development of the country, and is operated as an enterprise for the country and the people, based on the premise of the country and society. Second, the Japanese press competes with each other in terms of management organization, equipment, technology, and talent recruitment, but they are consistent in their contributions to the country, nation, and social undertakings. Third, Japanese newspaper operators and employees must not simultaneously hold government official positions or operate other businesses other than newspapers. At the same time, government officials and people from all walks of life other than newspapers must not operate newspapers or other news-related businesses. Therefore, the Japanese newspaper industry has had sound development and can exert its power of public opinion. Fourth, although the Japanese newspaper industry is operated as a capitalist enterprise and has had elements of profit-seeking, under the national policy, especially during wartime, it absolutely sacrifices and struggles under the goal of "national supremacy" and "public interest first," resolutely rejecting everything that is harmful to the country and public interest. Conversely, for everything that is beneficial to the country and public interest, it will do it even if the newspaper suffers some economic losses. Fifth, we must especially point out the Japanese authorities' "respect for freedom of speech" and "newspaper guidance policy." In a passive sense, as long as it is not detrimental to the country and public interest, there will be no arbitrary prohibitions or easy interference with the words and deeds of the newspaper industry. In an active sense, it will do its best to support and guide it, so that the newspaper industry has sound and proper development. Whether in terms of human resources, technology, or material (such as paper) allocation, it is very reasonable and universal, because there are only newspapers for the country and only newspapers for the people, and no newspapers for a certain faction or individual of the government. Therefore, even during wartime, the Japanese newspaper industry still presents a state of progress and can shoulder the historical mission!

"The pen of justice and the sword of righteousness, together fighting for the motherland and East Asia!" We express our infinite admiration for the sacrifices and struggles of the Japanese press seniors, and we cannot help but have ardent expectations for the domestic press.
