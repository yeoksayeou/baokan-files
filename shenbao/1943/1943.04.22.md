### Eliminating Defeatists in the Peace Zone

Since Chairman Wang published the "Gorgeous Telegram," advocating for peace, more than four years have elapsed, and the National Government's return to the capital has been over two years. During this time, countless patriotic individuals have sacrificed themselves for loyalty to the peace movement, and even more staff members have dedicated themselves to the peace movement, braving dangers and risking their lives. Living in this time and place, it is not difficult to imagine the perilous environment of that time and place, and it is all the more commendable for their arduous struggle.

Having gone through this period of struggle, and promoting the accuracy of the peace movement theory, gradually shifting the general public's suspicious and apprehensive mentality towards a state of understanding and acceptance, this is a partial success of the peace movement. However, the goal of the peace movement is comprehensive peace between the entire China and Japan, so it is necessary to eliminate the Chongqing regime's reliance on Britain and the United States, making it impossible to continue the dragged-out war. With the strength of the entire China, cooperating with Japan to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War, revitalizing and rebuilding a new China, this is the true essence of peace, the entire mission of the peace movement. We feel that this mission is significant and the task arduous, not only requiring continuous effort and a spirit of constant struggle, but also needing constant reflection and examination of the reasons why the mission has not been quickly achieved.

If we make a calm observation from all aspects, at present within the peace zone, the general public, especially among party and government personnel, still lacks firm belief in peace. Judging from the behavior of a few politicians, even today, they fundamentally do not understand the true essence of peace, let alone any belief. Because they mistakenly believe that the current situation is merely a phenomenon of a transitional era, a temporary situation, with this mentality, they take advantage of opportunities to engage in muddied-waters-fishing activities. These people, although not leaders, occupy key positions in various institutions, using their positions as cover to engage in acts driven by greed. In their speeches, they claim to be for the people and the country, but their actual behavior is completely the opposite. As a result, the majority of the people have a reactive perception. Therefore, in order for the National Government to obtain the firm peace belief of the broad masses of the people and smoothly promote comprehensive peace work, it is necessary to eliminate and sanction these peace defeatists or wavering elements.

Furthermore, as far as the majority of the people are concerned, there may be places where they do not fully understand the true essence of peace, so it is difficult to demand that they have a firm belief. However, it is not difficult for the majority of the people to understand the true essence of peace and develop a firm belief; it depends on whether the government can grasp and satisfy what the people need most. If what the people need most is satisfied, then the people will definitely support and obey all government policies and decrees. Conversely, if what the people need most is not satisfied, and the people have doubts, even with various explanations and forced obedience, the effect may be minimal. Then, what is it that the people need most? It is simply "stable life"!

Since the National Government initiated the peace movement and shouldered the arduous task, it will inevitably overcome all difficulties and complete the mission of comprehensive peace, revitalization, and nation-building. In this regard, we believe that it is urgently necessary to reform the following matters:

(1) Completing political institutions and strengthening administrative efficiency is the most worthwhile point to raise. At present, whether it is in the Axis countries or the anti-Axis countries, centralized countries or "democratic" countries, they all set up institutions for people to participate in or assist in politics. Even the Chongqing regime has an organization like the Political Participation Council – even if it is only in name. Therefore, we believe that the political institutions of the National Government are not yet sound, and we urgently hope to quickly establish a substantive system for people to participate in politics, from the central government to the local grassroots organizations, all having opportunities for people to participate in politics. In this way, the dissemination and implementation of government policies and decrees will be faster, administrative efficiency can be improved, and those peace defeatists who are enough to influence the people's peace beliefs will know to hide themselves due to supervision, gradually leading to a state of enlightened politics.

(2) The most fundamental and crucial political goal is to stabilize the people's livelihood. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, in any era and any country, the rulers have always sought this urgently. And the rise and fall, prosperity and decline of their countries have always been judged by this. This has become a very ordinary and superficial political principle. Especially in today's critical and precarious times, in order for the government to obtain the people's firm belief in peace, and further cooperate with Japan to defeat Britain and the United States, there is no other way but to earnestly achieve stable people's livelihood. At a minimum, it must be more stable than the lives of the people under the rule of Chongqing.

In order to give the people the opportunity to participate in politics, to facilitate the implementation of policies and decrees, the government must improve political institutions; in order for the people to firmly believe in peace, the government must stabilize the people's livelihood. And in the current situation where the domestic peace movement has not yet succeeded, the "peace defeatist" elements, that is, corrupt elements who take advantage of opportunities to muddy the waters, and those who waver in their belief in peace, are a great obstacle to the government's promotion of the peace movement. For example, the speculators and hoarders who cause the current high prices, as well as public officials who engage in business, the government should thoroughly eliminate these people as soon as possible.

In the end of Chairman’s letter to the national people on the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, he solemnly said: "Finally, one sentence, in the total war of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, we cannot forget the majority of our compatriots in Chongqing who are in shackles. We must liberate them and make them stand with us. ..." We deeply admire the government for having such aspirations. We believe that we must first liberate our compatriots in the peace zone from the oppression of high prices and the hardship of life, and stabilize their lives. By then, we believe that the majority of our compatriots in shackles in Chongqing will liberate themselves from the shackles and run to our camp to enjoy a stable life. In this way, the mission of comprehensive peace will be achieved.

### After the Partial Reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Assumed Office Yesterday, Delivered a Broadcast Speech Expressing His Determination Upon Assuming Office, Premier Wang and Chairman Zhu Sent Congratulatory Telegrams

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Japan's new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu assumed office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2 p.m. on the 21st. In the Minister's office of the ministry, he completed the handover procedures with the former Foreign Minister, and then convened all the staff, with the new and old ministers delivering speeches respectively.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Japan's new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Kui delivered a broadcast speech here tonight, expressing his determination after assuming the post of Foreign Minister. The gist is as follows: I am deeply afraid of being appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs this time. The world war situation is now advancing step by step, and has reached the most important stage. Both sides are using their national strength to face this decisive battle, and its outcome is not only a major key to the rise and fall of Japan, but also to the rise and fall of East Asia. No matter how difficult the future is, Japan will swear to overcome the difficult situation with iron will under the imperial prestige, so as to open up the future of Japan. The reason why Japan is engaged in war is not only a matter of life and death for Japan, but also to build and defend Greater East Asia. We must achieve this goal to welcome the long-awaited dawn of East Asia. Moreover, the great cause of the revival of East Asia is the historical mission borne by Japan. At this point, Japan, which has a leading position in Greater East Asia, must share weal and woe with the countries of East Asia. In order to win their admiration and trust, we should make redoubled efforts in the future. The new policy towards China recently implemented by Japan is in fact in this spirit, and the co-existence and co-prosperity of the countries of East Asia is the guiding principle for the revival of Asia. Therefore, I firmly believe that Japan, with the great ideal of spreading justice throughout the world, can unite the entire East Asia, and its intention is the same as winning this war. Japan and its allies, Germany and Italy, share the ideal of justice, echoing each other from east to west, and supporting each other with the countries of East Asia, advancing step by step towards the completion of the war. At present, military affairs and diplomacy are mixed together, and we should not only expand the great results we have already achieved with this, but also use it politically to achieve the great mission borne by Japan. At this time of national hardship, I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to bear this heavy responsibility due to my dullness, but I am determined to serve the country even if it means crushing my bones.

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - After the change of personnel in the Japanese Foreign Ministry, concurrent Premier of the Executive Yuan, especially telegraphed former Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki and new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Kui on the 21st to express his greetings, expressing his expectations for Sino-Japanese relations and the future of East Asia.

Beijing, 21st (Central News Agency) - After the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, Zhu Shen, chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, sent congratulatory telegrams to the four newly appointed ministers, Shigemitsu, Ando, ​​Yamasaki, and Oma, and the director general of the Information Bureau.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - After Ambassador Shigemitsu assumed the post of Foreign Minister this time, the post of Ambassador to China that he left behind is attracting attention due to the importance of the mission. Now that Aoki, Minister of Greater East Asia, is inspecting various places in the South, it is expected that a decision will be made after he returns to the country and consults with Foreign Minister Shigemitsu. As for the new diplomatic lineup in various places in Greater East Asia, at present, important issues such as the independence of Myanmar, the enhancement of the close relationship between Japan and Thailand, and the strengthening of the new policy towards China all need to be resolved. Therefore, in order to adapt to this new situation, Japan's diplomatic lineup in various places in East Asia may be greatly adjusted recently.

In addition, according to observations from various parties here, it is believed that although the Japanese foreign affairs have been changed, there will be no changes in the personnel within the province at present. Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Former Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu Kui's appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs this time has two important meanings: first, it is hoped that the close relationship and business adjustment between the Japanese Ministry of Greater East Asia and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be further strengthened and promoted; second, judging from the experience and insights of the new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, it can be inferred that Japanese diplomacy will become more active. The emergence of Shigemitsu's diplomacy has been expected by all parties, which is natural. Moreover, since China's participation in the war, Japan's new policy towards China is also being implemented step by step. During his tenure as Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu's mission can be said to have been mostly completed. Furthermore, in the current world situation, Japan urgently needs to exert strong diplomacy. Based on this objective situation, Shigemitsu's appointment as Foreign Minister this time is naturally expected. After the Manchurian Incident, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu soon served as Minister to China. In January of Showa 10 (1935), he transferred to the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs. In December of the year before last, he succeeded Hondo Kumata as Ambassador to China, participating in the initial negotiations for the peaceful construction of the new China until today. In terms of the internal relationship adjustment of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the close cooperation and promotion of common policies between the two provinces in the future, it is undoubtedly welcome. From June of Showa 11 (1936) to September of the 13th year, Japan's new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu served as Ambassador to the Soviet Union for two years. During the European War, he was transferred to Ambassador to the United Kingdom. He has a very deep understanding and insight into the internal situation of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and various places in Europe. Therefore, the appointment of Shigemitsu as Foreign Minister is also highly expected by both domestic and foreign parties in this regard. It is deeply believed that the new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu has decided to take on the heavy responsibility, and he will definitely have full confidence and determination to promote Japan's extraordinary diplomacy during the war.

Beijing, 21st (Central News Agency) - After the reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet, Guan Zhenxian, Director of the Information Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Committee, issued a statement, which generally meant that the Japanese government changed some cabinet members to strengthen new policies for wartime diplomacy and internal affairs in response to the current situation. Due to the new political measures of friendly countries, we feel infinite light for the future of Sino-Japanese coexistence and death. Here, we especially express our congratulations to the Japanese government and the future of Greater East Asia. This time, Ambassador Shigemitsu's appointment as Foreign Minister and Minister of State Ando's appointment as Minister of Internal Affairs are expected. These two gentlemen will create a new situation for Japan's internal affairs and diplomacy. We hope to rapidly complete the great cause of building Greater East Asia in the new ideal. These two gentlemen have been stationed in China for a long time and are familiar with the national conditions of China. We are confident that due to the new measures of the two gentlemen, Sino-Japanese relations will become closer and move forward hand in hand on the road to defeating Britain and the United States and liberating Greater East Asia.

### Talk by Vice Minister Zhou Longxiang

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Cabinet implemented a partial reorganization on the evening of the 20th, and Ambassador Shigemitsu was honored as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Our Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Longxiang recently issued the following statement: I am saddened to hear the news of Ambassador Shigemitsu's honor as the new Minister of Foreign Affairs. At the same time, I am also pleased and congratulated. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, Special Envoy Abe and Ambassador Hondo have successively provided sincere assistance and earnest sympathy to the National Government, allowing the National Government to clean up the mess and devote itself to restoration after the war. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the responsibility borne by our country was even more arduous. Internally, we sought to revive China, and externally, we sought to protect East Asia. At the same time, we should do our best to share the heavy responsibility of building a new order. Ambassador Shigemitsu came to China at the right time, with his lofty vision and outstanding skills, standing from the overall situation and working hard. On the one hand, he sought to strengthen the National Government, and on the other hand, he sought ways for the two countries to cooperate sincerely, so that our country had the courage and strength to share the great cause of building East Asia together. For example, since participating in the war, the agreement on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights was signed by Ambassador Shigemitsu, and every effort was made to implement it one by one in a short period of time. The concessions and extraterritorial rights in China are shackles for the Chinese nation, hindering the development of our country. There is nothing more serious than this. Since Britain and the United States first forcibly seized these unequal privileges, it has been many years, and all the people of our country are heartbroken. Now, through the mediation of Ambassador Shigemitsu and the assistance of the Japanese government, they have been abolished one by one, allowing our country to develop independently. This is truly a great achievement of Ambassador Shigemitsu. It is not only one of the most glorious pages in the history of China's revival, but also immortal in the history of Sino-Japanese relations. Our government is deeply grateful, and the people of our country will never forget this time that the ambassador has been honored as Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is deeply believed that in the future, he will be able to give full play to his great aspirations and thoroughly implement his proposals based on his understanding during his tenure in China, which will not only benefit the friendly relations between China and Japan, but also be fortunate for the future of East Asia.

### Manchukuo Expresses Cooperation

Xinjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government's implementation of a partial cabinet reorganization this time has further strengthened its determination to complete the Greater East Asia War. The government and the people of Manchukuo have expressed their full cooperation, decided to implement the established national policy, actively protect the northern border, and strengthen economic cooperation with Japan. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Yamasaki, and Minister of State Omaso are all recognized as celebrities in the Japanese political circles and have outstanding insights. Shigemitsu and Amano have served in the diplomatic circles for many years and are well aware of the situation in Europe and the United States. At this stage when the Greater East Asia War is advancing to the decisive battle, their contributions to Japan's construction in the future will be great. Moreover, the Japanese government's reorganization of the cabinet this time has made the domestic total force more concentrated, and the determination to complete the Greater East Asia War has been strengthened with new determination. Manchukuo has decided to implement the national policy since its founding, defend the northern border with the spirit of one heart and one mind, and actively cooperate with Japan to enhance its combat power. In the economic aspect, it will establish a domestic self-sufficiency system. In the future, it will concentrate the national total force to adapt to the enhancement of the Japanese cabinet and the completion of the Greater East Asia War.

### Vietnamese Authorities Are Quite Concerned

Hanoi, 21st (Central News Agency) - Various parties here are extremely concerned about the partial reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet, believing that Japan's political and war posture will become stronger in the future. In particular, the change of Foreign Minister is a manifestation of Japan's diplomacy echoing Europe and actively refreshing the Axis diplomatic lineup. This time, Ambassador Shigemitsu to China took office as Foreign Minister. In terms of his past experience, everyone trusts him, and good results will inevitably be achieved in the cooperative relationship between Japan and Vietnam.

Saigon, 21st (Central News Agency) - Political figures here believe that the strengthening of the Tojo Cabinet is a further success of the Japanese domestic wartime system: Prime Minister Tojo's concurrent post as Minister of Education and State Minister Ando's transfer to the Cabinet are particularly significant: and Ambassador Shigemitsu's promotion to Foreign Minister and Mr. Amano's appointment as Director-General of the Information Bureau are a landmark progress in the cooperation between China and Japan and the ideological war lineup of Japan.

### Talk by Mr. Ishiwatari Sotaro, the Highest Economic Advisor of the National Government, Deeply Hoping that All Parties Will Assist the National Government in Thoroughly Investigating Hoarding, and Concrete Policies for Handling Idle Capital Will Be Decided Soon

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - After the National Government participated in the war, all economic construction was actively promoted in accordance with the wartime system. The recent thorough investigation of hoarding and speculation has further demonstrated the determination of the government authorities to stabilize the people's livelihood and revive the economy. The reporter recently visited Mr. Ishiwatari Sotaro, the highest economic advisor of the National Government, and asked him about various issues related to the wartime economy. He answered in detail, and the following is a record:

(Question) What is your opinion on investigating hoarding and speculation?

(Answer) Although hoarding materials is an abnormal phenomenon that is difficult to avoid during wartime, this behavior is extremely harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the National Government authorities' resolute order to thoroughly investigate hoarding and speculation this time is of great significance. I greatly admire the National Government's measures and hope that the thorough investigation will continue to achieve practical results. It is hoped that all parties will provide comprehensive assistance in order to eliminate this abnormal phenomenon and stabilize the people's livelihood. On the other hand, suppressing prices, increasing production, saving consumption, and adjusting allocation are also urgent tasks at present. Therefore, trade associations and general merchants should have a conscious spirit. They must know that taking advantage seems profitable on the surface, but in fact, the ultimate victim is still themselves. In addition, the suppression of prices and the stabilization of currency are inseparable. Banks have now stopped lending to avoid inflation. The National Government is also paying great attention to this matter. The Chinese people must also do their best to assist. Japan will certainly assist at all costs. Since China's participation in the war, China and Japan have entered a stage of coexistence and death. Japan is willing to assist China in completing wartime economic construction.

(Question) What are the policies for increasing production after China's participation in the war?

(Answer) During the war, increasing the production of necessary materials is a matter of urgency. Both China and Japan have a complete plan, and some of it has already been implemented. Factories that were previously invested and operated by British and American companies in Shanghai were closed down due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Now they have been transferred to China by Japan. Therefore, China should use idle capital to engage in operation. It is appropriate to focus on agriculture, such as seed improvement, pest control, and fertilizer improvement, so that agricultural products will increase first. Especially the Central China area has excellent natural conditions and is most suitable for agricultural production. If it can get appropriate guidance, it will have a good harvest. Then, if the agricultural products in the interior and the industrial products in Shanghai are exchanged with each other, or exchanged with the coal in North China, and the surplus is used to make up for the deficiency, it will be of great benefit to economic construction.

(Question) How can Shanghai's idle capital be channeled into increasing production?

(Answer) The use of idle capital is currently a very serious problem. In recent years, idle capital has concentrated in Shanghai. The National Government has paid attention to it early and is actively planning. Concrete policies will be decided soon, and Japan is also preparing to assist. Although the specific methods are not yet known, the general idea is to start with agriculture first, such as reclaiming wasteland and expanding farmland, and other necessary tasks. In addition, if idle capital can be used to operate the enemy property transferred by Japan, the good harvest can also be predicted.

(Question) After the suspension of new military ticket issuance, are there any new policies to enhance the credit of the Central Reserve Bank Notes?

(Answer) The credit issue of the Central Reserve Bank Notes is most related to price increases. Price increases easily lead to a decrease in the value of currency, which is inevitable. Since the issuance of the Central Reserve Bank Notes, not only has there never been any adverse phenomenon, but the foundation has become stronger and the credit has become more prominent. However, the recent price increases have been quite severe, and it is necessary to thoroughly study its causes and try to suppress them.

(Question) What are the specific methods for the exchange of materials between the North and the South?

(Answer) The method of exchanging materials between the North and the South is very simple. At present, the North lacks grain, and the South can transport flour to the North to provide assistance. At the same time, the North produces the most coal, and the price is still very low. The South lacks fuel, so in the future, the North and the South must communicate with each other, and the surplus can be used to make up for the deficiency. In this way, the materials of both parties can be integrated, and there is no need to worry about panic.

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency)

### Chen Gongbo Receives Chinese and Foreign Reporters, Expresses Thoughts on Visiting Japan

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch)

Chen Gongbo, Speaker of the Legislative Yuan and concurrently Mayor of Shanghai, was recently appointed as a special envoy to visit friendly nation Japan and has now completed his mission and returned to the capital. At 3:00 PM on the 21st, he met with a group of Chinese and foreign reporters in the conference room of the Legislative Yuan and gave the following speech regarding his trip to Japan after returning to the capital: "I am deeply grateful for the cordial hospitality extended by the Japanese government and public during my recent mission to Japan. Although my time in Tokyo was short, I am gratified to have completed my mission. As for my impressions of Tokyo, I would like to share them with you. (1) Three years ago, I was sent to Japan to return a courtesy visit as an envoy of peace. This time, I came to Tokyo again as an envoy of cooperation. I recall that three years ago, I was jointly hosted by Japanese groups and media promoting Pan-Asianism. I said that I hoped Japan would continuously and automatically improve already established relationships, and that China would also continuously and automatically improve future relationships; this is true peace." This time, China voluntarily participated in the Greater East Asia War, and Japan also voluntarily assisted China in achieving its freedom and independence. Therefore, during this trip to Japan, both the Japanese government and public had the feeling that the common ideals had been realized. Their joy is beyond words. (2) The Japanese government and public are very tense during the war. Government authorities are extremely diligent, without a moment's rest. The people everywhere can demonstrate their determination to win and their joint efforts to endure hardship. Regarding rationed materials, the people can automatically conserve and supply them to the front lines. Their spirit of unity from top to bottom and close national solidarity are something our country should emulate. (3) Japan's policy towards China is not only clear, but also its expectations are particularly strong. The government and public all cite Chairman Wang Jingwei's words of sharing weal and woe and living and dying together to express their sincere affection for China. Therefore, regarding my view of the future of China and Japan, the relationship between the two countries is no longer just that of close friends, but has advanced to that of brothers. However, our country should also deeply reflect on the fact that Japan's actions towards us are the result of a long-term ideal and cultural exchange in a long history. We should treat Japan as Japan treats us, and even more so, treat Japan as we treat ourselves. Be careful not to be arrogant, be careful not to be conceited, and strive to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. We must work hard to reform politics, increase production, and further improve relations between China and Japan. The above three points are my impressions after a brief observation. We must know that the relationship between China and Japan is by no means just peace, nor is it just the Greater East Asia War of today, but lies in the similarity of ideals, the similarity of goals, and the similarity of efforts, to jointly shoulder the great responsibilities of the Greater East Asia today and tomorrow. According to my observation, after the completion of this Greater East Asia War, East Asia will probably be in a state of defense for the next twenty years. This is something that the people of China and Japan should deeply reflect upon. As for my trip to Beiping on the way, there was no other mission. Since returning to the capital, I have not visited Beiping for one or two years. The last time was in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933) when I went to Tianjin to preside over the National Mineral Exhibition and visited Beiping on the way. Therefore, I decided to make a special detour to visit friends. During my three-day stay in Beiping, I felt that the authorities were working hard on construction without sparing any effort, and the people's support for the central government and their desire for the exchange of materials between the north and the south were very strong. Recently, the food shortage has reached an extreme level, and the central government has taken measures to provide relief. In the future, North China will focus on increasing production, so there should be no worries."

### US Department of the Army Officially Announces Losses from Last Year's Raid on Japan

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to news from Washington, the US Department of the Army announced yesterday that all US aircraft participating in the air raid on Japan on April 18th last year, except for one that reached the Soviet Union, were destroyed. This confirms the accuracy of the detailed report made yesterday by Major General Tanigaki, spokesman for the Army Information Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. It is said that the US aircraft squadron that carried out the air raid was composed of twin-engine North American bombers, which were carried by the aircraft carrier Hornet to a location less than 800 miles from Tokyo, and then took off. A total of 80 pilots participated in the air raid. The idea of this air raid came one month after the Japanese aircraft bombed Pearl Harbor. At that time, Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle, who was still a colonel, selected pilots from volunteers and then spent three months preparing, completing his training at Eglin Field in Florida. It was stipulated that after bombing the Japanese mainland, the US aircraft should fly to airfields within Chongqing's territory. However, due to environmental conditions, all the aircraft failed to reach the designated airfields. Several aircraft landed in areas occupied by the Japanese army or at sea near the Chinese coast. Doolittle himself took off at 8:20 AM that morning and parachuted into Chinese territory 13 hours later. Five others landed in Soviet territory and have been detained.

### British and American Forces Attempt to Launch Another Offensive Around Bizerte, Tunisia; Axis Forces Prepared for Retaliation, Fearless

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) Last night, a German military spokesman declared that the German-Italian forces in the North African theater are currently occupying the main lines in that area. Military experts here unanimously believe that the divisions under Marshal Rommel and Lieutenant General Arnim are capable of holding their current positions to resist any offensive. Judging from the military actions of the past few days, it can be seen that the offensives of the British First and Eighth Armies are increasing daily, suggesting that the first large-scale offensive by British and American forces in the areas around Tunis and Bizerte is about to begin. The transfer of Rommel's forces has given General Montgomery of the British Eighth Army ample time to make all necessary preparations for a major offensive, so the Axis defenders are also prepared and fearless. Furthermore, according to a German announcement, the number of British and American tanks destroyed in North Africa since the Battle of El Alamein has reached over 4,000, not just the 400 claimed by the British.

Swiss Capital, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) The final battle in Tunisia began last night in Enfidaville. The British Eighth Army launched a major offensive against the German-Italian forces in the trapezoidal positions in the mountains. However, the strong defenders won the first battle, routing the wave of British troops and forcing them to retreat to their original positions.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to news from the front lines in North Africa, the Tunisian front has become increasingly active in recent days, and the time for a decisive battle seems to be approaching. The British Eighth Army has been deploying in the area south of Enfidaville for days. On the 19th, it finally launched a full-scale attack with strong infantry units, engaging in a decisive battle with Rommel's forces. The anti-Axis forces suffered heavy damage due to the concentrated artillery positions of the Axis forces, but continued to reinforce and attack fiercely. Some even reached the Axis positions, but by the morning of the 20th, they had been surrounded and annihilated by the Axis forces. The Enfidaville line of defense is currently still in the hands of the Axis forces. It is currently unclear whether this attack by the British Eighth Army is the beginning of the decisive battle on the Tunisian front. It is also reported that the Axis forces launched a counterattack on Bou Arada in the western region on the 19th. The French rebel forces near El Agareb in the south have now increased pressure on the anti-Axis forces in that area.

Rome, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) Authoritative sources have authorized the Stefani Agency to announce that since the Axis forces withdrew from the Wadi Akarit line to the current Enfidaville line, they have been able to consolidate and hold firmly. The realization of this unity of the troops is due to the fighting spirit and skills of the Axis forces. During the withdrawal, the British and American forces attempted to attack the flanks of the German-Italian forces. The Axis forces fought continuously to delay the enemy's actions. On the morning of April 6th, after a fierce air and artillery preparation, the enemy attacked the Spezia and Pistoia divisions, cutting off Jebel Roumana and other positions. Afterwards, they launched a fierce attack on the Trieste division, breaking into the Italian lines. To avoid being surrounded, the Italian army launched a counterattack, resulting in the recovery of Jebel Roumana. As a result, the enemy's attack along the entire front was delayed. The Axis forces were under pressure from the enemy on the west, southwest, and south sides, so they decided to retreat. Because they did not want to over exhaust the troops, they decided not to make continuous defenses with hasty preparations, but to retreat according to plan to the line prepared at Enfidaville. In order to complete this long retreat, it was necessary to fight the enemy along the line from El Guettar to Akarit, avoiding being surrounded in the Maknassy area. Finally, the enemy, who attempted to advance between Pichon and Fondouk and attack Kairouan, was defeated. Since the British and American forces joined forces, the pressure exerted by the enemy from the southwest and south sides became even more dangerous. The British Eighth Army, after joining forces, was greatly facilitated and could obtain supplies from its base in Algeria. On April 7th, the battle resumed, this time extending to the northern region. At the same time, the First Army also completed its withdrawal. After the enemy contacted our rearguard, they were quite successful. On April 9th, the Axis forces completed their withdrawal, and fierce battles also occurred at Fondouk and Pichon. The enemy advanced near Fondouk, forcing the Axis forces to decide to retreat to Enfidaville. The enemy in the north also attacked Medjez el Bab again, hoping to pass between Maktar and Tunis. Although they had some local victories, they were ultimately blocked by the German army. After the Axis forces retreated to the new positions, on April 16th, they defeated the enemy who came to attack. A major battle has now begun along this new line of positions. According to the enemy's own admission, this battle will be an extremely difficult and bloody battle.

### British Artillery Intensifies Bombardment, Probing the Strength of the Axis Forces

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to a military correspondent from the Havas News Agency, there is currently fierce fighting in the southern section of the Tunisian bridgehead, and this fighting has clearly gone beyond the scope of local battles. On Monday, many British artillery units began to explore the range of the German-Italian positions. By Monday evening, the British artillery intensified its bombardment. On Tuesday morning, British forces attacked again with strong infantry and tank units, but encountered strong resistance. The fighting quickly expanded and was still raging at noon on Tuesday. It is currently difficult to say whether this battle marks the beginning of the British Eighth Army's expected large-scale new offensive, or whether it is merely an attempt at armed reconnaissance. General Montgomery's strategy is to launch an initial attack, and then decide whether to immediately continue the attack with a large number of troops or temporarily stop the fighting, depending on its success or failure. In the current stage of the battle, Montgomery is very likely to use this type of strategy. The fighting in the western section of Tunisia also seems to be more active. On Monday, the British First Army launched several small-scale attacks on the German positions on the high ground, but was repelled. Anti-Axis sources say that General Anderson is advancing towards Djebel Djobba, while also claiming that he is fighting German mountain troops in the mountains northwest of Medjez el Bab, which is contradictory. It is unreasonable or imprudent for the British army to advance towards Djebel Djobba while the German army is still present on these mountains on the German flank. British generals are unlikely to do this. It is worth noting that the US army has sent one or two divisions to join the British Eighth Army, and now more troops are joining the British First Army. The US Fifth Army currently does not seem to be operating as an independent unit.

### Japanese Diplomatic Officials Stationed in the Soviet Union to Move Back to Moscow

Kuybyshev, 20th (Central News Agency Dispatch) It was learned today that the Japanese government has recently completed negotiations with the Soviet Bureau for Servicing the Diplomatic Corps and will move the Japanese military and naval attachés back to Moscow. The Japanese naval attaché moved here with other officials of the Japanese Embassy when the Soviet Union established a temporary capital in Kuybyshev in 1941. Although officials of the Japanese Embassy and other foreign diplomats here have not yet received formal notification from the Soviet government, it is expected that they will all move back to Moscow this summer.

### Japanese Air Force Active in the Southwest Pacific

### Statements by Major General Sato Cause Anxiety in the United States

Geneva, 20th (Central News Agency Dispatch) A German news agency reports that news from Washington today indicates that the statements made by Major General Kenryo Sato of the Japanese Army Ministry that Japan is now capable of attacking the US mainland have caused great panic in the United States. Major General Sato stated that the average American has not yet realized that the so-called US technological superiority has become a thing of the past. This coincides with the warnings issued by General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis forces, and Australian Prime Minister Curtin that Australia is under direct threat of Japanese attack. Well-informed sources in Washington solemnly declare that, as far as the situation in the Pacific is concerned, its development is decidedly favorable to Japan, but the American public seems to be too inattentive to it. The powerful Japanese air strikes have prompted the Australian Prime Minister to re-issue warnings against misplaced optimism. According to recent Australian news, the greatest danger currently facing US forces in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea is that their fighting power can only be maintained if supplies are continuous. The anti-Axis high command no longer denies Japanese air superiority in the South Pacific because US Navy transport ships are often bombed by Japanese aircraft.

### US Army and Navy Losses

Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Stefani Agency, relaying news from Washington, reports that since the start of the war, US military deaths, injuries, and captures have reached 75,460, with the Army accounting for 51,000 and the Navy accounting for 24,460.

The Senate previously repealed the President's power to devalue the US dollar, but granted the President authority over the fund and sent the bill to the House of Representatives for discussion. According to Committee Chairman Representative Summers, "This has made me realize that the establishment of an international bank will not be successful, and it shows the trend of national thinking."

This council must maintain close contact with the anti-Axis powers and the French peace zone.

### British Retreat on the Mayu River Cut Off

Istanbul, 21st - Central News Agency - Since the Japanese forces launched a fierce attack on the Mayu Peninsula, the attempt by the anti-Axis Indian expeditionary force to recapture Burma has been completely shattered. The remaining British forces appear to be retreating towards the Indian border. According to dispatches from New Delhi, the Indian anti-Axis military headquarters announced on the 20th that the central army in Arakan has been forced to retreat to new positions and is now retreating towards the Indian border in two columns. Japanese forces now control the Mayu River, so the retreat route for British naval vessels on the river to the estuary has been cut off.

Lisbon, 21st - Central News Agency - The anti-Axis Indian expeditionary force in Burma is gradually retreating towards the Indian border due to fierce attacks by Japanese forces.

### Detailed Account of Sinking of U.S. Aircraft Carrier: A Glorious Page in the Record of Japanese Submarines

(From Hirate Naval Reporting Team, 〇〇 Base) - It is recalled that on June 7th of last year, the Japanese 〇〇 submarine sank the U.S. Yorktown large aircraft carrier far in the northern waters of Midway Island, establishing an immortal feat and receiving the first commendation since the start of the war. The following is the submarine captain's handwritten account of the attack on the aircraft carrier.

The I-numbered 〇〇 submarine participated in the Battle of Midway Island. From the beginning of June last year, it was tasked with monitoring the area around the island and shelling enemy air bases. On the evening of the 6th, it received orders to sink the enemy Yorktown-class aircraft carrier, which had been damaged by our naval air forces and was drifting north of Midway Island. It immediately sailed at full speed to the designated location. At dawn on the 7th, the ship was discovered in the distant ocean, being towed slowly by several escorting destroyers. The Yorktown-class was surrounded by several escorting destroyers, with extremely tight security. In addition, the weather was clear, and the sea was calm, making it quite difficult to approach at close range. Our submarine strictly controlled its acoustics and, with bold and careful maneuvers, passed under the hulls of the guarding destroyers three times. Finally, according to the planned maneuver, it approached the shortest distance and launched accurate torpedoes, skillfully sinking the enemy aircraft carrier. The time was 10:30 AM. However, after launching the torpedoes, the enemy destroyers immediately launched a fierce attack, lasting four hours. Even after our ship surfaced, it was still subjected to chasing shelling. Due to calm and alert evasive maneuvers, it finally escaped the crisis, and the mission was successfully completed.

From the very beginning of the Midway Island operation, our ship searched for enemy ships in the nearby area. On June 6th, an aircraft carrier damaged by our air force's surprise attack was drifting with a list near 〇〇 nautical miles north of Midway Island. Our ship received orders to sink it and arrived at the designated location before dawn the next day. At 〇〇:00 AM on the 7th, upon arriving at the designated location, the lookout reported "Black spots sighted." This was the initial sighting, followed by the sighting of another black spot. At this time, the aircraft carrier was sailing in the 〇〇 degree direction. Our ship submerged 〇〇 meters behind it. The line of sight gradually became clearer, and it was identified that the aircraft carrier was listing to the left. It was decided to attack from the left and proceed to the appropriate attack distance.

There were no traces of bombing craters on the flight deck, nor did it appear that a fire had occurred. I thought perhaps it had been attacked by torpedoes and was listing. I immediately ordered anti-depth charge defenses and completed preparations inside the ship, such as arranging the lights. There were five enemy destroyers surrounding us, two in front, with extremely tight security. The sky was clear, with only a 5-meter per second east wind, and the waves were flat, making for excellent attack weather. When sighted, the enemy ship was stopped in its drifting mode. After repeated surfacing observations, it was found that it was different from what had been expected in the navigation officer's plotting. About 〇 hours and a half had passed since we began to submerge. Had there been no action yet? I began to feel doubtful.

Each time the lateral distance observed by periscope was unexpectedly gradually approaching, but the bearing angle was increasing. Thus, it was felt that an attack from the left would be difficult. We did not know if the enemy had the ability to maneuver. We tentatively judged that it was maneuvering and decided to attack from the right. During the two hours of crossing the enemy's screen, the periscope was not used at all. We only used the plotting to break through in the direction of cutting off the enemy's route of advance. Regardless of whether we had been discovered by the enemy, we silently submerged, leaving it up to fate. The enemy destroyers had almost passed over our ship's head several times.

The Enemy's Shadow in the Periscope

At 〇〇:00, the periscope showed the enemy aircraft carrier being towed by two destroyers, at around 〇〇 meters. Initially, we wanted to wait for the enemy at a firing point at a bearing angle of 〇〇 degrees and a distance of 〇〇 meters. At this time, our ship had already broken through the enemy destroyer screen and was at the closest distance. Soon, before the aircraft carrier reached the position where our ship was waiting, I immediately ordered "Fire!" Ah! Four times! The sound of powerful hits shook our ship. Large explosions occurred one after another, creating waves and noise that were deafening.

Before the launch, the enemy destroyer was only 〇〇 meters from our ship's stern. After the enemy was hit by the torpedoes, it fled in confusion over our ship, scrambling in panic. An hour later, an enemy destroyer passed over our ship from right to left and dropped depth charges twice. After that, more than a hundred depth charges were dropped every ten to fifteen minutes. However, only 〇〇 parts of our ship were damaged. We continued to take emergency measures. I inspected each part of the ship three times. The crew's desperate efforts to survive were truly divine. I could not help but clasp my hands in prayer in my heart.

By 〇〇:00, the battery power was exhausted, the electric motors stopped, and the air became cloudy. The inside of the ship gradually darkened, with only the hand lamps still providing a few points of light, like a sign of our connected lives.

Escaping the Enemy's Encirclement

Our ship then began to surface at an angle of 〇〇 degrees. The chief mechanic came to the issuing station and, following the instructions of the former officer, ordered the engineers to move back and forth to maintain balance, because there was no other way to survive except to surface. If we could surface, then the only option would be to aim for the enemy's vital point and carry out a suicide attack. However, we still held onto a glimmer of hope. 〇〇 minutes had already passed since the last bombing. Perhaps the enemy ships were already far away. In anxiety, we opened the bridge hatch, climbed onto the bridge, and looked around. There were no enemies nearby, nor were there any aircraft. Only in the distance, near 〇〇, could we see three destroyers heading home. The aircraft carrier was no longer in sight. It could probably be confirmed that it had been sunk. With the sinking of the aircraft carrier, our mission was over. Let us die at any time! We have done our human duty and await fate. As we thought the enemy destroyers were still within range and had not yet fully submerged, the enemy had also discovered our ship and began to turn back.

Before surfacing, it was reported: "Silence is absent, air pressure is 〇〇 kilograms." So we quickly ordered charging and ventilation, turned the stern of the ship toward the enemy, and fled at full speed. Our ship emitted thick black smoke, which covered us from both sides, enveloping the ship in smoke. Among the three destroyers, the middle one had no hope of catching up. Only the left and right ones. The destroyer on the left was obscured by our smokescreen. Only the one on the right was occasionally visible in the sparse smokescreen. At 〇〇 minutes, the enemy increased its speed, and the distance was gradually decreasing. The lookout reported "Getting closer!" The situation inside the ship, according to the Marine Chief's report, we could not go much further.

Reporting Mission Accomplished

This submersion would be the end of life, I had long held such a realization. So I verbally ordered the communications chief to issue a mission completion report, saying "The mission to sink the aircraft carrier has been completed." At the same time, I made a signal and quickly sent a notification by telegram. Suddenly, a destroyer that had communicated with us 〇〇 minutes before submerging approached 〇〇 meters. However, a small submersion still could not escape. I asked the electrical engineer, "How is the electricity?" He replied, "No confidence." With the expectation of dying in battle, I did not want to see my lovely subordinates perish with me. A final effort! One more struggle, using the electrical power in the ship as a standard, we submerged again.

In depth 〇〇, a voice came from the speaking tube, saying, "The propeller is slowly turning." Was this not a dream? I asked myself. Listen! Listen! We had finally won. Where there is a will, there is a way. Perseverance is the true submarine spirit. The enemy's artillery fire began to explode behind us. Because our ship was submerging in the smokescreen, the enemy shells could not hit us. The sky gradually darkened. The enemy ship, having lost its nerve before our surprise attack, only launched a few intimidating depth charges this time, passing over our heads. At 〇〇:00, our ship, shining with the shadow of victory, reappeared in the dark sea of twilight. (Sho: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, April 15th)

### Preparations for the German-Soviet Summer Offensive

Both Germany and the Soviet Union believe that the Soviet Union's winter offensive has come to an end, and the new offensives of the German and Soviet armies will soon follow. On the 4th of this month, German General Dittmar stated: "The largest of all military experiments is currently being prepared." This is of course not limited to the Eastern Front. However, Dittmar regarded the Eastern Front as the most visible of the five decisive fronts. These five fronts are: (1) The Western Front; (2) The Atlantic Front; (3) The Greater East Asia Front; (4) The Northwest African Front; (5) The Air Front over Germany and Occupied Countries.

Currently, both Germany and the Soviet Union are waiting for the opportunity to begin a large-scale conflict on the Eastern Front, at the latest this summer. A German newspaper published the following dispatch from Berlin under the headline "A Prelude to Expanded Military Operations on the Eastern Front":

"The arrival of spring this year has come particularly early on the Eastern Front, which has not only ended the Soviet offensive. The rapid pace of seasonal transition has meant that the ground in the southern district, namely the Kupiansk region, is already drying out, so it seems the Soviet Union will launch an offensive in that area. But the fighting will be limited to local battles."

The report went on to say: "Apart from the Kupiansk area, the ground in the entire Donets Basin has dried out and is suitable for a large-scale offensive." In this regard, we quote from Lieutenant General Dittmar's article "Winter Offensive" as follows:

"We admit that the Soviet Union has achieved some success in this offensive. However, in addition to the weapons production competition, Germany has discovered new methods and means that will surprise the enemy. The large Soviet army on the front will be at a loss. The Soviet winter offensive is now a thing of the past, and we have already understood that the Soviet forces are not inexhaustible. The vast Soviet territory, the Russian winter, and the huge human resources are the three key factors in Soviet success. This winter, the vast Soviet territory has given the Red Army many advantages on the Eastern Front. But this winter, the blows suffered by both the German and Soviet armies in terms of human resources are one of the most unfathomable elements of the factors that determine the war situation. However, the outdated Soviet operational plan, like that of Napoleon in 1812, has failed. Because this operational plan is only effective when dealing with enemies without elasticity and decisiveness. However, elasticity is the core of German military tactics. Therefore, the German army has felt from the results of the German-Soviet war that special rules must be used to fight against the Soviet army. And now we already know what this law is and how to use it?"

Two articles published in Pravda on local news are related to this and are extremely noteworthy. First, it points out that if the climate and ground conditions are good, the German army may launch a new offensive at any time. Several dozens of German elite divisions are now entering the front line in the Donets Basin. German factory workers are being mobilized to form new units. The German army occupies locations suitable for launching a new offensive, especially the Donets Basin, which can be used as a base for launching offensives against the northern Don River region and the southern Caucasus. Fierce fighting will soon begin. Second, the Soviet Union will also launch an offensive this summer. This comes from a senior member of the Red Army General Staff, and its main points are roughly as follows:

"This year's summer offensive can liberate the Soviet Union from the German army. The Soviet Union will make the most advantageous use of its mechanized divisions. We did not make good use of the results of this winter offensive, because snow and mud hindered the Red Army's offensive. Winter is called the offensive season for the Soviet army. This does not mean that the Soviet army likes winter, but rather that preparations are usually completed by winter. But this year, the Soviet army seems to have completed all preparations for military operations in a very short period of time. We do not ignore the German army's military strength. The German army is an extremely tenacious enemy, and everyone knows that the German army is now accelerating preparations for the Soviet summer offensive. But we know the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet Union. The reason why the German army can achieve great results is that its excellent mechanized units concentrate their forces in one location and carry out concentrated, large-scale attacks. Conversely, the Soviet Union cannot quickly move troops to the German army's concentration points for defense. The Soviet army's mechanization has not yet been completed, but mechanization is being implemented quickly and effectively."

This report explains why the Soviet army has repeatedly re-enacted the winter offensive every year. This contradicts the experts of neutral countries. The implication is that the Soviet army may launch a summer offensive starting this summer. (Zurich, Taguchi Correspondent, 8th - Sho: Translated from the Western Asahi Newspaper, April 10th)

### Recent Situation in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River, Revealed by the Japanese Military Authorities in Shanghai

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) According to news revealed by the Japanese military authorities here, the recent situation in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is as follows:

(1) Since the beginning of this month, the New Fourth Army, numbering 2,000 men, which infiltrated the area east of Shijiu Lake, has been in contact with the Chongqing regular army and miscellaneous troops entrenched in that area and the area south of Lishui. The New Fourth Army suffered fierce attacks. Small units were surrounded in various places and suffered heavy blows, fleeing to the Shijiu Lake area. The Chongqing army is still gathering forces and will continue to pursue them. There are signs that the conflict between Chongqing and the Communists in that area is becoming increasingly serious.

(2) Since the 11th of this month, Japanese troops in the Jiangbei area have repeatedly conducted mopping-up operations against the Chongqing army's Li Mingyang troops in the area between Taixian, Xinghua, and Dongtai. On the 13th, near Fengjiazhuang, 25 kilometers northeast of Taixian, they surrounded and annihilated 3,000 men of Zhang Xingbing's unit, and also routed part of Li Mingyang's troops. They are still continuing to thoroughly mop up the fleeing remnants of the Chongqing army. To date, Chongqing army battalion commanders and regimental commanders have been captured by the Japanese army. Also, on the 16th, the commander of the 1st Column of Li Mingyang's army and his group participated in the "Peace Movement". The Li Mingyang army units are now in disarray and on the verge of annihilation. The Japanese army's achievements include burying 957 bodies of the Chongqing army, capturing 1,628 prisoners, 800 participants in the "Peace Movement", seizing 11 light mortars, 128 small mortars, 2,470 mortar shells, 2 heavy machine guns, 14 light machine guns, 1,218 rifles, and 1,600 hand grenades.

### Sugar Merchants' Cooperative is Preparing to Handle the Third Phase of Sugar Distribution

The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, after implementing sugar distribution based on population, has already begun preparations for the third phase of sugar distribution based on sugar ration cards. It is said that the mountain region has submitted a request to the military allocation authorities for the sugar allocation quota for April. Once approved, the allocation will be carried out immediately. (1) Type A retailers are exclusively for household sugar consumption. (2) Type B retailers supply special allocations for various industries' operational needs. It is reported that the sugar needed by various industries will be subject to an application system, with the application period set from the 23rd to the 25th of each month. After review and approval, a sugar purchase certificate will be issued, and the certificate holder will pay the designated Type B retailer for the goods. It is stipulated that specially allocated sugar is only for self-use and not for resale, and violators will be dealt with according to the law. As for the first phase of household sugar, it will expire on April 30th. Expired cards will be invalid. Cardholders are requested to purchase from designated Type A retailers before the deadline.

In other news, the second phase of sugar distribution based on population began in different areas on the 15th of this month. However, the Public Works Department requires all Type A retail stores involved in this sugar distribution to report their sugar sales. For every hundred sugar purchase certificates, a report form must be filled out, and the purchase certificates must be attached to the form and submitted to the Bureau for verification. The first phase has already been completed, and the same procedure must be followed for this phase. The report forms needed by Type A sugar stores are sold by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative and can be purchased there.

### Reader's Forum Establishing Joint Guarantee Primary Schools

— Yan Kaiwen

Education is the foundation of a nation, especially primary school education, which lays the groundwork for citizens' knowledge and morals. It should be actively promoted to enhance the nation's vitality.

Since the outbreak of the war, our country's education has been at a standstill due to the impact of the war. Since the start of peace and the return of the National Government to the capital, although the government authorities have made every effort to promote it, it has gradually recovered, but it has not yet seen universal development. Just looking at the current situation of primary school education in this city, on the surface, schools are numerous and primary school education is very developed. However, the situation of schools in this city is different from that in other parts of the interior. Most of the primary schools in Shanghai, except for a few public primary schools and those established by a few public organizations, are all privately established. Regular expenses rely on tuition income to maintain. In recent years, the cost of living has risen daily, and the tuition fees of various schools have gradually increased as a result. As far as the author knows, the tuition fees for primary schools in the two concession areas are as high as 150 yuan and as low as 80 yuan. General middle and lower-class families, under this high cost of living pressure, can barely afford three meals a day, let alone have the extra money to provide for their children's education expenses. As a result, the number of school-age children excluded from schools is increasing day by day. If we conduct an accurate survey and statistics, the number of out-of-school children in this city must be very alarming.

Although there is no shortage of enthusiastic people in society who are doing their best to help out-of-school children, such as the establishment of scholarships by Shen Xin and other newspapers and various organizations, and the establishment of free schools, the resources are limited and the number of people is limited. It is impossible to help all the out-of-school children in the city. Judging from the above situation, the seriousness of the current problem of primary school education in Shanghai should also be addressed in the same way as the issue of prices.

The Baojia system is not only a mechanism for preventing undesirable elements and ensuring local security, but also a mechanism for promoting local public welfare undertakings. Since the city implemented the Baojia system, bandits have disappeared and the local area has been peaceful. It is therefore necessary to further promote public welfare undertakings. Education is the priority of public welfare, and the establishment of joint guarantee primary schools in this city is currently an urgent task.

We hope that those enthusiastic about Baojia work in Shanghai will, in the spirit of serving the local area and cultivating talents for the country, realize the establishment of joint guarantee primary schools in the short term. This is what all the citizens are eagerly looking forward to.

Now, based on my humble opinion, I will briefly list a few methods for establishing joint guarantee primary schools below:

(1) Administrative Organization: Organize a joint guarantee education committee, with the joint guarantee chief and the chiefs of each Bao and enthusiastic educators in the area as joint guarantee education committee members, to handle educational administrative matters.

(2) Number of Schools: Investigate the number of out-of-school children in the Bao and determine the number of schools to be established.

(3) Fees: No tuition or miscellaneous fees will be charged, and books will be provided as much as possible.

(4) Sources of Funding:

Start-up Costs: Solicit donations from shops and wealthy residents in the Bao.

Recurring Expenses: Organize Baojia education monthly donations, with different levels of donations set.

Determine the amount of donation for each household, which will be collected monthly by the Jia chief from the residents.

Request the Baojia authorities to provide appropriate subsidies.

(5) In order to save expenses, all staff members, except for teachers and school workers, should volunteer their services.

The above points are only general outlines. As for the detailed methods, they need to be carefully planned by the Baojia gentlemen to make them perfect.

### Japanese Authorities Treat Enemy Nationals in Shanghai with Generosity in Group Living Implementing Assembly Gradually Since the End of January Aiming to Prevent Espionage, Especially the Instigation of the Fifth Column

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese military authorities here have treated the enemy nationals residing in the Shanghai area with great leniency. Initially, their lives were hardly restricted in any way, and they were able to live freely. However, due to the prolongation of the war, the following reasons have been given: (1) To prevent espionage, especially the instigation of the Fifth Column. (2) To stabilize the lives of enemy nationals, it was decided to order enemy nationals residing in the Shanghai area to live collectively. This has been gradually implemented since January 31st of this year, and the organization of collective living has generally been completed recently. Thousands of British, American, Dutch, Belgian, and other enemy nationals residing in the Shanghai area are currently divided into several locations, scattered around Shanghai, enjoying a privileged life with their wives and families in a good environment. The Japanese government bears their living expenses with an extremely fair and generous attitude and provides as much convenience as possible to stabilize their lives. Attention has been paid to the structure of the shelters, the surrounding environment, and the internal facilities. Special care has been taken with the diet, and medical and entertainment facilities have also been made as complete as possible. Communication is also permitted, and books, newspapers, magazines, and wireless radios are available. Residents in the shelters organize various committees themselves to rationalize their lives. There are classrooms for educating children and sports grounds and walking areas for maintaining health. Other equipment such as tennis and volleyball are also complete. They all live in harmony and pass a happy life, and they automatically cultivate vegetables using the open space in the shelter. The Japanese government's generous and fair measures have led to the fact that the enemy nationals are now enjoying complete protection compared to before, and their lives are guaranteed. Those who have been accommodated have expressed their gratitude for the authorities' attitude. The Japanese authorities here specifically issued a statement yesterday (the 21st) regarding the collective living of enemy nationals:

Statement: "The Imperial Japanese authorities in Shanghai, in order to prevent espionage, especially the instigation of the Fifth Column, and to enable enemy nationals to live a stable life, have decided to order enemy nationals residing in the Shanghai area to live collectively. This has been gradually implemented since January 31st and has generally been completed. They and their families are all living happily in a pleasant environment, and their health is very good."

### Mr. Shao Guorui Donates Funeral Gifts to Help Education Generous Donation from the Director of Lianhua

I am now donating the full amount of the funeral gift money, totaling 1,100 yuan in savings certificates, to your newspaper's education fund, in order to benefit everyone. Please accept it."

### Anti-Epidemic Vaccination Certificates Must Not Be Borrowed or Forged Certificates Issued by Private Doctors Must Be Officially Exchanged at the Health Department

The health authorities of the two concession areas have already started full-scale anti-epidemic vaccinations. In addition to designated places and times for free vaccinations for citizens, mobile vaccination teams have also been organized to go to various important roads, schools, and factories for vaccinations for public groups. All citizens who have been vaccinated against epidemics will be given a certificate called "Typhus Prevention Vaccination Certificate," which is valid for four months and states the date of vaccination, age, gender, name, or right thumbprint. The health authorities have now issued an order that anti-epidemic certificates must not be borrowed from others or forged. The vaccinated person must use the anti-epidemic certificate issued by a private doctor to exchange it for a fixed certificate at the health department. If a doctor issues a certificate without actually vaccinating, he will be investigated if discovered.

Verification of Certificates The anti-epidemic vaccination campaign in various districts of this city has been expanded one after another to maintain public health in the summer. The Public Concession Health Department has also expanded publicity, hanging banners with slogans all over the bridges and roads to attract public attention. In the urban area, anti-epidemic certificates have been checked at the iron gates of Nanyang Bridge and other places bordering the French Concession since yesterday (the 21st). Those without certificates are vaccinated on the spot. The anti-epidemic vaccination team organized by the Municipal Health Bureau is responsible for this vaccination work.

Anti-Epidemic Picture Slides The Shanghai Chinese Film Association, in order to assist the authorities in launching the anti-epidemic campaign, specially hung up picture slides of the newly compiled anti-epidemic script "Invisible Little Devils" in the shop windows of major companies and stores in the city yesterday, imparting anti-epidemic knowledge so that citizens understand the importance of anti-epidemic and automatically request anti-epidemic vaccinations.

Anti-Epidemic in West Shanghai The West Shanghai Anti-Epidemic Task Force established an anti-epidemic vaccination team on the 16th of this month and set off to carry out vaccinations in the shantytowns in the district. Starting from the 20th, it launched a full-scale preventive vaccination campaign at eight key points in the district. Citizens in the district who were vaccinated were very enthusiastic, and the statistics to date are more than 40,000 people. Mr. Chen Yeqin, director of the West Shanghai Health Office and the chief captain of the task force, also inspected the eight locations in the district yesterday and encouraged the staff.

### Pickpocketing is Active Pedestrians Should Pay Attention Often Using Young Women to Carry Out Activities in Crowds

Since the launch of the pickpocketing crackdown campaign in the French Concession and the Public Concession, as of the 18th, no less than 130 pickpockets have been arrested.

The Value of Stolen Items is Huge

According to reports from various police stations, the total value of stolen money and items is 232,512.84 yuan, of which 145,843.20 yuan has been recovered. The stolen items, such as fountain pens, hats, clothes, and leather shoes, are all snatched from the hands of pedestrians by pickpockets.

111 Theft Cases Last Week

A total of 111 theft cases occurred last week, and 124 people have been prosecuted according to law. At the same time, it is also learned that pickpockets have not changed their modus operandi of operating on crowded trams, and it is also reported that such people often use young women to lure the other party into crowds, and use unexpected means to commit pickpocketing activities. Therefore, the police in this city are determined to find ways to prevent the occurrence of unfortunate incidents and sincerely hope that residents will promptly report pickpocketing activities.

### Children's Protection Association Adopts Abandoned Children

Recently, prices have soared, people's livelihoods have become extremely difficult, and families with many children are particularly distressed, leading to a prevalence of child abandonment.

At the same time, it sent a letter to the Second Special District Local Court of this city requesting assistance in jointly maintaining this social welfare cause for children. After receiving the letter, the president of the court specially instructed the judges of the court yesterday that if there are any cases of children left for foster care in the future, they should all be sent to the association for adoption in order to protect the children.

### Ambassador Shigemitsu Transferred to Foreign Minister Strengthening the Significance of the Japanese Cabinet Enhancing the Strength of the War Cabinet to Run and Indicate Directions Concretely Realizing the Diplomatic Policy of the Axis Powers The Minister of Information, Hirota, Answered Questions from the Press Corps at a Reception

The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy held a regular meeting with the Chinese press corps in this city at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 21st). Those attending from the embassy included Minister of Information Hirota and Vice Consul Fukuma. More than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended and held a cordial discussion.

Strengthening the Wartime Cabinet First, the press corps asked Minister of Information Hirota about (1) the significance of the Allied strengthening of the wartime cabinet this time, and (2) whether there would be any changes in Japan's future diplomatic policies after Ambassador Shigemitsu took office as Foreign Minister. The replies were as follows: The purpose of Japan's strengthening of the cabinet this time is (1) Since Prime Minister Tojo formed the cabinet in October of the year before last, a year and a half has passed. During this time, the Greater East Asia War broke out. In order to complete the liberation of the Greater East Asian nations, Japan resolutely went to war. In this great era, the government has carefully planned and its responsibilities are heavy, so it is necessary to make partial adjustments to strengthen the wartime cabinet. (2) At the beginning of the formation of the Tojo cabinet, the focus was on the combination of comrades. Now, because the scope is small, it is necessary to enhance the strength of the war cabinet this time and devote efforts to running and indicating directions. This is the meaning of this decision to strengthen the cabinet. Therefore, after Ambassador Shigemitsu is transferred to Foreign Minister, there will be absolutely no changes in Japan's future diplomacy.

Strengthening Axis Relations The press corps then asked Minister of Information Hirota, after Ambassador Shigemitsu took office as Foreign Minister, about (1) diplomacy with East Asian countries, (2) relations with Axis countries, and (3) adapting to the current world situation. The replies were as follows: The Axis alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy is the foundation of Japan's diplomatic policy. In the future, the relationship between the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy will be further strengthened. The Japanese Foreign Ministry originally focused on handling diplomacy with countries outside Greater East Asia and is also responsible for handling diplomacy with Greater East Asian countries. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the situation in Greater East Asia in order to smoothly operate diplomacy. Not only has Mr. Shigemitsu been in China for a long time, but he also has a clear understanding of the situation in China, so we have high expectations for the new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, who is suitable for the job. Furthermore, in terms of Mr. Shigemitsu's experience, before serving as Ambassador to China, he successively served as Ambassador to the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, as well as an official in the Japanese Foreign Ministry. In addition, he also spent a considerable amount of time in Germany and the United States. Therefore, in addition to understanding the situation in East Asia, he also has an accurate understanding of the situation in various European groups. We firmly believe that the new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, based on his rich experience and adhering to Japan's fundamental diplomatic policy, will be able to more concretely realize the diplomatic policy of the Axis powers to adapt to the current world situation.

### Merchants Traveling from Shanghai to Guangzhou Should Pay Attention to Extended Navigation Time in the Pearl River

This move is beneficial to general merchants traveling from Shanghai to Guangzhou.

### Court Judges Should Carefully Execute Civil Cases

In order to effectively rectify the national judiciary, the judicial administration must strictly enforce the execution of civil cases handled by courts at all levels, as they are of great importance to the rights and interests of the parties involved in litigation. The execution judges of each court should be carefully selected and must not be negligent, lest they cause inconvenience.

### Economic Circles: Commentary - "Autonomous Control of Commercial Organizations"

During a tea party held the other day by the former Minister of Food, attended by key representatives of the food industry and all directors and supervisors of the National Commercial Control Association, the Commercial Control Association expressed its hope for "autonomous control of commercial organizations." Therefore, we feel that the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, the ongoing adjustments of trade associations, and even the recent active withdrawal of loans by the banking industry, all demonstrate that the arrow of wartime economic policy is indeed gradually moving towards the path of autonomous control. Undoubtedly, this is a ray of dawn for the Chinese economic world during wartime. What we primarily await is the flourishing and expansion of this ray of dawn, ensuring that there is not even a trace of obstruction obscuring it.

We discussed the issue of economic autonomous control in the economic lecture on March 4th, believing that commercial organizations, while engaging in lofty discussions of autonomous control, should absolutely not take obtaining and maintaining their own common welfare as their premise, but should instead take adapting to the surrounding environment and promoting the common welfare of society as their sole and unique mission. In addition, the two basic conditions for autonomous control are: (1) being able to manage themselves, and (2) being able to self-report. The first is the inherent ability of people's organizations to develop, and the second is the strength of social sanctions to be tested.

Therefore, we believe that if we are not going to talk about autonomous control of commercial organizations, then so be it; otherwise, two strict organizations must be prepared: first, a highly strengthened council, whose responsibility is to standardize and rationalize the prices of goods, and to universalize and equalize the distribution of goods; second, a highly strengthened supervisory committee, whose responsibility is to conduct thorough investigations and open accusations. The candidates for these two committees must undergo the strictest selection; those serving as councilors must have familiarity with commodity conditions and the state of people's livelihoods as their sole condition, and those serving as supervisors must have impartiality, shrewdness, competence, and fearlessness, with nothing to hide, as their sole condition.

Only by practicing autonomous control of commercial organizations in this way can the autonomous control of commercial organizations win the faith of the public.

### Small Dragon Well Tea Production: High Selling Price and Very Little Transport to Shanghai

Hangzhou Dragon Well green tea, as Qingming has passed, tea trees have already sprouted, but the production is small, and the roasting fee is huge, so the cost has increased. After the various firms began to weigh and collect, although tea merchants in this port have sent people to purchase, but due to the expensive price, only a few have been transported to Shanghai.

(Another Dispatch) The consumption of tea buds in this port has not declined. The Xinyi Industry Committee's Xinxing Tea Factory imported more than 70 loads of red tea buds and 50 loads of green tea buds, which were sold by the Xueji, Zheng Daxiang tea firms and the Zhiji Tea Factory. As for tea leaves, only the Detai Tea Firm imported about four loads of red tea, which was sold by the Gongxing Tea Firm.

It is also learned that the candidates for responsible representatives in each district have been selected.

Due to the factory's repair of machinery, the production of coal briquettes in this port's retail stores has decreased, resulting in a demand that exceeds the supply at the stores, and there are rumors of price increases. It is now learned that the Yitaixing Coal Company has started work, and the Guohua has also completed repairs and resumed work on the 21st. In the future, it should be able to supply continuously, and the retail price at the stores may be reduced.

### Translation and Commentary: Hoping for Self-Restraint in the Financial Sector

The National Government's authorities have been loud in their calls for a thorough investigation into speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, but the results have been insignificant. The parties undertaking the investigation seem to have failed to fully understand the complexity and importance of the issue, and have only acted hastily, resulting in a failure to achieve the intended results. This is something they should take responsibility for. However, although there are few cases of illegal acts, their impact is by no means superficial, especially because of the thorough investigation. The whole picture of speculation and hoarding in Shanghai has been clearly revealed, and the actions of financial institutions have also been fully understood. This provides good data for self-restraint in the Chinese financial sector, and its significance is quite significant.

The banking sector has a significant relationship with speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, which is clear to everyone, but it was not as clearly understood as it is now before the investigation. Large and small banks have released credit loans to make hoarding funds, or have set up shell organizations, using funds to engage in business hoarding themselves. These disorderly behaviors have really exceeded our expectations. Disregarding laws and regulations, only knowing how to profit from speculation, regardless of everything, we can't help but be speechless at the track behavior. Banking capital finding a way out in speculative activities is of course because it has lost its normal way out. However, no matter how it loses its normal way out, it should not have the irregular status quo of today. Banking capital should have the standards and limits of banking capital. Getting out of this standard and limit is of course the bank's suicidal behavior, and it exposes the immorality of the principals.

It is heard that the financial sector has expressed self-restraint and self-respect, not only starting to recover improper loans, but also stopping improper loans in the future, and refraining from hoarding and trading activities themselves. This is something to be congratulated on, especially because it is able to be implemented automatically, which is even more worthy of our attention. The funds recovered after investigating hoarding, it is said, have been taken back by the Banking Association and the Money Shop Association, with the total amount of 100 million yuan, and 50 million yuan has been recovered in other areas. Although this amount is small, the method is good and the intention is beautiful, and it is worthy of welcome. If this kind of self-restraint can go a few steps further, and actively recover general speculative funds, then it will be more effective than investigating, punishing, etc. to prevent speculation. We hope that the National Government authorities will pay attention to promoting this self-restraint movement.

However, there is one more thing that must be considered at the same time, which is the measures after these speculative funds are recovered. Everyone believes that due to this recovery measure, the bank's profit margin will be reduced to a certain extent. If there is no good follow-up measure, it is feared that banks will be induced to fall into depravity again. However, now that the National Commercial Control Association has been established, the circulation of materials has been restored, and the revival of sound production enterprises, etc., then everyone must start working quickly from this point of view.

### Name

— Sha Lei

There is a Western proverb that "reputation" is a person's second life, and our country also says that after three generations, people are afraid of having a bad "name," so the importance of "name" can be known.

Because of the importance of "name," people want to "seek" fame and reputation to win a smile. On the one hand, they earn wicked money, and on the other hand, they hang a sign of compassion, using the "name" method to cover up the inferior description, which is the same as hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat, and the same as being despicable, the so-called full of benevolence, righteousness and morality, but with the heart of a poisonous snake and a fierce beast.

"Name" is where reality returns. Work silently, and the results will be obvious. Don't want "name" and "name" will come. If you don't start with the facts themselves, but only want to win a good "name," even if you succeed, it will only be a little "name" like a昙花, and it will disappear in no time.

"Name can be sought, but reality cannot be sought." It is also said: "If you only work hard to seek fame, and do not hesitate to sacrifice everything to pursue fame, then "name" will be a burden on the body." That's true.

Therefore, "for the supreme person, name is acceptable, no name is also acceptable... name, a small thing enough to be a burden to me, I only do what I should do, isn't it happy!"

### Common Knowledge of Vaccination

— Bao Ming

The warm spring has come, and it is also a suitable season to start vaccinating. In order to protect the general health of citizens, the authorities in this city have set up temporary free vaccination sites these days, and hope that everyone can go to vaccinate automatically to prevent the spread of smallpox. In the past, the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon said, "A good doctor does not treat the disease that has already occurred, but treats the disease that has not yet occurred," which is what this means.

Here we briefly describe a general overview of vaccination: it was first exported from India, and at that time it was by means of variolation, that is, selecting a person who has smallpox with a milder illness, peeling off his scab, grinding it into a fine powder, and then blowing this powder into the nose of a healthy person, so that he develops mild smallpox to resist the poison and gain immunity; later, after painstaking research in England, cowpox was invented, which can achieve artificial immunity.

Infants must be vaccinated once within four to eight months after birth, and should not be restricted by the season, because at this time the child has no fear and will not scratch after being vaccinated. If the result is very good after vaccination, it can guarantee that he will not develop smallpox for five or six years. After this period, he should be vaccinated once more. If the results of the vaccination are good, and he can get the method right, after three vaccinations, he can guarantee that he will not develop smallpox in his life. There are also cases where babies are vaccinated ten months after birth, and if they are fully vaccinated, they should be vaccinated in the second stage at the age of six; if they are not fully vaccinated, they should be revaccinated at the same time the following year. If they are still not fully vaccinated, they should be revaccinated the following year. In short, the second stage of vaccination must be completed before the age of ten, and the third stage of vaccination should be administered around the age of twenty. However, there are exceptions. It is always better to vaccinate more. If smallpox is prevalent, regardless of whether it has been vaccinated or not, it must be revaccinated, without being too rigid. As for the time, it can be done in all four seasons, but it is most convenient in the cool seasons of spring and autumn, March and April, and September and October. If smallpox occurs, vaccination should be carried out at any time and any place. The most obvious thing after vaccination is itching, but it cannot be scratched arbitrarily, because there are often small clean objects on the nails, and if you are not careful, it can easily cause suppuration and ulceration, or cause systemic, local ulceration. The air in the room must be circulated, and the light should be slightly dim, or red light can be used, which is most suitable. In our country's customs, when a child is vaccinated, he often wears a red hat on his head and a red cloth on his body, which is what this means. As for the diet, it should be easy to digest and have a flowing, non-irritating consistency.

When a person is infected with a virus, he should develop the disease. If there is a strong resistance in the body, it can of course be avoided. This is what is called immunity; however, immunity is innate and acquired. Innate immunity means that there are immune factors present from birth. Acquired immunity means that it is achieved by artificial treatment after birth or by being immune after suffering from a disease once. Among them, it can be divided into two situations. When the body has no resistance to the virus, or when it has resistance but not enough, you can take the blood of others or animals that contains abundant substances that can resist this disease to supplement it. If the body has no resistance or insufficient resistance, you can introduce attenuated viruses, which have no harm to the vaccinated person, and the body gradually produces resistance to prevent the spread of the disease. Sometimes, after suffering from a certain infectious disease, the body also produces resistance to the disease, so that it will not be reinfected with this disease in the future, which is also called automatic immunity. Vaccination uses the method of automatic immunity. Nine to eleven days after vaccination, immunity can be obtained, which can last for at least several years or even decades, depending on the individual's constitution.

### Talking About "Decisiveness"

— Shu An

A person who is said to have no decisiveness is a person who hesitates. When they encounter an event, they are indecisive, should they do it or not? Should they take it or give it up? They start to hesitate, and as a result, they don't start anything, and they waste a good time on this hesitation, procrastinating until they are old. Their lives pass in hesitation.

People with decisiveness are the exact opposite. They use their decisiveness to judge whether this thing should be done or not, taken or given up, and work in an orderly manner according to the decision, and finally reach the stage of success. In their minds, there is no such thing as hesitation in the world, so they can seize the opportunity and create great careers in a short life, which people without decisiveness can never catch up with. From this point of view, being smart without decisiveness is not as good as being stupid with decisiveness. Therefore, Taishi Gong said: "The hesitation of a fierce tiger is not as good as the sting of a bee; the stagnation of a noble horse is not as good as the steady pace of a stupid horse; the suspicion of Mencius is not as good as the inevitable arrival of an ordinary man. Although there is the wisdom of Shun and Yu, humming without speaking is not as good as the pointing of the blind and deaf..." This shows the advantages and disadvantages of having or not having decisiveness.

However, I have to say that decisiveness is not arbitrary. Decisiveness is based on one's own reason, self-confidence and experience, and is judged after careful consideration, so it is reasonable. It is not arbitrary to act rashly, relying entirely on temporary emotions and arbitrarily judging. In short, we need to have decisiveness, which is an indispensable potential for success. However, we should use it properly and never abuse it arbitrarily and hastily.

### Envy and Enthusiasm

— Hong Ying

"Envy" is similar in meaning to "admiration," and it is the starting point of all success. If a person is attracted and stimulated by something and shows "envy," then he must have become interested in something and further have "attempts" and "hopes."

However, "envy" is only a temporary effect on the psychology. It is like a bubble mirage, which will disappear invisibly when the emotional climax gradually declines. If you keep "envy" for a considerable period of time and let it grow in your heart, new "hopes" will grow with it.

Having "hope" is like seeing light in the darkness, making everything have vitality; the things in the past ideals have the possibility of realization. However, "hope" is just "hope." If you don't work hard to promote the realization of "hope," isn't it the same as fantasy? Therefore, in the middle of the distance between the two, you must use "enthusiasm" to work hard in a down-to-earth manner!

If you do things with "enthusiasm," eight or nine times out of ten you will be able to succeed, and you will also get an unexpected harvest. A worker who can work "enthusiastically" is like a shining lamp in a dry and lonely desert, which will always make you pursue the goal unremittingly; it can enable workers to open up new paths on the road of life struggle adventurously; a "enthusiastic" person is not afraid of failure or difficulties, and his emotions are always enthusiastic.

Therefore, "envy" and "enthusiasm" are also two conditions for success; having "envy" can produce desire, and having "enthusiasm" can turn desire into reality. Improper "envy" often becomes jealousy, which is very dangerous; just "envy" without "enthusiasm" is like fantasy; if you are "enthusiastic" for a while and cannot have "perseverance," it is also very regrettable.

### Life

— Xiao Chuang

Life is a road, a long road. Everyone must walk from the starting point to the end point. However, on this road, everyone has their own way of walking, everyone has their own path. Some people take the shortcut and choose the original road that the predecessors have taken, regardless of the advantages and disadvantages, and still follow it as it is. Some people skillfully find the diameter, the purpose is to find an easier road to walk. But there are also people with far-sighted vision who take all kinds of risks and difficulties. When it is possible to continue walking on this small road, he will open up a road in the thorny mountains and fields. He will drive away the sea when he meets it. He will drive away the wild beasts when he encounters them. He not only does it for himself, but also for others. He awakens a group of people and asks everyone to create a new avenue and recognize the real goal.

This is the right life.

### Before and After Success

— Ji Lu

Some people say, "It is a very difficult thing to create." However, maintaining something that has already been created is equally difficult. In the stage of "success," these two important steps of creation and maintenance are indispensable.

When anything is created, it will inevitably be ridiculed by the world, and even face many obstacles, preventing you from achieving "success" smoothly. After you have gone through all kinds of hardships to achieve victory, you must work hard to avoid the jealousy of others and avoid being poisoned.

In this way, is it too difficult to accomplish something? But it is not as difficult as it is said. As long as we cultivate ourselves to have: perfect character, profound cultivation, and rich experience, then it is not very difficult to accomplish anything.

In the world, there are often many people who think that when something has been "successful," this thing is over, and they no longer pay attention to it very carefully. Unexpectedly, after a long time, it is slowly forgotten. Then, wouldn't the hard work spent by the founder be a pity? It is truly the so-called, "Failure to carry a basket of earth will result in all previous efforts being wasted."

Indeed: "Starting a business is difficult, and the responsibility of those who die later is heavy." This sentence is truly penetrating and clear. If only the founders start a business, and those who die later do not honor the efforts of the martyrs and work hard to expand it; then the business that was created will eventually be ruined. Therefore, those who die later must shoulder the responsibility of maintaining and expanding it.

Founders certainly need decisiveness, self-confidence, perseverance, perseverance... and other elements of "success"; however, maintainers also need them. We must not think that as long as we arbitrarily hide behind people and enjoy the business that people have already created, we can maintain it and have more than enough. We must also have considerable knowledge to be able to apply other people's inventions.

Creation before success cannot achieve "success": but, if you do not continue to work hard after success, then the "success" you get will become "nothing."

### Heaven? Earth? People?

— Xiao Luo

As the saying goes: "Heavenly timing is not as good as geographical advantage, and geographical advantage is not as good as human harmony." This is indeed a very true saying. However, we can add: "Human harmony" is important, but sometimes it is not as effective as "self-improvement."

Just think, does a person who only wants to rely on friends and relatives have any ambition to improve? He must always only want others to help him and get something for nothing. He no longer thinks about how to work hard and how to develop, and create a world of his own.

Just imagine a person who specializes in social interaction and has a wide range of contacts, no matter how eloquent he is, no matter how his friends keep saying, "I will definitely help, I will definitely help..." If he does not become more motivated, his friends will slowly leave him.

Isn't it? There are many people in society who, unfortunately, are eliminated because they "rely on others and do not improve themselves." However, there are still many people who do not wake up, and live like parasites, stealing peace and indulging in pleasure and death.

Wake up! People in the Yellow Millet Dream.

We must work hard to be self-reliant, and other people's strength cannot be relied on.

"Self-improvement!" Let us make this our motto.

### The Resurrected Poor Woman: Gao Ruan Dies Despite Efforts

The case of the poor woman Gao Ruan, who briefly revived in the Nanshi district, drew extraordinary attention from all sides. Supporters offered financial assistance, visitors came to express their concern, and hospital doctors provided treatment. However, due to the severity of her illness, despite the best efforts of both Chinese and Western doctors, she ultimately succumbed and passed away yesterday at 3:05 PM, at the age of 27. She was originally from Shaoxing. Our reporter personally visited her, delivering a慰劳费 (consolation fee) of 800 yuan. A summary of the treatment expenses after her revival is as follows:

(1) Report from the nurse at the Guoyi Pingmin Hospital (National Medicine Public Hospital) at 88 Rue Robert: The patient's illness began in early November of last year with vomiting and diarrhea, worsening around the first month of the lunar new year, with episodes of fainting, including one episode where she remained unconscious for seven hours. On the 16th of this month, she was referred to our hospital for treatment by Mr. Zhuang Yaosheng. Dr. Zhao Yu examined her and deemed her condition critical, noting blurred vision, diarrhea, intermittent confusion, a dry tongue coating, a weak pulse of 140 beats per minute, and a body temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius. It was decided to use a method to strengthen her vital energy and reduce fever. Dr. Jiang Shuzhong (Head of Internal Medicine at Jimin Hospital) was also consulted for a detailed examination, which confirmed the critical state. Dr. Ding Jimin also visited the hospital for a thorough examination and agreed on the severity. They proposed administering saline, glucose, vitamin BC, and cardiac stimulants. Despite several days of both injections and medicine, and the combined efforts of Chinese and Western medicine, her body remained in a critical state due to extreme anemia. Her temperature has now dropped below normal, but her pulse remains around 120 beats per minute, with intermittent confusion. According to doctors, there is a possibility of collapse at any time. (Additional note) Mr. Sun Guyi from the Shendan Pharmaceutical Factory donated various injections and medicines, Dr. Jiang Shuzhong donated cardiac stimulants and medicinal liquids, Mr. Shi Yunfu donated Vitamin B, and Mr. Wen Lantin, chairman of the hospital, donated rice and Taibao Ling (brand of nutritious food).

(2) Dr. Shu Shuyun not only provided free treatment to Gao Ruan but also covered transportation costs and made a donation, demonstrating true empathy. His warmheartedness is evident in his letter: Gao Ruan's limbs warmed, and her mind became clear when first treated by this doctor, and she was able to eat a little. In recent days, her condition became unpredictable under the care of the hospital. Yesterday, her condition deteriorated, and her husband, Gao Weiren, seeing her worsen, reluctantly invited this doctor to the hospital again. After examination, the doctor found the condition even more dangerous than before and reluctantly prescribed medicine. Upon returning home after taking the medicine, she soon passed away. This doctor, unable to stand by idly, is willing to send 100 中儲劵 (Central Reserve Bank notes) earned in peacetime to fulfill his human obligation. (Editor's note: Mr. Pan Shanshi also sent 100 yuan, bringing the total to 200 yuan, which, along with the 610 yuan donated by various parties the previous day, will be handed over to her husband, Mr. Gao Weiren, to arrange the funeral).

### Medical Treatment at Various Hospitals

Yesterday, 100 free medical treatment coupons were entrusted to us for distribution, which we will do promptly. (3) In order to implement the spirit of community service and seek the welfare of patients, Tongde Hospital has established Surgery, Dermatology, Venereal Disease, and Urology treatment departments, overseen by Dr. Zeng Liqun, a medical doctor. Surgery is held daily from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, overseen by Dr. Shen Chengyuan, a medical doctor. Dermatology, Venereal Disease, and Urology are held daily from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM.
