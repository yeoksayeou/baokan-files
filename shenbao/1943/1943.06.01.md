### Respectful Wishes for Mr. Shen Gao's Eightieth Birthday

In these perilous and difficult times, with national affairs in disarray, we are not inclined to write eulogies for any individual. However, today, on the occasion of the eightieth birthday of Mr. Shen Xinqing and Mr. Gao Hanqing, it is necessary to express our respectful congratulations and to particularly draw the attention of the nation to this event. This is because the longevity of these two gentlemen is closely related to the cultural endeavors of our country, and their long lives symbolize the bright future of our nation's cultural undertakings!

Mr. Xinqing's morality and writings do not require promotion by the media, as they have already left a deep impression on the minds of the people. We believe that what is particularly worthy of respect are two major undertakings beyond his personal morality and writings. The first is his tireless efforts in supporting education. Since establishing the Longdou Academy before the Republic, and later presiding over the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association after the revolution, up to advocating for the widespread opening of lectures, he has established a glorious record in the history of China's national enlightenment movement. In particular, since 1917, Mr. Xinqing and Mr. Huang Renzhi, recognizing the special needs of the Republic's construction, advocated for vocational education. Under the motto of "enabling the unemployed to have employment" and "enabling the employed to improve their employment," they founded the "Chinese Vocational Education Society." For more than twenty years, throughout the country, they have cultivated many practical professionals who serve the country and society. The voices of "vocational education" and "versatile hands" have resonated throughout the nation. The ancients said, "A single word can revitalize a nation," and Mr. Xinqing has not only advocated but also practiced tirelessly and taught without fatigue. This spirit will surely be boundless. The second is his efforts to promote the library cause. In 1924, Mr. Xinqing and his friends founded the "Jiazi Society" to collect modern historical materials, which was later expanded into the "Humanities Library." With the assistance of Mr. Ye Hongying, its scale was further expanded, resulting in the nationally renowned "Hongying Library" today. Mr. Xinqing has been in charge of it for twenty years, visiting the library every day, regardless of wind, rain, cold, or heat. Even at the age of eighty, he still supports himself with a cane and dedicates himself to public service, without seeking fame or profit. Others may fear being unable to get rid of it quickly, but Mr. Xinqing alone "knows it cannot be done but does it anyway." This spirit is truly worthy of our younger generation's admiration! And its contribution to public education and China's cultural undertakings cannot be measured by any standard! In his early years, Mr. Xinqing once edited the "Common Sense" section of this newspaper, greatly enhancing the wisdom of young people, which not only enhanced the newspaper's reputation.

Mr. Hanqing is a devout and sincere Christian who, with the dedication and singleness of purpose of a religious person, strives for cultural undertakings. More than thirty years ago, recognizing that the backwardness of China's modern cultural undertakings, especially publishing, was a major cause of national poverty and weakness, he, along with Mr. Zhang Jusheng and the late Mr. Xia Cuifang, founded the Commercial Press, which became one of the largest publishing enterprises in our country. Mr. Hanqing has devoted himself to its management, and although the environment has changed and personnel have experienced vicissitudes, he has remained diligent and loyal to the institution, without ever wavering. This spirit of dedicating one's life to a cause is not for the sake of the institution itself, but actually for the benefit of the entire Chinese publishing industry, which is to provide the people with spiritual food.

Today, we are delighted to celebrate Mr. Xinqing's eightieth birthday, and in ten days (the twentieth of this month), we will also celebrate Mr. Hanqing's eightieth birthday. How should we celebrate these two great figures in the cultural world, and how should we express our respect for these pioneers of Chinese culture? According to reports, as both elders have always advocated against lavish birthday celebrations, friends of Mr. Xinqing have decided to follow his wishes and use the money intended for public toasts and banquets to fund the Hongying Library, "celebrating the person and benefiting the world, leaving a lasting memory." This is truly the most reasonable and pleasing approach for Mr. Xinqing. For Mr. Hanqing, celebrities from all walks of life have also initiated public celebrations, and Mr. Hanqing has generously donated 10,000 yuan for disaster relief in the north, declaring that he will not accept gifts, and that any cash gifts will be donated to disaster relief. This is a way of "fulfilling good wishes together and leaving behind kindness forever," which is also the most timely celebration. In addition to hoping that friends from all walks of life will understand the elders' hearts and jointly express the wish to "celebrate the person and benefit the world," we should learn from the elders' consistent enthusiasm and solemn attitude towards cultural and educational undertakings. We hope that all sectors of society will help to expand the scale of the Hongying Library, making it the most comprehensive and abundant library in East Asia, opening the door of convenience to poor scholars everywhere. We also hope that the vocational education movement that Mr. Xinqing has been devoted to for more than twenty years, with its emphasis on "respecting work and enjoying work," will have a more widespread and in-depth development, cultivating thousands upon thousands of talents for the future construction of the Chinese nation. We also hope that the Commercial Press, which Mr. Hanqing has diligently managed for decades, will quickly resume publishing new books, and continue to provide an inexhaustible source of spiritual food for students and experts across the country. We respectfully offer our congratulations to the two elders, and look forward to countless great figures in the cultural world following in their footsteps!

### Dawn of the Revival of China's Publishing Industry

The torrent of Chinese culture has unfortunately been hindered in the past six or seven years due to the prolonged war. It has stagnated, it has declined! However, this is only a superficial appearance. The Chinese people all understand that the torrent of a nation's culture will never truly come to a sudden halt. It has a latent power. In the heart of every person, to a greater or lesser extent, there is a demand for the cultivation of cultural life. The essence of the cultural torrent has the characteristic of "cutting off water with a knife only makes it flow more." The people's demand for cultural life has the tendency to seek food in hunger. Therefore, the trend of Chinese culture towards revival is an inevitable conclusion.

When discussing a nation's culture, scholars generally analyze it into ten aspects: 1. Literature and History; 2. Politics; 3. Economics; 4. Science; 5. Philosophy; 6. Ethics; 7. Religion; 8. Craftsmanship; 9. Fine Arts; 10. Figures. In terms of cultural content, it is generally no more than this. What we want to further point out here is that these ten analyzed aspects are three-dimensional and active things. Recording these things in writing and passing them on for a long time constitutes books. In other words, national culture is the crystallization of a nation's life, and the undertaking and responsibility of the publishing industry is to absorb this crystallized substance, use paper and ink as materials, and writing as form, to produce books, which are widely distributed and passed on for a long time.

Since the implementation of the New Policies in the late Qing Dynasty, the cultural centers of the country have been Beijing and Shanghai. Beijing is the place where China's inherent cultural relics are preserved and gathered, while Shanghai is the place where new cultures converge and radiate. In other words, Beijing has more cultural relics and talents, while Shanghai is the general hub of the publishing industry. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, under the actual environment of the spreading flames of war, the decline of the publishing industry is an inevitable phenomenon. The urgent need to remedy this phenomenon and prevent its continuation is a common view among insightful people in the country. However, in the past six or seven years, the publishing industry in Shanghai has ultimately been in a state of prolonged decline. The reasons for this are: first, there is an extreme shortage of printing materials, with average prices being more than a hundred times higher than before the war, especially the soaring price of paper; second, prices are soaring and life is difficult. Cultural figures, who are the center of the publishing industry, are either displaced and struggling or struggling to survive, and have no energy to engage in writing. If these two factors continue to exist, even if there are people with enthusiasm and sincerity who want to seek the revival and promotion of the publishing industry, it will be difficult.

Fortunately, a major turning point for the publishing industry has arrived. Many famous publishers in Shanghai have, based on their great aspirations and ideals to serve culture, voluntarily concentrated their manpower and organized the China United Publishing Company to restore and promote the publishing industry. After several months of preparation, it is scheduled to open today. In today's decline of the publishing industry, such a surprising move cannot help but make us feel extremely excited. For many years, we have been distressed by the silence of the publishing industry and the stagnation of all cultural undertakings. We have loudly appealed, hoping that cultural figures will come out and make the greatest struggle for the Chinese cultural world. Now, in Shanghai, the center of the publishing industry, the manpower and material resources of the publishing industry have finally been gathered to form this united organization, and its contribution to culture is so great that it is not necessary for us to praise it any further.

We have high expectations for the China United Publishing Company. For the sake of the revival of China's cultural undertakings, we hope that the company will not be constrained by the position of pursuing profits, but should assume the normal cultural mission from the standpoint of the country, and promote wartime cultural work. We hope that people from all walks of life, especially cultural figures, will encourage and assist the company. We hope that the reading public in society will supervise, recommend, and promote the company's publications.

However, what we are worried about is that the printing materials are so scarce and the prices are so high that the price of books is almost impossible for readers to afford. Since the company is a commercial organization, we certainly cannot expect it to operate at a loss. To fundamentally solve the problem, we cannot but ask the government authorities to severely punish merchants who hoard printing materials, especially paper. Moreover, we hope that we can emulate the policies of friendly countries such as Japan and provide a sufficient allocation of paper for legitimate purposes. This will surely have a great impetus for the future of China's publishing industry and the future of Chinese culture.

Finally, we respectfully wish the China United Publishing Company a boundless future! The Chinese publishing industry a boundless future! And Chinese cultural undertakings a boundless future!

### Lin Sen Dies

Guangzhou, May 31st (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Chongqing, Chairman Lin Sen of Chongqing recently passed away due to a serious illness on May 31st at the age of 82. Lin Sen was born in Minhou County, Fujian Province, in the first year of the Tongzhi reign.

Navy Minister Shimada also visited Yasukuni Shrine at 3:00 p.m. on the same day, making the same report.

Tokyo, May 31st (Central News Agency) The heroic sacrifice of more than 1,000 Japanese defenders on Attu Island has deeply saddened the entire nation of Japan, and their determination to defeat Britain and the United States has been further strengthened. Thousands of students in schools across the country have unanimously petitioned the authorities to volunteer to kill the enemy, and the workers of one factory have also unanimously decided to strive to increase aircraft production. Today, 100 million people in Japan are united in hatred and filled with fighting spirit, determined to do their best in their respective positions to avenge the fallen martyrs by defeating Britain and the United States. For example, 1,200 students of the Colonial Science Department and 200 students of the Agricultural Preparatory Course at Nihon University in Kanagawa Prefecture were undergoing training on the training ground on the evening of the 30th when they suddenly received the sad news of the sacrifice of the Japanese troops on Attu Island. They were deeply angered and immediately petitioned the department head, Mr. Komatsu Yudo, to allow them to volunteer as members of the volunteer army to go to the front line to kill the enemy. Mr. Komatsu was deeply moved and immediately gathered all the students to explain the matter, suspending training. All the students then lined up at 8:00 p.m. and set off without sleeping all night. At 9:00 a.m. on the 31st, they arrived in Tokyo, worshiped remotely in front of the Imperial Palace, and vowed to avenge the fallen martyrs before returning to school in formation. They then convened a meeting of 1,500 representative students from the Law Department in the auditorium, urging them to join the volunteer army and kill the enemy together.

All the workers were deeply saddened and shouted loudly, "We will definitely avenge this! We will do our best to build more aircraft and transport them to the front to help the war!" At 9:00 p.m. that evening, they all prayed silently towards Attu Island, and at 5:00 a.m. on the 31st, they all visited the shrine, determined to defeat Britain and the United States and increase production to avenge the dead.

### Negotiations between the Two Leaders of the French Splinter Faction Commence in North Africa; Churchill Has a Frank Conversation with de Lattre, Revealing Increasingly Blatant Anglo-American Ambitions

Madrid, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to a report from the Havas News Agency, British Prime Minister Churchill met with General Giraud, a leader of the French rebels in North Africa, in Gibraltar on the 28th. Discussions centered on the necessity for Giraud to quickly reconcile with de Gaulle. Simultaneously, reports indicate that Churchill has departed Gibraltar for Algiers, presumably to personally attend the meeting between de Gaulle and Giraud, allowing him to exert pressure on them when necessary. However, the reported news of Churchill's visit to Gibraltar or Algiers has not been confirmed by any official sources.

Cairo, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to Havas News Agency, the details of British Prime Minister Churchill's talks in Gibraltar on the 27th and 28th of this month were learned here last night. According to informed sources, Churchill arrived in Gibraltar by plane from Washington on the evening of the 27th. General Giraud had already arrived in Gibraltar from North Africa earlier. Immediately after their meeting, Churchill and Giraud began negotiations, with senior British officials also participating, to resolve the dispute between Generals Giraud and de Gaulle. Havas News Agency reporters learned from reliable sources that Churchill emphasized to Giraud the need to quickly agree on a plan with the leader of the Free French National Committee in London, General de Gaulle. General Catroux, Allied Commander-in-Chief Eisenhower, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of North Africa General Alexander, and Commander of the British Eighth Army General Montgomery all participated. The issues of future military operations and the division of Anglo-American spheres of influence in North Africa have likely been discussed. Therefore, Churchill's trip to Gibraltar is seen as a direct result of the Roosevelt-Churchill talks.

Lisbon, May 31st, Central News Agency: Upon arriving in Algiers, de Gaulle issued a formal statement declaring that the planned negotiations between de Gaulle and Giraud would commence at 2:00 PM today. Giraud stated that he welcomed de Gaulle's arrival, as he sincerely desired the unity of the two factions for the sake of French interests. De Gaulle's arrival in Algiers was kept quite secret, so the citizens made no response. Besides Giraud, those welcoming de Gaulle at the airport included Catroux and Anglo-American representatives. According to individuals close to Giraud, the future negotiations between de Gaulle and Giraud will be conducted secretly in Algiers.

Lisbon, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to news from Algiers, French General Georges, residing in southern France, has fled to Algiers and joined Giraud's forces. General Georges served as the commander of the French Northwest Army in 1939.

Lisbon, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to reports from Vichy, since the end of the North African campaign, Anglo-American imperialist political activities in North Africa have become increasingly blatant. They are now attempting to divide French North Africa and take it for themselves. The United States seems to intend to seize French Morocco and West Africa as a political and economic foothold for accessing the African continent, while Britain intends to permanently occupy Algeria as a military base for dominating the Mediterranean. The attitudes of de Gaulle and Giraud toward this are worthy of attention.

### No Possibility of a Churchill-Stalin Meeting

Stockholm, Sweden, May 31st, Central News Agency, Havas News Agency: Political circles in London believe that there is no possibility of a meeting between Churchill and Stalin in the near future. The American Broadcasting Company's correspondent in Moscow stated that whether the two will meet depends on the content of Roosevelt's letter to Stalin. Although there are rumors that the letter proposed a meeting between the two, this cannot be confirmed.

### Speculation on the Date of the Invasion of Europe; Landing Expert Appointed as Advisor to American Forces in Europe

Stockholm, Sweden, May 31st, Central News Agency, according to Havas News Agency, neutral country reporters in London report: The general public in London now considers June 22nd of this year as the starting date for the invasion of Europe. This date was originally known only to informed sources, but now everyone is talking about it. It is also the day of the armistice between Sweden and France. The Observer newspaper first published it, and then other newspapers mentioned it. Most British newspapers say that the current air raids are no different from the artillery bombardment before the infantry offensive.

Stockholm, Sweden, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to news from London, Rear Admiral Knowles has been appointed as an expert advisor on joint operations to the staff of the American forces in Europe. He is 49 years old and is a famous landing expert who has been testing landing skills using small boats for twenty years.

### Expect Stalin to Explain the Reasons for Dissolving the Third International

Moscow, May 31st, Central News Agency

Regarding the dissolution of the Communist International, the Soviet newspaper Pravda only stated that it was due to the decision of the Executive Committee of the Communist International. However, the Soviet side avoided explaining the meaning of the dissolution. The Reuters correspondent in Moscow sent a written inquiry to Chairman Stalin asking for the reasons for the dissolution and its impact on international relations. On the 28th, Stalin replied that the dissolution of the Communist International would make it easier for countries to form a common front. The reasons are as follows: (1) The Hitlerites believe that the Soviet Union has the ambition to interfere in the national life of other countries and communize them. The dissolution of the Communist International will shatter this view. (2) Anti-communists in the labor front often say that the communist parties of various countries do not work for the welfare of their own people but are acting under external orders. The dissolution of the Communist International will overturn this view. (3) The dissolution of the Communist International can promote the work of patriots in various countries and "those who are fighting against fascism."

German Commentary, Berlin, May 31st, Central News Agency, the diplomatic correspondent of the German News Agency, Höllen, recently commented on Stalin's reply to the Reuters correspondent in Moscow regarding the reasons for the dissolution of the Third International, as follows: Stalin's dissolution of the Third International is an attempt to make all countries in the world believe that the Soviet Union has abandoned its ambition to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and communize them. Political circles in Berlin believe that Stalin's statement is a new propaganda strategy. He is trying to achieve his goals after disclaiming responsibility for communizing other countries. After the dissolution of the Third International, Stalin had to break his silence to explain the reasons, but his intentions have been seen through by all countries in the world, and his dissolution of the Third International has not achieved the desired effect.

### Stilwell Arrives in England

Lisbon, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to news from London, General Stilwell, the commander of the American forces stationed in Chongqing, has arrived in the United States. It is reported that Stilwell stayed in Washington for a long time this time to discuss how to help Chongqing deal with the advancing Japanese troops.

### French Youth Forced to Work in Germany

### German Aircraft Raid British Mainland, Using Liquid Air Bombs; British and American Aircraft Suffer Heavy Losses Raiding Continental Europe

Stockholm, Sweden, May 31st, Central News Agency: Swedish newspapers recently published news from London stating that it is rumored that the German Air Force has recently used a certain kind of "liquid air bomb" with great power to bomb the military industrial areas of the British mainland. It is said that this kind of bomb has the following special properties: (1) It contains nitrogen-free liquid air. When the bomb explodes, this air comes into contact with the outside air and immediately causes a storm that can destroy everything on the ground within 700 to 800 meters around it. (2) Because this kind of bomb can be accurately dropped from an altitude of 4,000 to 4,500 meters, it is difficult for anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes to attack. The British Air Force has felt a great threat. It is believed that the appearance of this bomb indicates that the Axis air force will launch a major offensive in the European war.

Berlin, May 31st, Central News Agency: The German responsible party announced that a German fast bomber squadron attacked the port of Torquay on the south coast of Britain yesterday. Many bombs hit important targets and anti-aircraft gun positions. Afterwards, four German planes did not return.

Stockholm, Sweden, May 31st, Central News Agency: The British Air Ministry announced that German planes again attacked a coastal city in East Anglia on Sunday night. Ground losses were considerable, with several deaths and many homeless. The name of the city was not announced in the communique.

Stockholm, Sweden, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to a dispatch from London, the British Air Ministry announced on the 31st that the British Air Force lost a total of 135 aircraft during attacks on Germany and German-occupied Europe in the past week.

Berlin, May 31st, Central News Agency: A German news agency said that the US Eighth Bomber Squadron lost a total of 28 four-engine giant bombers and more than 180 pilots when it attacked Brittany on Saturday afternoon. The American aircraft flew at an altitude of 7,000 feet and arrived off the coast of northern France in three batches. However, they were immediately intercepted by a strong German fighter squadron, and the formation dispersed, so they dropped bombs indiscriminately and fled, causing many civilian casualties in the Rennes area.

### Earthquake Disaster in Germany

Tuttington, May 31st, Central News Agency: German news agency reports: The earthquake that occurred in Huttonburg on May 28th was even more severe than the one that occurred on May 2nd. The tremors between Asmes-Teichingen and Törfe-Jeschingen were greater than those in November 1911. The chimneys of houses and factories in both places were destroyed, roofs flew off, many houses caught fire, water and fire pipes were broken, and many people were injured. Many other villages were also affected.

### Japanese Army Air Force Attacks Chittagong, India; Fourteen Enemy Planes Shot Down in Aerial Combat

### Anglo-American Seizure of Interests in North Africa

(Special dispatch from Paris on the 22nd by special correspondent Takada) Since the withdrawal of the Axis forces from Tunis and Bizerte, the situation in North Africa has taken a sharp turn for the worse. The internal situation in French North Africa appears to be extremely complex. When the United States landed in Africa, based on the advice of Murphy, the American Consul General stationed in Vichy at the time, it first devoted all its efforts to appeasing the native population of the African colonies. However, recently there has been a considerable shortage of supplies in Africa, especially cotton products. The natives there are all Muslims and, according to the teachings of the Koran (Islamic scriptures), when a person dies, they must be buried wrapped in cotton cloth. Therefore, the shortage of cotton cloth could lead to the danger of rebellion.

American capitalism pays close attention to these natives. Therefore, from the time they landed in Casablanca and Algiers, they brought in large quantities of these supplies and sold them cheaply. The unwise natives were appeased and had no choice but to welcome the American army.

To prevent any unexpected resistance or sabotage, the American army brought in a lot of steel materials, cement, bricks, tiles, building materials, iron bridges, etc., and had thousands of locomotives. The railway from Casablanca via Algiers to Tunis was originally a single line, but since the American army landed, it has been carrying out double-tracking construction. At the same time, from the moment they landed, they promoted currency manipulation, consciously lowering the market price of the French franc against the British pound from 300 francs to 200 francs, and against the US dollar from 75 francs to 50 francs. Even today, they are still trying to maintain this artificial price stability. The Jews took advantage of the situation and began to speculate. The American Maritime Insurance Company recently lowered the maritime insurance rate for ships heading to Africa. These actions are clearly not just for military necessity. In fact, American capitalists, especially the Morgan banking group, are making huge investments. Poss, the former General Manager of the French Commercial and Industrial Bank, recently obtained a loan from the Morgan banking group and established a Commercial and Industrial Bank in North Africa, serving as its General Manager, engaged in unifying the finances of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. At present, British capitalism is clearly under the United States and has no choice but to follow in its wake. The opposition between de Gaulle and Giraud clearly shows the battle arising from the unequal competition for interests between the United States and Britain in the face of new colonial possessions.

De Gaulle is a puppet representing British interests, and Giraud is a puppet representing American interests. Besides the relationship between their behind-the-scenes manipulators, personal incompatibility is also a reason for their opposition. Before the fall of France, de Gaulle was just an unknown figure. He was a mechanization army theorist who wrote books discussing the need for the mechanization of the army, but the French military department only regarded him as a theorist and did not adopt his suggestions, and his personal qualifications were not enough. Giraud and Weygand were both senior members of the French army and were purely military types. Since de Gaulle fled to England, he has leaned to the left, while the elderly Giraud remains conservative. For this reason, the opposition between the two is manifested in all aspects and can only wait for Anglo-American intervention. One of the things they are currently arguing about is the operational policy of the 300,000-strong army that is being trained in Africa and will be completed by the end of May. The most experienced in this army are the de Gaulle faction, who have fought on the battlefield for a long time, but Giraud wants to use this army as a Praetorian Guard in case of a return to the French mainland, while de Gaulle advocates using it only when Britain and the United States carry out a landing operation at a location other than the French mainland.

The opposition between the two can also be seen in the issue of the whereabouts of Berrouton, the former French Minister of the Interior who fled from Vichy to Africa. Berrouton had served as the Governor of Algeria and Tunisia, had rich experience, and was deeply loved by the natives. Giraud did not want to appoint him as the Minister of the Interior, while de Gaulle strongly opposed it. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, May 24)

### Anglo-American Economic Offensive Against Spain

(Special dispatch from Madrid on the 21st by special correspondent Oshima) The end of the North African campaign and the situation in Europe and the political situation have also caused great fluctuations in Spain.

Britain and the United States are working extremely actively in Spain. First, they expanded their embassies, established propaganda departments, and equipped them with more than 2,000 personnel to carry out organized propaganda, engaging in breaking up pro-Axis figures and spreading discussions. At the same time, they are also using anti-German politicians and soldiers from third countries who are passing through or staying in Spain, with propaganda expenses reaching millions of pesetas. The economic work is even more noteworthy. Taking advantage of Spain's eagerness to recover from the exhaustion of the civil war, they are carrying out various pressure tactics. This year, they have imported tens of thousands of tons of cotton. Besides aviation fuel, Spain is now the number one importer of oil and heavy oil in Europe. When the UK issues navigation certificates for the trade agreement between Spain and Argentina, which includes 2 million tons of wheat and other items such as meat and tobacco, it loosens and tightens the certificates, adding threats, and is extremely cunning. For example, when Chief of State Franco mentioned cooperation with the Axis in a speech, the imported materials would disappear from the outside the next day, and various rumors would follow. Compared to the situation a year ago, when Spain was suffering from a shortage of food, bread, crops, and daily necessities, there has been a significant improvement.

Bread, meat, sugar, wheat, butter, oil, coffee, coal, etc. only have a nominal rationing system, and there are no restrictions on clothing, etc. Since last December, buses have started running again, and the production of fish and eggs is very abundant, and the market prices of fruits, etc. have also fallen.

The war debts owed to Germany and Italy during the civil war have been largely repaid. General observation shows that 60-70% of the scars of the civil war have been healed. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, May 24)

### Navy Soul (6)

— By Ariu Shen Qing of Ueno Mountain

Morning 4:00 AM on a certain month and day. Departed by large motorboat to Narukami Island for regional investigation. If we encounter the fishing season for Dog Salmon and Red-Eyed Salmon, we also want to catch a lot of fish. Sergeant, investigators, fishermen, plus me, a total of twenty-five or six people. Especially good weather. Investigating near Kunikawa is the next step toward Beijia Bay. The coxswain shouted loudly, "Submarine!" Everyone knew that it was a sign of enemy ships coming to attack, but the soldiers were preparing for battle. All we have are rifles, and it's a very small boat. The surface speed of the enemy submarine is fifteen or sixteen knots. The distance between us is about 3,000 meters, but it suddenly appeared in the black waves. Everyone felt that they were about to be buried in the depths of the Aleutian Sea. "It's a big enemy! So happy! Charge up! I haven't seen the enemy for a long time!" This was the soldier's voice. Suddenly, two planes flew in the sky at that time. Our reconnaissance plane suddenly dived, wanting to engage you slaves in aerial combat. The submarine did not enter the water by mistake; it turned out to be Japanese. What a joke, it turned out to be our own people. The soldiers were relieved. At that time, my mind was thinking that I had picked up a life. (One page of diary) (Tao translated from the Asahi Shimbun)

### Chinese Suspects in Zhang Jinhai Case Not Prosecuted by French Authorities

In the tragic death of Zhang Jinhai, the principal culprit, French patrol officer Mireille, is being tried by the French Consulate's court according to French law, and a fair legal resolution is expected. However, the Chinese suspects Guo Shiyuan and others who assisted in the beating and incited the crime, after being transferred to the Second Special District District Court, have not been prosecuted by the French authorities, resulting in repeated delays. It is rumored that the French Police Department will not prosecute the three suspects Guo Shiyuan, Li Xiuying, and Feng Quansheng. A Central News Agency reporter inquired about this matter with the Second Special District District Court yesterday, and the court stated that as of yesterday, the official French prosecution had not yet been received, so it is difficult to determine whether Guo and others are on the list of those to be prosecuted. However, it was found that the court's prosecution had opened a hearing in the case and believed that Guo and others were indeed suspected of committing a crime. Yesterday morning, Chen Bingjun, President of the Second Special Court, and Shen Wenjie, Chief Justice, jointly paid a visit to Luo Junqiang, Minister of Judicial Administration, to seek instructions, and whether the hearing can proceed on the 4th remains to be seen.

### Air Raid Drill to Be Held Again in French Concession Starting Today; Special Attention to Be Paid to Light Control

One side of each fan has been contributed by contemporary masters such as Tang Dingzhi, Xia Jiancheng, and Bai Jiao, with paintings of pine, plum, orchid, and bamboo, making them quite valuable. All proceeds from the sale will be used to fund the Hongying Library. The exhibition will only last for one day, and a unprecedented event is expected.

### Quick Look at the Calligraphy of Mr. Shen Xinqing, Celebrating His Eightieth Birthday

— Retiree

Mr. Shen Xinqing of Wuxian, a respected senior figure in the education community, has had his moral character, literary achievements, and life stories extensively reported in various newspapers, so I don't need to repeat them. This time, for his 80th birthday celebration, leaders from various sectors, because Mr. Shen has dedicated his heart and soul to maintaining the Hongying Library for nearly 20 years, are taking Mr. Shen's aspiration as their own, using the birthday celebration to fund the Hongying Library, initiating a public celebration, benefiting society and future generations, which can be said to be an immortal grand event. At the same time, at the suggestion of the organizing committee, Mr. Shen was asked to write 100 couplets and, exceptionally, 20 folding fans, which will be publicly exhibited on June 1st at the Pudong Native Place Association, and Mr. Shen agreed. The day before yesterday, I drove to the Hongying Library to visit the Shen Xinqing Birthday Celebration Committee and the financier, and was told that the寿辰 had all come to an end and had been released with each other, and finally 　　　　　　　　怏. Now I will record my impressions and inform the general readers who admire Mr. Shen and want to obtain his calligraphy as a souvenir.

(1) Couplets: There are a total of one hundred and two pairs. Five and seven characters are the most common. The styles include seal script, clerical script, regular script, and cursive script, with regular script being the most common, and seal script and cursive script being less common. Most of the couplet phrases are collected from Li She's poems, and the Longmen couplets collected from Song lyrics were written by Mr. Shen at the age of 79 and are very neat. Mr. Shen's calligraphy is derived from 入王, and has a unique style. The regular script, such as No. 21, "剖心输丹云胸肊达时地气思经纶," No. 20, "惠施不肯千万乘, 范子何曾杀五湖," and No. 71, "心事有谁能会得, 流光容易把人抛," are especially liked by the author. The large cursive script, such as No. 32, "化于天地外, 寄情在山水间," No. 74, "无事于此静坐, 有情可以长生," No. 73, "美人胡爲　秋水, 先生有道出　　," and No. 75, "白云过相　, 靑天若可捫," has a grand and swirling momentum and is very majestic. The clerical script, such as No. 62, "往事知何处, 此乐与　同," and No. 58, "人生爲逆旅, 问事不关心," reveals the natural interest of brush and ink in its simple and ancient charm. The seal script, such as No. 70, "曾经沧海难爲水, 落尽闲花不见人," No. 69, "秋爱冷吟春爱醉, 水爲心地玉爲　," No. 66, "独圣淸天下, 岳立冠人曹," No. 77, "挥手折若木, 飞剑决浮云," and No. 78, "她非黄石老, 煎作济南生," is either neat or unrestrained, and is above Zhang Taiyan.

(2) Folding Fans: There are only twenty pages in total. Seal and clerical script account for four or five pages, regular script is the most common, and there is only one page of cursive script, which is a back-copied Seventeen Posts, full of spirit, with neat lines and no sloppiness in any stroke. One buy of the small regular script is actually double-lined, from beginning to end, with every word being divine. It is quite rare for an 80-year-old man to do this, and Mr. Shen has never written fans in his life, so this is undoubtedly a difficult thing to ask. There is no shortage of people with a fondness for collecting pairs, but there will be no fan paintings by the elderly Shen Ruoying, and now is a precious, memorable, and unique opportunity. One side of the fan page was also obtained by the 公视沈寿 of the 备委员会 requesting the paintings of famous artists such as Tang Dingzhi, Xia Jiancheng, and Bai Jiao, which is even more beautiful. Mr. Tang and Mr. Xia are famous for their landscapes, and their flowers are extraordinary. Mr. Bai Jiao paints in the style of the Cao family, and has always been known as a master of writing, and most of the 20 fan pages are also written.

It is said that the proceeds from the public exhibition of Mr. Shen's calligraphy will also be used to fund the Hongying Library. As for the pricing, each couplet with frames in regular script is 200 dollars, without frames 100 dollars, cursive without frames 200 dollars, with frames 300 dollars, seal and clerical without frames 300 dollars, with frames 400 dollars. Each page of the folding fan ranges from 500 to 1,500 dollars.

### Economic Circle: Commentary: Dragon Boat Festival and Credit Crunch

Recently, the industrial and commercial sectors of this city have felt a credit crunch, insufficient funds, and sluggish turnover. Some say that this is a normal phenomenon that occurs every year before the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar and is not surprising. However, in this extraordinary period, the usual financial seasonal 脱素 does not seem to apply.

Others say that the successive harvesting of silkworms, lotus roots, wheat, broad beans, rapeseed, and other crops in the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang requires a large amount of cash for various factories to send people to the countryside to purchase them, which is another reason for the credit crunch. However, this explanation only applies to normal times, not to this extraordinary period, because this year's purchase of spring crops is not much different from last year's.

The real reason for the current credit crunch is probably the change in the loan policy of the national banks. It is said that the Central Reserve Bank, in order to assist the National Government in stabilizing prices and ensuring the livelihood of the people, has recently been actively withdrawing loans from the interbank market. As a result, various同案banks and firms have also had to actively withdraw loans or overdrafts from customers who hoard goods, or reduce the amount or shorten the term of their overdrafts. Customers who hoard goods have had to sell their goods for cash due to credit relations, so the wholesale prices of various goods have shown a downward trend recently. As wholesale prices continue to fall, retail prices also tend to fall accordingly.

From this, it can be seen that the central bank's prudent and tight loan policy is indeed an effective means for curbing hoarding, stabilizing prices, and ensuring the livelihood of the people. It is hoped that the bank authorities can persevere and not be moved by seemingly plausible rumors, so as not to change their current prudent loan policy.

### The Six Major Businesses Outside the Blockade Line to Be Registered by District Offices

The Municipal Food Bureau, in order to adapt to wartime food policies and stabilize the people's food supply, was ordered to handle the registration of six major types of businesses: miscellaneous grains, sugar, flour, livestock eggs, and edible oil. The deadline has now passed. The seven districts outside the blockade line – Jiading, Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, Chongming, Baoshan, and Beiqiao – have been instructed to have their respective district offices handle the registration matters on their behalf, to avoid merchants having to travel back and forth. Therefore, all six major types of businesses within these districts should quickly apply for registration with their respective district offices.

### After the Establishment of the Joint Cooperative, the Original Rice Guild Ceases Activities

In order to adapt to the wartime system, stabilize the people's food supply, fulfill military needs, and prevent speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and profiteering, the Ministry of Food, based on the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice and Grain Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui," formulated the "Organizational Charter for Municipal and County Rice and Grain Joint Cooperatives" and supervised rice merchants in various locations to organize accordingly. Recently, the Ministry of Food issued a notice to the Rice and Grain Procurement and Sales Office of the Su, Song, Chang, and Jia districts, stating that the rice and grain joint cooperatives in all counties under its jurisdiction have been formally established in succession. Other districts will also begin preparations to ensure that rice and grain buying, selling, transportation, and sales in all locations are brought into order, and that there is no shortage of food for the people or military supplies. In areas where municipal or county rice and grain joint cooperatives have been established, the original rice industry guilds in cities, counties, townships, and towns, as well as all organizations similar to rice industry guilds, should be automatically dissolved and cease all activities. Matters concerning the public welfare of rice merchants will be temporarily handled by the rice and grain joint cooperatives in accordance with Article 16 of the "Organizational Charter for Municipal and County Rice and Grain Joint Cooperatives." After receiving the order, the special office has notified all county rice and grain joint cooperatives to comply.

Furthermore, the Shanghai Rice Merchants Joint Cooperative will hold its inaugural meeting tomorrow at the Pudong Building on Avenue Edward VII.

### Unified Purchase and Allocation of Eggs to Be Implemented Starting Today

(2) All fresh chicken and duck eggs stored by various firms in the city as of the night of May 31st, whether stored in the firms' premises or in warehouses with cold storage, must be registered starting June 1st.

### Friendship

— Bu Jian

A person who doesn't understand friendship is not only seen as a cold, aloof, and unpopular person by others, but also feels trapped in a "cold palace."

A person with rich friendship can not only taste the sweetness of life, feel as comfortable as eating candied fruit and swimming in a spring sea, but also promote the excitement of work and the success of their career.

The formation of friendship is relatively easy. Familiarity can be established through an encounter, a chat, or a banquet. But everyone knows that it is not easy to achieve deep, intimate, and lasting friendship, and being able to do so is true happiness.

Many friendships are built on monetary interests. Once there is a slight disturbance in interests, they will "turn against each other" and tend to break down.

Some friendships are superficial. When they meet, they flatter each other—thinking that such humility and politeness are the smartest way to maintain friendship. In fact, when faced with difficulties and obstacles, they cannot actively help and sincerely encourage each other.

True friendship must not be based on selfishness but on a common cause. Only such friendship can withstand adversity, setbacks, and maintain permanence, promote work, and complete careers.

### Mr. Shen Xin's Eightieth Birthday

— Zhang Yipeng

Brilliant south pole shines on the southern sky, a pillar of literature in the central plains stands firm.

Early attainment in Confucian studies, the attainment of virtue, once aboard a boat with examination success;

Talented students leaping like dragons from the public door, blessed land, even dogs are immortal,

Eight generations reviving decline, leaving an old elder, may your long life reach a hundred years.

Repeating the Previous Rhyme

Leaving a corner of the southern sky, cultivated in obscurity, his heart is firm,

Once presented plans to stabilize the nation, now only enjoying old age with painting boats.

Respected as a village wine elder among his peers, now seen as a roaming immortal in his old age,

Raising a cup, I dare not follow the customs, donating gold to Buddha, ashamed of my meager strength.

China Confucian Society

### Ode to President Shen Xinqing on His Eightieth Birthday

— China Confucian Society

Profit-seeking thrives, moving further away from the past, as the examination system arises, scholars lack practice, empty words are adorned, habits become increasingly superficial, disasters are brought about, when will they return? Lofty is Mr. Shen, with great prestige, the old learning perfects himself, the new learning perfects others. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, seeking customs from the east, starting with horse bones, hearing the rooster first; his plan is for students, the beginning of elementary learning, form, meaning, and sound, both refined and familiar; consulting scriptures and history, awakening the sleeping, writing articles, returning to simplicity, occasionally speaking of poems, tasting sweeter than meat. Serving as a staff member once, in charge of civil affairs, government and industry, assisting and supporting; planning education, hand-drafting grand rules, presiding over association affairs, worthy of the name at the time, retiring after success, not diminishing his efforts. Establishing Humanities Pavilion, laying the foundation for outstanding talents, day by day, month by month, until now, the function of books, almost like insight, selecting only the refined, collecting without being bored, Confucianism is the foremost, Confucius is the wooden bell, Buddhism, Taoism, and Christianity are the same, all streams flow to the same ravine, analyzing can be five, the sea is the same spoonful. Mencius said, when scriptures are rectified, the people flourish. All of your achievements are a model for the world, throwing the old wood to seek office, the East Sea awaits clarity, we respect simplicity, and truly serve as the chief ally, may your life be boundless, a thousand years is just beginning.

### Strange Stories of the Japanese Navy (6)

— Oshita Udarou

(8) Fast Walking

Stations are often crowded, so there is propaganda calling on people to walk at a normal pace and not get confused. That is because the average person does not have the "five minutes before" cultivation in the navy, (Five minutes before is a traditional spirit in the Japanese navy, meaning to prepare everything within five minutes), and when they arrive at the station, everyone rushes forward, pushing aside the old, weak, sick, and disabled to get ahead. In order to restrain such unruly people, promotional methods are used to call on everyone to maintain order. A certain lieutenant on the destroyer 〇〇〇 had not been ashore for a long time. One time when he went ashore and arrived at the station, he saw that completely unfamiliar state and showed a very strange expression.

On board the ship, everyone walks briskly up and down the ladder. Nimble as squirrels, they walk up and down quickly. Because this has become a habit, when they come to the station, they hesitate at the ladder. The loudspeaker is shouting: "Please walk at a normal pace!" The lieutenant looked around. There wasn't much of a crowd in the station. It wouldn't hurt to walk faster! But if he walked fast, he would be noticed by the station staff! He thought that a soldier doing this would be too undignified. So he could only grit his teeth and slowly walk down the ladder.

After being on a ship for a long time, one develops all sorts of habits, but the navy seems to have a particularly deep connection with fast walking.

In military schools, there is a relay race to Mount Misen on Miyajima Island, which is a famous, very hard, and intense fast walk. Not only that, but people who want to enter this school must first know that even on ordinary days, students in the school always walk briskly. The posture of walking must also be very correct. Neatly bracing their hands on their waists, they walk far and wide. This is indeed the most emphasized thing in a part of the school time.

Students have no free time in a day. After this class, they go to that class, moving from this classroom to that classroom, arranged without a moment to spare.

Speaking of the circumstances of the imperial family entering school, the life of the imperial family in school is also subject to strict training like other students, hurrying back and forth according to a busy schedule. When I was a student, I was with Prince Toshihiko Kuni. As soon as the Prince entered the main gate of the student hall, he immediately went to the self-study room on the left and self-studied with his classmates for a week. After the self-study, if it was his turn to be on duty, he would write on the blackboard with chalk, "October 8th, water, west and north 4 meters, left and right, clear." After writing, he would quickly walk up the ladder with the sound of boots, and go to the dormitory upstairs to rest.

The students have less than fifteen minutes from the morning bugle call to the time of lining up in the drill field. First-year students undergo rigorous training, and soon it becomes a habit. If they arrive at the drill field before the formation time, they will use the extremely short time before the formation, even five or ten seconds, to practice commands loudly, "Rest... Attention..."

On Sundays, everyone goes to the club to row, and the students have very little time to even chat. They all have a leisurely expression. Entrusting their lives to something great, that attitude of peace of mind, clearly floats on their actions. Outsiders see this and say that naval education is a mystery. But the existence of this school is not only the good fortune of the students but also the greatest good fortune of Japan. (Wing: Translated from Asahi Shimbun).

### Going to War (4)

— Naval Reporting Team Member, Hamaoto Hiroshi

"The ship is really good!" Reserve Lieutenant Edo said in his mouth, but in his heart, he thought, don't be surprised, how should I serve on this ship.

This place is not as stable as the mainland in the evening, as soon as the sun sets, you can't see the road immediately. Reserve Second Lieutenant Matsumae shone a flashlight on the road and told Edo:

"The people on the artillery platform just now, they like to call themselves a family in the clear sky. Living in the wilderness, of course, can only look at the clear sky from afar. Living here, you unknowingly become a humorist, and at the same time, you like this attitude, so everyone likes to say whatever they want. Maybe this is often cheering themselves up in life. But in terms of action, they are all good warriors. Hey! Pay attention! There's wire netting in that place."

On the other side of the dark square, there was a faintly lit barrack, and from there came the loud chorus of majestic military songs.

Second Lieutenant Matsumae explained, "The soldiers are adjusting their energy. That's the barrack of the aviation corps."

The surroundings were very dark, and in the shadows, I always felt like something was hiding.

"How do you feel when you stand in the line of fire for the first time?" Lieutenant Edo didn't know where the question came from, and asked this.

Second Lieutenant Matsumae didn't intend to think about anything and smiled lightly, "I was hungry and my throat was itchy."

"But I envy serving on a warship, you can encounter the enemy without walking, and the food and water are always around," Matsumae said again about his experience. Talking, unknowingly, they had already arrived in front of Lieutenant Edo's dormitory, and Edo persuaded, "Don't you want to come in and sit for a while?"

"See you tomorrow! Because I have to be on duty at twelve o'clock, I need to sleep a little," Second Lieutenant Matsumae said goodbye like this.

Edo returned to the room, took off his uniform, and took out his yukata from his bag.

At this time, a voice came from another bed, saying, "Are you Reserve Lieutenant Edo?"

He thought to himself that this must be a guest who came while he was running out, so he simply replied, "Yes."

The guest came out from the mosquito net, dragging the rattan cane forward, while introducing himself, saying that he was a supply lieutenant going to the front aviation corps, a young officer who looked like he was wearing a student uniform, but his voice was very loud.

"Someone from the headquarters just sent someone to say that the warship you will be serving on has already entered the port at night, so tomorrow at seven o'clock in the morning, you have to go to the warship," he told him like this.

Edo thanked him and asked, "When are you leaving?"

"I'm also leaving tomorrow morning, I heard there's a plane tomorrow."

The supply lieutenant lit a cigarette and said:

"This dormitory, to be precise, is Dormitory No. 3. It is said that people generally call it Ichiyado-sō. There are many people like us who stay for one night. It's just like a hotel in society, but it has a different feeling of the battlefield. Anyway, the term Ichiyado-sō is very correct. Even in the moment of life and death, humans always can't forget to joke around. So maybe they rush into the line of fire without caring," he seemed to happily look around the room that had no decorations at all.

The next morning, the "Kurogane" commander who greeted Edo at the door was completely unlike the person he had heard about and imagined.

He was very burly, but his body was as white as if he had grown up in a snowy country. White, without a beard, with clear eyebrows and beautiful eyes, I felt a sense of refreshingness. His clothes were also very elegant, and his feet wearing long socks and white shoes were slenderly stretched out. When Edo performed the arrival ceremony, the commander bowed politely.

"The journey was so long, it must have been hard—come over here and cool off!" Saying that, he led Edo to the canvas chair on the front deck.

Then the commander began to explain.

The boat had just entered the port the night before and had received orders to depart tomorrow. Although it was only a one-day stopover, all the crew members were busy replenishing ammunition, fuel, food, fresh water, etc. Not being able to wash their sweaty clothes during the landing was a big regret for the soldiers, but this is war, so it can't be helped. Words caring for the soldiers also overflowed his words.

But the other soldiers also never slacked off. Some were brushing the deck, some were washing equipment, and some were hammering nails on the damaged chairs. The soldiers looked energetic and busy working. But when they passed by the commander and the newly appointed artillery officer who were discussing work, they respectfully saluted. You couldn't feel the "Kurogane Family" feeling that others said, but just felt solemn.

"Call the senior lieutenant!" The commander said to the orderly like this.

The summoned lieutenant saluted the commander respectfully first, "What's the matter?" He didn't look like a heroic warrior with the third degree of kendo.

Two eyes are beautiful like those of a maiden officer.

"Is the bed in the room empty?"

The commander wanted to place the new artillery officer in that room.

"The artillery officer's luggage has already been moved over. The anti-heat uniform has also been prepared." This is what the senior lieutenant said to Edo.

"Thank you—"

The commander rewarded his subordinate with these words, stood up, and said:

"I'll take you to see the inside of the boat!"

The narrow bridge was also cleaned up very cleanly.

"How do you think this is? This is my new design."

The commander said this while walking up to the platform and opening part of the cover above. Only that part was locked with hinges, and suddenly opening it, you could see the blue sky.

"When enemy planes come, you look out from here. I tried to take the canopy down as much as possible, but it can't be done like that." He slightly expressed his heroism, and then pointed to the small room behind the chart room and said, "This is my villa."

Peeking in, on the narrow wall were posted charts of enemy aircraft types. Next to it was a very strange photo of a person in a frame. It was a faded old photo. It was a handsome man wearing a white old-style Japanese dress and sporting an ancient square beard.

"Commander. This is Elder Kiyomizu Kakurō, right!" Edo asked like this.

"You know that, ha-ha! Haha!" The commander said this and burst out laughing. (Write: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)

### Symposium on Elderly Welfare (1)

— Initiated by this newspaper's social service department

This service department, respecting the spirit of honoring the elderly, invited well-known individuals who have always been enthusiastic about the welfare of the elderly, as well as practical workers from elderly care organizations, to hold a symposium on elderly welfare at Jue Lin Vegetarian Restaurant the day before yesterday. More than 30 people participated, including Gao Fengchi, Zhang Yipeng, Ding Fubao, Sun Houzai, Feng Yangshan, Zhao Ximing, Sun Choucheng, Zhu Juefo, Zeng Gongye, Wu Zai, Zhong Shoushen, and Xu Zhuodai. First, Chairman Huang Jingwan reported the significance of the meeting, briefly stating:

Honoring the elderly is an inherent virtue in our country, but society rarely pays attention to the impoverished and helpless elderly. This newspaper's social service department intends to launch a 100,000 yuan old-age assistance fund-raising campaign. Donations from all walks of life will be used to help the hidden poor and helpless elderly and distributed to elderly care organizations to solve the problem of old-age care. Regarding elderly associations, similar organizations have existed in the past, but most of them gather celebrities and hold periodic banquets without any practical achievements. It is hoped that future elderly associations should seek welfare for the entire elderly community. Then, each person present spoke:

(1) Old man Ximing reported on the living conditions of the elderly in charitable organizations, saying: There are only five to six hundred elderly people in charitable organizations and religious organizations in Shanghai that accommodate poor elderly people. Among them, the old-age homes and Xin Puyu Tang run by the Catholic Church are the most well-run. The number of elderly people accommodated accounts for almost half of the total number of poor elderly people in Shanghai. It is hoped that in the future: (1) The old-age care institutions run by the Haiyu Charitable Organization, namely the Baoan Old-Age Home, the Disabled Factory Old-Age Care, and its branch halls, and the five disabled old-age homes of the Cilian Relief Association's Old-Age Department, can be unified, divided into male, female, and disabled sections, and cared for and educated separately. (2) The five institutions run by Christianity, namely Jiangwan Rende House, Nanxiang Old-Age Home, Beiqiao Cihui Group, Baptist Old-Age Hall, and Yushi Old-Age Center, can be combined into one and actively expanded, and the Salvation Army, known for its spirit of service, can be hired to manage it, so that it can be on par with the Catholic Church's poverty and old-age welfare undertakings. (3) It is hoped that the two poverty and old-age care institutions under the Catholic Church can be merged, also divided into male, female, and disabled sections, and taught light production skills every day to eradicate their laziness and make full use of their talents. The elderly can also produce for society.

### Trainees Save Money to Help Refugees in North China

(Letter) Recently, from hearing and reading newspapers, I have been impressed by the appeals of enthusiastic people for the disaster victims in North China and the quick relief efforts of those who bravely do what is right. I feel ashamed, because we are trainees. We lack strength and have no savings. It can be said that our hearts are willing, but our strength is insufficient. The other day, I was tied up in Qunxing and wanted to go to the Great Light Theater to watch a show, but unexpectedly it was sold out. I wanted to rush to another theater to make up for it. At that time, I remembered the disaster in North China and couldn't bear to enjoy myself idly. Now I offer the collected 30 yuan to be collected on our behalf. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is of no help, but it only expresses our sincerity to the utmost. Sincerely, Trainee Long Yaohuai.
